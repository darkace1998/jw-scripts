Our theme this month is “Feed Your Hope.”

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:08.279 line:10% position:50% align:center
Hope is essential for peace,

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.282 line:10% position:50% align:center
happiness, courage, and life.

00:00:11.282 --> 00:00:13.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is hope?

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Bible uses the word “hope,”

00:00:15.411 --> 00:00:19.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s referring not only
to the desire for something good

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:23.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to the basis
for believing it will happen.

00:00:23.961 --> 00:00:28.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
So hope is more than just wishful thinking
or even expectation.

00:00:28.132 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s based on fact.

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:33.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s evidence to back it up.

00:00:33.012 --> 00:00:36.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, true hope
can come only from the One

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:40.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has the power to fulfill
whatever he promises—Jehovah God.

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provides hope in abundance.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:48.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what Romans 15:13 says about Jehovah:

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:52.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives hope

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fill you with all joy and peace

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:58.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by your trusting in him,

00:00:58.203 --> 00:01:00.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may abound in hope

00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:02.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
with power of holy spirit.”

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah gives us what we need

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:09.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “abound in hope.”

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, the apostle Paul also wrote,

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Colossians 1:23,

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:18.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a Christian could be
“shifted away from the hope.”

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:20.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we must never take our hope for granted.

00:01:20.351 --> 00:01:22.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to feed it.

00:01:22.686 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you need to feed hope?

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:29.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two things are mentioned at Romans 15:4:

00:01:29.902 --> 00:01:33.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all the things that were written beforehand

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:36.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were written for our instruction,

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that through our endurance

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:43.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and through the comfort from the Scriptures

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:46.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might have hope.”

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
So did you notice what feeds hope?

00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:52.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our endurance”

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “the comfort from the Scriptures.”

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:58.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures
—what we take into our minds

00:01:58.097 --> 00:02:01.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
is vital to keeping our hope strong.

00:02:01.183 --> 00:02:05.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, recall what happened
shortly after Jesus was executed,

00:02:05.187 --> 00:02:07.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded in Luke chapter 24.

00:02:07.564 --> 00:02:09.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is part of the conversation

00:02:09.566 --> 00:02:13.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
between an unidentified traveler
and the disheartened disciples.

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:17.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples were beside themselves
with grief over Jesus’ death.

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:21.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
The traveler, though,
was in fact the resurrected Jesus.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples didn’t yet realize this.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they said, as recorded at Luke 24:21:

00:02:28.043 --> 00:02:31.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But we were hoping that this man was the one

00:02:31.714 --> 00:02:33.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who was going to deliver Israel.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:36.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, and besides all these things,

00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:39.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is the third day since these things occurred.”

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
This scripture shows just how susceptible
we can be to discouragement

00:02:45.185 --> 00:02:48.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
when things don’t turn out as we expect.

00:02:48.772 --> 00:02:52.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what Jesus did to help them

00:02:52.026 --> 00:02:55.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 25-27:

00:02:55.404 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he said to them:
‘O senseless ones

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and slow of heart to believe all the things
the prophets have spoken!

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:06.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Was it not necessary
for the Christ to suffer these things

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:08.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to enter into his glory?’

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:11.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And starting with Moses

00:03:11.628 --> 00:03:13.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all the Prophets,

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he interpreted to them things

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:20.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.”

00:03:20.554 --> 00:03:24.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Jesus feed their hope?

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:27.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, by showing them that they were right

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:30.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hope in the fulfillment of the Scriptures

00:03:30.105 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then by teaching them
how those Scriptures had been fulfilled.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we do the same today?

00:03:37.738 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:41.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re facing challenges
that threaten our hope,

00:03:41.825 --> 00:03:45.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should ask Jehovah for guidance
by means of his holy spirit,

00:03:45.162 --> 00:03:48.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then, with the help of the publications
of “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should meditate carefully
on how the Scriptures are being fulfilled.

00:03:54.254 --> 00:03:57.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be difficult to find time for this
in these hectic days.

00:03:57.841 --> 00:04:02.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many claims on our attention
—so many things to know and do.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what you take into your mind

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:10.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
is vital to keeping your hope alive.

00:04:11.313 --> 00:04:14.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
The humanitarian crises facing mankind today

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:17.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
could make any one of us feel anxious.

00:04:17.402 --> 00:04:21.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Experts in fields of technology,
finance, and government

00:04:21.156 --> 00:04:23.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
have found it necessary to coin new words

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:26.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
to convey the gravity of the situation.

00:04:26.787 --> 00:04:28.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2023,

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:33.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
the word “polycrisis” began to soar in usage.

00:04:33.752 --> 00:04:35.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
A polycrisis refers

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:40.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
to many global threats
happening at the same time

00:04:40.008 --> 00:04:42.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the overlapping of health emergencies,

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
climate change, wars, forced migrations,

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:48.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters, and economic collapse

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:51.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
all happening simultaneously.

00:04:51.603 --> 00:04:53.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
A polycrisis

00:04:53.605 --> 00:04:57.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
could throw a person
off balance spiritually.

00:04:57.985 --> 00:05:00.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as students
of Jesus’ sign of the last days,

00:05:00.696 --> 00:05:03.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have fully anticipated
that there would be

00:05:03.782 --> 00:05:08.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
many serious problems
facing mankind at the same time

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:11.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on an unprecedented scale.

00:05:11.456 --> 00:05:13.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
But isn’t it interesting

00:05:13.458 --> 00:05:17.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the world itself has seen fit
to come up with an expression

00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:20.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
that adequately matches
what we are going through?

00:05:20.048 --> 00:05:22.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether they realize it or not,

00:05:22.176 --> 00:05:26.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re acknowledging
that Jesus’ words are being fulfilled.

00:05:26.972 --> 00:05:30.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
So rather than become eaten up by anxiety,

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:35.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can find hope in these very same facts

00:05:35.063 --> 00:05:37.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if we meditate

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:41.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the fulfillment of the Scriptures.

00:05:42.446 --> 00:05:46.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures contain the promise of God

00:05:46.575 --> 00:05:49.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a promise of salvation.

00:05:49.494 --> 00:05:53.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah God . . . [will] bring to ruin
those ruining the earth.”

00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:57.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is going to be a resurrection.”

00:05:57.336 --> 00:05:59.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Death will be no more.”

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:04.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous will possess the earth,
and they will live forever on it.”

00:06:04.843 --> 00:06:07.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding how the Scriptures apply

00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:11.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they’re fulfilled builds our faith.

00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:15.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stronger our faith is,
the stronger our hope will be

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
because “faith is the assured

00:06:19.942 --> 00:06:24.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
[the assured] expectation
of what is hoped for.”

00:06:26.073 --> 00:06:28.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think often about your hope?

00:06:28.951 --> 00:06:32.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you meditate on what it means?

00:06:32.246 --> 00:06:35.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Thessalonians 5:8 says:

00:06:35.082 --> 00:06:38.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let us . . . put on . . .
the hope of salvation

00:06:38.377 --> 00:06:40.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a helmet.”

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a helmet protects the head,

00:06:43.173 --> 00:06:45.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
so hope protects the mind.

00:06:46.468 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us does not need such a helmet?

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you have a favorite Kingdom song
or original song from jw.org

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:58.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
that keeps Jehovah’s promises
shining brightly in your mind.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:02.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you recall that song,
you’re feeding your hope,

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:05.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
which in turn guards your thinking.

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:09.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hope has to be so real to us

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:11.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can see ourselves in the new world

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:15.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no longer battling illness and depression,

00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:18.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
but waking up each day with better hearing,

00:07:18.875 --> 00:07:22.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
better vision, better looks, better outlooks;

00:07:22.754 --> 00:07:25.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
no longer mourning the death of those we love

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:30.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, experiencing the thrill
of seeing them come back to life.

00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:35.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the longest life span
you’ve ever heard of?

00:07:35.517 --> 00:07:39.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the greatest number you can think of?

00:07:39.229 --> 00:07:41.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now combine the two concepts.

00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:43.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living for—

00:07:43.692 --> 00:07:47.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we could attempt to explain
googolplexes of galactic millenniums.

00:07:47.696 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact is that no matter
how great a period of time

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:53.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can possibly fathom,

00:07:53.243 --> 00:07:57.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises us life
that cannot be defined by any number

00:07:57.998 --> 00:08:00.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it never stops.

00:08:00.292 --> 00:08:02.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the Bible means

00:08:02.294 --> 00:08:05.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
by its many references to everlasting life.

00:08:06.757 --> 00:08:09.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Visualize a project

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:12.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would take several thousand years

00:08:12.346 --> 00:08:15.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
to plan and complete.

00:08:15.015 --> 00:08:18.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of forests would you like to grow?

00:08:18.226 --> 00:08:22.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine having millions of years to observe,

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:24.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
analyze, and draw new conclusions

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s activities and creative works.

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:30.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
What possibilities exist

00:08:30.781 --> 00:08:34.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an earth filled with loyal, loving people

00:08:34.451 --> 00:08:38.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cooperate with the many systems
Jehovah has created?

00:08:38.997 --> 00:08:41.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of knowledge
would you like to acquire

00:08:41.708 --> 00:08:44.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is currently out of reach
because of our limited life span?

00:08:46.129 --> 00:08:48.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will it be like to build

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:52.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the knowledge of hundreds of generations?

00:08:52.969 --> 00:08:55.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Picture whom you will meet
in the resurrection.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:09:00.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we think of family members
and faithful ones of old.

00:09:00.018 --> 00:09:02.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
But consider what it will be like

00:09:02.229 --> 00:09:04.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand how you are related

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:07.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
to every person on this planet

00:09:07.609 --> 00:09:10.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all the way back to the beginning!

00:09:10.570 --> 00:09:15.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine all intelligent creation
in heaven and on earth

00:09:15.492 --> 00:09:20.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
united as one happy family praising Jehovah!

00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:25.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just wishful thinking?

00:09:25.001 --> 00:09:27.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
happy thoughts? a dream?

00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:30.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, this is hope.

00:09:30.674 --> 00:09:35.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s meditation on the promise of God,
“who cannot lie”;

00:09:35.679 --> 00:09:39.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditation on what he has done
to fulfill his promise

00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:42.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
—providing the ransom
and establishing a heavenly Kingdom

00:09:42.394 --> 00:09:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will bring mankind back to perfection;

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:48.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditation on Jehovah’s personality

00:09:48.066 --> 00:09:52.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a personality revealed
in his creative works, in the Scriptures,

00:09:52.446 --> 00:09:55.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
and mirrored perfectly
by his only-begotten Son—

00:09:55.574 --> 00:10:00.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
a personality we know
not only through deep study

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also through our own experience.

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:08.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this leads us
to the second way we feed our hope.

00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:10.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall that Romans 15:4 said

00:10:10.338 --> 00:10:13.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are two ways to feed your hope

00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:15.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“through the comfort from the Scriptures”

00:10:15.677 --> 00:10:19.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also “through our endurance.”

00:10:19.514 --> 00:10:23.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does endurance feed your hope?

00:10:23.518 --> 00:10:25.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice what Paul said about this

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
back at Romans 5:3-5:

00:10:31.401 --> 00:10:34.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not only that,

00:10:34.237 --> 00:10:38.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but let us rejoice while in tribulations,

00:10:38.283 --> 00:10:42.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
“since we know that tribulation
produces endurance;

00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:45.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
“endurance, in turn, an approved condition;

00:10:45.832 --> 00:10:48.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the approved condition, in turn, hope,

00:10:48.627 --> 00:10:50.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the hope

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not lead to disappointment.”

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:56.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the “hope” mentioned here

00:10:56.051 --> 00:10:58.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
is referring not to our initial hope.

00:10:58.345 --> 00:11:00.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
We already had that when we learned

00:11:00.347 --> 00:11:02.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
the promise of God
contained in the Scriptures.

00:11:02.349 --> 00:11:06.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why Paul begins verse 3
with the words “not only that.”

00:11:06.186 --> 00:11:10.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, not only do we rejoice
in our initial hope

00:11:10.232 --> 00:11:13.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we rejoice in our reinforced hope

00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:17.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hope made even stronger
through new experiences with Jehovah

00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:20.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
as our personal Helper.

00:11:20.575 --> 00:11:25.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the only way
to understand this process fully

00:11:25.372 --> 00:11:27.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by going through it.

00:11:27.624 --> 00:11:29.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s been your experience?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have you done
when undergoing tribulation?

00:11:33.838 --> 00:11:36.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you turned to Jehovah for help.

00:11:36.675 --> 00:11:38.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then what happened?

00:11:38.301 --> 00:11:39.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped you.

00:11:39.719 --> 00:11:42.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, the trial
might not have disappeared,

00:11:42.639 --> 00:11:44.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you discovered

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:48.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you somehow
had the strength to endure it,

00:11:48.228 --> 00:11:51.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the wisdom to manage it,

00:11:51.022 --> 00:11:55.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
or practical aid or encouragement
at just the right time,

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:59.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the courage
to continue bearing witness to the truth.

00:12:00.448 --> 00:12:04.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you feel in that moment?

00:12:04.202 --> 00:12:09.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you sense
that Jehovah heard your prayer?

00:12:09.124 --> 00:12:11.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you perceive Jehovah reassuring you

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:15.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you and he have a relationship?

00:12:15.672 --> 00:12:18.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you go through that
—even once—

00:12:18.883 --> 00:12:22.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
you no longer wonder
whether you could endure a crisis.

00:12:22.053 --> 00:12:25.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know you can with Jehovah’s help.

00:12:25.056 --> 00:12:27.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is hope

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not simply a desire for something good,

00:12:30.186 --> 00:12:33.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the basis for believing it will happen.

00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:37.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our dear brothers and sisters

00:12:37.152 --> 00:12:41.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
have built up a lifetime of such experiences.

00:12:41.406 --> 00:12:43.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why their hope hasn’t weakened

00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:46.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite waiting for the new world
for decades.

00:12:46.578 --> 00:12:50.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the contrary, their hope
has been strengthened through experience.

00:12:50.332 --> 00:12:55.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
They know firsthand
what Romans 5:3-5 is talking about

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:58.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and likely you do as well.

00:12:58.298 --> 00:13:01.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank God for hope!

00:13:01.885 --> 00:13:04.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is “the God who gives hope.”

00:13:04.804 --> 00:13:08.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never become
“shifted away from [our] hope.”

00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:12.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
When difficulties arise, feed your hope!

00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:15.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to meditate
on “the comfort from the Scriptures.”

00:13:15.899 --> 00:13:19.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep trusting in Jehovah
for strength and wisdom.

00:13:19.944 --> 00:13:24.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
And each day,
take note of how he reassures you

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:28.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
that hope
—your hope—

00:13:28.244 --> 00:13:30.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
is real.
