00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:04.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was young,
one of my favorite desserts

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
was my mother’s sweet potato pie.

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.030 line:10% position:50% align:center
It always tasted the same.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.951 line:10% position:50% align:center
To me, it was perfect every time.

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:19.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d often ask her,
“Ma, what do you put in here

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make it taste so good?”

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’d always respond,
“I just use the same stuff every time.”

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:30.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, number one,
she wasn’t going to tell me.

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
And two,
she had a recipe that worked,

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:36.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she never changed it.

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:41.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible is like a cookbook,

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
full of recipes that work,

00:00:44.189 --> 00:00:47.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can make
our life spiritually successful.

00:00:48.903 --> 00:00:53.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please note how Paul explains
the benefits of these recipes

00:00:53.866 --> 00:00:58.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17:

00:00:58.495 --> 00:01:01.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All Scripture is inspired of God

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,

00:01:04.919 --> 00:01:08.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for setting things straight,
for disciplining in righteousness,

00:01:09.506 --> 00:01:13.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the man of God
may be fully competent,

00:01:13.135 --> 00:01:17.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:22.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes the recipe from God’s inspired Word

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:25.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes in the form of a Bible example.

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:27.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we study that example,

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
we extract qualities and attitudes
that we can imitate.

00:01:33.364 --> 00:01:37.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
At other times, 
there’s a list of qualities,

00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the various aspects
of the fruitage of God’s spirit

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:43.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in Galatians chapter 5

00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the list of positive things to consider

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:49.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 4:8, 9.

00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:53.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
there are numerous Bible principles

00:01:53.258 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can use
to help us make good decisions.

00:01:57.721 --> 00:02:01.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditating on and applying
these principles,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
qualities, and examples

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be a recipe
that contributes to spiritual success.

00:02:10.234 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider one example.

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:17.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s recorded at 1 Peter 3:8.

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take note of the ingredients.

00:02:20.494 --> 00:02:24.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All of you have unity of mind,

00:02:24.164 --> 00:02:26.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fellow feeling,

00:02:26.166 --> 00:02:28.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“brotherly affection,

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:30.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“tender compassion,

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and humility.”

00:02:32.715 --> 00:02:37.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a recipe
of five beautiful qualities

00:02:37.511 --> 00:02:40.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that contribute to our spiritual success.

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:41.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss the ingredients.

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter first mentions “unity of mind.”

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:53.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote says “think in agreement.”

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we must think in agreement
with one another

00:02:58.032 --> 00:03:02.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially with Jehovah
and his organization.

00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:03.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
The latter part of Isaiah 30:15 says:

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your strength will be in keeping calm
and showing trust.”

00:03:13.338 --> 00:03:17.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s exactly what the faithful slave
has done.

00:03:17.134 --> 00:03:21.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let us have unity of mind with them

00:03:21.096 --> 00:03:26.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have the same calmness
and confidence in Jehovah

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we face personal challenges in our life.

00:03:30.647 --> 00:03:33.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Kings chapter 4,

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:36.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Shunammite woman is mentioned

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:39.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had confidence in the prophet Elisha.

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
She suffered a terrible tragedy in her life.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, she remained calm

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:49.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showed trust
in “the man of the true God,” Elisha.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her example of trust
in Jehovah’s representative

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
is worthy of imitation.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, there is an expression
she uses in chapter 4

00:04:01.428 --> 00:04:03.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
that conveys the level of trust

00:04:03.806 --> 00:04:05.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to have in Jehovah

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:08.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his earthly representatives today.

00:04:09.436 --> 00:04:12.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me tell you about this woman.

00:04:12.564 --> 00:04:15.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
She and her husband lived in Shunem.

00:04:15.317 --> 00:04:19.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha would regularly make
encouraging visits with them

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:22.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was in that city.

00:04:22.407 --> 00:04:25.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha appreciated their hospitality

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:27.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wanted to do something kind for them.

00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:29.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would he do?

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:33.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, verses 14-16

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:35.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 2 Kings chapter 4

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:38.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicate that she did not have a son

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:40.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that her husband was old.

00:04:40.968 --> 00:04:43.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elisha told her that the next year

00:04:43.762 --> 00:04:46.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
she would be embracing a son.

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:49.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as Elisha foretold,

00:04:49.351 --> 00:04:51.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
she gave birth the next year.

00:04:53.438 --> 00:04:57.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
But unfortunately,
something drastic happened.

00:04:58.402 --> 00:05:03.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
The child grew up
and one day went out to work with his father.

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:06.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 19,
the boy complained of a headache,

00:05:06.952 --> 00:05:10.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
which led to his eventual death.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh my!

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:14.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would this woman do?

00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:17.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was her only son.

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:20.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she had confidence

00:05:20.424 --> 00:05:22.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
in “the man of the true God,” Elisha,

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:27.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she says to her husband in verse 22:

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Send me, please, one of the attendants

00:05:29.975 --> 00:05:31.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and one of the donkeys,

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:33.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let me go quickly

00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:35.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the man of the true God and return.”

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 23, her husband asks:

00:05:39.067 --> 00:05:42.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are you going to see him today?”

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:47.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
“What can he do for us?”

00:05:47.034 --> 00:05:49.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, note her response

00:05:49.828 --> 00:05:52.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of verse 23 and verse 24:

00:05:53.624 --> 00:05:56.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, she said:

00:05:56.418 --> 00:06:00.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Everything is all right.’

00:06:00.339 --> 00:06:02.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So she saddled the donkey

00:06:02.341 --> 00:06:05.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to her attendant: ‘Go quickly.

00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:08.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not slow down for me unless I tell you to.’”

00:06:08.472 --> 00:06:12.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this calm, trusting woman

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:17.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
rides about 19 miles, or 30 kilometers,

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:19.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finds Elisha.

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:21.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he ends up resurrecting her son.

00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:27.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her trusting relationship
and association with Elisha

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:30.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
had given her confidence.

00:06:30.244 --> 00:06:32.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although she experienced a tragedy,

00:06:32.496 --> 00:06:36.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
she knew that everything was all right.

00:06:37.834 --> 00:06:40.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha’s faith and confidence in Jehovah

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:43.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped this devoted woman also

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain calm and confident

00:06:46.051 --> 00:06:48.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
when facing adversity.

00:06:49.137 --> 00:06:51.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 41:10,

00:06:51.682 --> 00:06:54.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
note Jehovah’s assurance:

00:06:54.685 --> 00:06:58.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:06:58.647 --> 00:07:01.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:07:02.484 --> 00:07:07.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:07:07.197 --> 00:07:10.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:07:10.075 --> 00:07:12.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:16.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s work hard to have unity of mind

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s organization

00:07:19.001 --> 00:07:23.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
by keeping calm
and showing trust in Jehovah

00:07:23.213 --> 00:07:26.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by being confident
that with Jehovah’s help

00:07:26.508 --> 00:07:30.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything will be all right.

00:07:30.304 --> 00:07:32.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a beautiful ingredient

00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:35.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this recipe for spiritual success.

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:39.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Peter 3:8,

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:43.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter next mentions three more ingredients.

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are aspects of love:

00:07:46.403 --> 00:07:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fellow feeling,

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:49.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
“brotherly affection,

00:07:49.698 --> 00:07:52.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
tender compassion.”

00:07:52.242 --> 00:07:56.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
These aspects of love convey empathy.

00:07:57.372 --> 00:08:00.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Empathy is “the ability to understand

00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:03.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
and share the feelings of another.”

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:07.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this system draws to a close,

00:08:07.257 --> 00:08:11.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan will try to divide us from within.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:15.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
So love for our brothers and sisters

00:08:15.932 --> 00:08:18.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
and empathizing with one another

00:08:18.602 --> 00:08:21.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
will become ever more important.

00:08:21.063 --> 00:08:23.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will serve to unify us.

00:08:25.067 --> 00:08:26.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the empathy

00:08:26.818 --> 00:08:29.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s organization.

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:32.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all have personal challenges,

00:08:32.407 --> 00:08:34.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
but so do our overseers,

00:08:34.618 --> 00:08:38.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
those taking the lead
in the organization here on earth.

00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:41.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them have lost loved ones in death

00:08:41.541 --> 00:08:43.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like us.

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:46.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some have experienced sickness and anxiety

00:08:46.838 --> 00:08:48.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like us.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love them for their empathy.

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:56.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the heavenly part
of Jehovah’s organization.

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:01.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Satan’s rebellion,
Jehovah has been disappointed,

00:09:01.144 --> 00:09:06.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
saddened, angered at the actions
of imperfect men.

00:09:06.066 --> 00:09:08.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are real feelings

00:09:08.443 --> 00:09:11.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our empathetic heavenly Father
possesses.

00:09:12.489 --> 00:09:17.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus experienced
similar disappointment and sadness

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:19.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he also saw the rebellion

00:09:19.496 --> 00:09:23.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Satan, Adam, and Eve
and what’s resulted.

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:29.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
Jesus’ understanding became deeper

00:09:29.214 --> 00:09:34.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he became human
and began to experience human emotions.

00:09:34.219 --> 00:09:37.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
The April 15, 2002, <i>Watchtower</i>  article

00:09:37.889 --> 00:09:42.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled
“Empathy—Key to Kindness and Compassion”

00:09:42.894 --> 00:09:47.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned three ways
we can sharpen our sensitivity

00:09:47.023 --> 00:09:49.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the needs and feelings of others.

00:09:50.444 --> 00:09:54.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first: ‘Listen.

00:09:54.322 --> 00:09:56.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘By listening carefully,

00:09:56.366 --> 00:09:59.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘we learn what problems others face.

00:09:59.744 --> 00:10:01.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And the better we listen,

00:10:01.746 --> 00:10:05.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘the more likely
they will open up their hearts

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:07.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reveal their feelings.’

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:11.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second: ‘Observe.

00:10:11.298 --> 00:10:13.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Not everyone will openly tell us

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:15.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘how they feel

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:18.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘or what they are going through.

00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:21.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘A keen observer will notice

00:10:21.183 --> 00:10:23.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when a fellow Christian needs encouragement

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:25.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
or some practical assistance.’

00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:30.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third: “Use Your Imagination.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:34.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The most powerful way to stimulate empathy

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:36.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is to ask yourself:

00:10:36.239 --> 00:10:38.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If I were in this situation,

00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:40.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘how would I feel?

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘How would I respond?

00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:44.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would I need?’”

00:10:45.749 --> 00:10:50.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
So fellow feeling, brotherly affection,
and tender compassion

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:53.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
are aspects of loving empathy

00:10:53.715 --> 00:10:57.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are valuable ingredients
to our spiritual success

00:10:57.677 --> 00:11:00.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will benefit others.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:06.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
The final quality highlighted at 1 Peter 3:8

00:11:06.561 --> 00:11:08.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
is humility.

00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:11.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we need humility?

00:11:11.775 --> 00:11:14.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we need to trust.

00:11:14.444 --> 00:11:17.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust in Jehovah and his organization

00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:20.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires humility

00:11:20.367 --> 00:11:24.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not relying on our own strength or wisdom.

00:11:24.538 --> 00:11:27.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility helps us to cope

00:11:27.207 --> 00:11:30.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whatever God permits.

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:33.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we face anxiety
and pressure in our life,

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:37.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may yearn for immediate relief.

00:11:37.175 --> 00:11:40.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
But humility helps us to trust

00:11:40.637 --> 00:11:44.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah knows precisely when

00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:47.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how to act in our behalf.

00:11:47.852 --> 00:11:50.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wait

00:11:50.188 --> 00:11:52.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
patiently.

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:55.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah always responds to our needs

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:59.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his time and in his way.

00:11:59.656 --> 00:12:03.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility helps us to admit
that Jehovah’s thoughts

00:12:03.493 --> 00:12:07.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
are vastly superior to our own.

00:12:07.706 --> 00:12:11.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recognize our limited discernment

00:12:11.084 --> 00:12:13.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
in comparison

00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:17.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s all-encompassing perception.

00:12:17.549 --> 00:12:20.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees things we do not discern,

00:12:20.719 --> 00:12:25.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thus we trust
that his way of doing things

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:28.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
is always best.

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:31.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the great tribulation approaches,

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:35.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
humbly trust in Jehovah

00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:37.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his organization.

00:12:37.944 --> 00:12:40.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter chapter 5,

00:12:40.864 --> 00:12:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 6 says this:

00:12:43.867 --> 00:12:46.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Humble yourselves, therefore,

00:12:46.703 --> 00:12:49.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“under the mighty hand of God,

00:12:49.289 --> 00:12:53.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he may exalt you in due time.”

00:12:54.210 --> 00:12:59.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, there is no better place to be

00:12:59.215 --> 00:13:04.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
than “under the mighty hand of God.”

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:07.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility is a beautiful ingredient

00:13:07.849 --> 00:13:12.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps us to remain there.

00:13:14.439 --> 00:13:16.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what were the ingredients

00:13:16.733 --> 00:13:20.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our recipe for spiritual success?

00:13:20.111 --> 00:13:24.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
First was unity of mind.

00:13:24.366 --> 00:13:28.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be at unity with Jehovah’s organization today

00:13:28.370 --> 00:13:32.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
by keeping calm and showing trust.

00:13:32.248 --> 00:13:35.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the words of the Shunammite woman
in 2 Kings chapter 4,

00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:40.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
when facing adversity,
always know that with Jehovah

00:13:40.173 --> 00:13:43.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“everything is all right.”

00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second was fellow feeling,

00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:50.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
brotherly affection, and tender compassion

00:13:50.141 --> 00:13:53.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all aspects of loving empathy.

00:13:53.937 --> 00:13:58.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, we’re all in this together.

00:13:58.274 --> 00:14:02.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
The celestial chariot
is empathetic toward what we face

00:14:02.445 --> 00:14:07.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will respond
to our personal and organizational needs.

00:14:08.451 --> 00:14:11.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, try always

00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:14.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
to include humility

00:14:14.165 --> 00:14:16.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your recipe for success.

00:14:16.918 --> 00:14:20.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility requires trust,

00:14:20.588 --> 00:14:24.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
so trust that Jehovah’s way of doing things

00:14:24.342 --> 00:14:26.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
is always best.

00:14:28.096 --> 00:14:31.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 119:105 says

00:14:31.725 --> 00:14:35.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible “is a lamp to my foot,

00:14:35.562 --> 00:14:38.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a light for my path.”

00:14:39.607 --> 00:14:42.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take time to consider

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:45.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
a portion of God’s Word each day.

00:14:45.697 --> 00:14:50.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
As situations, decisions,
and challenges arise,

00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:53.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
search for the right recipe

00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:57.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Bible example, Christian quality, principle.

00:14:58.293 --> 00:15:01.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you do,
Jehovah will light up

00:15:01.713 --> 00:15:03.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
the path ahead of you

00:15:03.715 --> 00:15:08.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help you to be spiritually successful.
