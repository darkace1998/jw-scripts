00:01.284 --> 00:04.821
Welcome to this month’s edition 
of JW Broadcasting.

00:04.821 --> 00:08.992
Here are just a few highlights 
that we have in store for you.

00:08.992 --> 00:11.628
Do you feel that you’ve missed 
past opportunities

00:11.628 --> 00:13.663
to do more for Jehovah?

00:13.663 --> 00:16.733
Or do you feel that your age 
or present circumstances

00:16.733 --> 00:18.968
keep you from reaching out?

00:18.968 --> 00:20.970
We’ll see how one couple learned

00:20.970 --> 00:23.573
that there may be doors of activity available

00:23.573 --> 00:27.243
to those with a willing spirit.

00:27.243 --> 00:31.047
Have you ever received an assignment 
that you felt was overwhelming?

00:31.047 --> 00:34.117
Brother and Sister Halme, 
serving in West Africa,

00:34.117 --> 00:37.120
will share what helped them 
accept such an assignment

00:37.120 --> 00:40.123
and remain spiritually strong 
through difficult times.

00:41.925 --> 00:44.227
And if you’re a regular pioneer,

00:44.227 --> 00:48.531
what role do you have 
in strengthening the congregation?

00:48.531 --> 00:51.935
You’ll find this dramatization 
very insightful.

00:51.935 --> 00:54.437
Our focus is on our ministry

00:54.437 --> 00:59.275
in this May 2018 edition 
of JW Broadcasting!

01:18.128 --> 01:21.631
To set the stage 
for the experiences in our program,

01:21.631 --> 01:24.667
I’d like to talk to you 
for a few minutes on the theme

01:24.667 --> 01:28.738
“Invigorate Your Ministry—How?”

01:28.738 --> 01:31.174
You dear brothers and sisters are having

01:31.174 --> 01:33.176
a regular share in the preaching work,

01:33.176 --> 01:35.512
and just think of the results.

01:35.512 --> 01:36.780
Each year,

01:36.780 --> 01:40.683
about two billion hours 
are spent in the ministry.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.586
Millions of Bible studies are conducted,

01:43.586 --> 01:47.957
and those being baptized 
number into the hundreds of thousands.

01:47.957 --> 01:50.260
If you are a Kingdom publisher,

01:50.260 --> 01:53.963
you have had a share 
in those thrilling statistics.

01:53.963 --> 01:57.100
But there’s a potential danger.

01:57.100 --> 01:59.769
With so much to do in our life

01:59.769 --> 02:03.740
—not just in the ministry 
but also with secular work,

02:03.740 --> 02:07.811
family responsibilities, 
for some, even health issues—

02:07.811 --> 02:10.547
we can get into a rut.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.416
It’s not always easy to detect at first,

02:13.416 --> 02:15.752
because in this age of technology

02:15.752 --> 02:18.588
we always feel busy.

02:18.588 --> 02:21.357
But what consumes our day?

02:21.357 --> 02:23.693
Watch this one-minute video,

02:23.693 --> 02:27.697
and try to detect what’s going on 
in the life of one brother.

02:27.697 --> 02:29.899
His life is in a rut.

02:29.899 --> 02:32.302
Try to figure out why.

03:46.376 --> 03:49.612
Would you say 
that this brother’s life is in a rut?

03:49.612 --> 03:51.748
Oh, he’s active all day

03:51.748 --> 03:54.183
—he always has something to do.

03:54.183 --> 03:59.055
But it’s as if his mind 
has been kidnapped by his devices.

03:59.055 --> 04:02.959
Have you ever had 
the experience of reading an e-mail

04:02.959 --> 04:05.695
while someone 
is trying to tell you something?

04:05.695 --> 04:07.697
It can be embarrassing

04:07.697 --> 04:10.066
when you realize 
that they’ve asked you a question,

04:10.066 --> 04:12.068
and they’re waiting for an answer,

04:12.068 --> 04:14.237
but you have no idea what they asked.

04:14.237 --> 04:16.239
It’s embarrassing, right?

04:16.239 --> 04:21.244
But what if the person 
who is trying to speak to you is Jehovah?

04:22.345 --> 04:24.847
Even though we aren’t doing anything wrong,

04:24.847 --> 04:29.285
our daily routine 
can occupy our attention so much

04:29.285 --> 04:34.057
that we are not able to hear 
the refreshing words of Jehovah.

04:34.724 --> 04:37.226
That can happen to any one of us.

04:37.226 --> 04:41.331
Even our spiritual activity 
can get into a rut.

04:41.331 --> 04:44.667
One Christian sister described it this way:

04:44.667 --> 04:46.869
“I would go out in service,

04:46.869 --> 04:50.340
“go to meetings, study, pray

04:50.340 --> 04:53.376
“—but I did it all on automatic control,

04:53.376 --> 04:55.812
never feeling anything.”

04:56.913 --> 04:59.382
Have you ever felt that way?

04:59.382 --> 05:02.085
Do you see 
all the happy servants of Jehovah

05:02.085 --> 05:05.555
whose experiences 
appear on JW Broadcasting,

05:05.555 --> 05:07.557
and you say to yourself:

05:07.557 --> 05:09.692
‘Why can’t I find that joy?

05:09.692 --> 05:12.562
Why is my ministry in a rut?’

05:12.562 --> 05:15.565
Perhaps you feel 
like a remote-control train

05:15.565 --> 05:18.334
that goes around and around on a track,

05:18.334 --> 05:22.105
working the same territory, 
with the same partner,

05:22.105 --> 05:24.774
saying the same thing at each door.

05:24.774 --> 05:28.945
Of course, there’s nothing wrong 
with being in a good routine.

05:28.945 --> 05:32.915
But being in a rut can sap our energy

05:32.915 --> 05:35.752
and take the joy out of our service.

05:35.752 --> 05:40.023
We could even come to view 
our ministry as boring.

05:40.023 --> 05:44.527
Of course, we feel invigorated 
when we get good results:

05:44.527 --> 05:47.230
We meet an interested person 
when going from door to door

05:47.230 --> 05:49.065
—we’re invigorated!

05:49.065 --> 05:51.467
An inactive person approaches the cart

05:51.467 --> 05:53.903
and wants to get in touch 
with the local congregation

05:53.903 --> 05:55.905
—we’re even more invigorated!

05:55.905 --> 05:59.542
We start a Bible study 
—we’re on top of the world!

05:59.542 --> 06:01.544
I’m sure you’ll agree,

06:01.544 --> 06:05.281
all those outcomes 
are good reasons for joy.

06:05.281 --> 06:08.818
The problem is 
that we’re not always in control

06:08.818 --> 06:10.887
of getting those outcomes.

06:10.887 --> 06:14.223
In real life, 
we may spend an entire morning

06:14.223 --> 06:17.693
in the door-to-door work 
without meeting an interested person.

06:17.693 --> 06:19.695
We may spend months

06:19.695 --> 06:23.066
making return visits 
without starting a study.

06:23.066 --> 06:27.804
And once again, 
our ministry can get into a rut.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.806
Now, don’t misunderstand.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.275
It’s not that we’re doing anything wrong,

06:32.275 --> 06:36.879
but we’re not getting 
the full joy out of doing what’s right.

06:36.879 --> 06:39.082
Of course, Satan would love it

06:39.082 --> 06:42.418
if our service to Jehovah 
were to fall into a rut.

06:42.418 --> 06:45.822
He would love it if we lost our joy.

06:45.822 --> 06:49.325
If we lose our joy, we lose hope,

06:49.325 --> 06:51.327
we lose strength,

06:51.327 --> 06:55.331
and we might even begin 
to feel like giving up.

06:55.331 --> 06:57.900
The point is this, brothers and sisters:

06:57.900 --> 07:02.105
If you feel that your ministry 
has fallen into a rut,

07:02.105 --> 07:05.208
don’t be discouraged and don’t give up.

07:05.208 --> 07:08.544
There are ways 
that we can invigorate our ministry

07:08.544 --> 07:11.414
and serve Jehovah with renewed joy.

07:11.414 --> 07:13.182
To illustrate that:

07:13.182 --> 07:14.750
Maybe you’ve had

07:14.750 --> 07:17.487
the frustrating experience 
of locking yourself

07:17.487 --> 07:20.356
out of your house or apartment.

07:21.090 --> 07:23.893
Of course, with a key, 
opening the door is simple.

07:23.893 --> 07:26.729
A locked door 
might seem like an obstacle,

07:27.330 --> 07:29.599
but it isn’t if you have the key.

07:30.900 --> 07:33.970
And the same is true 
with invigorating our ministry.

07:33.970 --> 07:36.205
If we’ve fallen into a rut

07:36.205 --> 07:40.176
and if we’ve lost 
that feeling of joy in our service,

07:40.176 --> 07:45.081
there are a number of keys 
that can help us unlock the door.

07:45.081 --> 07:47.350
Let’s look at one.

07:47.350 --> 07:52.855
Open your Bible 
to 1 Corinthians 16:8, 9.

07:52.855 --> 07:55.324
Now, in these verses,

07:55.324 --> 07:59.462
the apostle Paul was presented 
with a key of opportunity,

07:59.462 --> 08:02.498
and he used it to open a door.

08:02.498 --> 08:06.636
First Corinthians 16:8, 9 says:

08:06.636 --> 08:09.305
“But I am remaining in Ephesus

08:09.305 --> 08:11.874
“until the Festival of Pentecost,

08:11.874 --> 08:15.645
“because a large door that leads to activity

08:15.645 --> 08:17.847
has been opened to me.”

08:18.481 --> 08:21.484
Here, the apostle Paul found a key,

08:21.484 --> 08:24.854
and it didn’t require 
moving to another location.

08:24.854 --> 08:28.858
In this case, 
the key was to stay where he was

08:28.858 --> 08:33.863
and to take full advantage 
of an opportunity right before him.

08:33.863 --> 08:38.334
Sometimes, the key 
to getting out of a rut in our ministry

08:38.334 --> 08:43.039
is to take advantage of opportunities 
we have right where we are.

08:43.039 --> 08:47.343
For example, 
have you considered auxiliary pioneering

08:47.343 --> 08:49.612
or regular pioneering?

08:49.612 --> 08:51.781
What about learning a foreign language

08:51.781 --> 08:56.319
with the goal of helping 
a nearby group or congregation?

08:56.319 --> 09:01.123
Opening one door often leads 
to other doors of opportunity.

09:01.123 --> 09:05.761
For example, 
a brother named Jacob wrote this:

09:05.761 --> 09:10.233
“When I was seven, 
many of my classmates were Vietnamese.

09:10.233 --> 09:12.635
“I wanted to tell them about Jehovah,

09:12.635 --> 09:16.005
“so after a while 
I made plans to learn their language.

09:16.005 --> 09:18.074
“For the most part,

09:18.074 --> 09:21.177
“I learned by comparing 
the English and Vietnamese editions

09:21.177 --> 09:23.045
“of The Watchtower.

09:23.045 --> 09:27.516
“I also made friends in a nearby 
Vietnamese-language congregation.

09:27.516 --> 09:30.886
“When I was 18, I started pioneering.

09:30.886 --> 09:34.056
“Later, I attended 
the Bible School for Single Brothers.

09:34.056 --> 09:37.793
“This helped me 
with my present pioneer assignment,

09:37.793 --> 09:41.998
“where I am the only elder 
in a Vietnamese-language group.

09:41.998 --> 09:46.502
“Many Vietnamese people are amazed 
that I have learned their language.

09:46.502 --> 09:50.906
“They invite me in, 
and often I can study the Bible with them.

09:50.906 --> 09:54.277
Some have progressed to baptism.”

09:54.277 --> 09:59.315
The point is, 
our ministry is what we make it.

09:59.315 --> 10:01.984
If we allow ourselves to remain in a rut,

10:01.984 --> 10:03.986
it will be boring.

10:03.986 --> 10:06.856
If we use our keys 
and if we take advantage

10:06.856 --> 10:09.492
of opportunities that present themselves,

10:09.492 --> 10:13.896
we will invigorate our ministry 
and give it new meaning.

10:13.896 --> 10:18.301
This doesn’t always involve 
putting in more time in the ministry.

10:18.301 --> 10:22.104
It could mean that we 
simply ‘make the best use of our time’

10:22.104 --> 10:26.108
as Ephesians 5:16 says.

10:26.108 --> 10:28.577
In fact, there’s a saying:

10:28.577 --> 10:32.248
“Don’t work harder; work smarter.”

10:32.248 --> 10:34.350
The key to working smarter

10:34.350 --> 10:37.119
could be as simple 
as switching things up a bit.

10:37.119 --> 10:39.121
For example:

10:39.121 --> 10:43.793
Could we work with different publishers 
instead of the same one all the time?

10:43.793 --> 10:46.729
Could we try a different approach 
to our presentation,

10:46.729 --> 10:50.933
perhaps making better use 
of the Bible or our videos?

10:50.933 --> 10:53.903
Could we engage 
in other aspects of the ministry,

10:53.903 --> 10:56.772
such as cart witnessing 
or phone witnessing?

10:57.873 --> 11:01.077
Could we use our time 
more effectively to reach people

11:01.077 --> 11:04.347
when they’re most likely to be home?

11:04.347 --> 11:07.283
Here’s something else 
we could do to unlock a door

11:07.283 --> 11:09.585
and invigorate our ministry.

11:09.585 --> 11:15.591
Open your Bible to Acts 16:9, 10.

11:17.326 --> 11:19.328
Now, here the apostle Paul found

11:19.328 --> 11:23.099
a unique way to unlock 
a door to greater joy.

11:23.099 --> 11:26.202
Acts 16:9, 10 says:

11:26.202 --> 11:30.206
“And during the night 
a vision appeared to Paul

11:30.206 --> 11:34.610
“—a Macedonian man 
was standing there urging him and saying:

11:34.610 --> 11:38.514
“‘Step over into Macedonia and help us.’

11:38.514 --> 11:40.950
“As soon as he had seen the vision,

11:40.950 --> 11:43.486
“we tried to go into Macedonia,

11:43.486 --> 11:46.689
“drawing the conclusion 
that God had summoned us

11:46.689 --> 11:49.592
to declare the good news to them.”

11:50.059 --> 11:54.063
Notice, Paul didn’t think of all the reasons

11:54.063 --> 11:56.565
he couldn’t step into Macedonia.

11:56.565 --> 11:58.567
No, he took action

11:58.567 --> 12:01.804
as soon as he was presented 
with the opportunity.

12:01.804 --> 12:06.809
Paul unlocked the door 
to invigorate his ministry.

12:06.809 --> 12:10.746
Sometimes we think 
that only those who are young

12:10.746 --> 12:14.750
can reach out to pioneer 
or to serve where the need is greater.

12:14.750 --> 12:18.254
But that’s not always the case.

12:18.254 --> 12:23.292
You parents may be able to unlock 
a door of opportunity for yourselves,

12:23.292 --> 12:28.297
and think of the example 
you set for your children when you do so.

12:28.297 --> 12:33.302
That’s what a mother named Tara discovered:

12:33.302 --> 12:36.539
“I started pioneering 
when my youngest daughter

12:36.539 --> 12:39.341
was in elementary school,” she says.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.410
“It was important to me

12:41.410 --> 12:44.780
“that my children see me serving Jehovah

12:44.780 --> 12:49.218
to the best of my ability 
as I encouraged them to reach out.”

12:50.219 --> 12:52.221
Tara’s husband, Anthony,

12:52.221 --> 12:54.924
saw the effect 
that his wife’s pioneering had

12:54.924 --> 12:58.027
and, in time, 
he too joined the ranks.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.262
This is what he said:

13:00.262 --> 13:02.264
“When Tara became a pioneer,

13:02.264 --> 13:04.533
“it made an immediate impact

13:04.533 --> 13:07.470
“on daughters number one and number two,

13:07.470 --> 13:09.872
“and they became pioneers.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.874
“When I became a pioneer,

13:11.874 --> 13:14.844
“daughters number three 
and number four followed.

13:14.844 --> 13:18.714
“I wish I had pursued 
full-time service sooner,

13:18.714 --> 13:23.719
as it made a huge impact 
on the spirituality of the family.”

13:24.553 --> 13:26.822
I can relate to this experience

13:26.822 --> 13:30.226
because of the good example of my parents.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.928
My mother was baptized in Canada

13:32.928 --> 13:36.365
in 1940 when she was 16.

13:36.365 --> 13:40.269
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
had just been banned in Canada.

13:40.269 --> 13:42.505
Her father had already died,

13:42.505 --> 13:45.508
and her mother was opposed at that time.

13:45.508 --> 13:48.043
The brothers had very little money,

13:48.043 --> 13:51.881
but they encouraged 
my mother to pursue spiritual goals.

13:51.881 --> 13:53.883
With that encouragement,

13:53.883 --> 13:56.785
she started pioneering in 1942

13:56.785 --> 14:00.189
while the ban was still on in Canada.

14:00.189 --> 14:04.693
In 1947, she was invited 
to become a special pioneer

14:04.693 --> 14:07.029
in the province of Quebec.

14:07.029 --> 14:10.232
At that time, 
special pioneers were required

14:10.232 --> 14:14.537
to spend 200 hours 
each month in the ministry.

14:14.537 --> 14:18.507
With basically no money 
and no family support,

14:18.507 --> 14:20.776
she accepted that assignment.

14:20.776 --> 14:24.413
This picture was taken 
when she and her pioneer partner

14:24.413 --> 14:27.283
were boarding the train to Quebec.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.552
Whenever I see this picture,

14:29.552 --> 14:33.455
it reminds me 
of the intrepid spirit that my mother had

14:33.455 --> 14:37.326
—not being afraid 
to take on a challenging assignment,

14:37.326 --> 14:40.462
but putting complete trust in Jehovah.

14:41.130 --> 14:45.267
That spirit encourages me even to this day.

14:45.267 --> 14:47.903
My father has that same spirit.

14:47.903 --> 14:52.207
In the summer of 1976, 
when I was 11 years old,

14:52.207 --> 14:56.278
a new arrangement was announced 
at our district convention

14:56.278 --> 14:58.514
—auxiliary pioneering.

14:58.514 --> 15:00.950
You could be an auxiliary pioneer

15:00.950 --> 15:05.120
if you could devote 60 hours 
in one month to the ministry.

15:05.120 --> 15:09.725
The month of October 1976 
had five weekends.

15:09.725 --> 15:12.995
My father encouraged 
our whole congregation

15:12.995 --> 15:15.698
to try auxiliary pioneering that month.

15:15.698 --> 15:19.134
So many brothers and sisters, including me,

15:19.134 --> 15:22.171
decided to get a taste of pioneering.

15:22.171 --> 15:24.740
It was a wonderful experience

15:24.740 --> 15:27.343
that I will never forget.

15:27.343 --> 15:31.747
Parents, your good example 
will help your children

15:31.747 --> 15:36.785
to have a living ministry 
of their own that they will love.

15:36.785 --> 15:40.556
Brothers and sisters, 
if you find yourself in a rut,

15:40.556 --> 15:42.891
there is no reason to stay there.

15:42.891 --> 15:47.062
We’ve discussed several ways 
to reinvigorate our ministry,

15:47.062 --> 15:51.900
and with Jehovah’s help 
we will be successful.

15:52.635 --> 15:55.404
Now let’s meet a few brothers and sisters

15:55.404 --> 15:58.540
who’ve expanded 
and invigorated their ministry.

15:58.540 --> 16:01.777
We’re sure you’ll appreciate their stories.

16:01.777 --> 16:04.847
Our first experience comes from Brazil,

16:04.847 --> 16:06.882
in South America.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.652
Cristiano and Joana Souza

16:09.652 --> 16:12.788
found the key to invigorating their ministry

16:12.788 --> 16:16.258
in a congregation letter 
encouraging individuals

16:16.258 --> 16:20.229
to apply for the School 
for Kingdom Evangelizers.

16:20.229 --> 16:25.034
What new blessings 
did they experience by reaching out?

16:32.875 --> 16:34.877
We had our own house,

16:34.877 --> 16:37.146
a certain amount of comfort.

16:37.146 --> 16:39.214
My husband had a stable job,

16:39.214 --> 16:41.316
and I was doing a lot where we were.

16:41.316 --> 16:43.085
I had Bible studies.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.989
I was already a regular pioneer,
so I thought I was doing enough.

16:46.989 --> 16:49.758
It was fine to stay there.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.762
We’d often see the younger ones

16:53.762 --> 16:58.200
going to Bethel,
going to serve as special pioneers.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.336
And once we reached our 40’s,
I thought that since we’re getting older,

17:01.336 --> 17:04.306
we won’t be able to reach out
and do more for Jehovah.

17:04.306 --> 17:07.009
But after a letter
was read to the congregations,

17:07.009 --> 17:09.144
well, that was really 
the starting point for us to see

17:09.144 --> 17:12.347
that we could do more for Jehovah.

17:12.347 --> 17:16.652
When I heard that there was
a school for couples up to 65 years old,

17:16.652 --> 17:19.021
I said, “Cristiano, it’s now or never.”

17:19.021 --> 17:23.492
So immediately at the first convention
that held a meeting for interested couples,

17:23.492 --> 17:27.262
we attended the meeting
and realized that out of the requirements

17:27.262 --> 17:29.998
there was one
that my husband didn’t meet yet,

17:29.998 --> 17:33.368
which was two years as a regular pioneer.

17:33.368 --> 17:36.105
So I thought, ‘Why not?’

17:36.105 --> 17:39.408
After the convention,
I applied to be a regular pioneer.

17:39.408 --> 17:42.911
So we made plans to attend the school.

17:42.911 --> 17:46.014
But we didn’t want to stay there
waiting to be accepted,

17:46.014 --> 17:48.016
as there were no guarantees of being accepted

17:48.016 --> 17:50.018
in the same year in which we applied.

17:50.018 --> 17:52.020
We sold our house.

17:52.020 --> 17:54.556
And two weeks later,
we had sold all the furniture.

17:54.556 --> 17:57.559
So we made arrangements
to serve where the need was greater.

18:01.530 --> 18:03.565
We took only what was necessary in our car.

18:03.565 --> 18:06.301
But “what is necessary” is always too much.

18:06.301 --> 18:10.072
When you get to the territory, you realize
you didn’t even need everything you took.

18:10.072 --> 18:14.076
We were really excited because we knew 
the brothers were expecting us.

18:14.076 --> 18:16.545
There was a gas station
that belonged to a brother,

18:16.545 --> 18:18.947
and when we arrived,
the whole congregation

18:18.947 --> 18:21.049
was waiting for us there 
to welcome us.

18:21.049 --> 18:22.251
Nine people!

18:22.251 --> 18:23.952
And that had a great impact on us,

18:23.952 --> 18:26.388
because you could see 
the expression on their faces;

18:26.388 --> 18:29.558
it was as if they were asking for help.

18:31.059 --> 18:34.263
They helped us a lot.

18:34.263 --> 18:38.267
I can honestly say 
that they helped us more

18:38.267 --> 18:41.270
than we helped them.

18:43.105 --> 18:45.507
Now they would be able
to have regular meetings

18:45.507 --> 18:47.509
—a public talk every week.

18:47.509 --> 18:51.346
You know, we were in São Paulo
and we had all the meetings.

18:51.346 --> 18:55.818
But in these remote areas, they need
spiritual food from Jehovah so much.

18:55.818 --> 18:58.253
But there needs to be people 
willing to go and help.

19:02.958 --> 19:05.327
Then one day,
we had a wonderful surprise.

19:05.327 --> 19:09.832
A brother called me and said,
“Cristiano, have you checked your e-mails?”

19:09.832 --> 19:14.536
We’d received a letter
inviting us to the school.

19:14.536 --> 19:17.206
The school really is a gift from Jehovah.

19:17.206 --> 19:19.675
I’ve encouraged others that I know
to attend the school

19:19.675 --> 19:23.846
because you really feel
how Jehovah cares for his organization.

19:25.581 --> 19:29.785
And a small thing we can do
is simply give our best,

19:29.785 --> 19:32.321
and the school helps us do just that

19:32.321 --> 19:35.190
—find out what is our best.

19:35.190 --> 19:39.661
We were assigned
to a congregation called Itiruçu.

19:39.661 --> 19:43.832
The brothers are very loving,
and we’re really happy in our assignment.

19:47.502 --> 19:50.372
I do miss my house.

19:50.372 --> 19:52.374
It’s nice to have your own house

19:52.374 --> 19:54.643
and not to have to worry about paying rent.

19:54.643 --> 19:57.613
I miss my hairdresser.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.282
But nothing compares
to the blessings and the joy

20:00.282 --> 20:02.985
that comes from serving 
where there’s a need.

20:03.919 --> 20:07.789
This joy helps us to combat 
any homesickness we feel

20:07.789 --> 20:11.493
and stops us from developing
any desire to go back home.

20:12.694 --> 20:15.230
In the big city,
everything’s very rushed.

20:15.230 --> 20:17.399
I would only see my wife
when I got home from work.

20:17.399 --> 20:20.569
I’d be tired, and then also
have to care for congregational matters.

20:20.569 --> 20:23.338
So there wasn’t much time
for us to be together.

20:23.338 --> 20:25.340
Now it’s completely different.

20:25.340 --> 20:28.010
We have much more time
—during the ministry,

20:28.010 --> 20:30.345
in the congregation, 
being together at home.

20:30.345 --> 20:33.849
So for us as a family,
it has been very positive, very good.

20:36.218 --> 20:38.253
We’re not tired.
We’re not old in the sense—

20:38.253 --> 20:39.254
No we’re not.

20:39.254 --> 20:41.290
—of saying that we’ve got no more to give.

20:41.290 --> 20:43.892
We really believe we can do more for Jehovah.

20:43.892 --> 20:46.929
And we want to do more for Jehovah.

20:46.929 --> 20:50.766
The school is proof
that he wants us to do more.

20:50.766 --> 20:54.870
We want to use our life to the full
to serve Jehovah wherever he sends us.

20:54.870 --> 20:56.872
We are willing to go.

20:56.872 --> 20:59.574
We feel it’s the only way
to say a big “thank you”

20:59.574 --> 21:02.377
to Jehovah
for everything he’s done for us

21:02.945 --> 21:07.950
—the territory, school, 
the brothers, and Bible students.

21:07.950 --> 21:10.953
What better way to thank Jehovah.

21:20.095 --> 21:23.732
Do you feel the way 
that Brother and Sister Souza felt

21:23.732 --> 21:27.469
—that you’ve missed the chance 
to do more for Jehovah?

21:27.469 --> 21:31.239
They learned there were 
doors of opportunity accessible to them

21:31.239 --> 21:33.508
if they were willing to reach out.

21:33.508 --> 21:35.911
Their choice to make themselves available

21:35.911 --> 21:38.547
resulted in rich blessings.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.451
But did you notice 
when those blessings started?

21:42.451 --> 21:44.453
Before the school,

21:44.453 --> 21:47.089
they chose to serve 
where the need was greater.

21:47.089 --> 21:49.758
This had a profound effect on them,

21:49.758 --> 21:54.096
deepening their appreciation 
for spiritual provisions.

21:54.096 --> 21:57.466
If you desire to enliven your ministry

21:57.466 --> 22:00.369
by means of theocratic education,

22:00.369 --> 22:05.207
consider ways you can prepare 
your heart before you attend.

22:05.207 --> 22:07.676
The Souzas’ example proves

22:07.676 --> 22:10.979
that even the road 
to expanding our ministry

22:10.979 --> 22:13.415
can be deeply satisfying.

22:14.783 --> 22:18.053
When we’re faced 
with challenging assignments,

22:18.053 --> 22:22.624
reliance on Jehovah is of utmost importance.

22:22.624 --> 22:26.328
In what ways can we show that reliance?

22:26.328 --> 22:29.931
I have the pleasure of introducing you 
to a friend of mine,

22:29.931 --> 22:34.336
Shane Brady, who is presently serving 
along with his wife, Iolanda,

22:34.336 --> 22:36.505
at the branch in Finland.

22:36.505 --> 22:39.174
Brother Shane Brady and I 
previously worked together

22:39.174 --> 22:41.043
at the Canada branch.

22:41.043 --> 22:44.546
Shane has been involved 
in legally defending our brothers

22:44.546 --> 22:48.250
for the past 22 years in many countries,

22:48.250 --> 22:52.654
including Armenia, Kazakhstan, 
and Kyrgyzstan.

22:53.755 --> 22:57.092
Shane, it’s good to see you. 
How are you doing?

22:57.092 --> 22:59.661
I’m doing very well. 
It’s great to see you too, Mark.

22:59.661 --> 23:01.263
Shane, we want to ask you,

23:01.263 --> 23:03.432
What have been some of the challenges

23:03.432 --> 23:06.101
that you’ve faced 
in accepting these assignments

23:06.101 --> 23:08.236
in various countries in the world?

23:08.236 --> 23:11.606
Well, there certainly have been 
a few challenges.

23:11.606 --> 23:13.708
One is frequent travel.

23:13.708 --> 23:15.710
Another is language;

23:15.710 --> 23:18.914
each country that we assist 
has its own language.

23:18.914 --> 23:22.250
Some court cases are very stressful,

23:22.250 --> 23:25.187
and at times, we’ve faced firsthand

23:25.187 --> 23:27.322
the hatred of our opposers.

23:29.191 --> 23:31.726
Yes. And you know, Shane, 
in spite of all that,

23:31.726 --> 23:35.263
you and your wife have always been willing 
to go on these assignments.

23:35.263 --> 23:37.766
We appreciate your spirit so much.

23:37.766 --> 23:41.436
Is there an experience 
that you can share with us

23:41.436 --> 23:44.439
that would give us a taste 
of the kinds of situations

23:44.439 --> 23:46.641
that you’ve had to deal with 
in these countries?

23:46.641 --> 23:48.910
Well, there have been many experiences.

23:48.910 --> 23:50.912
But one experience comes to mind.

23:50.912 --> 23:54.049
A few months ago, 
there was a special pioneer,

23:54.049 --> 23:56.051
and a case was started against him.

23:56.051 --> 24:00.122
And if the decision was negative, 
it could have had very serious consequences

24:00.122 --> 24:02.124
for our work in that country.

24:02.124 --> 24:05.494
So we did our best 
to present a strong defense.

24:05.494 --> 24:07.362
But as the trial progressed,

24:07.362 --> 24:10.499
things didn’t seem to be going so well.

24:10.499 --> 24:14.102
But on the last day of the trial, 
everything changed.

24:14.102 --> 24:16.271
We presented a motion,

24:16.271 --> 24:19.608
and we asked the judge 
to terminate the case against the brother.

24:19.608 --> 24:22.277
Personally, I didn’t think 
it would actually work.

24:22.277 --> 24:24.513
But one older brother who we’ve worked with

24:24.513 --> 24:26.148
over the years always told us,

24:26.148 --> 24:28.416
“We need to give Jehovah something to bless.”

24:28.416 --> 24:33.421
And so we did, and the results 
were quite unexpected.

24:33.421 --> 24:36.691
When we made the motion, the judge turned 
to the prosecutor and asked,

24:36.691 --> 24:38.426
“Well, what’s your opinion?”

24:38.426 --> 24:41.863
And to our surprise, 
the prosecutor agreed with our request,

24:41.863 --> 24:43.932
and he even went beyond what we asked.

24:43.932 --> 24:46.735
He said to the judge 
that the government official

24:46.735 --> 24:49.938
that started the case 
against our brother should be punished.

24:49.938 --> 24:53.742
Well, the judge agreed; 
the case was terminated.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.144
When we were walking out of the courtroom,

24:56.144 --> 24:59.014
I looked at the other brothers with me 
and we all said the same thing,

24:59.014 --> 25:00.782
“What happened?”

25:00.782 --> 25:03.185
It was obvious
—Jehovah had intervened.

25:03.185 --> 25:05.554
That’s wonderful, Shane.

25:05.554 --> 25:08.123
I wish we had more time 
to hear many more experiences.

25:08.123 --> 25:10.692
But could you just share 
at least one more with us?

25:10.692 --> 25:12.460
Sure.

25:12.460 --> 25:16.565
In another land where our work 
is not recognized,

25:16.565 --> 25:19.901
on the night of the Memorial,
a number of the brothers were arrested

25:19.901 --> 25:23.138
for so-called illegal religious activity.

25:23.138 --> 25:25.140
They were all convicted at trial.

25:25.140 --> 25:28.376
So arrangements were made 
to appeal each of those cases,

25:28.376 --> 25:31.980
and they were heard 
before a different appeal court judge.

25:31.980 --> 25:36.318
What at first seemed quite negative, 
the loss at trial,

25:36.318 --> 25:38.753
turned out to be an amazing result.

25:38.753 --> 25:41.022
Let me give you just one example.

25:41.022 --> 25:44.092
In one of the appeals, 
as we were presenting the appeal,

25:44.092 --> 25:48.129
not long into the case, 
the appeal court judge stopped us,

25:48.129 --> 25:52.167
and he began to ask us 
many questions about the Bible

25:52.167 --> 25:54.269
and about what Jehovah’s Witnesses believe.

25:54.269 --> 25:57.672
So for quite some time, 
we answered these Biblical questions,

25:57.672 --> 25:59.674
and then the case continued.

25:59.674 --> 26:02.744
And then after some minutes, 
the judge stopped us again.

26:02.744 --> 26:06.214
And this time the judge said, 
“I remember reading in the Bible”—

26:06.214 --> 26:09.284
The judge said this, 
“I remember reading in the Bible

26:09.284 --> 26:12.654
“that Jesus said: 
‘If they have persecuted me,

26:12.654 --> 26:14.789
they will persecute you also.’”

26:14.789 --> 26:18.560
So we said to the judge: 
“Yes, indeed. Jesus said that.”

26:18.560 --> 26:21.963
The judge asked, 
“Do you think that’s the reason why

26:21.963 --> 26:25.200
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
are having problems in this region?”

26:25.200 --> 26:28.837
Well, what could we say 
but agree with the judge.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.272
But that wasn’t the end of it.

26:30.272 --> 26:34.509
As the case continued a few minutes more, 
the judge stopped us again.

26:34.509 --> 26:38.313
And this time the judge said: 
“You know, I’m not sure if Jesus said this.

26:38.313 --> 26:40.949
“It’s in the Bible where he said:

26:40.949 --> 26:43.618
“‘Where there are two or three 
gathered together,

26:43.618 --> 26:45.620
there I am in your midst.’”

26:45.620 --> 26:48.523
And we assured the judge, 
“Indeed, those are Jesus’ words.”

26:48.523 --> 26:51.026
The judge looked out at this old courtroom,

26:51.026 --> 26:53.828
which was filled 
with our brothers and sisters, and he said,

26:53.828 --> 26:57.699
“Well, Jesus must be in our midst today.”

26:57.699 --> 27:00.168
We felt like breaking into applause.

27:00.168 --> 27:02.170
At the end of the court hearing,

27:02.170 --> 27:04.506
the judge ruled in our favor 
and acquitted the brother,

27:04.506 --> 27:08.376
and the judges in all of the other cases 
also acquitted our brothers.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.645
It was just a thrilling experience!

27:10.645 --> 27:12.881
Oh, that’s wonderful; 
that’s wonderful, Shane.

27:12.881 --> 27:15.150
Thank you so much 
for sharing those experiences.

27:15.150 --> 27:18.720
You know, despite the challenges 
that you’ve had to face,

27:18.720 --> 27:22.524
how do you feel about the way 
you and Iolanda have benefited

27:22.524 --> 27:25.527
from being involved in accepting 
these challenging assignments

27:25.527 --> 27:27.529
in various parts of the world?

27:27.529 --> 27:31.433
Well, we have benefited 
in so many ways, Mark.

27:31.433 --> 27:34.836
Our relationship with Jehovah has deepened.

27:34.836 --> 27:36.838
Certainly, our trust in Jehovah

27:36.838 --> 27:39.074
has been strengthened.

27:39.074 --> 27:41.943
And we’ve experienced firsthand the love

27:41.943 --> 27:44.713
of the amazing worldwide brotherhood.

27:44.713 --> 27:46.781
Could I just share one experience about that?

27:46.781 --> 27:48.783
Please, please do.

27:48.783 --> 27:51.252
Two years ago, we were involved in a case

27:51.252 --> 27:54.823
where police had raided 
a congregation meeting in one country.

27:54.823 --> 27:58.059
They had brutally beaten the brothers 
and threatened the sisters.

27:58.059 --> 28:00.061
It was just terrible!

28:00.061 --> 28:02.364
Some weeks later in the court case

28:02.364 --> 28:04.933
that started against the brothers

28:04.933 --> 28:06.434
(that the police brought 
against the brothers),

28:06.434 --> 28:09.437
during that court case, 
the police repeatedly tried

28:09.437 --> 28:11.806
to arrest me and another brother 
I was working with.

28:11.806 --> 28:14.509
Over two days they were trying to arrest us.

28:14.509 --> 28:18.046
Even in the courthouse, 
they tried to detain and arrest us.

28:18.046 --> 28:22.684
And all through this, my wife, Iolanda, 
was watching what was happening.

28:22.684 --> 28:25.053
But do you know what was so remarkable?

28:25.053 --> 28:27.689
It was that despite the brutal treatment

28:27.689 --> 28:30.458
our brothers and sisters 
had endured just a few weeks earlier

28:30.458 --> 28:33.027
at the hands 
of these very same police officers,

28:33.027 --> 28:36.598
those dear brothers and sisters 
came to our aid.

28:36.598 --> 28:39.634
They were like a wall 
of protection around us,

28:39.634 --> 28:43.605
and they would not leave our side 
until the ordeal was done.

28:43.605 --> 28:46.007
It was love in action.

28:46.007 --> 28:49.277
So to answer your question, 
we have benefited in so many ways.

28:49.277 --> 28:54.282
We don’t regret for a moment 
accepting this thrilling assignment.

28:54.282 --> 28:57.051
Well, thank you so much, Shane.

28:57.051 --> 28:59.487
Please give our love to Iolanda as well.

28:59.487 --> 29:02.524
We appreciate the tremendous work 
that you’re accomplishing,

29:02.524 --> 29:05.293
and may Jehovah’s spirit 
continue to be with you.

29:05.293 --> 29:06.294
It’s our privilege.

29:06.294 --> 29:09.664
We look forward to continuing 
to work with you, Mark.

29:10.498 --> 29:13.501
Well, now, 
what if getting yourself out of a rut

29:13.501 --> 29:16.171
takes longer than expected?

29:16.171 --> 29:18.406
We’re going to meet a couple from Italy

29:18.406 --> 29:22.744
who had the goal to participate 
in a special preaching campaign.

29:22.744 --> 29:26.548
These campaigns 
can be a life-changing experience

29:26.548 --> 29:28.550
for the publishers involved,

29:28.550 --> 29:32.253
pushing them, sometimes, 
far out of their comfort zone.

29:32.253 --> 29:36.591
However, the Di Giacintos 
faced trying circumstances

29:36.591 --> 29:39.194
that prevented them from participating,

29:39.194 --> 29:43.565
but they did not stop knocking 
on this door of opportunity.

29:46.701 --> 29:50.505
We live in a beautiful, 
quiet town in central Italy,

29:50.505 --> 29:53.074
between the sea and the mountains.

29:53.074 --> 29:56.344
We have many friends, 
some of whom are good cooks.

29:59.814 --> 30:03.952
We have been serving for some years 
in a Romanian-language congregation,

30:03.952 --> 30:07.455
and we preach to people who have moved 
to Italy to seek a better life.

30:09.691 --> 30:11.759
When we heard the announcement 
about the special campaign,

30:11.759 --> 30:15.363
we looked at each other 
and said, “Let’s go!”

30:17.832 --> 30:20.735
‘A large door of activity’ 
was opening up to us.

30:25.473 --> 30:27.742
But there was a problem—my job.

30:27.742 --> 30:30.812
I would need a month’s leave of absence,

30:30.812 --> 30:32.881
and that would be difficult.

30:32.881 --> 30:35.083
We prayed, and we did research.

30:35.083 --> 30:38.453
And during family worship, 
we decided that in order to participate,

30:38.453 --> 30:41.556
I would ask for a one-month leave from work.

30:41.556 --> 30:44.859
But Jehovah had something else in mind

30:44.859 --> 30:47.195
that would create 
the right circumstances for us.

30:50.665 --> 30:53.201
When I arrived at work the next day, 
I found an unexpected situation.

30:54.002 --> 30:56.004
Because of the failing economy,

30:56.004 --> 30:58.039
my boss gave me and some other employees

30:58.039 --> 31:00.475
a letter of dismissal.

31:00.475 --> 31:02.477
I was not at all worried.

31:02.477 --> 31:04.412
I trusted in Jehovah,

31:04.412 --> 31:06.881
and I knew that this new situation

31:06.881 --> 31:10.518
would allow me 
to participate in the campaign.

31:12.820 --> 31:17.191
Participating in this campaign 
is a dream come true.

31:17.191 --> 31:20.628
We wanted to participate in 2013,

31:20.628 --> 31:24.999
but unfortunately things in life 
do not always go as we would like.

31:30.972 --> 31:34.909
We received some truly shocking news.

31:34.909 --> 31:38.212
My father had been diagnosed 
with pancreatic cancer.

31:39.247 --> 31:42.650
Emotionally, it was not easy.

31:42.650 --> 31:45.753
The tranquillity 
we had dreamed and hoped for

31:45.753 --> 31:49.557
was almost gone.

31:49.557 --> 31:52.860
The only thing that could help me 
at that moment was

31:52.860 --> 31:56.297
the hope for what Jehovah promises us.

31:56.297 --> 31:58.800
In addition to my father’s death,

31:58.800 --> 32:01.502
I began to experience panic attacks.

32:01.502 --> 32:06.374
I was afraid of something that didn’t exist

32:08.076 --> 32:13.014
—afraid of not being able to move on.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.283
It’s the kind of emotion 
that leaves a lump in your throat,

32:15.283 --> 32:17.285
and you can’t even breathe.

32:17.986 --> 32:20.221
I realized that only Jehovah

32:20.221 --> 32:24.959
could help me fill the void that I felt.

32:24.959 --> 32:26.928
After a family worship,

32:27.629 --> 32:30.865
Fabio and I decided to turn in 
our regular pioneer applications.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.802
I felt Jehovah at my side,

32:34.802 --> 32:37.772
embracing and supporting me.

32:37.772 --> 32:41.976
In the end, they turned out to be 
the three most beautiful years of our lives,

32:41.976 --> 32:46.514
which also allowed us 
to participate in this beautiful campaign.

32:48.449 --> 32:51.052
In Romania, there are 
many isolated territories

32:51.052 --> 32:54.389
that local brothers cannot work 
because of the great distances to be covered.

33:00.595 --> 33:03.031
It is really exciting to reach many people

33:03.031 --> 33:05.967
by traveling on dirt roads 
that are often muddy.

33:16.377 --> 33:19.681
The people are generous, 
hospitable, and genuine.

33:28.189 --> 33:30.658
They almost always invite us into their homes

33:30.658 --> 33:33.661
and are willing to talk to us.

33:38.733 --> 33:41.402
Talking to people who do not know Jehovah

33:41.402 --> 33:45.673
and who are still very much interested 
in doctrinal topics is really exciting.

33:51.913 --> 33:55.750
Experiencing firsthand 
a culture different from ours,

33:55.750 --> 33:58.553
seeing people who live a more simple life,

33:58.553 --> 34:00.922
and trying to understand their needs

34:00.922 --> 34:03.324
is an experience that we will take with us.

34:03.324 --> 34:06.561
And it will help us 
to preach more effectively

34:06.561 --> 34:10.431
in our assigned 
congregation’s territory in Italy.

34:17.739 --> 34:20.508
Now we are stronger than when we left home.

34:20.508 --> 34:24.545
This experience has made us 
love the ministry even more.

34:27.615 --> 34:31.953
We look forward to returning 
to our home territory with renewed zeal.

34:36.791 --> 34:40.528
We are certain that Jehovah will guide us 
to further service opportunities

34:40.528 --> 34:43.731
in order to help others know 
his wonderful purposes.

34:47.935 --> 34:50.371
What blessings did this couple experience

34:50.371 --> 34:53.207
by staying focused on their goal?

34:53.207 --> 34:56.444
It brought them the joy of full-time service.

34:56.444 --> 34:58.679
Not even the threat of unemployment

34:58.679 --> 35:02.683
caused them to waver 
in their determination to participate.

35:02.683 --> 35:06.521
After the campaign, 
they returned to their home territory

35:06.521 --> 35:10.024
with a renewed energy and zeal.

35:10.024 --> 35:12.794
When we stay focused on Jehovah,

35:12.794 --> 35:15.763
even in the most trying of circumstances,

35:15.763 --> 35:19.934
it will strengthen our resolve 
to serve him faithfully.

35:21.502 --> 35:25.339
Juuso and Pauliina Halme, 
a couple from Finland,

35:25.339 --> 35:28.676
now serving in Sierra Leone, 
in West Africa,

35:28.676 --> 35:31.279
were invited to accept an assignment

35:31.279 --> 35:33.614
that seemed overwhelming.

35:33.614 --> 35:38.419
What happened when some 
of their worst fears came true?

35:38.419 --> 35:42.256
How did Jehovah provide 
“the power beyond what is normal”

35:42.256 --> 35:45.526
to help them to endure?

35:46.794 --> 35:49.030
Worrying doesn’t help us.

35:49.030 --> 35:52.200
There is no need, really, 
to worry about what could happen.

35:52.200 --> 35:55.236
Even if it happens, let Jehovah show

35:55.236 --> 35:57.839
how he can handle the situation.

35:57.839 --> 36:02.777
He can actually do it in ways 
you could never expect.

36:02.777 --> 36:05.346
We are Juuso and Pauliina Halme.

36:05.346 --> 36:07.348
We loved our assignment 
in the Finland branch.

36:07.348 --> 36:10.284
We had wonderful friends.

36:10.284 --> 36:12.820
Our families, they were very close.

36:13.521 --> 36:16.390
We had time to be with them often.

36:16.390 --> 36:19.660
In 2014, we got the Yearbook

36:19.660 --> 36:23.064
and that had an account of Sierra Leone.

36:23.064 --> 36:25.199
And I was reading that account,

36:25.199 --> 36:27.735
and I remember saying 
a couple of times to Pauliina,

36:27.735 --> 36:29.871
“This would be a tough place.”

36:29.871 --> 36:32.773
After coming back from Gilead, 
I couldn’t believe it;

36:32.773 --> 36:35.476
we got a letter saying

36:35.476 --> 36:39.280
that we had been reassigned 
to Sierra Leone branch.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.283
And it was a huge change for us.

36:42.283 --> 36:45.553
Then what we did 
is we Googled Sierra Leone

36:45.553 --> 36:49.624
and what we saw was only about a civil war

36:49.624 --> 36:51.626
that took place years ago.

36:51.626 --> 36:55.897
An Ebola outbreak 
was starting in West Africa.

36:55.897 --> 36:58.633
Some of our relatives 
were worried about that.

36:58.633 --> 37:02.503
That was our impression, 
first impression, about the country.

37:02.503 --> 37:05.239
We were terrified, and we couldn’t sleep.

37:05.239 --> 37:07.241
We just prayed the whole night.

37:07.241 --> 37:11.913
And really, with the reassignment, 
our greatest fear was my father.

37:11.913 --> 37:15.149
He had been terminally ill 
for about two years,

37:15.149 --> 37:18.619
and we knew that at some point 
it would get worse.

37:18.619 --> 37:22.390
He would need more help 
and also Juuso’s mother.

37:22.390 --> 37:25.493
So were we able to travel back to Finland?

37:25.493 --> 37:28.796
It’s so expensive, 
and we didn’t have savings.

37:28.796 --> 37:31.065
Although we had all those fears,

37:31.065 --> 37:34.268
after praying about it a lot,

37:34.268 --> 37:37.171
we just realized 
that we could not say no.

37:37.171 --> 37:40.474
And we realized 
that this assignment was from Jehovah.

37:40.474 --> 37:42.743
Let’s go there.

37:42.743 --> 37:47.315
Let’s get to work. 
Let’s give our best to it.

37:47.315 --> 37:52.253
Then actually in three months, 
our greatest fear came true.

37:52.253 --> 37:54.255
It really happened

37:54.255 --> 37:57.558
that Juuso’s mom 
called us and she told us

37:57.558 --> 38:01.062
that Juuso’s father’s situation had changed.

38:01.062 --> 38:04.632
So we immediately started to check flights.

38:04.632 --> 38:07.301
And then the next call was

38:07.301 --> 38:10.371
that he had passed away.

38:11.806 --> 38:15.209
We were able to get flights, fly back home,

38:15.209 --> 38:18.312
support my mother, 
and help with the funeral.

38:18.312 --> 38:22.416
We were so happy 
when we finally got back to Sierra Leone.

38:22.416 --> 38:24.952
And now we thought that we could focus

38:24.952 --> 38:29.156
on our assignment and on our work at Bethel.

38:29.156 --> 38:32.860
Then one day, we got another 
Skype call from my father.

38:32.860 --> 38:35.029
And then he told us 
that he was diagnosed

38:35.029 --> 38:37.798
with an extremely aggressive cancer,

38:37.798 --> 38:41.202
and he’s in hospital now, 
and he asked us

38:41.202 --> 38:44.071
to come back to Finland for a visit.

38:46.173 --> 38:49.410
We had a beautiful ten days 
together with my father.

38:49.410 --> 38:52.213
Then, finally, he passed away.

38:52.213 --> 38:55.616
Yeah, that was really 
the lowest point in our life.

38:55.616 --> 38:59.286
That came out of the blue; 
we were not expecting it.

38:59.286 --> 39:02.156
We had two widows to take care of.

39:02.156 --> 39:04.492
So we were really wondering

39:04.492 --> 39:06.727
if we could continue 
in our assignment in Sierra Leone.

39:09.964 --> 39:12.533
At that time, 
one of our favorite scriptures was

39:12.533 --> 39:14.668
Isaiah 30:15

39:14.668 --> 39:19.340
that “your strength will be 
in keeping calm and showing trust.”

39:19.340 --> 39:23.644
And when we poured our hearts 
to Jehovah in prayer,

39:23.644 --> 39:28.516
we could see so well how Jehovah 
helped us to stay calm

39:28.516 --> 39:31.152
and have peace.

39:31.152 --> 39:34.321
And we got some good advice here 
from mature brothers

39:34.321 --> 39:36.791
not to make any quick decisions.

39:36.791 --> 39:40.628
So we put our trust in Jehovah, 
and we could just see

39:40.628 --> 39:45.232
that it was Jehovah’s will that we continue 
in our assignment in Sierra Leone.

39:45.232 --> 39:49.637
The fact is that, really, 
the blessings always

39:49.637 --> 39:52.406
surpass any of the challenges.

39:52.406 --> 39:56.610
And we have come to love 
our assignment in Sierra Leone.

39:56.610 --> 39:59.980
Our brothers and sisters, 
they are so faithful in Sierra Leone

39:59.980 --> 40:02.950
despite their problems and challenges.

40:02.950 --> 40:05.753
They give beautiful examples for us.

40:05.753 --> 40:09.790
Being in a country where there is a lot 
of potential, a lot of work, . . .

40:09.790 --> 40:13.194
. . . you can have as many Bible studies 
as you can conduct,

40:13.194 --> 40:16.263
so it’s just a preaching paradise.

40:16.263 --> 40:19.467
Going through these experiences,

40:19.467 --> 40:22.736
we are so happy that Jehovah 
is the Writer of our story.

40:22.736 --> 40:25.506
And, for sure, 
there’s a happy end.

40:25.506 --> 40:28.476
If he wants to take you there, go there;

40:28.476 --> 40:30.945
see what Jehovah 
has in mind for you.

40:30.945 --> 40:35.149
And then you can really 
“taste and see that Jehovah is good.”

40:37.818 --> 40:40.354
Despite heartbreaking challenges,

40:40.354 --> 40:43.591
the Halmes saw Jehovah’s loving support

40:43.591 --> 40:46.360
and they did not give up!

40:46.360 --> 40:49.330
When we extend ourselves for Jehovah,

40:49.330 --> 40:53.434
we can be confident 
that he will help us in good times

40:53.434 --> 40:55.636
and in difficult times.

40:55.636 --> 40:59.640
We learn that we are safe 
with Jehovah, come what may.

41:00.741 --> 41:04.812
What quality do you need 
to serve in a foreign land,

41:04.812 --> 41:07.281
like Brother and Sister Di Giacinto,

41:07.281 --> 41:12.219
or to face the fear of the unknown, 
like Brother and Sister Halme?

41:12.219 --> 41:14.989
We need courage.

41:14.989 --> 41:17.324
As was announced last year,

41:17.324 --> 41:21.262
courage is 
this year’s regional convention theme.

41:21.262 --> 41:25.266
The drama presentation 
will focus on a Bible character

41:25.266 --> 41:29.703
that needed great courage 
to accomplish his ministry.

41:29.703 --> 41:34.074
It’s our pleasure 
to present a preview of the drama

41:34.074 --> 41:40.080
The Story of Jonah 
—A Lesson in Courage and Mercy.

41:44.218 --> 41:46.620
Papa says you are a prophet.

41:46.620 --> 41:48.722
I was a prophet.

41:50.491 --> 41:52.726
I tried to run away from Jehovah.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.896
But when has Jehovah ever asked a prophet

41:55.896 --> 41:57.998
to go to a foreign land

41:57.998 --> 42:00.000
to preach judgment against it?

42:01.769 --> 42:03.737
What about the people?

42:03.737 --> 42:05.306
They worship gods of war.

42:05.306 --> 42:07.374
What do you think they’re like?

42:14.982 --> 42:17.084
So, what will you do now?

42:19.887 --> 42:21.922
You need to go back inside, Joanna.

42:21.922 --> 42:23.290
No! We can talk to Father!

42:23.290 --> 42:24.124
Joanna!

42:24.124 --> 42:25.426
I can’t go to Nineveh.

42:25.426 --> 42:26.660
I just can’t do it.

42:26.660 --> 42:27.661
You’re Jehovah’s prophet.

42:28.462 --> 42:29.463
Not anymore.

42:30.531 --> 42:32.633
Go home, Joanna.

42:49.817 --> 42:51.118
O Jehovah,

42:52.253 --> 42:54.288
out of the depths of the Grave,

42:54.288 --> 42:57.324
I cry to you for help.

43:01.729 --> 43:03.797
What will become of me?

43:09.770 --> 43:14.608
No doubt you eagerly anticipate 
this year’s regional convention program

43:14.608 --> 43:17.478
held around the world starting this month.

43:18.646 --> 43:21.582
Many of the segments on our program thus far

43:21.582 --> 43:25.586
have featured some aspect 
of preaching in a foreign land.

43:25.586 --> 43:29.857
If current circumstances 
don’t permit you to serve in this capacity,

43:29.857 --> 43:32.359
be assured that there’s much you can do

43:32.359 --> 43:35.996
in your home territory 
to revive your ministry.

43:35.996 --> 43:37.665
For example—

43:37.665 --> 43:42.036
Out of the over 100,000 publishers 
in South Korea,

43:42.036 --> 43:46.840
there are more than 
40,000 zealous regular pioneers.

43:46.840 --> 43:48.842
What efforts have they made

43:48.842 --> 43:52.346
to reach more people 
in frequently worked territory?

43:52.346 --> 43:54.348
Let’s find out.

43:55.949 --> 43:59.586
I started pioneering 
less than a year after I got baptized,

43:59.586 --> 44:01.155
so I was eager to sharpen

44:01.155 --> 44:02.623
my preaching skills.

44:02.623 --> 44:05.392
I really wanted to share my hope with others.

44:05.392 --> 44:07.227
But it’s so hard to meet people

44:07.227 --> 44:08.896
at their homes during the day.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.731
And even if we do meet them,

44:10.731 --> 44:14.134
it’s not easy to start a conversation.

44:14.134 --> 44:16.837
Our congregation organized 
convenience store witnessing

44:16.837 --> 44:19.340
from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m.,

44:19.340 --> 44:22.242
so I thought this might be 
a good way to reach people

44:22.242 --> 44:23.911
and have meaningful conversations.

44:25.813 --> 44:27.915
But the thing is that I’m not 
a morning person,

44:27.915 --> 44:30.584
so getting up early was not easy.

44:31.251 --> 44:33.987
So I had to make some adjustments.

44:33.987 --> 44:35.656
I tried not to make plans

44:35.656 --> 44:40.260
or to stay up late the night before.

44:40.260 --> 44:44.631
The sample presentations 
from our meetings were also very helpful.

44:45.999 --> 44:50.270
In the past, I hardly got the chance 
to open the Bible while I was preaching,

44:50.270 --> 44:53.540
but now I have a few Bible studies.

44:55.275 --> 44:58.746
Even the time we spend traveling 
from one convenience store to the next

44:58.746 --> 45:02.549
is very uplifting spiritually 
because we use that time

45:02.549 --> 45:05.586
to share our preaching skills 
and build each other up.

45:05.586 --> 45:08.555
Having a regular share 
in convenience store witnessing

45:08.555 --> 45:12.092
has allowed me to be 
more productive in the ministry.

45:12.092 --> 45:14.628
I feel like I’m progressing spiritually

45:14.628 --> 45:18.799
and becoming a better minister 
of the good news.

45:18.799 --> 45:22.636
On weekdays, I work to support my family.

45:22.636 --> 45:25.105
So I would usually go out in field service

45:25.105 --> 45:27.274
on the weekends.

45:27.274 --> 45:30.177
But it wasn’t easy 
to find people at their homes

45:30.177 --> 45:33.380
because they usually make plans and go out.

45:33.380 --> 45:35.082
And you know,

45:35.082 --> 45:37.618
it’s hard to get excited 
about the preaching work

45:37.618 --> 45:40.053
when you’re not meeting many people.

45:40.053 --> 45:43.357
I wanted to set 
a good example for my family,

45:43.357 --> 45:47.861
but I found it a real challenge 
to maintain my zeal for the ministry.

45:49.129 --> 45:52.833
So I began to regularly participate 
in evening witnessing

45:52.833 --> 45:57.237
on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays.

45:57.237 --> 46:00.474
I usually get off work around 5:00 p.m.

46:00.474 --> 46:02.843
After a long day at work,

46:02.843 --> 46:04.778
it’s not always easy to get dressed

46:04.778 --> 46:07.781
to go out in the field ministry.

46:07.781 --> 46:10.551
But I kept up with my return visits

46:10.551 --> 46:13.287
and had some really encouraging experiences.

46:13.287 --> 46:16.256
A young man I had been visiting

46:16.256 --> 46:19.760
accepted a Bible study, 
and he’s making fine progress.

46:19.760 --> 46:23.997
My children are able to see 
how much joy I get from the ministry,

46:23.997 --> 46:27.468
and so now they too 
are able to give a bold witness

46:27.468 --> 46:30.137
in their own words, 
even in the face of opposition.

46:31.505 --> 46:34.174
I am very proud of my children.

46:34.174 --> 46:36.543
Training and teaching them how to make

46:36.543 --> 46:39.012
effective return visits and Bible studies

46:39.012 --> 46:41.715
brings me great joy.

46:41.715 --> 46:44.117
We serve in a small rural town

46:44.117 --> 46:46.954
where many leave home 
early in the morning to work in the field,

46:46.954 --> 46:48.956
and they return late at night.

46:48.956 --> 46:50.357
So it’s not easy

46:50.357 --> 46:52.726
to find people at home during the daytime.

46:52.726 --> 46:55.128
And even if we do find them at their doors,

46:55.128 --> 46:57.965
it’s not easy to develop 
a meaningful Bible-based conversation,

46:57.965 --> 47:02.603
let alone make return visits 
and conduct Bible studies with them.

47:02.603 --> 47:05.239
After returning home 
from preaching at night,

47:05.239 --> 47:07.174
I would ask myself,

47:07.174 --> 47:08.876
‘Did I have a meaningful share 
in the ministry today?’

47:10.644 --> 47:12.646
It’s a small rural town.

47:12.646 --> 47:14.982
So many people are concerned 
about what their neighbors

47:14.982 --> 47:17.017
would think if they talked with us.

47:17.885 --> 47:21.989
So even those who were interested 
in learning more about the Bible

47:21.989 --> 47:25.826
were reluctant to have 
Bible discussions with us.

47:25.826 --> 47:29.263
It was really unfortunate.

47:29.263 --> 47:33.133
We tried to figure out 
the right time to call on people,

47:33.133 --> 47:37.371
and we found out 
that many householders are more relaxed

47:37.371 --> 47:39.806
and willing to talk about the Bible

47:39.806 --> 47:44.311
if we visit them 
around nine or ten o’clock in the evening.

47:45.212 --> 47:48.715
I gave much thought 
on how I could help my Bible students

47:48.715 --> 47:51.618
have a regular intake of spiritual food.

47:51.618 --> 47:55.422
One of my students 
worked from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m.,

47:55.422 --> 47:58.025
so I asked her if we could arrange

47:58.025 --> 48:00.027
to study early in the morning.

48:00.027 --> 48:02.029
She agreed.

48:02.029 --> 48:04.164
I often tell my Bible students,

48:04.164 --> 48:07.734
‘Just call me whenever you have 
a little time to talk.’

48:08.869 --> 48:12.539
When I get those calls, 
no matter what time it is,

48:12.539 --> 48:15.275
it’s time to rush out that door.

48:17.177 --> 48:20.647
There was one elderly lady 
who was in her early 80’s

48:20.647 --> 48:24.151
who had attended church all her life.

48:24.151 --> 48:26.186
To accommodate her needs,

48:26.186 --> 48:30.324
I visited her 
around nine or ten o’clock in the evening

48:30.324 --> 48:32.826
for our Bible studies.

48:34.595 --> 48:37.297
I would come home 
feeling tired and hungry,

48:37.297 --> 48:39.466
but the satisfaction of knowing

48:39.466 --> 48:41.902
that I’ve helped her learn 
more about the truth

48:41.902 --> 48:45.405
enables me to maintain my joy.

48:47.107 --> 48:50.644
Now I am able to conduct 
about 12 Bible studies.

48:50.644 --> 48:55.215
I try to “become all things 
to people of all sorts”

48:55.215 --> 48:57.918
in order to look after their needs.

48:57.918 --> 49:00.320
And it brings me great satisfaction and joy

49:00.320 --> 49:02.322
to see my studies make progress

49:02.322 --> 49:04.324
because that’s really how Jehovah wants us

49:04.324 --> 49:07.327
to be carrying out our ministry.

49:10.831 --> 49:15.068
You might feel that you’ve worked 
every corner of your home territory.

49:15.068 --> 49:19.973
But just like a literal fisherman 
adapts to the time when the fish are biting,

49:19.973 --> 49:23.310
we need to work when people can be found.

49:23.310 --> 49:27.214
Cast your nets into productive waters!

49:27.214 --> 49:31.551
Our sister arranged her schedule 
to call on her Bible student

49:31.551 --> 49:34.187
at nine or ten in the evening.

49:34.187 --> 49:36.423
Of course, we want to use good judgment

49:36.423 --> 49:41.194
to call at times that are both practical 
and safe for our territory.

49:41.194 --> 49:45.298
But by being adaptable in when, where,

49:45.298 --> 49:47.734
or how we preach the good news,

49:47.734 --> 49:52.406
we may yield good results like those 
of our fellow Witnesses in South Korea.

49:53.140 --> 49:57.678
This will help us to have 
a meaningful share in the all-important work

49:57.678 --> 50:02.516
of finding those who 
are “rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

50:04.284 --> 50:07.487
Regular pioneers work in a powerful way

50:07.487 --> 50:11.992
to help their brothers and sisters 
get the most out of their ministry.

50:11.992 --> 50:15.996
But does that mean 
that they’re impervious to being in a rut,

50:15.996 --> 50:18.031
as mentioned earlier?

50:18.031 --> 50:20.434
In the following dramatization,

50:20.434 --> 50:23.837
see how one pioneer sister comes to realize

50:23.837 --> 50:27.774
the need to adjust her approach 
to the field ministry.

50:42.689 --> 50:45.792
It was really nice of Maria 
to invite me in service.

50:49.096 --> 50:51.665
But I already have plans with Sarah.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.476
We have similar service schedules,

51:02.476 --> 51:05.712
and we really enjoy working together.

51:14.387 --> 51:17.224
I try to get most of my time 
during the week, . . .

51:21.061 --> 51:23.029
Anyone made plans to work together?

51:23.029 --> 51:26.733
. . . though I do meet with the group 
sometimes on Saturday.

51:26.733 --> 51:29.836
Sister Martin, 
can you work with Rachel today?

51:32.839 --> 51:34.341
Thanks, everyone.

51:34.341 --> 51:36.643
Anyone made plans to work together?

51:38.879 --> 51:42.149
OK. 
Joanna, you can work with Sarah.

51:48.855 --> 51:50.857
Anyone made plans to work together?

51:50.857 --> 51:52.092
Sarah, do you want to go with me 
to a Bible study?

51:52.092 --> 51:53.026
Could I work with Alisha?

51:53.026 --> 51:54.394
Uh-huh.

51:54.394 --> 51:55.729
OK, let’s work together.

51:55.729 --> 51:57.430
Joanna, could you two work together, please?

51:57.430 --> 51:59.866
Um, I’d love to.

51:59.866 --> 52:01.868
But I’ve just arranged to work with Sarah.

52:01.868 --> 52:02.903
I’m so sorry.

52:02.903 --> 52:06.239
Uh-huh. 
No problem.

52:06.239 --> 52:08.875
Maria, could you work with this sister?

52:29.062 --> 52:31.932
While doing my Bible reading that night,

52:31.932 --> 52:33.800
I was really affected

52:33.800 --> 52:38.438
by the words found 
at 2 Corinthians 6:12, 13:

52:38.438 --> 52:42.709
“You are restricted 
in your own tender affections . . .

52:42.709 --> 52:45.846
Open your hearts wide.”

52:50.283 --> 52:52.886
It struck me that some in the congregation

52:52.886 --> 52:55.555
missed out on a beautiful blessing

52:55.555 --> 52:59.392
by drawing away from the apostle Paul.

53:01.928 --> 53:05.565
I realized I was limiting my joy as well

53:06.633 --> 53:10.003
by not working with more in the ministry.

53:10.003 --> 53:13.306
I was going through the motions 
of pioneering,

53:13.306 --> 53:16.509
but I was stuck in the same routine.

53:16.509 --> 53:18.311
How are you, Maria?

53:18.311 --> 53:19.913
Good. And you?

53:19.913 --> 53:20.914
Let me ask you something.

53:20.914 --> 53:23.016
Could you join me on a Bible study Saturday?

53:23.016 --> 53:24.117
Oh, I’d love that! Uh-huh.

53:24.117 --> 53:24.918
That’s great.

53:24.918 --> 53:26.653
So later we’ll make the arrangements. OK?

53:26.653 --> 53:27.988
The meeting is starting.

53:27.988 --> 53:29.489
We’d like to invite everyone 
to take your seats

53:29.489 --> 53:30.490
because our meeting is about to begin.

53:36.863 --> 53:41.701
My student liked Maria and Isabelle so much.

53:41.701 --> 53:44.271
I really learned a lot from them.

53:50.310 --> 53:53.313
I started going out regularly 
on the weekends . . .

53:55.315 --> 53:57.884
Anyone made plans to work together?

53:57.884 --> 54:02.589
. . . and working with different ones 
in the ministry.

54:04.057 --> 54:06.826
And I learned more about Sister Martin

54:06.826 --> 54:09.296
after one day in the ministry

54:09.296 --> 54:14.000
than I had in years 
of seeing her at meetings.

54:14.000 --> 54:18.004
Sarah and I still enjoy working together.

54:18.004 --> 54:21.574
But I’ve found that by working 
with a variety of friends,

54:21.574 --> 54:25.578
my own joy has increased.

54:37.057 --> 54:42.062
I’m so glad I ‘opened my heart wide.’

54:48.368 --> 54:52.372
Joanna came to realize 
that her privilege of full-time service

54:52.372 --> 54:55.675
was more than just hours and a schedule.

54:55.675 --> 54:59.012
By working with a variety 
of sisters in the ministry

54:59.012 --> 55:01.481
and supporting her field service group,

55:01.481 --> 55:04.884
she could strengthen and encourage others.

55:04.884 --> 55:07.487
It was within her power to help.

55:07.487 --> 55:09.622
But with what result?

55:09.622 --> 55:12.592
It rejuvenated her ministry!

55:12.592 --> 55:17.597
We truly appreciate 
the love and sacrifice of our pioneers.

55:18.565 --> 55:22.736
Have you been inspired 
to make a change in your ministry?

55:22.736 --> 55:26.573
Whether big or small, 
at home or abroad,

55:26.573 --> 55:29.242
we can find the satisfaction that comes

55:29.242 --> 55:32.178
from reinvigorating our ministry.

55:32.178 --> 55:35.548
That’s the theme featured 
in the music video entitled

55:35.548 --> 55:38.118
I’m Making a Change.

55:45.658 --> 55:53.199
Been thinking it over—
Each day it seems

55:53.199 --> 56:01.107
My serving Jehovah 
Falls into the same routine.

56:01.107 --> 56:06.413
The things that I’m doing now 
I’ve always done.

56:06.413 --> 56:14.054
So it’s clear that I need to break out—
Out of my comfort zone.

56:14.054 --> 56:21.728
Now I’m making a change starting from today. 
I’m turning a page, yes, I’m on my way.

56:21.728 --> 56:32.338
Jehovah, I see what I need to do. 
I’m changing direction and trusting in you.

56:45.485 --> 56:53.193
It’s gonna take courage, 
But now I see

56:53.193 --> 57:00.100
How changing my thinking 
Renews and refreshes me.

57:00.100 --> 57:06.673
I’m trying some new things, 
and I’m energized.

57:06.673 --> 57:13.646
There were doors that were opening wide, 
But I never realized.

57:13.646 --> 57:21.788
So I’m making a change, and I’m on my way. 
I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day.

57:21.788 --> 57:32.465
Jehovah, I see what I need to do. 
I’m changing direction and trusting in you.

57:45.678 --> 57:52.986
Back then, I remember when 
It seemed it wouldn’t happen.

57:52.986 --> 58:00.693
Some days, well, I have to say, 
I didn’t know why.

58:00.693 --> 58:08.301
But now I can see just how 
My boldness led to blessings.

58:08.301 --> 58:15.875
I’m sure there’ll be many more 
As time goes rolling by.

58:15.875 --> 58:23.983
Now I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day. 
I’m making some changes along the way.

58:23.983 --> 58:31.424
Jehovah, I saw what I had to do, 
And you gave me your blessing

58:31.424 --> 58:36.696
for trusting in you.

58:38.631 --> 58:46.673
So I’m making a change starting from today. 
I’m turning a page, yes, I’m on my way.

58:46.673 --> 58:53.947
Jehovah, I see what I need to do. 
I’m changing direction.

58:53.947 --> 59:01.621
So I’m making a change, and I’m on my way. 
I’m turning a page each and ev’ry day.

59:01.621 --> 59:08.995
Jehovah, I see what I need to do. 
I’m changing direction

59:08.995 --> 59:12.365
and trusting in you—

59:17.003 --> 59:21.608
Trusting in you.

59:43.896 --> 59:48.901
The Governing Body deeply appreciates 
the work of each Kingdom publisher.

59:48.901 --> 59:51.137
You dear brothers and sisters

59:51.137 --> 59:54.007
are having a regular share 
in the preaching work,

59:54.007 --> 59:56.509
and we commend you for that.

59:56.509 --> 1:00:00.446
You can be sure 
that “God is not unrighteous

1:00:00.446 --> 1:00:05.118
so as to forget your work 
and the love you showed for his name,”

1:00:05.118 --> 1:00:09.822
as the Bible says at Hebrews 6:10.

1:00:09.822 --> 1:00:14.827
Just knowing that can help us 
to take a fresh look at our ministry

1:00:14.827 --> 1:00:19.599
and can invigorate us 
to participate to the fullest extent.

1:00:19.599 --> 1:00:20.933
To conclude,

1:00:20.933 --> 1:00:22.935
we bring you greetings

1:00:22.935 --> 1:00:26.205
from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

1:00:26.205 --> 1:00:29.075
This mountainous region has a rich history

1:00:29.075 --> 1:00:31.210
as a traditional meeting place

1:00:31.210 --> 1:00:33.713
between eastern and western cultures;

1:00:33.713 --> 1:00:36.549
it dates from the Middle Ages.

1:00:36.549 --> 1:00:40.186
Because of the diverse religious beliefs 
within the country,

1:00:40.186 --> 1:00:43.423
the 1,160 publishers

1:00:43.423 --> 1:00:46.492
must adapt their preaching methods

1:00:46.492 --> 1:00:49.395
to appeal to the hearts of those who listen.

1:00:49.395 --> 1:00:51.664
This is the city of Mostar,

1:00:51.664 --> 1:00:54.233
which sits on the Neretva River.

1:00:54.233 --> 1:00:55.935
The Neretva River

1:00:55.935 --> 1:00:58.838
flows for nearly 230 kilometers,

1:00:58.838 --> 1:01:00.940
or almost 143 miles.

1:01:02.275 --> 1:01:05.945
Mostar was a former front line 
during the wars of the 1990’s,

1:01:07.113 --> 1:01:09.482
and many buildings still bear the marks

1:01:09.482 --> 1:01:12.919
of the intense fighting that took place.

1:01:12.919 --> 1:01:17.090
Likewise, the aftermath 
left many people in this region

1:01:17.090 --> 1:01:19.892
with emotional and mental scars.

1:01:19.892 --> 1:01:22.829
Our brothers and sisters are working hard

1:01:22.829 --> 1:01:24.897
to bring the hope of something good

1:01:24.897 --> 1:01:28.167
to those in need.

1:01:28.167 --> 1:01:33.072
In the 1930’s, 
a pioneer brother named Alfred Tuček

1:01:33.072 --> 1:01:37.210
spearheaded the preaching work 
in the city of Mostar.

1:01:37.210 --> 1:01:41.881
He was actually one of the first 
in the former Yugoslavia to pioneer.

1:01:41.881 --> 1:01:45.785
Today, the congregation in Mostar 
has about 60 publishers,

1:01:47.019 --> 1:01:51.424
including nine pioneers 
and four field missionaries.

1:01:51.424 --> 1:01:54.427
They bring their warm love and greetings

1:01:54.427 --> 1:01:57.330
to all of us around the world!

1:01:57.330 --> 1:01:59.899
This is JW Broadcasting

1:01:59.899 --> 1:02:10.436
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
