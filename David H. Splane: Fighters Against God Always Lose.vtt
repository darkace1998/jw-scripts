00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:03.315 line:10% position:50% align:center
An outstanding fact

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:07.570 line:10% position:50% align:center
is recorded at Isaiah 55:10, 11:

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:13.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For just as the rain and the snow
pour down from heaven

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:17.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not return there
until they saturate the earth,

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:19.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“making it produce and sprout,

00:00:19.623 --> 00:00:23.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“giving seed to the sower
and bread to the eater,

00:00:23.294 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now notice this]

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:30.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so my word [my word]

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that goes out of my mouth will be.

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:36.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will not return to me without results,

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but it will certainly accomplish

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:41.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
whatever is my delight.”

00:00:41.854 --> 00:00:45.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word of God
is the statement of his purpose.

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:50.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it can be delivered orally
or in writing.

00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:54.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
We call the Bible God’s written Word,
and rightly so.

00:00:54.992 --> 00:00:57.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
But long before writing was invented,

00:00:57.244 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah expressed his purpose in words.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And God said: ‘Let there be light.’

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then there was light.”

00:01:06.712 --> 00:01:08.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through Isaiah, Jehovah is telling us

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:12.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will always accomplish his purpose.

00:01:12.092 --> 00:01:16.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no matter how powerful fighters
against that purpose seem to be,

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:20.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will always lose in the end.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remembering that will help us when we’re

00:01:22.603 --> 00:01:25.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
faced with opposers who seem unbeatable.

00:01:25.564 --> 00:01:30.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I thought we might consider some
Bible examples that illustrate the point.

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take the days of King Saul, for example.

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jehovah sent Samuel

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:38.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anoint the next king of Israel.

00:01:38.702 --> 00:01:41.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as recorded at 1 Samuel 16:1,

00:01:41.664 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
God said to Samuel:

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:47.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite,

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because I have selected
from among his sons

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
a king for myself.”

00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:55.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul’s replacement turned out to be David.

00:01:55.052 --> 00:01:57.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was Jehovah’s choice.

00:01:57.554 --> 00:02:00.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
At some point, Saul himself understood that.

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:03.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, according to 1 Samuel 23:17,

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:06.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
his son Jonathan said to David:

00:02:06.063 --> 00:02:09.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will be king over Israel, . . .

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my father Saul also knows that.”

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:18.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Confirming this, on one occasion
Saul said to David:

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:22.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I know that you will surely rule as king.”

00:02:22.621 --> 00:02:26.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
In spite of it all, Saul tried to kill David.

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:29.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had the support of a powerful army.

00:02:29.211 --> 00:02:32.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul himself was apparently a very strong man.

00:02:32.798 --> 00:02:37.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, it was God’s will
for David to become king,

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Saul knew it.

00:02:39.722 --> 00:02:44.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we ask: Why did Saul keep on fighting?

00:02:44.768 --> 00:02:47.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whom was he fighting, really?

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:49.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not just David.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was fighting against God.

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:57.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul was setting himself up for failure.

00:02:57.197 --> 00:03:00.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt Satan was egging Saul on.

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:05.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Satan could cause
just one of Jehovah’s promises to fail—

00:03:05.247 --> 00:03:08.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the end, the word of God prevailed.

00:03:08.792 --> 00:03:10.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
David became king.

00:03:13.422 --> 00:03:17.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, who would replace David
when the time came?

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was also Jehovah’s decision to make,
and he made it.

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:23.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to 1 Chronicles 22:9, 10,

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:25.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told David:

00:03:25.267 --> 00:03:27.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! You will have a son . . .

00:03:27.853 --> 00:03:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Solomon will be his name

00:03:30.522 --> 00:03:32.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and . . . I will firmly establish the throne

00:03:32.858 --> 00:03:36.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his kingship over Israel forever.”

00:03:36.528 --> 00:03:40.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Solomon would be the next king of Israel.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who could prevent that from happening?

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:47.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
David’s son Adonijah tried and failed.

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:03:49.374 --> 00:03:52.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
As quoted at 1 Kings 2:15, he later admitted:

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:56.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The kingship eluded me
and became my brother’s,

00:03:56.173 --> 00:04:00.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
for it was from Jehovah that it became his.”

00:04:00.552 --> 00:04:04.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Adonijah thought
he could outmaneuver Jehovah,

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was sadly mistaken.

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised the Israelites

00:04:09.603 --> 00:04:13.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would give them
the land of Canaan as an inheritance.

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:15.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Canaanites had other ideas.

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:18.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had heard of Jehovah’s powerful works
in Egypt,

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they fought against him anyway.

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
They learned.

00:04:22.116 --> 00:04:24.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
They learned at their cost

00:04:24.118 --> 00:04:27.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fighters against God always lose.

00:04:28.997 --> 00:04:31.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you were asked to name
some prominent fighters

00:04:31.917 --> 00:04:34.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
against God in Jesus’ day,

00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:37.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might think of King Herod the Great,

00:04:37.631 --> 00:04:40.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jewish High Priest Caiaphas,

00:04:40.134 --> 00:04:43.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate.

00:04:43.804 --> 00:04:46.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about them.

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Herod the Great.

00:04:48.433 --> 00:04:53.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Matthew 2:1, 2.

00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:58.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, astrologers visit King Herod,

00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:01.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they ask a strange question.

00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:02.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read:

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:06.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After Jesus had been born
in Bethlehem of Judea

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the days of Herod the king, look!

00:05:09.413 --> 00:05:11.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“astrologers from the East
came to Jerusalem,

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:16.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“saying:
‘Where is the one born king of the Jews?

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:19.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘[king of the Jews?]

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For we saw his star
when we were in the East,

00:05:22.342 --> 00:05:25.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have come to do obeisance to him.’”

00:05:26.054 --> 00:05:28.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice something strange here?

00:05:28.891 --> 00:05:31.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
No angel had spoken to those astrologers,

00:05:31.935 --> 00:05:34.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet when the men saw a light in heaven,

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:38.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
they concluded that it signaled
the birth of the “king of the Jews.”

00:05:38.734 --> 00:05:40.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a stretch!

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:43.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who do you suppose
put that idea in their head?

00:05:43.989 --> 00:05:46.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who do you suppose
gave them the bright idea

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ask the present king of Israel
about his future rival?

00:05:51.663 --> 00:05:54.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
That has Satan the Devil written all over it,
doesn’t it?

00:05:54.791 --> 00:05:57.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice verses 3 and 4:

00:05:58.587 --> 00:06:02.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At hearing this, King Herod was agitated,

00:06:02.174 --> 00:06:04.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all Jerusalem with him.

00:06:04.176 --> 00:06:08.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On gathering together all the chief priests
and scribes of the people,

00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:11.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he inquired of them where

00:06:11.308 --> 00:06:14.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Christ was to be born.”

00:06:14.895 --> 00:06:16.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interesting!

00:06:16.772 --> 00:06:21.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Herod doesn’t just ask where
the future “king of the Jews” will be born;

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:25.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
he asks “where the Christ [will] be born.”

00:06:25.155 --> 00:06:27.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as a Jewish proselyte,

00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:30.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s supposed to be waiting for the Christ,
the Messiah.

00:06:30.494 --> 00:06:33.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, now that the Messiah has come,

00:06:33.163 --> 00:06:35.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Herod wants to kill him.

00:06:35.666 --> 00:06:39.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Herod is fighting against God.

00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:40.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he win?

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:42.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:44.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus escapes his clutches.

00:06:44.258 --> 00:06:47.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a few months later, Herod himself dies.

00:06:47.719 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Few mourn his death.

00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:54.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jesus’ day, the Jewish high priests

00:06:54.434 --> 00:06:58.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
were appointed and removed by the Romans.

00:06:58.313 --> 00:07:01.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, High Priest Caiaphas
was a skilled politician.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:03.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew how to please the Romans.

00:07:03.944 --> 00:07:08.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of that, he hung on to his job
a lot longer than many others.

00:07:08.782 --> 00:07:13.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had a powerful supporter,
Pontius Pilate.

00:07:13.537 --> 00:07:18.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
With his connections,
Caiaphas seemed untouchable.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate himself was very well-connected.

00:07:21.378 --> 00:07:24.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a good friend in high places in Rome:

00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:27.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lucius Sejanus.

00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:30.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe you’ve never heard
of Sejanus before,

00:07:30.304 --> 00:07:34.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was probably the most powerful man
in the Roman Empire.

00:07:34.516 --> 00:07:38.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
The emperor left most of the major decisions
to Sejanus.

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:42.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he made many enemies,
but they were powerless against him

00:07:42.607 --> 00:07:47.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
until—until—the fall of 31 C.E.

00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:53.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time,
Sejanus got on the wrong side of the emperor

00:07:53.118 --> 00:07:55.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was put to death.

00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:57.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that,

00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:01.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
the emperor commanded
that anyone who had been friends

00:08:01.793 --> 00:08:05.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Sejanus was to be executed.

00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:09.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you think Pilate felt?

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:12.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
He must have been a nervous wreck!

00:08:12.012 --> 00:08:16.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we said, he and Sejanus
had been very close.

00:08:16.475 --> 00:08:21.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, a year and a half
after Sejanus was executed,

00:08:21.355 --> 00:08:24.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do you suppose Pilate was thinking

00:08:24.775 --> 00:08:26.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Jewish rulers cried out,

00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:31.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If you release Jesus,
you are no friend of Caesar’?

00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:35.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some scholars believe that this was a factor

00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Pilate’s decision
to order Jesus’ execution

00:08:38.705 --> 00:08:40.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to protect his own job.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he protect it?

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:44.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:08:44.711 --> 00:08:47.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate wasn’t immediately
struck by lightning.

00:08:47.255 --> 00:08:50.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
But less than four years
after he sentenced Jesus to death,

00:08:50.884 --> 00:08:54.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
he got into big trouble
and was recalled to Rome.

00:08:54.846 --> 00:08:57.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
With no powerful friend to defend him,

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate was removed as Roman governor.

00:09:01.186 --> 00:09:03.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened next isn’t clear.

00:09:03.605 --> 00:09:06.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some say Pilate committed suicide.

00:09:06.233 --> 00:09:08.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others say he was banished.

00:09:08.902 --> 00:09:11.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever happened, it wasn’t good.

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:17.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Pilate lost his job,
Caiaphas lost his protector

00:09:17.119 --> 00:09:20.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
and soon he was removed as high priest.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:23.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, two fighters against God,

00:09:23.333 --> 00:09:26.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate and Caiaphas, were dispatched

00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:29.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
soon after they committed
their greatest crime.

00:09:31.425 --> 00:09:35.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
We certainly don’t want to be fighters
against Jehovah God.

00:09:35.429 --> 00:09:39.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we cooperate with his purpose today?

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:41.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider this scenario:

00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:46.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother offends you,
says something thoughtless.

00:09:46.022 --> 00:09:48.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re hurt.

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:50.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how does Jehovah view that person?

00:09:50.944 --> 00:09:52.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s God’s friend.

00:09:52.946 --> 00:09:54.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves his friends.

00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:57.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants you to love them too.

00:09:57.492 --> 00:10:01.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s God’s purpose
for the brother who offended you?

00:10:01.663 --> 00:10:05.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants him to enjoy life forever.

00:10:05.292 --> 00:10:10.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how can you
work along with Jehovah’s purpose?

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:14.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you can just overlook the offense,
Jehovah will appreciate that.

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:16.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you can’t overlook it,

00:10:16.970 --> 00:10:21.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would want you to approach
the person in a kind, respectful way.

00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:23.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might say something like this:

00:10:23.977 --> 00:10:26.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maybe I’m being too sensitive,

00:10:26.146 --> 00:10:28.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I was hurt
by what you said the other day.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, I know you didn’t mean to hurt me,

00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:33.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I thought I’d let you know how I felt.”

00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:36.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the person responds favorably

00:10:36.156 --> 00:10:38.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unity is restored,

00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:41.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you imagine how pleased Jehovah will be?

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:47.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Matthew chapter 18, Jesus gave
the illustration of the lost sheep.

00:10:48.418 --> 00:10:50.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
A man had 100 sheep.

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
One got lost.

00:10:52.088 --> 00:10:54.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
The shepherd left the 99 in the field

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
and went to great lengths
to find the sheep that had strayed

00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:59.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring it back to the fold.

00:10:59.804 --> 00:11:01.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it a coincidence

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
that right after telling that story,

00:11:04.643 --> 00:11:07.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus outlined three steps we should follow

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:10.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
when someone has sinned seriously
against us?

00:11:10.524 --> 00:11:12.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 18:15,

00:11:12.526 --> 00:11:16.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus tells us what our goal should be
when we follow those steps.

00:11:16.279 --> 00:11:17.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that:

00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:21.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, if your brother commits a sin,

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:25.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“go and reveal his fault
between you and him alone.

00:11:25.956 --> 00:11:28.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If he listens to you, [notice]

00:11:28.542 --> 00:11:32.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have gained your brother.”

00:11:32.921 --> 00:11:36.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother who sinned against us
may be like that lost sheep.

00:11:36.591 --> 00:11:38.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
What should be our goal?

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:41.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
To gain our brother, not to expose him,

00:11:41.846 --> 00:11:44.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to get revenge, not to prove him wrong,

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:47.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to shame him, but to get him back.

00:11:47.769 --> 00:11:49.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like that loving shepherd,

00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:51.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are willing to go
to great lengths to bring

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
that erring brother back to the fold.

00:11:55.694 --> 00:11:59.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, if the brother
is an unrepentant sinner,

00:11:59.197 --> 00:12:02.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders will follow the third step
outlined by Jesus

00:12:02.492 --> 00:12:05.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll be removed from the congregation.

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:11.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
How else can we work along
with Jehovah’s purpose?

00:12:11.543 --> 00:12:14.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do that by being involved
in the preaching work.

00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:17.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word has gone out:
“This good news of the Kingdom

00:12:17.632 --> 00:12:21.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
[must] be preached
in all the inhabited earth.”

00:12:21.011 --> 00:12:25.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many have tried
to prevent that from happening.

00:12:25.015 --> 00:12:27.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the early 20th century,

00:12:27.183 --> 00:12:30.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few prominent brothers opposed
the organization’s efforts

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:33.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get everyone involved
in the preaching work.

00:12:33.023 --> 00:12:36.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those dignitaries were quite happy
to get all dressed up

00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:39.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give public talks to large audiences,

00:12:39.404 --> 00:12:43.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they refused to “lower themselves”
to go from house to house.

00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:48.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were fighting against God,

00:12:48.163 --> 00:12:51.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the angels soon sifted them out.

00:12:51.416 --> 00:12:54.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of them were never heard of again.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:59.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in countries
where there’s a measure of religious freedom,

00:12:59.007 --> 00:13:03.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
fighters against God have tried to prevent us
from carrying out our commission.

00:13:03.094 --> 00:13:05.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You need a permit to go from house to house.

00:13:05.555 --> 00:13:08.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You can’t offer magazines on the street.

00:13:08.016 --> 00:13:10.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
You people are a dangerous sect.”

00:13:10.894 --> 00:13:14.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve even enacted laws
directed at stopping our work.

00:13:15.273 --> 00:13:18.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unless they change their ways,

00:13:18.485 --> 00:13:22.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
those lawmakers
are going to be in big trouble.

00:13:22.405 --> 00:13:26.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word has gone out: “As you go, preach.”

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
That great work will be accomplished,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:32.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their support or in spite of them.

00:13:34.042 --> 00:13:36.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we mentioned, fighters against God

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes seem to get away
with their acts of rebellion.

00:13:40.298 --> 00:13:43.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they’re on a slippery slope.

00:13:43.134 --> 00:13:45.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t express it better than David did

00:13:45.845 --> 00:13:48.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 37:1, 2:

00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:52.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be upset because of evil men

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:54.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or envious of wrongdoers.

00:13:54.562 --> 00:13:56.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will quickly wither like grass

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and shrivel like green new grass.”

00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:05.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you hear about powerful opposers
who seem to be untouchable,

00:14:05.448 --> 00:14:07.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember what we’ve discussed.

00:14:07.784 --> 00:14:11.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men may seem to prosper for a while,

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:13.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since they’re fighting against God,

00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:16.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re more to be pitied than to be feared.

00:14:16.876 --> 00:14:19.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re on the wrong side.

00:14:19.421 --> 00:14:23.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are fighting a losing battle.
