Welcome to JW Broadcasting®

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:05.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
for January 2024!

00:00:25.004 --> 00:00:26.463 line:10% position:50% align:center
In November,

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:28.591 line:10% position:50% align:center
we enjoyed the exciting first half

00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.801 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the annual meeting program.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:33.387 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now please enjoy Part 2!

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:38.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll now enjoy the first of two symposiums.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each speaker will introduce the next.

00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:43.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s give our attention, please,

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Brother Jeffrey Winder,

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:48.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will consider the theme

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How Does the Light Get Brighter?”

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent years,
the annual meeting has been an occasion

00:00:57.536 --> 00:01:01.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
where clarified understanding
of Bible truths, new light,

00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been announced and explained.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, it’s not at every annual meeting
that this takes place,

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:10.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when Jehovah makes something known,

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:15.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
often it’s at the annual meeting
where it is announced.

00:01:16.096 --> 00:01:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, will there be new light today?

00:01:19.683 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think Brother Cook
already spilled the beans a bit,

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we look forward to seeing

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:30.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is in store for our program.

00:01:30.361 --> 00:01:32.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you ever wondered, though,

00:01:32.905 --> 00:01:36.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How exactly does Jehovah reveal

00:01:36.116 --> 00:01:38.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘clarified understanding of the Scriptures,

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
new light, in modern times?’

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:44.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Governing Body is meeting together

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:47.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:49.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does it work?

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:51.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
How exactly does the light get brighter?

00:01:51.632 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah use that arrangement

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
to clarify our understanding?

00:01:58.597 --> 00:02:03.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,
what do we know from the Scriptures?

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:05.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at four points.

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one is this:

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
By what means does Jehovah reveal new light?

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:15.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for that,
we can turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 2

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
and read together 1 Corinthians 2:10:

00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:28.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it is to us God has revealed them

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:30.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through his spirit,

00:02:30.421 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the spirit searches into all things,

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:35.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
even the deep things of God.”

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
So clearly—
By what means does Jehovah reveal new light?

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:40.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s by his spirit.

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:43.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recognize the key role

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:46.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s spirit
has in revealing the truth.

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:48.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point two:

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom does Jehovah reveal
clarified understanding?

00:02:53.444 --> 00:02:57.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for that we can turn
to the book of Matthew chapter 24

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
and read together Matthew 24:45:

00:03:05.497 --> 00:03:08.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who really is
the faithful and discreet slave

00:03:08.834 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whom his master
appointed over his domestics,

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:15.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give them their food at the proper time?”

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:19.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
So clearly, Christ has appointed
“the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:23.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is through this channel
that Jehovah, through Christ,

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:26.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
works to provide spiritual food.

00:03:27.436 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
So just with those first two points,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s very clear to us how spiritual truth,
new understanding,

00:03:34.151 --> 00:03:38.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
is communicated from heaven to earth
by means of the holy spirit

00:03:38.155 --> 00:03:40.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the channel
of “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:03:41.617 --> 00:03:43.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Question number three:

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
When does Jehovah reveal new light?

00:03:47.998 --> 00:03:52.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we just have to look back
to verse 45 of Matthew chapter 24.

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
The slave will provide
the “food at the proper time.”

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:59.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a clear timing element
indicated there, isn’t there?

00:03:59.968 --> 00:04:04.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so Jehovah reveals
clarified understanding at his time

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:09.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it is needed and when it
will help us to carry out his will.

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:12.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number four:

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:15.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
At what rate does he reveal new light?

00:04:15.901 --> 00:04:17.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it all at once, like a dump truck?

00:04:17.903 --> 00:04:21.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it metered out, like a trickle?

00:04:21.448 --> 00:04:26.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the answer to that is found
in the book of Proverbs chapter 4

00:04:28.372 --> 00:04:30.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 18

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 4:18:

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:37.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the path of the righteous
is like the bright morning light

00:04:37.256 --> 00:04:42.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
that grows brighter and brighter
until full daylight.”

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the Bible here
uses the illustration of daylight.

00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:47.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does that teach us?

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:51.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower</i>  said:
“These words aptly apply to the way

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:56.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which Jehovah reveals
his purpose to his people—gradually.”

00:04:56.358 --> 00:05:00.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
So just as daylight grows
brighter and brighter gradually,

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:03.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
a proper understanding
of Bible truths comes gradually

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:08.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we need it and as we are
able to absorb it and use it.

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:11.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we appreciate that, don’t we?

00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:16.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s easier on our eyes when literal light
gets brighter gradually.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it is with the understanding
of Jehovah’s purpose as well.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, think about Abraham.

00:05:23.177 --> 00:05:27.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could Abraham have handled
and absorbed a complete understanding

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:30.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s will at his time

00:05:30.058 --> 00:05:32.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how he would use the 12 tribes of Israel,

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:36.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Mosaic Law, the understanding of Christ,
the payment of the ransom,

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:39.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first-century Christian congregation,
the heavenly hope,

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
the last days,
and details about the great tribulation?

00:05:42.696 --> 00:05:45.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
No way.
He couldn’t handle all of that.

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:46.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t need it.

00:05:46.992 --> 00:05:49.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Abraham had what he needed

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:52.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve Jehovah acceptably
during the time that he lived.

00:05:53.916 --> 00:05:57.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have the privilege
to live during the last days

00:05:57.294 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
when “true knowledge”
was foretold to “become abundant.”

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even still, it is released and made known

00:06:04.676 --> 00:06:06.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a pace that we can absorb,

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can handle, and that we can use.

00:06:09.431 --> 00:06:11.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank Jehovah for that.

00:06:13.352 --> 00:06:18.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is what we know from the Scriptures
and from our own experience as well

00:06:18.023 --> 00:06:20.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how the light
gets brighter in modern times.

00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:23.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
It comes about by means of the holy spirit,

00:06:23.654 --> 00:06:26.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his channel
of “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:30.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reveals it gradually,
and at a time that it is needed.

00:06:32.454 --> 00:06:37.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, knowing this, then, we are not
embarrassed about adjustments that are made,

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:39.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor is an apology needed

00:06:39.628 --> 00:06:42.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
for not getting it exactly right previously.

00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:45.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understand that this
is how Jehovah operates.

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:48.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reveals matters gradually
when it is needed.

00:06:49.805 --> 00:06:54.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also the Governing Body
is neither inspired nor infallible.

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:59.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it can err in doctrinal matters
or in organizational direction.

00:06:59.731 --> 00:07:02.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers do the best they can
with what they have

00:07:02.567 --> 00:07:05.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they understand at the time

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:09.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
but are happy if Jehovah sees fit
to clarify matters,

00:07:09.241 --> 00:07:11.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then that can be shared
with the brotherhood.

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when that happens,

00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:17.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
we understand it’s because it’s
Jehovah’s time for that to happen,

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we eagerly accept that.

00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:24.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s go back
to our original question.

00:07:24.047 --> 00:07:26.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, we understand these things
from the Scriptures.

00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:27.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, really, how does it work?

00:07:27.634 --> 00:07:30.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the brothers are meeting together,
how does Jehovah help them

00:07:30.887 --> 00:07:34.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
come to a better understanding of things?

00:07:35.142 --> 00:07:39.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s an appropriate question
because Jehovah does not intend for it to be

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:42.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
a mystery or overly secretive.

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:45.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in his inspired Scriptures,

00:07:45.277 --> 00:07:49.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
he reveals examples of when understanding

00:07:49.114 --> 00:07:51.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
was clarified in the Christian era.

00:07:51.616 --> 00:07:54.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a notable example was around 49 C.E.

00:07:54.870 --> 00:07:59.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
when clarification was needed
regarding the requirements for salvation.

00:07:59.207 --> 00:08:01.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
And specifically, the question was this:

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:04.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Gentile males
first need to be circumcised

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:08.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and submit to the Mosaic Law
in order to be saved?

00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:13.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a significant matter that could have
divided the congregation,

00:08:13.472 --> 00:08:15.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so it was referred to the apostles

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the older men, the governing body,
at that time.

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:22.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in fact, at Galatians 2:2,

00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:26.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul states
that “as a result of a revelation,”

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
he brought the matter to the brothers
in Jerusalem.

00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:33.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Christ himself directed
that this important doctrinal matter

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
be settled by the brothers taking the lead.

00:08:36.703 --> 00:08:41.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in Acts 15, Jehovah allows us
to look in on that meeting

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:45.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
(to be a fly on the wall, as it were)
to hear their discussion

00:08:45.629 --> 00:08:50.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to see how the holy spirit worked with them,
how they used God’s Word,

00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:53.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they came to a conclusion,
and then the result

00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:57.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was sent and conveyed
to the congregations.

00:08:57.015 --> 00:09:00.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the process
is not entirely different today.

00:09:00.977 --> 00:09:05.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s take a look at what happened
if we turn together to Acts chapter 15.

00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts chapter 15 and beginning in verse 6,
it says:

00:09:12.614 --> 00:09:15.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The apostles and the elders
gathered together to look into this matter.”

00:09:15.784 --> 00:09:17.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is an important matter.

00:09:17.494 --> 00:09:21.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s brought before the governing body
of that day.

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:23.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 7,

00:09:23.667 --> 00:09:27.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
it mentions that there was
“much intense discussion.”

00:09:27.546 --> 00:09:29.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was a lively conversation.

00:09:29.631 --> 00:09:33.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers felt free
to express themselves respectfully,

00:09:33.176 --> 00:09:35.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they were sharing
their thoughts and opinions

00:09:35.762 --> 00:09:37.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the different sides of the issue.

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:39.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in verse 7, Peter stands.

00:09:39.766 --> 00:09:44.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe this is the point
that is reflected in our artwork here.

00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:48.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Peter begins to speak
and relates his comments

00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:52.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on his real-life experience
with Cornelius.

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:55.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they’re considering some facts.

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:59.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you look in verse 12,
Peter’s words strike a chord

00:09:59.327 --> 00:10:02.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
because “the entire group [becomes] silent.”

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:05.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this, we see humility
—don’t we?—

00:10:05.876 --> 00:10:08.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
because none of the brothers
were trying to force their personal opinion

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:11.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
or get their idea approved.

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:15.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were collectively looking to Jehovah
for direction on the matter.

00:10:16.511 --> 00:10:19.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this makes way, then,
for Paul and Barnabas

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:21.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
to begin to explain their experiences.

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:25.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there were more facts, more evidence,
that they could consider.

00:10:25.479 --> 00:10:28.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 13, James speaks up

00:10:28.315 --> 00:10:31.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he uses the Scriptures
to help the brothers

00:10:31.026 --> 00:10:34.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
draw a proper Scriptural conclusion.

00:10:34.321 --> 00:10:37.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
He applies Amos 9:11, 12, saying that Jehovah 

00:10:37.741 --> 00:10:40.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
would turn “his attention to the nations

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take out of them a people for his name.”

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:49.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well in verses 19-21,
he recommends a decision.

00:10:49.419 --> 00:10:54.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 25 indicates
that that decision was unanimous.

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:57.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 22,
it mentions that they sent the brothers out

00:10:57.552 --> 00:11:01.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
to inform the congregation
of this clarified understanding.

00:11:02.724 --> 00:11:06.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in the whole process described there,
we see the use of God’s Word,

00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:10.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see the leadership of the Christ,
and the operation of the holy spirit

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
working through the brothers
taking the lead at that time.

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:17.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we can see the process is not intended

00:11:17.989 --> 00:11:22.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be a mystery or to be overly secretive.

00:11:22.202 --> 00:11:26.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the process today
is not much dissimilar than that.

00:11:27.624 --> 00:11:31.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2010,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  explained it this way.

00:11:31.169 --> 00:11:35.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said: “When the time comes
to clarify a spiritual matter in our day,

00:11:35.674 --> 00:11:38.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“holy spirit helps . . .
‘the faithful and discreet slave’ . . .

00:11:38.593 --> 00:11:43.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to discern deep truths
that were not previously understood.

00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:48.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Governing Body as a whole
considers adjusted explanations.

00:11:48.228 --> 00:11:52.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
What they learn,
they publish for the benefit of all.”

00:11:53.608 --> 00:11:57.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
So generally the process happens this way:

00:11:57.988 --> 00:12:00.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, a question comes up.

00:12:00.824 --> 00:12:04.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it could be that a Governing Body
member in his personal study

00:12:04.619 --> 00:12:09.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
or his personal Bible reading notices
something that then raises a question.

00:12:09.249 --> 00:12:12.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or it could be that a question
comes up during the preparation

00:12:12.669 --> 00:12:14.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
or translation of spiritual food

00:12:14.754 --> 00:12:18.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that requires more consideration.

00:12:18.049 --> 00:12:21.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
World events might put the spotlight
on a particular prophecy

00:12:21.553 --> 00:12:24.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
that then gets closer attention.

00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:27.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in one way or another,
a question comes up.

00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:29.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that question is then put on

00:12:29.269 --> 00:12:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body’s agenda for discussion.

00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:33.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the question is,

00:12:33.648 --> 00:12:38.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does this require, or warrant,

00:12:38.653 --> 00:12:40.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
additional research?

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers are not making a final decision
on what the new understanding will be

00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:48.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
but are just asking,
“Does it warrant additional research?”

00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if the answer is yes,
then a research team is assigned to provide

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:57.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
recommendations and research
for the Governing Body to consider.

00:12:57.505 --> 00:13:01.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this research includes
a summary of everything that we have said

00:13:01.384 --> 00:13:05.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
(the organization has said)
on the subject since 1879

00:13:05.221 --> 00:13:08.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of <i>The Watchtowers </i>
on what we have said.

00:13:08.183 --> 00:13:13.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, it includes what the context
of the verse indicates about its meaning.

00:13:14.105 --> 00:13:17.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further, what bearing do parallel accounts

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
have on the understanding of the account,
if there are any parallel accounts?

00:13:22.322 --> 00:13:26.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, what impact
does the original Hebrew or Greek

00:13:26.117 --> 00:13:28.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
have on our understanding of the verse?

00:13:29.871 --> 00:13:32.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, once that whole research package
is compiled,

00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s placed back on
the Governing Body’s agenda for review.

00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:39.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, once it goes on the agenda,

00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:42.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
then each individual member
of the Governing Body under prayer

00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
reviews the information and thinks about it
in preparation for the meeting.

00:13:46.888 --> 00:13:49.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then it’s discussed as a group

00:13:49.015 --> 00:13:52.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Governing Body meeting
again under prayer,

00:13:52.018 --> 00:13:55.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
relying on Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:13:55.522 --> 00:13:58.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when this matter is discussed,
the discussion is not rushed,

00:13:58.942 --> 00:14:01.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor is the decision forced.

00:14:01.486 --> 00:14:04.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
But often, like in the first century,
it’s a lively discussion

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:08.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the brothers feel free to share
their opinions and their thoughts

00:14:08.034 --> 00:14:11.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the results of their meditation
and their research.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s also humility there
because, again, none of the brothers

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
are trying to force their idea
or are trying to get their thoughts approved.

00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:24.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is this collective, unified desire

00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:29.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see Jehovah’s direction on the matter
and where he is steering things.

00:14:29.097 --> 00:14:33.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
The goal is to discern Jehovah’s direction
on the matter.

00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:35.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And often (or at times, we could say),

00:14:35.645 --> 00:14:38.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
the final result might be quite different

00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:41.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
than what the research package
originally recommended.

00:14:41.234 --> 00:14:44.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s Jehovah’s spirit working
through “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:14:44.863 --> 00:14:47.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring us to the right decision.

00:14:47.532 --> 00:14:51.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the brothers
are looking for a unanimous decision.

00:14:51.119 --> 00:14:54.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, it may seem like this
is a solid adjustment,

00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if it’s not unanimous,

00:14:56.082 --> 00:15:00.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
it just might not be time yet
for it to be revealed.

00:15:00.003 --> 00:15:01.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it’s not forced.

00:15:01.421 --> 00:15:03.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
The matter is set aside.

00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:06.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it could be that sometime later,
even some years later,

00:15:06.342 --> 00:15:09.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
the matter comes back up
and then it sails right through.

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:13.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe it does get approved
but now with a couple of key points

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:16.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
discerned that weren’t discerned earlier.

00:15:18.021 --> 00:15:21.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with this thorough process under prayer

00:15:21.524 --> 00:15:23.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when there is unanimous accord,

00:15:23.777 --> 00:15:26.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the brothers
take that as Jehovah’s direction

00:15:26.613 --> 00:15:29.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then are happy to share it
with the brotherhood.

00:15:31.409 --> 00:15:34.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this helps us to understand the process,

00:15:34.329 --> 00:15:38.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
understand how light
gets brighter in modern times.

00:15:39.876 --> 00:15:42.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while it is interesting to us

00:15:42.253 --> 00:15:45.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
how our understanding is clarified,

00:15:45.673 --> 00:15:49.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
what really touches our heart
is why it’s clarified.

00:15:50.887 --> 00:15:54.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to the book of Amos chapter 3.

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:01.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice what Amos 3:7 says:

00:16:03.858 --> 00:16:06.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
will not do a thing

00:16:06.903 --> 00:16:10.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
“unless he has revealed
his confidential matter

00:16:10.198 --> 00:16:12.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his servants the prophets.”

00:16:13.493 --> 00:16:17.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t that convey
Jehovah’s confidence in us?

00:16:17.038 --> 00:16:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t it indicate his love and his loyalty?

00:16:21.584 --> 00:16:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is actively involved
in teaching his people,

00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:28.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
preparing us for what lies ahead.

00:16:28.132 --> 00:16:32.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s providing us with the understanding
that we need when we need it.

00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:36.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is reassuring
—isn’t it?—

00:16:36.474 --> 00:16:40.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
because as we progress
deeper into the time of the end,

00:16:40.228 --> 00:16:43.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Satan’s hatred intensifies

00:16:43.064 --> 00:16:45.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his attacks increase,

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:48.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we draw closer to the great tribulation

00:16:48.152 --> 00:16:51.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the destruction
of Satan’s wicked system of things,

00:16:51.698 --> 00:16:55.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be confident that Jehovah God,
our God,

00:16:55.785 --> 00:16:57.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue to loyally provide us

00:16:57.996 --> 00:17:01.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the direction and the understanding
that we need.

00:17:01.833 --> 00:17:06.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will not be left without guidance,
unsure where to go or what to do.

00:17:06.754 --> 00:17:09.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will not be left to stumble in the dark

00:17:09.549 --> 00:17:11.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah has said:

00:17:11.718 --> 00:17:16.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The path of the righteous one
is like the bright morning light

00:17:16.222 --> 00:17:19.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
that grows brighter and brighter
until full daylight.”

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:35.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with these things in mind,

00:17:35.909 --> 00:17:39.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to listen closely
to the next two talks.

00:17:39.621 --> 00:17:42.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first will be presented
by Brother David Splane

00:17:42.373 --> 00:17:46.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is entitled “Trust in the Merciful
‘Judge of All the Earth.’”

00:17:48.755 --> 00:17:51.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of an angel,

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:56.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God told his dear friend Abraham

00:17:56.888 --> 00:18:01.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was going to destroy
the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:18:01.809 --> 00:18:03.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
The angel said:

00:18:03.895 --> 00:18:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah

00:18:06.397 --> 00:18:09.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is indeed great,

00:18:09.108 --> 00:18:13.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their sin is very heavy.”

00:18:15.573 --> 00:18:17.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham was troubled.

00:18:18.242 --> 00:18:19.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
He apparently wondered

00:18:19.994 --> 00:18:23.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether Jehovah had taken
all of the factors into consideration

00:18:23.581 --> 00:18:27.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
before he made that decision
to destroy the cities.

00:18:28.378 --> 00:18:30.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he asked:

00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Will the Judge of all the earth
not do what is right?”

00:18:37.136 --> 00:18:41.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can understand
why Abraham would ask that question.

00:18:42.433 --> 00:18:46.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was early days
in his relationship with Jehovah God.

00:18:46.813 --> 00:18:51.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was just beginning
to get acquainted with Jehovah,

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:54.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can hardly imagine him
asking the same question later

00:18:54.946 --> 00:18:57.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he knew Jehovah much better.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you ever asked a similar question,

00:19:03.037 --> 00:19:05.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe when you
were just coming into the truth?

00:19:06.874 --> 00:19:08.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever asked, for example:

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Will none of those
who died in the Flood get a resurrection

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:17.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—even those
who may never have heard of Noah?

00:19:17.468 --> 00:19:19.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And what about Sodom and Gomorrah?

00:19:21.264 --> 00:19:23.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Will everyone who died
in Sodom and Gomorrah

00:19:23.891 --> 00:19:26.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“sleep an everlasting sleep

00:19:26.686 --> 00:19:31.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the women, the children, the babies?

00:19:32.525 --> 00:19:37.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And was there not one
redeemable Assyrian soldier

00:19:38.114 --> 00:19:42.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in that band of 185,000 who died

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the hand of Jehovah’s angel?”

00:19:46.247 --> 00:19:48.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t have the answer to those questions.

00:19:50.084 --> 00:19:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do know one thing:

00:19:53.087 --> 00:19:58.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
The merciful “Judge of all the earth”
will do what is right.

00:19:59.552 --> 00:20:01.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wait a minute.

00:20:01.596 --> 00:20:03.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did I hear that right?

00:20:04.182 --> 00:20:07.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t have the answer to those questions?

00:20:07.810 --> 00:20:09.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought we did.

00:20:10.188 --> 00:20:12.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past, our publications have stated

00:20:12.857 --> 00:20:15.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there’s no hope of a resurrection

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:19.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those who died in the Flood
or those destroyed in Sodom and Gomorrah.

00:20:21.157 --> 00:20:23.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do we really know that?

00:20:24.744 --> 00:20:27.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
The men of Sodom and Gomorrah
were certainly wicked,

00:20:27.789 --> 00:20:30.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they deserved to die for what they did.

00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:35.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did they know any better?

00:20:36.214 --> 00:20:39.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often
did Lot and his family preach to them?

00:20:39.884 --> 00:20:42.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
And are we saying that if special pioneers

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
had been assigned to Sodom,

00:20:45.098 --> 00:20:49.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would have had no success whatsoever
in preaching to the Sodomites,

00:20:49.727 --> 00:20:53.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping them to turn around
and come to a knowledge of Jehovah?

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we say dogmatically

00:20:56.442 --> 00:20:59.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
that not one Sodomite would have repented

00:20:59.737 --> 00:21:03.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Jehovah’s requirements had been explained?

00:21:04.325 --> 00:21:07.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then there’s the fascinating statement

00:21:07.036 --> 00:21:10.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
made by Jesus found in Matthew chapter 11

00:21:12.792 --> 00:21:17.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I’ll give you a moment—Matthew chapter 11.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:21.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re going to read verses 23 and 24.

00:21:23.553 --> 00:21:25.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is interesting

00:21:26.722 --> 00:21:30.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 11:23, 24:

00:21:31.727 --> 00:21:36.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And you, Capernaum,
will you perhaps be exalted to heaven?

00:21:36.941 --> 00:21:39.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Down to the Grave you will come;

00:21:39.152 --> 00:21:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because [and notice this]
if the powerful works

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:46.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that took place in you
had taken place in Sodom,

00:21:46.993 --> 00:21:51.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it would have remained until this very day.

00:21:51.455 --> 00:21:53.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I say to you

00:21:53.499 --> 00:21:58.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it will be more endurable
for the land of Sodom on Judgment Day

00:21:58.421 --> 00:22:00.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
than for you.”

00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:04.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It would have remained

00:22:04.385 --> 00:22:07.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
until this very day.”

00:22:07.305 --> 00:22:11.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s angel had told Abraham

00:22:11.100 --> 00:22:14.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if ten righteous men
could be found in Sodom,

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
the city would not be destroyed.

00:22:16.397 --> 00:22:20.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
So was Jesus saying
that if he had preached

00:22:20.526 --> 00:22:23.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and performed powerful works in Sodom,

00:22:23.654 --> 00:22:27.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
ten righteous men would have been found

00:22:27.658 --> 00:22:29.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the city would have been spared?

00:22:30.703 --> 00:22:32.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also of interest

00:22:32.705 --> 00:22:36.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
to consider Jehovah’s words
to unfaithful Judah

00:22:36.459 --> 00:22:38.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Ezekiel chapter 16.

00:22:38.961 --> 00:22:42.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said that the citizens of Sodom

00:22:42.089 --> 00:22:45.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
were more righteous
than the inhabitants of Judah.

00:22:45.259 --> 00:22:49.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Sodom is doomed, what about Judah?

00:22:51.182 --> 00:22:53.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the disciple Jude’s statement

00:22:53.517 --> 00:22:55.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Sodom and Gomorrah would undergo

00:22:55.311 --> 00:22:58.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the judicial punishment
of everlasting fire”?

00:22:59.315 --> 00:23:02.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that certainly
will prove true of the cities

00:23:02.401 --> 00:23:05.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and probably many of the inhabitants as well,

00:23:05.363 --> 00:23:09.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
but does it mean
that there’s no hope for any of them?

00:23:09.033 --> 00:23:11.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ statement we just read

00:23:11.577 --> 00:23:13.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
would indicate that there is hope for some.

00:23:14.705 --> 00:23:18.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just can’t be dogmatic.

00:23:19.085 --> 00:23:24.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
But again, we can say
that the merciful “Judge of all the earth”

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:26.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
will do what is right.

00:23:27.134 --> 00:23:30.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s talk about the Flood of Noah’s day.

00:23:30.179 --> 00:23:33.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past, we’ve said that any
who died in the Flood

00:23:33.099 --> 00:23:35.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
would not be resurrected.

00:23:35.643 --> 00:23:37.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does the Bible say that?

00:23:38.354 --> 00:23:41.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Noah’s contemporaries
certainly were wicked,

00:23:41.357 --> 00:23:44.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible says that “man’s wickedness
was great on the earth

00:23:44.652 --> 00:23:47.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that every inclination
of the thoughts of his heart

00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
was only bad all the time.”

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:54.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
So those living at that time were sinners,

00:23:54.954 --> 00:23:58.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
but did they all get a thorough witness?

00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:02.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah and his family
must have been very busy building the ark.

00:24:02.670 --> 00:24:06.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much time did they have for preaching?

00:24:06.215 --> 00:24:10.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
And were they able
to do seldom-worked territory?

00:24:11.595 --> 00:24:14.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have found that people
who live within ten miles (16 km) of Bethel

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:17.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
have never heard of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:24:17.476 --> 00:24:21.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
So can we guarantee
that everyone living on earth

00:24:21.605 --> 00:24:25.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
during that time knew of Noah
and what he was doing?

00:24:25.192 --> 00:24:27.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t really say that.

00:24:27.236 --> 00:24:31.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
And can we say that if someone
had been given an adequate opportunity, 

00:24:31.991 --> 00:24:35.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still would have turned
his back on Jehovah?

00:24:35.953 --> 00:24:38.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just can’t say that.

00:24:39.206 --> 00:24:41.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course,
if Jehovah didn’t bring them back,

00:24:41.959 --> 00:24:44.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
they wouldn’t have any grounds for complaint.

00:24:45.129 --> 00:24:47.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve had life,

00:24:47.131 --> 00:24:51.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and life is more than any of us deserves.

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:54.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you know, when Adam and Eve sinned,

00:24:54.096 --> 00:24:56.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could have destroyed
them right away.

00:24:56.140 --> 00:25:00.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
But instead, he gave them the opportunity
to have sons and daughters.

00:25:00.353 --> 00:25:03.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result, we were born.

00:25:03.272 --> 00:25:06.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the fact that you and I

00:25:06.108 --> 00:25:09.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
have drawn one breath

00:25:09.111 --> 00:25:13.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
is pure undeserved kindness
on Jehovah’s part.

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, on the other hand,
for many years it was suggested

00:25:17.536 --> 00:25:21.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all those who the Bible says
were buried with their forefathers

00:25:21.499 --> 00:25:23.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
were going to have a resurrection.

00:25:24.251 --> 00:25:26.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon was one of those.

00:25:26.712 --> 00:25:28.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says of him:

00:25:28.589 --> 00:25:33.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Solomon was laid to rest
with his forefathers

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was buried
in the City of David his father.”

00:25:37.765 --> 00:25:41.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we reasoned that those
who were buried with their forefathers

00:25:41.644 --> 00:25:43.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
were in the common grave of mankind,

00:25:43.187 --> 00:25:46.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know that the common grave
of mankind is going to be emptied

00:25:46.482 --> 00:25:48.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ.

00:25:49.902 --> 00:25:52.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we ask ourselves:

00:25:53.447 --> 00:25:57.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘When Bible writers said that someone
was buried with his forefathers,

00:25:57.576 --> 00:26:01.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘were they really revealing
what Jehovah’s final judgment would be?

00:26:01.914 --> 00:26:05.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Was Jehovah revealing to them
—inspiring them to say—

00:26:05.042 --> 00:26:08.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘how he was going to settle the case?

00:26:08.254 --> 00:26:10.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Or were the Bible writers really saying

00:26:10.756 --> 00:26:13.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘that this is the way the person was buried

00:26:13.592 --> 00:26:15.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this is the manner of his burial?’

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:18.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, in Bible times,
the way someone was buried

00:26:18.931 --> 00:26:21.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
was very important.

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:25.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph and Jacob
refused to be buried in Egypt.

00:26:25.896 --> 00:26:29.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
High Priest Jehoiada
was buried with the kings of Judah

00:26:29.608 --> 00:26:32.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of all the good things he had done.

00:26:32.903 --> 00:26:35.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when a prophet said that a certain king

00:26:35.281 --> 00:26:38.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
was going to have “the burial of a donkey,”
that wasn’t good.

00:26:41.162 --> 00:26:45.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Solomon was the second wisest man
ever to walk the earth.

00:26:46.792 --> 00:26:49.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah appeared to him twice,
and the second time he appeared to him,

00:26:49.879 --> 00:26:54.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “If you and your sons
turn away from following me

00:26:54.592 --> 00:26:58.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and . . . you go and serve other gods
and bow down to them,

00:26:58.637 --> 00:27:03.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will cut Israel off
from the surface of the land.”

00:27:04.226 --> 00:27:06.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Solomon do?

00:27:07.646 --> 00:27:11.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
He began to “serve other gods
and bow down to them.”

00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:15.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will
the “Judge of all the earth” view that?

00:27:16.739 --> 00:27:18.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not for us to say.

00:27:19.366 --> 00:27:21.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can’t be dogmatic about the prospects

00:27:21.827 --> 00:27:24.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who are said to be buried
with their forefathers.

00:27:24.788 --> 00:27:26.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be that the Bible

00:27:26.499 --> 00:27:30.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
was just indicating
the manner of their burial.

00:27:30.377 --> 00:27:33.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that isn’t to say
that they won’t be resurrected.

00:27:33.255 --> 00:27:36.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
It simply means that we don’t know.

00:27:37.468 --> 00:27:41.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
The righteous Judge knows,
and we know that he’ll do the right thing.

00:27:43.015 --> 00:27:45.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do we know about Jehovah?

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:48.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we trust him to do the right thing?

00:27:49.438 --> 00:27:51.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, look at the record.

00:27:51.482 --> 00:27:53.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the days of the prophet Joel,

00:27:53.484 --> 00:27:57.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people
were in a sick spiritual condition.

00:27:57.321 --> 00:28:02.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were worshipping the Baals
and the golden calves and the sacred poles.

00:28:02.076 --> 00:28:04.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were lying,
committing adultery, stealing,

00:28:04.495 --> 00:28:07.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
shedding innocent blood,
oppressing widows and orphans.

00:28:08.457 --> 00:28:11.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had good reason
to wipe the whole nation out.

00:28:11.627 --> 00:28:14.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, what do we read at Joel 2:13?

00:28:14.255 --> 00:28:17.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joel says: “Rip apart your hearts,

00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:21.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and not your garments,
and return to Jehovah your God,

00:28:21.637 --> 00:28:24.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for he is compassionate and merciful,

00:28:24.557 --> 00:28:27.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“slow to anger and abundant in loyal love,

00:28:27.851 --> 00:28:32.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will reconsider the calamity.”

00:28:34.233 --> 00:28:38.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will reconsider the calamity.”

00:28:38.237 --> 00:28:42.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all that,
Jehovah was willing to show mercy.

00:28:43.158 --> 00:28:45.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is very encouraging.

00:28:46.203 --> 00:28:48.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:28:49.123 --> 00:28:52.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our brothers
have no trouble accepting the fact

00:28:52.334 --> 00:28:57.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will forgive the sins
they committed in their ignorance

00:28:57.256 --> 00:28:59.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
before they came to a knowledge of the truth.

00:29:01.594 --> 00:29:05.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if they’ve committed a sin after baptism,

00:29:05.598 --> 00:29:09.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re afraid that Jehovah will never forget
and he will never forgive them.

00:29:09.893 --> 00:29:11.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, what do we see here?

00:29:11.562 --> 00:29:16.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
The nation of Israel
was in a dedicated situation before Jehovah,

00:29:16.191 --> 00:29:19.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet Jehovah said:
‘If you stop doing what is wrong

00:29:19.653 --> 00:29:24.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if you start doing what is right,
I will reconsider.’

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:28.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you have the encouraging words
found in Ezekiel chapter 33.

00:29:28.954 --> 00:29:30.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read this.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:38.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I find that this is a good passage to read
to brothers and sisters

00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
who may feel that Jehovah could never
forgive them for what they’ve done.

00:29:42.426 --> 00:29:46.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezekiel 33:14, 16

00:29:49.642 --> 00:29:51.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
—verse 14 first:

00:29:52.686 --> 00:29:55.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And when I say to the wicked one:

00:29:55.356 --> 00:29:57.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You will surely die,’

00:29:57.566 --> 00:30:01.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he turns away from his sin

00:30:01.236 --> 00:30:04.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and does what is just and righteous, . . .

00:30:04.365 --> 00:30:05.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[verse 16]

00:30:05.949 --> 00:30:09.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“none of the sins he committed
will be held against him.

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:13.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For doing what is just and righteous,

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:16.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will surely keep living.”

00:30:17.086 --> 00:30:21.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, isn’t that encouraging
for someone who strayed from the truth,

00:30:21.465 --> 00:30:24.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe got involved in some bad conduct?

00:30:24.009 --> 00:30:27.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Far too many of these ones

00:30:27.054 --> 00:30:30.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
are afraid that Jehovah
will never forgive them.

00:30:30.182 --> 00:30:33.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would love to come back to the truth,
and they would love to come back to Jehovah,

00:30:33.352 --> 00:30:36.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they’re afraid that Jehovah
is not going to accept them.

00:30:36.647 --> 00:30:38.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet he says:

00:30:38.273 --> 00:30:42.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“None of the sins he committed
will be held against him.”

00:30:43.654 --> 00:30:45.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
The case of King Manasseh makes the point.

00:30:45.989 --> 00:30:48.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was in a dedicated relationship
with Jehovah,

00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:52.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet for most of his life,
he did what was wrong.

00:30:52.162 --> 00:30:55.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when he repented, turned around,

00:30:55.582 --> 00:30:57.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started doing what was right,

00:30:57.626 --> 00:31:00.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wiped the slate clean.

00:31:00.963 --> 00:31:05.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a marvelous, merciful God we worship!

00:31:06.468 --> 00:31:09.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows that Jehovah will show mercy

00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:12.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
whenever he sees a basis for doing so.

00:31:13.183 --> 00:31:16.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, consider how Jehovah
dealt with the people of Nineveh

00:31:16.645 --> 00:31:18.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the days of Jonah.

00:31:18.272 --> 00:31:20.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their conduct was so bad

00:31:20.774 --> 00:31:23.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah was determined
to destroy the city,

00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:25.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jonah was in agreement with that.

00:31:25.821 --> 00:31:27.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yeah, wipe them all out.’

00:31:28.615 --> 00:31:33.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah was more merciful
than Jonah was,

00:31:33.036 --> 00:31:36.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when He saw
that the people repented and turned around,

00:31:36.665 --> 00:31:38.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was willing to forgive them.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:40.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?
The Bible tells us why.

00:31:41.795 --> 00:31:45.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t “know right from wrong.”

00:31:47.134 --> 00:31:50.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t know any better.

00:31:50.137 --> 00:31:52.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will some of those Ninevites be back?

00:31:52.723 --> 00:31:56.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ words found at Matthew 12:41

00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:58.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
seem to indicate that they will.

00:31:58.228 --> 00:32:02.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Men of Nineveh
will rise up in the judgment

00:32:02.691 --> 00:32:05.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with this generation and will condemn it,

00:32:05.819 --> 00:32:08.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they repented
at what Jonah preached.

00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:12.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look! something more than Jonah is here.”

00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:16.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we see from these examples?

00:32:16.538 --> 00:32:21.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
The men of Nineveh, Manasseh, and others

00:32:21.335 --> 00:32:24.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they were wicked, they did bad things,

00:32:24.546 --> 00:32:28.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
they repented,
they started to do what was right,

00:32:28.425 --> 00:32:31.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah wiped the slate clean.

00:32:32.971 --> 00:32:36.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, today, power for judging
has been given to someone else.

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a different judge of all the earth.

00:32:39.978 --> 00:32:43.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we read about him in John chapter 5

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:49.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
—John chapter 5—

00:32:49.905 --> 00:32:51.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verse 22.

00:32:51.740 --> 00:32:53.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment.

00:32:55.494 --> 00:32:57.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 5:22:

00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:03.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the Father judges no one at all,

00:33:03.001 --> 00:33:07.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but he has entrusted all the judging

00:33:07.297 --> 00:33:11.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
[all the judging] to the Son.”

00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:16.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus has been given authority
“to judge the living and the dead.”

00:33:16.849 --> 00:33:19.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, can we trust him?

00:33:19.142 --> 00:33:21.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we be sure that Jesus will be merciful?

00:33:21.728 --> 00:33:22.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:25.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s the exact image of his Father,

00:33:25.649 --> 00:33:28.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the prophet Isaiah wrote of him:

00:33:28.402 --> 00:33:31.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will not judge
by what appears to his eyes,

00:33:31.947 --> 00:33:35.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor reprove
simply according to what his ears hear.

00:33:35.868 --> 00:33:38.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will judge the lowly with fairness,

00:33:38.078 --> 00:33:41.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with uprightness he will give reproof

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:43.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
in behalf of the meek ones of the earth.”

00:33:45.085 --> 00:33:50.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
The authority that Jesus has been given
includes the authority to resurrect the dead.

00:33:50.757 --> 00:33:53.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s “the resurrection and the life.”

00:33:53.677 --> 00:33:55.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you know, we often say

00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:59.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah God knows everything
about those who have died,

00:33:59.141 --> 00:34:01.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s true.

00:34:01.184 --> 00:34:03.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
But since Jesus is doing the resurrecting,

00:34:03.854 --> 00:34:07.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s reasonable to conclude
that he also knows everything

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the dead and the living,

00:34:10.652 --> 00:34:14.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is going to be able
to resurrect them accurately.

00:34:14.406 --> 00:34:16.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, whether he’ll share
the power to resurrect

00:34:16.408 --> 00:34:19.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his anointed brothers
when they’re raised to heaven

00:34:19.077 --> 00:34:21.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
remains to be seen.

00:34:21.121 --> 00:34:23.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll stay tuned.

00:34:23.749 --> 00:34:27.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the takeaway
from this talk so far?

00:34:27.628 --> 00:34:31.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you explain it
to someone who wasn’t here today?

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:33.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
You would not say,

00:34:33.342 --> 00:34:35.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Some who died in Sodom and Gomorrah

00:34:35.427 --> 00:34:37.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in the Flood
are going to be resurrected,

00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:39.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Solomon isn’t going to be resurrected.”

00:34:39.181 --> 00:34:41.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, no.
You wouldn’t say that.

00:34:42.434 --> 00:34:46.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we’re saying
is that we shouldn’t be dogmatic

00:34:46.855 --> 00:34:50.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
about who will
and who will not be resurrected.

00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:53.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just don’t know.

00:34:53.278 --> 00:34:55.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we trust Jehovah God,

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
we trust Jesus Christ,

00:34:57.783 --> 00:35:00.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will do what is right.

00:35:03.455 --> 00:35:05.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know what you’re thinking.

00:35:06.708 --> 00:35:10.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
The wheels are turning,
and you’re saying to yourself:

00:35:10.796 --> 00:35:11.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Come on, come on.

00:35:11.922 --> 00:35:14.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We’ve talked about the Flood,

00:35:14.132 --> 00:35:16.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘we’ve talked about Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:35:16.635 --> 00:35:19.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but what about the great tribulation?

00:35:19.262 --> 00:35:23.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there anything
that we can or can’t say about that?’

00:35:23.517 --> 00:35:25.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, that’s a good question.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should talk about that.

00:35:28.563 --> 00:35:30.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what?
I think my time is up.

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:50.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
It looks like I have to finish
Brother Splane’s talk.

00:35:52.045 --> 00:35:55.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I don’t think you want me
to talk about anything else.

00:35:56.675 --> 00:36:01.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is the takeaway point
up to this time?

00:36:01.138 --> 00:36:03.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure we got the point.

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s helped us to think about our loving,
heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:36:07.561 --> 00:36:11.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the merciful Judge of the entire earth,

00:36:11.356 --> 00:36:13.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his Son, Jesus Christ.

00:36:13.608 --> 00:36:16.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we can trust them

00:36:16.153 --> 00:36:19.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make proper judgments.

00:36:19.156 --> 00:36:23.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah
and Jesus can read hearts.

00:36:23.035 --> 00:36:25.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they have a long record

00:36:25.328 --> 00:36:29.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
of living by the perfect standards of justice
that Jehovah has set up.

00:36:30.584 --> 00:36:33.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what about the future judgments

00:36:33.754 --> 00:36:35.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the great tribulation?

00:36:35.839 --> 00:36:40.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there something that we can adjust
with regard to our understanding?

00:36:40.385 --> 00:36:45.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, before we start to do that,
let’s be quite frank.

00:36:45.057 --> 00:36:47.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the last few years,
we’ve had a few changes

00:36:47.809 --> 00:36:51.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to the events
that occur during the great tribulation.

00:36:51.813 --> 00:36:54.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’ve been in the truth for a while,

00:36:54.024 --> 00:36:56.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes it’s a bit hard to remember,

00:36:56.026 --> 00:37:00.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Was that what we used to believe,
or is this what we believe now?’

00:37:01.198 --> 00:37:05.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to help us to make sure
that we’ve got some idea

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:09.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
of some of the events
that occur during the great tribulation,

00:37:09.581 --> 00:37:11.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s look at this review.

00:37:15.837 --> 00:37:18.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
What event starts the great tribulation?

00:37:19.007 --> 00:37:21.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
The destruction of Babylon the Great.

00:37:21.676 --> 00:37:24.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will be the time
when the political powers

00:37:24.679 --> 00:37:27.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
turn on the world empire of false religion,

00:37:27.182 --> 00:37:31.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
showing their disgust
for the symbolic prostitute.

00:37:31.061 --> 00:37:33.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will lead to the destruction

00:37:33.563 --> 00:37:36.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all false religious organizations.

00:37:38.193 --> 00:37:41.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
What event ends the great tribulation?

00:37:41.321 --> 00:37:43.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
The battle of Armageddon.

00:37:43.698 --> 00:37:47.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will be the final part
of the great tribulation.

00:37:47.494 --> 00:37:51.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus, along with the resurrected 144,000

00:37:51.748 --> 00:37:54.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and myriads of angels, will battle

00:37:54.126 --> 00:37:56.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all those who oppose Jehovah,

00:37:56.378 --> 00:37:59.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
his Kingdom, and his people here on earth.

00:37:59.840 --> 00:38:03.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will be “the war
of the great day of God the Almighty.”

00:38:05.804 --> 00:38:07.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that we have the start

00:38:07.973 --> 00:38:10.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the end of the great tribulation in mind,

00:38:10.642 --> 00:38:13.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s ask a few more questions.

00:38:13.353 --> 00:38:15.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long will that time period be

00:38:15.772 --> 00:38:17.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
from start to finish?

00:38:17.816 --> 00:38:21.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is we don’t know.

00:38:21.027 --> 00:38:23.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do know that many events

00:38:23.446 --> 00:38:26.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
are foretold to happen during that time period.

00:38:26.283 --> 00:38:28.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these events may all occur

00:38:28.618 --> 00:38:31.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a reasonably short period of time.

00:38:31.705 --> 00:38:33.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this discussion, though,

00:38:33.707 --> 00:38:36.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s focus on the few events that will occur

00:38:36.459 --> 00:38:39.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the end of the great tribulation.

00:38:40.172 --> 00:38:44.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
When does the attack of Gog of Magog occur?

00:38:44.092 --> 00:38:47.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t occur at the beginning
of the great tribulation

00:38:47.846 --> 00:38:51.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
but toward the end of that period of time.

00:38:51.016 --> 00:38:54.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
This attack on God’s people
by a coalition of nations

00:38:54.477 --> 00:38:57.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
will lead right
into the battle of Armageddon.

00:38:57.522 --> 00:39:01.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Gog’s attack will occur
just prior to Armageddon.

00:39:03.612 --> 00:39:06.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will the remaining ones of the anointed

00:39:06.531 --> 00:39:09.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
be gathered and taken to heaven?

00:39:09.326 --> 00:39:11.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible book of Ezekiel indicates

00:39:11.786 --> 00:39:14.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when Gog of Magog starts his attack,

00:39:14.623 --> 00:39:19.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of the anointed
will still be here on earth.

00:39:19.002 --> 00:39:22.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Revelation 17:14 tells us

00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:25.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when Jesus battles with the nations,

00:39:25.217 --> 00:39:29.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will come with those
“who are called and chosen,”

00:39:29.054 --> 00:39:33.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, all of the resurrected 144,000.

00:39:35.435 --> 00:39:39.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the final gathering
of his chosen ones must occur

00:39:39.522 --> 00:39:42.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the start of the attack of Gog of Magog

00:39:42.692 --> 00:39:45.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before the battle of Armageddon.

00:39:45.779 --> 00:39:49.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that the anointed
will be gathered and taken to heaven

00:39:49.741 --> 00:39:54.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the end of the great tribulation,
not at the beginning.

00:39:55.956 --> 00:40:00.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will the final judgment
of the sheep and the goats take place?

00:40:00.418 --> 00:40:03.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, although we can’t be dogmatic

00:40:03.004 --> 00:40:05.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to the exact sequence of events,

00:40:05.632 --> 00:40:08.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
it appears
that the final judgment takes place

00:40:08.677 --> 00:40:11.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of the great tribulation,

00:40:11.263 --> 00:40:13.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
not at the beginning.

00:40:13.265 --> 00:40:16.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will be the time
“when the Son of man comes in his glory,

00:40:16.935 --> 00:40:19.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all [his] angels with him.”

00:40:19.229 --> 00:40:22.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, there are a lot of other events

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are foretold to happen
during this time period,

00:40:25.568 --> 00:40:29.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for now,
let’s just focus on these few events,

00:40:29.531 --> 00:40:34.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of which will happen
just before the outbreak of Armageddon.

00:40:35.745 --> 00:40:37.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we learn from them?

00:40:37.872 --> 00:40:41.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Jesus’ judgment
of the sheep and the goats

00:40:41.334 --> 00:40:43.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the destruction of the wicked

00:40:43.378 --> 00:40:47.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
will take place
at the end of the great tribulation.

00:40:47.299 --> 00:40:50.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, there will be some
of the remaining ones

00:40:50.719 --> 00:40:52.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the anointed on earth

00:40:52.721 --> 00:40:55.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the start
of the attack of Gog of Magog,

00:40:55.682 --> 00:40:59.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
right at the end of the great tribulation.

00:40:59.060 --> 00:41:01.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, the judgment

00:41:01.396 --> 00:41:02.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the sheep and the goats

00:41:02.856 --> 00:41:04.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
will include their dealings

00:41:04.274 --> 00:41:05.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Christ’s brothers,

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:08.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
even during the great tribulation.

00:41:14.200 --> 00:41:18.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that is a review
of what we already believe.

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:20.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you were writing down notes
(“oh, that’s a new point”),

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
be careful what you say to others.

00:41:24.711 --> 00:41:27.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how do these basic facts

00:41:27.213 --> 00:41:29.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
(when we look at the things that occur

00:41:29.215 --> 00:41:32.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
toward the end of the great tribulation,
how do they)

00:41:32.552 --> 00:41:34.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
affect our understanding

00:41:34.888 --> 00:41:39.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s judgments
by means of Jesus Christ?

00:41:39.017 --> 00:41:42.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know that the closer
we get to the great tribulation,

00:41:42.979 --> 00:41:47.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
the clearer our understanding
is of what will occur.

00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:51.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our understanding is clarified
according to the proper time

00:41:51.821 --> 00:41:56.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also in a way that will help us
not only to endure the great tribulation

00:41:56.451 --> 00:42:00.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to prosper
during that period of time.

00:42:00.622 --> 00:42:02.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what we’re going to do

00:42:02.624 --> 00:42:07.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
is consider four very interesting questions.

00:42:10.382 --> 00:42:12.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and I’ve got some time left.

00:42:14.052 --> 00:42:16.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first question is,

00:42:16.554 --> 00:42:19.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once the great tribulation starts

00:42:19.432 --> 00:42:21.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
(we saw there in the chart

00:42:21.643 --> 00:42:26.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the destruction of Babylon the Great,
so once it starts),

00:42:26.064 --> 00:42:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there a door of opportunity

00:42:29.692 --> 00:42:33.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
for nonbelievers to actually join us

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:35.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
in serving Jehovah?

00:42:35.990 --> 00:42:38.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a door of opportunity?

00:42:38.576 --> 00:42:41.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have we said in the past?

00:42:41.037 --> 00:42:45.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve said,
“No, there will not be an opportunity

00:42:45.708 --> 00:42:48.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
for people to join us at that time.”

00:42:48.211 --> 00:42:50.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why did we say that?

00:42:50.463 --> 00:42:53.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, basically,
we viewed the account of the Flood

00:42:53.591 --> 00:42:57.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
as being a type and antitype portrayal.

00:42:57.303 --> 00:43:02.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thought the fact
that the door of the ark was closed

00:43:02.308 --> 00:43:04.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
prior to the Flood coming

00:43:04.602 --> 00:43:09.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicated that the door of opportunity
would close

00:43:09.149 --> 00:43:11.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
once the great tribulation started.

00:43:12.735 --> 00:43:17.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, it’s true;
Jesus did compare the time of Noah

00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:22.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the presence of him as a reigning King.

00:43:22.745 --> 00:43:25.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice, Jesus didn’t say anything

00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:28.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
that indicated
this was a type-antitype arrangement,

00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:31.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he certainly didn’t mention

00:43:31.337 --> 00:43:36.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
anything with regard
to a door of opportunity closing.

00:43:36.217 --> 00:43:39.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s think about that question again.

00:43:39.345 --> 00:43:42.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once the great tribulation starts,

00:43:42.724 --> 00:43:45.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there a door of opportunity still available?

00:43:45.935 --> 00:43:49.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to answer that, looking at this time chart,

00:43:49.063 --> 00:43:51.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember, the judgment

00:43:51.065 --> 00:43:53.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the sheep and the goats

00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:55.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the final judgment—occurs when?

00:43:55.278 --> 00:43:57.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at the beginning,

00:43:57.447 --> 00:44:01.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
but toward the end of the great tribulation.

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:05.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s think about some whom we know

00:44:05.288 --> 00:44:10.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
—perhaps unbelieving relatives,
disfellowshipped ones,

00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:14.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
others who have heard the message
and perhaps have studied with us.

00:44:14.130 --> 00:44:16.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could some of them,

00:44:16.424 --> 00:44:20.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
once they see the destruction
of Babylon the Great,

00:44:20.512 --> 00:44:24.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
decide that what Jehovah’s Witnesses
were saying

00:44:24.432 --> 00:44:26.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
is correct after all?

00:44:26.684 --> 00:44:30.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could they take a stand for the truth?

00:44:30.396 --> 00:44:35.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if they changed
their hearts and joined us,

00:44:35.193 --> 00:44:37.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
would we be disappointed?

00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:40.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we can’t be dogmatic,

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:45.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we don’t want to be like Jonah

00:44:45.828 --> 00:44:50.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say: “Oh, no, no.
The door is closed, no, no.”

00:44:52.043 --> 00:44:56.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, we need to remember
other cases in the Scriptures that help us

00:44:56.297 --> 00:44:59.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand how Jehovah as a merciful Judge

00:44:59.425 --> 00:45:01.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
has dealt with people in the past.

00:45:01.928 --> 00:45:05.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, think about the Israelites
when they left Egypt.

00:45:05.598 --> 00:45:07.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, if you turn with me

00:45:07.684 --> 00:45:10.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Exodus chapter 12,

00:45:10.895 --> 00:45:13.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exodus chapter 12,

00:45:13.189 --> 00:45:16.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read
the first part of verse 38.

00:45:16.359 --> 00:45:19.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here it’s describing the Exodus,

00:45:19.571 --> 00:45:22.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Exodus 12:38 says:

00:45:22.574 --> 00:45:25.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And a vast mixed company

00:45:25.827 --> 00:45:27.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
also went with them.”

00:45:27.996 --> 00:45:30.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now—do you notice?—
there’s a footnote there.

00:45:30.456 --> 00:45:32.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does it say?

00:45:32.083 --> 00:45:36.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is, a mixed company of non-Israelites,

00:45:36.462 --> 00:45:38.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Egyptians.”

00:45:39.966 --> 00:45:42.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what happened?

00:45:42.427 --> 00:45:47.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, during the time when the Ten Plagues
came upon the Egyptians,

00:45:47.307 --> 00:45:49.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
obviously some of these Egyptians

00:45:49.809 --> 00:45:52.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to see the distinction

00:45:52.270 --> 00:45:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Jehovah and the false gods
that they worshipped.

00:45:56.399 --> 00:45:59.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when decision time came

00:45:59.068 --> 00:46:01.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Israelites were leaving Egypt,

00:46:01.779 --> 00:46:05.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of these Egyptians
joined the Israelites.

00:46:05.575 --> 00:46:08.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, isn’t that interesting for us to note?

00:46:09.412 --> 00:46:12.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, we might be thinking:

00:46:12.290 --> 00:46:16.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yes, well, I understand why
we said what we did before,

00:46:16.461 --> 00:46:21.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘but is it really the case
that all these ones whom we’ve studied with

00:46:21.299 --> 00:46:24.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘or so on (some of them) may have a chance

00:46:24.218 --> 00:46:27.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to join us after Babylon the Great
is destroyed?

00:46:27.347 --> 00:46:29.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is that fair?

00:46:30.475 --> 00:46:33.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Last-minute repentance.’

00:46:34.854 --> 00:46:39.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you see, are we imitating
the merciful “Judge of all the earth”?

00:46:40.735 --> 00:46:44.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, we shouldn’t be surprised
if that were to happen, should we?

00:46:44.656 --> 00:46:46.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about it.

00:46:46.491 --> 00:46:50.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we looked at the time chart,
we saw that this is

00:46:50.828 --> 00:46:54.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
a time period prior to the final judgment.

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:59.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
So anyone who takes their stand for Jehovah
early in the great tribulation

00:46:59.295 --> 00:47:02.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
will still face the attack of Gog of Magog,

00:47:02.173 --> 00:47:04.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will be a very, very difficult time.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:09.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what do we need to note
with regard to this?

00:47:09.263 --> 00:47:14.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, just as in the first century,
in 66 C.E.,

00:47:14.185 --> 00:47:16.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
decision time came

00:47:16.479 --> 00:47:21.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many decided to go
and leave Jerusalem at that point.

00:47:21.484 --> 00:47:24.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, they made their decision

00:47:24.028 --> 00:47:28.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on what they already knew
and had heard.

00:47:28.032 --> 00:47:30.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, in a similar way,

00:47:30.243 --> 00:47:34.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
our preaching work today
is of utmost importance.

00:47:34.038 --> 00:47:36.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s notice what the apostle Paul said,

00:47:36.666 --> 00:47:39.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded in the book of Romans

00:47:39.419 --> 00:47:44.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Romans 10:13, 14.

00:47:44.257 --> 00:47:46.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we read this,

00:47:46.092 --> 00:47:49.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about the context
of what we’re talking about

00:47:49.262 --> 00:47:52.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when Babylon the Great is destroyed.

00:47:52.807 --> 00:47:57.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the time prior to that,
we see it says in verse 13:

00:47:57.645 --> 00:48:02.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For ‘everyone who calls
on the name of Jehovah will be saved.’

00:48:02.483 --> 00:48:05.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, how will they call on him

00:48:05.778 --> 00:48:08.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if they have not put faith in him?

00:48:08.406 --> 00:48:11.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How, in turn, will they put faith in him

00:48:11.701 --> 00:48:14.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about whom they have not heard?

00:48:14.370 --> 00:48:17.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How, in turn, will they hear

00:48:17.623 --> 00:48:20.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
without someone to preach?”

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:25.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see why our preaching work
is so urgent and important today?

00:48:26.549 --> 00:48:31.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, many take the opportunity
to make a decision right now.

00:48:32.305 --> 00:48:36.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
But could it be that once
the great tribulation starts,

00:48:36.809 --> 00:48:39.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
many who have heard the message

00:48:39.854 --> 00:48:42.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s Witnesses have preached

00:48:42.356 --> 00:48:44.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be in a position then

00:48:44.567 --> 00:48:47.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the right decision, the right choice?

00:48:47.945 --> 00:48:50.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, again, we can’t be dogmatic,

00:48:50.364 --> 00:48:54.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we certainly hope
that that would be the case.

00:48:54.243 --> 00:48:58.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while we’re talking about this,
let’s talk about the elephant in the room.

00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, what do we mean?

00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:02.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know, some of us in the past

00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
(we’re not going to mention names,
but yet some of us) have said:

00:49:07.256 --> 00:49:10.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, you know, my unbelieving relative—

00:49:10.301 --> 00:49:13.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope he dies before the great tribulation.”

00:49:13.179 --> 00:49:15.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aha!
We know what you’ve been saying.

00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:19.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve said: “Because if he dies
before the great tribulation,

00:49:19.894 --> 00:49:22.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he’ll have a chance of a resurrection.

00:49:22.396 --> 00:49:24.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
But during?
Uh-uh.”

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s think about that.

00:49:28.277 --> 00:49:32.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, does someone’s eternal salvation

00:49:32.073 --> 00:49:35.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
depend on when they die?

00:49:35.034 --> 00:49:39.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or does it depend on,
really, their heart condition?

00:49:39.163 --> 00:49:42.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the merciful Judge of the earth

00:49:42.458 --> 00:49:44.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
knows their heart condition.

00:49:44.877 --> 00:49:48.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, really, what are we thinking
if we ask that question?

00:49:48.089 --> 00:49:52.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, are we imagining Jehovah
saying to Jesus: “Look, at this person.

00:49:52.426 --> 00:49:54.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You know, they really should die forever.

00:49:54.846 --> 00:49:56.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But look at it!

00:49:56.264 --> 00:49:58.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They died now before the great tribulation.

00:49:58.266 --> 00:50:00.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, no!
We have to resurrect them”?

00:50:01.853 --> 00:50:03.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, really?

00:50:05.106 --> 00:50:09.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the righteous, merciful Judge.

00:50:09.527 --> 00:50:11.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows people’s hearts.

00:50:11.529 --> 00:50:13.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t fool him or trick him.

00:50:14.448 --> 00:50:18.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was the first question
I’m sure you found interesting, yeah?

00:50:18.661 --> 00:50:21.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once the great tribulation starts,

00:50:21.622 --> 00:50:24.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
does the door of opportunity close?

00:50:24.166 --> 00:50:26.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is, well,
we’ll have to wait and see.

00:50:26.544 --> 00:50:28.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
But according to the Scriptures,

00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:33.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is a possibility that some
can take a stand for the truth.

00:50:33.217 --> 00:50:35.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second question:

00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:39.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
When does the preaching
of the good news of the Kingdom finish?

00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:42.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good question.

00:50:42.101 --> 00:50:44.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a start, let’s remember

00:50:44.103 --> 00:50:48.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the good news is only good news
to us and to those who accept it.

00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:51.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Psalm 2 mentions, though,
for the rest of the world,

00:50:51.444 --> 00:50:54.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s never been good news, has it?

00:50:54.572 --> 00:50:58.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does Matthew 24:14 tell us?

00:50:58.409 --> 00:51:01.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
It tells us that ‘the good news
is going to be preached,’

00:51:01.662 --> 00:51:05.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “then the end will come.”

00:51:05.791 --> 00:51:07.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at our timeline again.

00:51:08.461 --> 00:51:12.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is “the end” referred to there?

00:51:12.048 --> 00:51:15.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s the final part of the great tribulation.

00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:19.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that means that during the great tribulation,

00:51:19.513 --> 00:51:21.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
the good news of the Kingdom

00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:22.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
will still be preached.

00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:25.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s still good news to us

00:51:25.186 --> 00:51:28.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not to the rest of the world.

00:51:28.439 --> 00:51:30.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
That good news will become

00:51:30.441 --> 00:51:33.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
more hard-hitting as time goes on,

00:51:33.861 --> 00:51:37.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
causing people to make
a decision one way or the other,

00:51:37.782 --> 00:51:40.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether they accept the Kingdom or not.

00:51:41.786 --> 00:51:45.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
So isn’t that yet another reason
why we shouldn’t be surprised

00:51:45.873 --> 00:51:48.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some may take a stand for the truth

00:51:48.834 --> 00:51:50.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
even during the great tribulation?

00:51:52.046 --> 00:51:53.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third question:

00:51:54.632 --> 00:51:58.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
All those who die
during the great tribulation,

00:51:58.761 --> 00:52:01.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
will they go into eternal death

00:52:01.305 --> 00:52:03.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and never be resurrected?

00:52:05.017 --> 00:52:08.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, initially, we can say the goats

00:52:08.562 --> 00:52:10.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not going to be resurrected
—are they?—

00:52:10.690 --> 00:52:14.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they’re
going to “everlasting cutting off,”

00:52:14.151 --> 00:52:16.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to what Jesus said.

00:52:16.278 --> 00:52:18.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 2 Thessalonians chapter 1,

00:52:18.781 --> 00:52:22.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
it speaks of the “punishment
of everlasting destruction”

00:52:22.785 --> 00:52:24.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
being meted out.

00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:27.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what time period are we talking about?

00:52:27.331 --> 00:52:29.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look at our timeline again.

00:52:29.458 --> 00:52:33.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, this is referring to the time

00:52:33.045 --> 00:52:37.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus comes with his holy ones.

00:52:37.216 --> 00:52:39.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
So looking at our timeline,

00:52:39.427 --> 00:52:41.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does it show us?

00:52:41.470 --> 00:52:46.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
That this is at the very end of the great tribulation

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:51.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
when people are judged as being goats.

00:52:51.272 --> 00:52:56.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Specifically,
they have been given this judgment.

00:52:56.277 --> 00:52:59.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there are some other questions
that come up.

00:52:59.613 --> 00:53:02.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, these ones who are judged as goats

00:53:02.283 --> 00:53:04.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
(those who receive everlasting destruction)

00:53:04.785 --> 00:53:09.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
obviously have had adequate
opportunity (have had a full opportunity)

00:53:09.498 --> 00:53:12.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accept or reject the Kingdom.

00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:16.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about those prior
to that final judgment?

00:53:16.630 --> 00:53:19.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the great tribulation starts.

00:53:19.508 --> 00:53:21.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re not sure how long it goes,

00:53:21.719 --> 00:53:26.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
but each day it goes on,
there are people who no doubt will die.

00:53:26.557 --> 00:53:29.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you realize that every day worldwide

00:53:29.769 --> 00:53:32.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 150,000 people die

00:53:32.772 --> 00:53:37.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
either of natural causes or wars,
sicknesses, and so on?

00:53:37.818 --> 00:53:40.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what about those ones?

00:53:40.571 --> 00:53:44.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not actually killed
by Jehovah as a punishment.

00:53:44.825 --> 00:53:47.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we need to remember?

00:53:47.328 --> 00:53:52.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
The merciful Judge knows
who should be resurrected

00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:54.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who shouldn’t be resurrected.

00:53:54.418 --> 00:53:59.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can’t be dogmatic
about those ones who may die at that time.

00:53:59.423 --> 00:54:03.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah
and Jesus will do the right thing.

00:54:04.637 --> 00:54:08.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, another final interesting question:

00:54:09.475 --> 00:54:14.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will all those living
during the great tribulation

00:54:14.438 --> 00:54:18.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
have a full opportunity

00:54:18.526 --> 00:54:21.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
to decide either
for the Kingdom or against it?

00:54:23.114 --> 00:54:25.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you answer?

00:54:25.116 --> 00:54:26.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t say it out loud.

00:54:28.327 --> 00:54:32.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
The simple answer is, we don’t know,

00:54:33.749 --> 00:54:38.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we don’t need to know
because we’re not the judges.

00:54:38.087 --> 00:54:40.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s above our pay grade.

00:54:41.841 --> 00:54:45.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, there may be a little voice
in you saying: ‘But why don’t we know?

00:54:45.261 --> 00:54:49.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, I’ve always believed
that during that time, that’s it.’

00:54:50.432 --> 00:54:53.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you see, each day, as we mentioned,

00:54:53.811 --> 00:54:57.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
150,000 people on average die,

00:54:57.022 --> 00:55:02.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
but 350,000 new babies are born each day.

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:06.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even if the great tribulation
was only a few days long,

00:55:06.615 --> 00:55:10.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
each day you’ve got more babies being born.

00:55:10.870 --> 00:55:14.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about areas where the good news

00:55:14.456 --> 00:55:17.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
hasn’t reached to the greatest extent,

00:55:17.084 --> 00:55:20.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe in lands where our work is restricted?

00:55:20.296 --> 00:55:25.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might be wondering, ‘Well, will we get
to preach to every individual?’

00:55:25.301 --> 00:55:28.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 10:23, if you look at it later,

00:55:28.596 --> 00:55:31.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
seems to indicate that maybe we won’t.

00:55:31.682 --> 00:55:34.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, now, here’s an interesting question:

00:55:34.727 --> 00:55:39.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it reasonable for us to say
that Jehovah and Jesus

00:55:39.565 --> 00:55:43.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
automatically label millions
of people as goats

00:55:43.569 --> 00:55:48.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they have never
had a full opportunity to respond?

00:55:49.116 --> 00:55:51.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interesting question.

00:55:51.243 --> 00:55:55.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they haven’t had a full opportunity
and they die at that time,

00:55:55.873 --> 00:55:59.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
is it possible
that they may receive a resurrection

00:55:59.460 --> 00:56:01.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
as unrighteous persons?

00:56:01.754 --> 00:56:03.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the answer?

00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:05.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
We simply don’t know.

00:56:05.925 --> 00:56:07.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t be dogmatic,

00:56:07.927 --> 00:56:11.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we shouldn’t be dogmatic
because we don’t know.

00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:17.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, rather, let’s take comfort
in what we do know.

00:56:17.811 --> 00:56:19.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do we know?

00:56:19.647 --> 00:56:23.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah and Jesus are merciful,

00:56:23.234 --> 00:56:26.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they will always do the right thing.

00:56:26.153 --> 00:56:29.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ezekiel 33:11, what does it say?

00:56:29.907 --> 00:56:33.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah takes no delight
in the death of a wicked person.’

00:56:33.744 --> 00:56:35.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants them to change.

00:56:35.955 --> 00:56:40.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that Jehovah and Jesus
will judge each individual

00:56:40.292 --> 00:56:44.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a balanced, righteous, and merciful way.

00:56:45.506 --> 00:56:47.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, at this point, you think:

00:56:47.591 --> 00:56:50.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Wow!
That’s a lot to take in.’

00:56:51.053 --> 00:56:54.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe your hand
is a little tired from taking notes.

00:56:54.265 --> 00:56:55.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry.

00:56:55.766 --> 00:56:57.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
An upcoming <i>Watchtower</i>

00:56:57.601 --> 00:57:02.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to give us all the details on this,
so stay tuned.

00:57:02.564 --> 00:57:06.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the meantime,
what do we need to keep doing?

00:57:06.026 --> 00:57:10.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to keep preaching the message
to as many people as possible.

00:57:10.614 --> 00:57:14.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have no idea what results
may come from that.

00:57:14.451 --> 00:57:17.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we keep on preaching, remember,

00:57:17.162 --> 00:57:21.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
leave the judging to Jehovah and Jesus!

00:57:21.208 --> 00:57:24.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will <i>always</i>  do the right thing,

00:57:24.461 --> 00:57:26.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
the merciful and just thing.

00:57:26.672 --> 00:57:30.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of that we can be absolutely confident!

00:57:48.193 --> 00:57:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I was going to ask you,
Wasn’t that exciting?

00:57:50.446 --> 00:57:52.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look at that applause.

00:57:52.448 --> 00:57:55.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve answered that question already.

00:57:55.326 --> 00:57:58.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was outstanding and so very touching.

00:57:58.662 --> 00:58:02.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank you, dear brothers,
for presenting those parts for us.

00:58:02.416 --> 00:58:06.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Above all, we’re grateful
to our heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:58:06.754 --> 00:58:11.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
who continues
to help us to see things as he does.

00:58:11.633 --> 00:58:15.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we leave so much in his wonderful hands

00:58:15.346 --> 00:58:17.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the hands of his Son.

00:58:17.723 --> 00:58:20.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, next on our program,

00:58:20.267 --> 00:58:23.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
we look forward
to viewing a new video entitled

00:58:23.604 --> 00:58:25.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend </i>

00:58:25.939 --> 00:58:28.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>—You Are Precious to Jehovah.</i>

00:58:28.150 --> 00:58:30.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that fitting?
Let’s enjoy the video.

00:58:44.333 --> 00:58:46.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good morning, students.

00:58:46.293 --> 00:58:51.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is your Principal Rodriguez,
and I’m very happy to announce that soon

00:58:51.131 --> 00:58:54.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to have
our annual holiday party.

00:58:54.426 --> 00:58:56.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that exciting?

00:58:56.011 --> 00:58:59.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
So get ready for games, treats, and more.

00:58:59.390 --> 00:59:00.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s gonna be great!

00:59:00.974 --> 00:59:01.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:02.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:59:02.684 --> 00:59:03.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s party time!

00:59:04.728 --> 00:59:05.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah!

00:59:05.562 --> 00:59:06.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, everybody.

00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Settle down.

00:59:08.273 --> 00:59:09.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see you all tomorrow.

00:59:15.364 --> 00:59:18.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you there, Sophia.

00:59:18.075 --> 00:59:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, wait.
You can’t go.

00:59:25.624 --> 00:59:27.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s all for today!

00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:30.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
What? Oh, OK, that’s right.
Thank you!

00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:33.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I go, we’d like to announce

00:59:33.757 --> 00:59:36.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
the award for student of the month,

00:59:36.218 --> 00:59:37.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
which goes to . . .

00:59:37.636 --> 00:59:39.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Caleb!
Way to go!

00:59:42.474 --> 00:59:44.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!
Look at Caleb!

00:59:44.476 --> 00:59:46.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s my little brother.

00:59:46.728 --> 00:59:49.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s help,
he tries to be good in school.

00:59:49.648 --> 00:59:51.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like learning about Jehovah.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:53.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready to study?

00:59:53.861 --> 00:59:55.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh!
I’ll get my book.

00:59:55.779 --> 00:59:57.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll meet you outside.

00:59:57.406 --> 00:59:58.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK!

01:00:05.914 --> 01:00:07.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Zoe.

01:00:08.417 --> 01:00:10.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, hey.

01:00:10.502 --> 01:00:12.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
What ya doing?

01:00:12.463 --> 01:00:16.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Um, I’m just about to meet . . .

01:00:16.049 --> 01:00:18.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . Sophia.

01:00:18.135 --> 01:00:20.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you hang out with her?

01:00:21.763 --> 01:00:24.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s so . . .

01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:25.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Different?

01:00:26.643 --> 01:00:27.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Weird.

01:00:32.357 --> 01:00:36.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
She never does anything fun.

01:00:37.696 --> 01:00:40.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean you’re different, Zoe.

01:00:41.533 --> 01:00:43.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in a cool way.

01:00:44.203 --> 01:00:48.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should hang out with us—not that loser.

01:00:48.707 --> 01:00:52.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Angela, please see me immediately.

01:00:53.795 --> 01:00:56.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
See ya later, Zoe.

01:01:06.808 --> 01:01:10.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it bother you
that others think you’re different?

01:01:11.438 --> 01:01:12.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

01:01:15.609 --> 01:01:18.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the other kids say things 

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:22.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
like it’s weird you can’t celebrate holidays

01:01:22.908 --> 01:01:25.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that you can’t have fun.

01:01:28.372 --> 01:01:29.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

01:01:29.915 --> 01:01:32.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who says we can’t have fun?

01:01:51.144 --> 01:01:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course we can have fun.

01:01:53.689 --> 01:01:58.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be hard sometimes,
but it’s good to be different,

01:01:58.151 --> 01:02:00.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Jesus.

01:02:00.237 --> 01:02:02.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jesus?

01:02:03.156 --> 01:02:06.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s right!
We learn a lot about him at family worship.

01:02:08.245 --> 01:02:11.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible, Jesus said his followers

01:02:11.164 --> 01:02:13.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be “no part of the world.”

01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:17.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think it means
to be “no part of the world”?

01:02:18.672 --> 01:02:19.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

01:02:27.139 --> 01:02:28.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whoa!

01:02:28.181 --> 01:02:29.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whoa!

01:02:33.478 --> 01:02:38.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:02:38.525 --> 01:02:42.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
six, five, four,

01:02:42.279 --> 01:02:45.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
three, two, one.

01:02:45.616 --> 01:02:49.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have liftoff!

01:03:02.633 --> 01:03:05.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good guess.

01:03:05.135 --> 01:03:07.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we don’t have to leave the planet.

01:03:09.014 --> 01:03:11.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that he did not want
to take his followers

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:13.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“out of the world” but . . .

01:03:14.394 --> 01:03:16.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . that they should be
“no part of the world”!

01:03:17.356 --> 01:03:19.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right, honey.

01:03:20.317 --> 01:03:22.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
What else did Jesus say?

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are no part of the world,

01:03:27.324 --> 01:03:30.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as I am no part of the world.”

01:03:31.203 --> 01:03:34.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
How was Jesus “no part of the world”?

01:03:35.207 --> 01:03:36.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see!

01:03:37.292 --> 01:03:40.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was different from everyone else,

01:03:40.379 --> 01:03:42.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so were his friends.

01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:44.216 line:10% position:50% align:center
He showed others

01:03:44.216 --> 01:03:46.468 line:10% position:50% align:center
how to be different in what they did,

01:03:47.344 --> 01:03:50.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they said, and even how they thought.

01:03:52.307 --> 01:03:54.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really?
How?

01:03:55.018 --> 01:03:58.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
People aren’t always nice
to others they think are different.

01:04:00.524 --> 01:04:02.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus wanted to help everyone.

01:04:02.693 --> 01:04:06.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that made some people very angry.

01:04:06.697 --> 01:04:09.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted Jesus to be more like them.

01:04:10.409 --> 01:04:13.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he didn’t worry about what they thought,

01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
because whom did Jesus want to be like?

01:04:16.623 --> 01:04:18.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah!

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:20.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

01:04:20.168 --> 01:04:22.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said that those who obeyed his voice

01:04:22.212 --> 01:04:24.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
were special to him.

01:04:24.464 --> 01:04:27.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you love and obey Jehovah

01:04:27.259 --> 01:04:30.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you are “no part of the world”
like Jesus, . . .

01:04:30.971 --> 01:04:32.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . that makes you special to Him!

01:04:36.268 --> 01:04:38.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know if I could ever be like you.

01:04:43.525 --> 01:04:45.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

01:04:46.778 --> 01:04:49.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, OK, settle down.

01:04:53.952 --> 01:04:58.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.
I-I gotta go.

01:05:28.028 --> 01:05:31.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you love and obey Jehovah,
that makes you special to him!

01:06:05.065 --> 01:06:06.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

01:06:06.191 --> 01:06:07.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a leper!

01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:24.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get away!

01:06:24.459 --> 01:06:26.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t want you here!

01:07:06.042 --> 01:07:08.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is he doing?

01:07:08.086 --> 01:07:10.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
He shouldn’t be here!

01:07:10.463 --> 01:07:12.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lord,

01:07:12.173 --> 01:07:15.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you just want to,

01:07:15.135 --> 01:07:17.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can make me clean.

01:07:23.894 --> 01:07:25.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to!

01:07:27.647 --> 01:07:29.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be made clean.

01:07:31.776 --> 01:07:33.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a miracle!

01:07:41.328 --> 01:07:43.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe this?

01:07:43.455 --> 01:07:45.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus isn’t one of us.

01:07:51.379 --> 01:07:53.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was different

01:07:53.173 --> 01:07:55.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what he did, said, and thought.

01:08:00.305 --> 01:08:01.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry about your grandma.

01:08:01.973 --> 01:08:03.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is for you.

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will help you feel better.

01:08:05.477 --> 01:08:06.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

01:08:07.270 --> 01:08:10.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that made some people very angry.

01:08:11.274 --> 01:08:12.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uhhh!

01:08:17.656 --> 01:08:19.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oops, I didn’t see you there.

01:08:20.784 --> 01:08:22.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you OK?

01:08:23.703 --> 01:08:25.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me help.

01:08:27.207 --> 01:08:29.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes they pick on me too.

01:08:31.252 --> 01:08:35.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
People aren’t always nice to others
whom they think are different.

01:08:35.548 --> 01:08:39.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should hang out with us—not that loser.

01:08:40.971 --> 01:08:44.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jesus wanted to be
like his Father, Jehovah,

01:08:44.599 --> 01:08:47.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s what made him special.

01:08:49.813 --> 01:08:51.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, darling, how was your study with Sophia?

01:08:52.774 --> 01:08:56.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom, there’s something I want to show you.

01:08:56.277 --> 01:08:58.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, OK.

01:09:06.454 --> 01:09:08.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, everyone,

01:09:08.456 --> 01:09:10.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoy the holiday party!

01:09:15.213 --> 01:09:16.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Zoe,

01:09:16.548 --> 01:09:19.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
aren’t you coming?

01:09:28.101 --> 01:09:30.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me show you how it’s done.

01:09:32.814 --> 01:09:34.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, guys!

01:09:34.774 --> 01:09:36.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
You didn’t go to the party?

01:09:37.402 --> 01:09:39.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.
I want to do the right thing.

01:09:42.615 --> 01:09:45.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
Let’s have some fun!

01:09:48.496 --> 01:09:51.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ugh.
Not again!

01:10:08.308 --> 01:10:12.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we certainly cherish
these beautiful videos, don’t we?

01:10:12.687 --> 01:10:14.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with that in mind,

01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:18.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
would you like to know
what is happening at the Ramapo site

01:10:18.526 --> 01:10:22.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as
the video production in Australasia?

01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:23.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you’ll enjoy this.

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:26.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s give our attention to Brother Lett

01:10:26.201 --> 01:10:28.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he provides an update for us

01:10:28.745 --> 01:10:33.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his part that is titled
“Jehovah’s Chariot Is on the Move.”

01:10:34.834 --> 01:10:37.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad you indicated you want to hear this.

01:10:41.257 --> 01:10:45.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Samuel 15:1

01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us that Absalom,

01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:52.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was trying to usurp the throne,

01:10:52.602 --> 01:10:56.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a royal chariot built for himself.

01:10:56.189 --> 01:10:59.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was pulled by majestic horses.

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:02.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fifty men ran ahead of that chariot.

01:11:02.654 --> 01:11:04.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as impressive

01:11:04.823 --> 01:11:08.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
as that chariot and rider
may have seemed to many,

01:11:08.993 --> 01:11:12.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
compared to the celestial chariot

01:11:12.330 --> 01:11:14.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in Ezekiel chapter 1,

01:11:14.666 --> 01:11:18.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absalom’s chariot would be a sluggish,

01:11:18.253 --> 01:11:20.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
minuscule rattletrap.

01:11:22.632 --> 01:11:27.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we know, that chariot
mentioned in Ezekiel chapter 1

01:11:27.637 --> 01:11:30.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
represents the heavenly part

01:11:30.473 --> 01:11:32.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s organization.

01:11:32.809 --> 01:11:35.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is the rider of this chariot?

01:11:35.395 --> 01:11:37.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah himself.

01:11:37.397 --> 01:11:39.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is he depicted this way?

01:11:39.858 --> 01:11:42.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah lovingly controls

01:11:42.193 --> 01:11:45.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
the movements of his organization

01:11:45.446 --> 01:11:48.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish his will and purpose.

01:11:48.908 --> 01:11:52.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder Ezekiel 1:18

01:11:52.412 --> 01:11:56.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes the rims
of the wheels of the chariot

01:11:56.833 --> 01:11:59.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
as having “eyes all around”!

01:11:59.294 --> 01:12:03.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
All-seeing Jehovah directs everything.

01:12:04.424 --> 01:12:07.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the speed of Jehovah’s chariot?

01:12:07.969 --> 01:12:10.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absalom’s chariot may have been able
to reach speeds

01:12:10.763 --> 01:12:13.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
of up to 45 miles an hour (72 km/hr)

01:12:13.349 --> 01:12:15.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the speed of a racehorse.

01:12:15.351 --> 01:12:17.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about Jehovah’s chariot?

01:12:17.604 --> 01:12:22.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in the Bible in verse 14 of chapter 1,

01:12:22.525 --> 01:12:25.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
it describes its movements

01:12:25.361 --> 01:12:29.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
in comparison with “flashes of lightning.”

01:12:30.617 --> 01:12:32.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a flash of lightning

01:12:32.994 --> 01:12:35.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
travels at 186,000 miles per second
(300,000 km/sec),

01:12:35.788 --> 01:12:37.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
the speed of light.

01:12:37.373 --> 01:12:40.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we think about it,
Jehovah’s chariot is a lot faster than that.

01:12:40.835 --> 01:12:42.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we could say

01:12:42.962 --> 01:12:46.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
it travels at the speed of thought,

01:12:46.049 --> 01:12:48.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the speed of Jehovah’s thought.

01:12:48.927 --> 01:12:53.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And obviously
that would be immeasurably fast.

01:12:53.348 --> 01:12:57.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we can’t see into the invisible realm

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how Jehovah is using
the heavenly part of his organization

01:13:01.439 --> 01:13:04.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
with lightning speed
to accomplish his will and purpose,

01:13:04.943 --> 01:13:08.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can see how fast things are moving

01:13:08.613 --> 01:13:12.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the visible part
of Jehovah’s organization.

01:13:12.784 --> 01:13:14.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that only makes sense
—doesn’t it?—

01:13:14.619 --> 01:13:19.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the earthly part
is closely related to the heavenly

01:13:19.249 --> 01:13:21.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is actually a reflection

01:13:21.417 --> 01:13:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the heavenly part
of Jehovah’s organization.

01:13:25.088 --> 01:13:27.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the foregoing discussion

01:13:27.632 --> 01:13:31.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
brings us to what Brother Cook mentioned

01:13:31.094 --> 01:13:36.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
are updates of two fast-moving projects

01:13:36.057 --> 01:13:39.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah obviously is directing,

01:13:39.227 --> 01:13:42.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to get brought up to speed.

01:13:42.522 --> 01:13:44.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
You like the way I used that
—right?—

01:13:44.357 --> 01:13:49.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
up to speed,
since we’re talking about moving.

01:13:49.153 --> 01:13:51.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
But things are happening,

01:13:51.155 --> 01:13:54.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah certainly is directing matters.

01:13:54.826 --> 01:13:56.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, as mentioned,

01:13:56.411 --> 01:14:00.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to have an update
regarding the audio/video facility

01:14:00.581 --> 01:14:04.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
being built at Ramapo, New York.

01:14:04.210 --> 01:14:08.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you’ll probably recall

01:14:08.214 --> 01:14:12.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s being built on property
that the organization already owned.

01:14:12.885 --> 01:14:16.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s conveniently located
only two miles (3 km)

01:14:16.264 --> 01:14:20.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our world headquarters facility
at Warwick.

01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:23.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a very interesting side point is

01:14:23.730 --> 01:14:26.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body tried for several years
(really hard)

01:14:26.899 --> 01:14:29.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
to sell this property

01:14:29.277 --> 01:14:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
with absolutely no results.

01:14:33.281 --> 01:14:36.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we came to realize

01:14:36.034 --> 01:14:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this is ideal property

01:14:38.494 --> 01:14:41.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build a much-needed facility

01:14:41.748 --> 01:14:44.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can consolidate onto one site

01:14:44.834 --> 01:14:48.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
the functions currently being done
on many different properties

01:14:48.796 --> 01:14:50.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one site to produce

01:14:50.923 --> 01:14:55.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
our audio/video and beautiful artwork.

01:14:55.595 --> 01:14:59.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is just another example
of Jehovah’s eyes seeing things.

01:14:59.932 --> 01:15:04.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we think of his words in Psalm 32.

01:15:04.437 --> 01:15:09.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please go there—Psalm 32:8.

01:15:09.025 --> 01:15:13.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says: “I will give you insight

01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:17.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and instruct you in the way you should go.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:19.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will give you advice

01:15:19.577 --> 01:15:22.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my eye upon you.”

01:15:22.622 --> 01:15:26.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is obviously
lovingly directing things.

01:15:26.042 --> 01:15:28.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m sure you’d like to see this video now

01:15:28.336 --> 01:15:30.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will give you an update

01:15:30.338 --> 01:15:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what is happening there at Ramapo.

01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:36.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
So enjoy the video.

01:15:38.888 --> 01:15:41.766 line:10% position:50% align:center
The specific purpose of the Ramapo project

01:15:41.766 --> 01:15:44.644 line:10% position:50% align:center
is to bring all media facilities

01:15:44.644 --> 01:15:46.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
under one roof.

01:15:47.897 --> 01:15:51.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a project begins,
we always want things to move fast.

01:15:51.109 --> 01:15:52.860 line:10% position:50% align:center
But sometimes the reality is

01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:53.945 line:10% position:50% align:center
that it doesn’t happen as fast

01:15:53.945 --> 01:15:55.029 line:10% position:50% align:center
as we would like it to.

01:15:55.029 --> 01:15:57.365 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s been several years

01:15:57.365 --> 01:15:59.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
of some pretty dynamic planning,

01:15:59.409 --> 01:16:01.452 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we’ve seen a lot of twists and turns

01:16:01.452 --> 01:16:02.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
and changes along the way.

01:16:02.912 --> 01:16:04.539 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’ve had a number of challenges

01:16:04.539 --> 01:16:05.873 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the Ramapo project.

01:16:07.917 --> 01:16:09.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the state of New York,

01:16:09.919 --> 01:16:13.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s only a certain season
when you can take trees down.

01:16:13.631 --> 01:16:15.758 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re only allowed to remove trees

01:16:15.758 --> 01:16:19.429 line:10% position:50% align:center
between November and the end of March.

01:16:19.429 --> 01:16:24.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
The town board approved the special permit
for us to be able to cut the trees.

01:16:24.016 --> 01:16:26.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
when we went to exercise that permit,

01:16:26.978 --> 01:16:29.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
we realized that another agency

01:16:29.063 --> 01:16:33.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
still had to give their permission
for us to be able to use it,

01:16:33.317 --> 01:16:34.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we didn’t get.

01:16:34.819 --> 01:16:36.696 line:10% position:50% align:center
Originally we had planned

01:16:36.696 --> 01:16:39.490 line:10% position:50% align:center
about 12 weeks to do all of this work.

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:42.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that 12 weeks
included using mechanized equipment.

01:16:42.910 --> 01:16:45.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that wasn’t accomplished,
we would be waiting an entire year

01:16:45.997 --> 01:16:47.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to cut those trees.

01:16:47.999 --> 01:16:51.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the window started closing
from 12 weeks to 8 weeks

01:16:51.419 --> 01:16:53.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the way down to 6 weeks.

01:16:53.421 --> 01:16:57.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then somehow,
something in the permitting language

01:16:57.091 --> 01:17:00.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
opened our eyes to a new possibility

01:17:00.052 --> 01:17:03.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
that allowed us to take the trees down
in a different way.

01:17:03.556 --> 01:17:05.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got permission to cut the trees,

01:17:05.933 --> 01:17:08.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we had to cut the trees all by hand.

01:17:09.562 --> 01:17:10.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in four weeks,

01:17:10.813 --> 01:17:12.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
we used an outside contractor

01:17:12.565 --> 01:17:14.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take down all the trees
that we needed . . .

01:17:15.776 --> 01:17:18.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . two weeks early
of the end of the tree-cutting season.

01:17:20.573 --> 01:17:23.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every single day
there’s still much work to be done

01:17:23.743 --> 01:17:25.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get us the needed permits.

01:17:25.703 --> 01:17:27.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
The design is continuing,

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:29.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the estimating for the project
is continuing.

01:17:29.582 --> 01:17:30.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
That hasn’t stopped.

01:17:30.750 --> 01:17:32.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
That hasn’t slowed up one bit.

01:17:33.628 --> 01:17:36.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of some of the delays
that we experienced,

01:17:36.464 --> 01:17:39.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a need to reassign
some of our brothers and sisters

01:17:39.759 --> 01:17:41.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
within the organization.

01:17:41.219 --> 01:17:42.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had these willing volunteers.

01:17:42.887 --> 01:17:46.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were skilled; they were trained;
they were willing to do whatever was needed,

01:17:46.432 --> 01:17:49.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we just didn’t have
the work for them at the time.

01:17:51.854 --> 01:17:54.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to communicate
with different departments

01:17:54.357 --> 01:17:56.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the branch and at headquarters.

01:17:57.568 --> 01:18:00.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it just so happened
that many of these departments

01:18:00.696 --> 01:18:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
had been praying for additional help.

01:18:03.866 --> 01:18:05.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers had a meeting with us,
and they said:

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:09.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We know you’re not 100 percent busy
like you want to be.

01:18:09.539 --> 01:18:12.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We’ll be giving a number of you
new assignments.

01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:15.461 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Most of you will go out for a while

01:18:15.461 --> 01:18:17.547 line:10% position:50% align:center
while we get our permits and come back.”

01:18:17.547 --> 01:18:19.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said that I would be going into CDE,

01:18:19.715 --> 01:18:22.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t even know what that was:
Computer Department Engineering.

01:18:22.927 --> 01:18:24.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:
‘That’s way above me.

01:18:24.971 --> 01:18:26.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a construction girl.’

01:18:26.597 --> 01:18:28.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
But actually, I’ve loved it.

01:18:28.683 --> 01:18:29.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned so much.

01:18:30.434 --> 01:18:31.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the team that I’ve worked with,

01:18:31.936 --> 01:18:35.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve gotten close to them,
and it’s been a wonderful change.

01:18:35.189 --> 01:18:38.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really shown us that Jehovah
is going to take care of us.

01:18:38.192 --> 01:18:40.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
For us to be at Ramapo

01:18:40.778 --> 01:18:44.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
was one of the most amazing privileges
we’ve ever had.

01:18:44.323 --> 01:18:46.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re still working for Jehovah

01:18:46.826 --> 01:18:49.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
and right in the center of his organization.

01:18:49.495 --> 01:18:52.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
These brothers and sisters
are real men and women of faith,

01:18:52.748 --> 01:18:56.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping to advance Kingdom interests
in all these other areas.

01:18:56.377 --> 01:19:00.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, when we hit some of these points
where maybe we were waiting on approvals,

01:19:00.298 --> 01:19:01.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work did not stop.

01:19:01.924 --> 01:19:05.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
The time has allowed us
to work with the Bethel departments,

01:19:05.636 --> 01:19:08.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work with the Governing Body committees,

01:19:08.639 --> 01:19:13.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work with our outside
expert audio/video design teams.

01:19:13.603 --> 01:19:18.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so because of that,
the buildings themselves have changed.

01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:22.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was looked into.
How could flexible spaces be created?

01:19:22.111 --> 01:19:24.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also how
could some of these spaces be shared

01:19:24.572 --> 01:19:26.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe between different departments

01:19:26.198 --> 01:19:28.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the best use
of the property that we have?

01:19:28.868 --> 01:19:31.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Art Department
will be in the same building

01:19:31.037 --> 01:19:32.955 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the other aspects of media

01:19:32.955 --> 01:19:35.374 line:10% position:50% align:center
—the audio part and the video part—

01:19:35.374 --> 01:19:37.251 line:10% position:50% align:center
so that when we need to collaborate,

01:19:37.251 --> 01:19:40.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will be much easier to work together

01:19:40.254 --> 01:19:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we can make
the very best possible product.

01:19:44.008 --> 01:19:48.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a state-of-the-art audio/video
and art production facility.

01:19:48.137 --> 01:19:51.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
The process of designing that
and getting it to stay ahead

01:19:51.766 --> 01:19:54.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
of not only the ever-changing technologies
that we see in the industry

01:19:55.978 --> 01:19:58.356 line:10% position:50% align:center
but also the needs for the organization

01:19:58.356 --> 01:20:00.566 line:10% position:50% align:center
is a dynamic process.

01:20:00.566 --> 01:20:02.443 line:10% position:50% align:center
The facility has been designed

01:20:02.443 --> 01:20:04.570 line:10% position:50% align:center
and will be constructed in such a way

01:20:04.570 --> 01:20:07.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if modifications need to be made later

01:20:07.114 --> 01:20:09.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep up with technology,

01:20:09.158 --> 01:20:11.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t have to deconstruct the building

01:20:11.452 --> 01:20:13.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to implement those changes.

01:20:14.789 --> 01:20:16.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve developed beautiful studios

01:20:16.957 --> 01:20:19.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be functional not only now

01:20:19.168 --> 01:20:21.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for future projects.

01:20:22.004 --> 01:20:24.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
One exciting feature of the media center

01:20:24.215 --> 01:20:27.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be the use of video walls
for virtual production.

01:20:27.885 --> 01:20:32.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we’ve already begun filming
with this new technology here at Patterson.

01:20:32.598 --> 01:20:34.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
With these video walls,

01:20:34.934 --> 01:20:37.812 line:10% position:50% align:center
we can create digital backgrounds

01:20:37.812 --> 01:20:40.147 line:10% position:50% align:center
that can be used to give the appearance

01:20:40.147 --> 01:20:43.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are shooting it
in a foreign location.

01:20:43.984 --> 01:20:47.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
made it very clear that their focus

01:20:47.446 --> 01:20:49.407 line:10% position:50% align:center
was the spirituality of those

01:20:49.407 --> 01:20:51.200 line:10% position:50% align:center
who are involved in our productions.

01:20:51.200 --> 01:20:55.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the friends have to be off-site
for long periods of time filming,

01:20:55.079 --> 01:20:57.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can really disrupt
their spiritual routine.

01:20:57.873 --> 01:21:01.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Virtual production will allow us
to reduce the need to travel

01:21:01.502 --> 01:21:03.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to even work hours

01:21:03.379 --> 01:21:05.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could interfere
with spiritual activities.

01:21:06.298 --> 01:21:08.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are some circumstances that arise

01:21:08.843 --> 01:21:12.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can sometimes limit our ability
to travel to another location.

01:21:12.888 --> 01:21:15.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with the use of the video wall,
we won’t be stopped.

01:21:15.683 --> 01:21:18.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Video production will continue in the studio.

01:21:18.811 --> 01:21:21.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’ll be able
to custom-make some backgrounds

01:21:21.856 --> 01:21:24.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
that actually look like Bible lands.

01:21:43.878 --> 01:21:48.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re very confident
that with Jehovah’s blessing,

01:21:48.174 --> 01:21:51.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
this new state-of-the-art facility

01:21:51.969 --> 01:21:56.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
will result in tremendous
savings and efficiency

01:21:56.599 --> 01:21:59.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we continue to produce

01:21:59.185 --> 01:22:01.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
beautiful videos and artwork

01:22:01.771 --> 01:22:04.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the benefit of the brotherhood.

01:22:04.106 --> 01:22:07.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, that video you saw

01:22:07.651 --> 01:22:11.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
was actually a while back, a little time ago.

01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:14.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have some late-breaking news events

01:22:14.492 --> 01:22:16.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share with you since then.

01:22:16.869 --> 01:22:20.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you saw in the video the trees cut down,

01:22:20.539 --> 01:22:23.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were just lying haphazardly
—weren’t they?—

01:22:23.375 --> 01:22:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
with snow on the top.

01:22:25.461 --> 01:22:27.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But since then,

01:22:27.463 --> 01:22:29.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
contractors have been very busy

01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:33.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
removing the trees, taking them out,

01:22:33.010 --> 01:22:35.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and clearing the site in preparation

01:22:35.805 --> 01:22:39.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
for other work that will come.

01:22:39.141 --> 01:22:43.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of this is preceding
this huge construction project

01:22:43.687 --> 01:22:45.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is looming just ahead.

01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we captured some of that work,

01:22:48.150 --> 01:22:51.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we also are bringing you up-to-date

01:22:51.612 --> 01:22:54.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a flyover video clip.

01:22:54.114 --> 01:22:55.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to show you this now

01:22:55.908 --> 01:22:57.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that it’ll bring you
even further up-to-date

01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:59.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
as to how things are looking.

01:23:57.344 --> 01:24:00.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you saw the trees being removed;

01:24:00.598 --> 01:24:04.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
you saw them carving out
the entrance there in the hillside.

01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:07.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a lot of exciting things are happening.

01:24:07.479 --> 01:24:11.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, soon contractors
are going to begin blasting away

01:24:11.567 --> 01:24:15.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
large underground rock formations

01:24:15.070 --> 01:24:17.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prepare the site for further site work.

01:24:17.615 --> 01:24:21.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And according to our current time schedule

01:24:21.035 --> 01:24:23.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and I think
you’ll be interested to know this—

01:24:23.454 --> 01:24:27.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the late summer of 2024

01:24:27.625 --> 01:24:29.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
(just a few months from now),

01:24:29.627 --> 01:24:32.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah willing, with Jehovah’s blessing,

01:24:32.922 --> 01:24:36.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to call in many more volunteers

01:24:36.634 --> 01:24:41.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us
to move this project forward speedily.

01:24:41.513 --> 01:24:43.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
But dear brothers and sisters,

01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:46.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
please remember to pray

01:24:46.060 --> 01:24:49.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
 for Jehovah’s blessing on these efforts.

01:24:49.939 --> 01:24:52.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, as we said, we have another update,

01:24:52.441 --> 01:24:55.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s concerning the exciting project

01:24:55.903 --> 01:24:58.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is going on in Australia.

01:24:58.447 --> 01:25:02.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you know,
it’s the series of dramas entitled

01:25:02.159 --> 01:25:05.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

01:25:05.788 --> 01:25:09.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy this video update.

01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:14.713 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now we’ll be able to custom-make

01:25:14.713 --> 01:25:17.091 line:10% position:50% align:center
some backgrounds that actually look

01:25:17.091 --> 01:25:18.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Bible lands.

01:25:18.759 --> 01:25:21.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so <i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>  project

01:25:21.345 --> 01:25:24.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the perfect candidate
for the use of virtual production.

01:25:25.808 --> 01:25:28.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
A video wall will be installed
and ready for use

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Australasia branch in early 2024.

01:25:39.279 --> 01:25:41.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many formats out there in the world

01:25:41.323 --> 01:25:43.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ life and how it’s depicted.

01:25:43.826 --> 01:25:46.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our film is so accurate.

01:25:46.245 --> 01:25:48.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
The research and effort that’s gone into it

01:25:48.372 --> 01:25:51.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
has made it so close to the Bible;

01:25:51.458 --> 01:25:53.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s going to make such a difference.

01:25:53.210 --> 01:25:56.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re going to see Jesus
and what he was truly like.

01:25:57.423 --> 01:25:58.632 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s going to affect hearts,

01:25:58.632 --> 01:25:59.800 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it’s really going to help them

01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
to see Jehovah as well.

01:26:01.552 --> 01:26:02.636 line:10% position:50% align:center
As we’ve been working

01:26:02.636 --> 01:26:05.055 line:10% position:50% align:center
with <i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>  project,

01:26:05.055 --> 01:26:07.599 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’ve run into a few challenges, to say the least.

01:26:07.599 --> 01:26:10.185 line:10% position:50% align:center
Right from the start, we had fires,

01:26:10.185 --> 01:26:13.063 line:10% position:50% align:center
we had floods, and we had a pandemic.

01:26:13.063 --> 01:26:15.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of a number of restrictions
that were taking place at the time,

01:26:15.816 --> 01:26:17.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
things were delayed.

01:26:17.109 --> 01:26:20.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
There even came a point
when it just completely stopped.

01:26:20.029 --> 01:26:21.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we did wonder how

01:26:21.739 --> 01:26:24.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were going to be able
to produce this video

01:26:24.491 --> 01:26:27.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the time frames
that we needed to do so.

01:26:30.330 --> 01:26:33.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to pick and choose which scenes
that we had to shoot first

01:26:33.917 --> 01:26:37.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
because construction was trying
to keep up with our film schedule.

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:41.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
So trying to manage
those two together was quite difficult.

01:26:42.384 --> 01:26:44.887 line:10% position:50% align:center
Some of the challenges also are depicting miracles.

01:26:44.887 --> 01:26:48.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are you going to depict
some of the various illnesses and diseases?

01:26:48.766 --> 01:26:51.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we film scenes
like the miraculous catch of fish

01:26:51.935 --> 01:26:54.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus walking on water

01:26:54.188 --> 01:26:56.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a realistic way?

01:26:56.190 --> 01:26:58.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a weighty responsibility,

01:26:58.525 --> 01:27:01.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there’s also the amazing joy
of being able to learn

01:27:01.862 --> 01:27:03.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
more about Jesus

01:27:03.697 --> 01:27:05.115 line:10% position:50% align:center
just through the process

01:27:05.115 --> 01:27:07.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
of trying to put it on film.

01:27:08.619 --> 01:27:10.537 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Bible accounts that we’re trying to depict

01:27:10.537 --> 01:27:12.331 line:10% position:50% align:center
involve a lot of animals.

01:27:12.331 --> 01:27:14.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know it was part of the culture
at the time.

01:27:14.875 --> 01:27:18.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re really trying to incorporate that
into this production.

01:27:18.462 --> 01:27:20.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had donkeys,

01:27:20.214 --> 01:27:21.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
sheep,

01:27:21.924 --> 01:27:23.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
pigeons,

01:27:23.425 --> 01:27:25.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even camels here at the branch on set.

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.430 line:10% position:50% align:center
They need to be trained to work with actors

01:27:28.430 --> 01:27:29.681 line:10% position:50% align:center
and trained to be ridden.

01:27:29.681 --> 01:27:32.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
They need to be familiarized with the sets.

01:27:33.143 --> 01:27:35.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
You actually start to see a bond established

01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:37.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the animals and the actors.

01:27:37.523 --> 01:27:39.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fortunately, many of our brothers and sisters

01:27:39.399 --> 01:27:41.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
that work in farmlands in rural Australia

01:27:41.693 --> 01:27:46.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
had many of these animals that they
were willing to make available for us.

01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:48.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a sister
in a nearby rural congregation

01:27:48.659 --> 01:27:51.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has volunteered to help raise

01:27:51.245 --> 01:27:54.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pigeons that we’re going to use
in the temple scenes and other areas.

01:27:54.665 --> 01:27:56.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sheep love to be around kids,

01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they love to be around the cast members.

01:27:59.419 --> 01:28:00.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it really does make a difference.

01:28:00.921 --> 01:28:03.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of those animals
essentially lend themselves

01:28:03.507 --> 01:28:05.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the realism of the sets that we’re in

01:28:05.676 --> 01:28:07.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help bring the Bible accounts to life.

01:28:10.139 --> 01:28:12.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one particular episode

01:28:12.266 --> 01:28:13.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
required the Judean wilderness.

01:28:14.643 --> 01:28:17.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
After reviewing a few options
here within the country of Australia,

01:28:17.855 --> 01:28:21.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw that it wasn’t as feasible
as we would have liked for it to be.

01:28:21.441 --> 01:28:24.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
After presenting the information
to our brothers in oversight,

01:28:24.486 --> 01:28:27.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
we got a response
that we didn’t anticipate.

01:28:27.447 --> 01:28:30.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
They came back asking,
“What about Israel?”

01:28:31.201 --> 01:28:33.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
A small crew traveled to Israel

01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:36.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and actually filmed
in the real Judean wilderness.

01:28:36.165 --> 01:28:39.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The local branch office provided support,

01:28:39.084 --> 01:28:40.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
a number of scenes were filmed,

01:28:40.794 --> 01:28:42.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now when we’re reviewing the material,

01:28:42.796 --> 01:28:44.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see Jehovah blessing that arrangement.

01:28:47.009 --> 01:28:49.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
The back lot is a huge film set.

01:28:49.928 --> 01:28:52.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has five historical areas:

01:28:52.055 --> 01:28:54.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the temple area and the temple slab;

01:28:54.725 --> 01:28:56.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem area;

01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:59.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s Cana of Galilee;

01:28:59.396 --> 01:29:02.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
then there’s Capernaum,
including a little beach area;

01:29:02.566 --> 01:29:04.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Nazareth.

01:29:04.401 --> 01:29:07.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
The back lot has roads and mounds

01:29:07.487 --> 01:29:10.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just landscapes
so that we can have a variety of filming.

01:29:10.824 --> 01:29:13.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was designed in a way
where you can point the camera anywhere.

01:29:13.869 --> 01:29:17.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it just helps you immerse yourself
into the story and the life of Jesus.

01:29:17.956 --> 01:29:22.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a world
that you’ve never seen before.

01:29:22.794 --> 01:29:24.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s different
about those sets there in Australia

01:29:24.922 --> 01:29:27.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
than what we’re typically using here is

01:29:27.883 --> 01:29:29.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have to last a lot longer.

01:29:29.635 --> 01:29:33.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
To cover the entire span
of the Gospel accounts

01:29:33.305 --> 01:29:35.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires many, many years of recording.

01:29:37.851 --> 01:29:41.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters
have shown amazing skill,

01:29:41.230 --> 01:29:44.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ve worked
through some very challenging conditions.

01:29:44.233 --> 01:29:46.485 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’ve had heat, we’ve had rain,

01:29:46.485 --> 01:29:48.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
it’s been dusty out here,

01:29:48.195 --> 01:29:50.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s been muddy at times,
but they’ve worked through all of it.

01:29:52.115 --> 01:29:54.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whilst the end product
is this beautiful set,

01:29:54.576 --> 01:29:57.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s going to bring
the ministry of Jesus Christ to life

01:29:57.412 --> 01:29:59.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an incredibly realistic way.

01:30:01.041 --> 01:30:02.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
While construction was going,

01:30:02.376 --> 01:30:06.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
a contractor came in to the back lot
to see the construction brothers.

01:30:06.296 --> 01:30:08.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spoke to one of the brothers

01:30:08.215 --> 01:30:11.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in tears asked what this was all about.

01:30:11.176 --> 01:30:13.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we explained
what we’re trying to achieve.

01:30:13.679 --> 01:30:17.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with tears, he said,
“I come from Israel,

01:30:17.683 --> 01:30:20.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this looks just like my home.”

01:30:20.519 --> 01:30:23.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing someone
who has no idea about this project

01:30:23.063 --> 01:30:25.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
come in
and say how accurate it was

01:30:25.274 --> 01:30:29.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
really shows me how Jehovah
is really looking after this project.

01:30:29.152 --> 01:30:32.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
It isn’t any one of us
that have made this a success;

01:30:32.281 --> 01:30:34.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s Jehovah the whole way.

01:30:34.241 --> 01:30:35.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we study these Bible accounts

01:30:35.993 --> 01:30:39.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and figure out ways
to bring them to life on the screen,

01:30:39.121 --> 01:30:42.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s teaching us to get into the motivations
of who these people were.

01:30:42.958 --> 01:30:46.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal is to take them
from being just characters

01:30:46.211 --> 01:30:48.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
in black and white
on the printed page

01:30:48.797 --> 01:30:51.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
into real people
whom you’re going to know

01:30:51.049 --> 01:30:52.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love for the rest of your life.

01:31:02.894 --> 01:31:05.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Roll camera!
Roll audio!

01:31:06.648 --> 01:31:08.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And action!

01:31:30.339 --> 01:31:32.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we recount

01:31:32.341 --> 01:31:36.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tremendous amount
of work that is being done

01:31:36.178 --> 01:31:40.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
to visually portray, or depict,

01:31:40.057 --> 01:31:45.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gospels of Jesus’ life and ministry,
we’re thrilled.

01:31:45.062 --> 01:31:47.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re absolutely amazed.

01:31:47.647 --> 01:31:50.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of this work and investment

01:31:50.192 --> 01:31:53.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not just for one convention drama.

01:31:53.028 --> 01:31:56.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, this production sets us up

01:31:56.281 --> 01:32:01.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
for convention dramas
for years to come in the future.

01:32:01.286 --> 01:32:06.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re going to truly enjoy them
as they’re rolled out.

01:32:06.166 --> 01:32:10.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, when we think about
these dramas,

01:32:10.921 --> 01:32:12.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
these episodes,

01:32:12.589 --> 01:32:14.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
you probably want to know:

01:32:14.257 --> 01:32:17.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘When am I going to get to see
the first episode?

01:32:17.677 --> 01:32:19.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
When?’

01:32:19.179 --> 01:32:21.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you’ll be happy to know

01:32:21.181 --> 01:32:24.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
that next year,

01:32:24.309 --> 01:32:26.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
2024,

01:32:26.353 --> 01:32:29.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to have them portrayed

01:32:29.481 --> 01:32:33.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the convention program as two dramas

01:32:33.402 --> 01:32:36.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that is, Episode 1 will be two dramas

01:32:36.655 --> 01:32:40.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the 2024 convention,

01:32:40.075 --> 01:32:43.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
the regional and the special conventions.

01:32:43.078 --> 01:32:45.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll enjoy them, indeed.

01:32:57.592 --> 01:33:00.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we’ve prepared a preview

01:33:00.887 --> 01:33:04.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those two convention dramas,

01:33:04.391 --> 01:33:07.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think you’ll enjoy this short preview.

01:33:07.727 --> 01:33:11.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know it’s really early
to show you something

01:33:11.106 --> 01:33:14.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the 2024 convention,

01:33:14.151 --> 01:33:16.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I hope I don’t get into trouble

01:33:16.153 --> 01:33:19.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Governing Body
for showing this prematurely.

01:33:21.741 --> 01:33:23.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just kidding!

01:33:24.411 --> 01:33:26.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you don’t think I’m that stupid.

01:33:34.296 --> 01:33:38.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is with the Governing Body’s
full blessing and approval

01:33:40.552 --> 01:33:42.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we show you this.

01:33:52.856 --> 01:33:54.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please enjoy

01:33:54.858 --> 01:33:59.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
this Governing-Body-approved teaser

01:33:59.029 --> 01:34:01.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
for these two dramas.

01:34:07.662 --> 01:34:09.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing that many have undertaken

01:34:09.498 --> 01:34:11.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
to compile an account of the facts,

01:34:14.711 --> 01:34:16.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
I resolved also,

01:34:17.797 --> 01:34:19.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I have traced all things

01:34:19.841 --> 01:34:22.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the start with accuracy.

01:34:26.598 --> 01:34:28.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be afraid, Mary.

01:34:30.310 --> 01:34:32.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will become pregnant

01:34:34.147 --> 01:34:35.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give birth to a son,

01:34:37.734 --> 01:34:42.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you are to name him Jesus.

01:34:44.824 --> 01:34:47.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let Jehovah be praised,

01:34:47.911 --> 01:34:49.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of Israel,

01:34:50.747 --> 01:34:53.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he has turned his attention to his people

01:34:54.793 --> 01:34:56.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has brought them deliverance.

01:35:01.758 --> 01:35:03.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
For look!

01:35:03.051 --> 01:35:04.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am declaring to you good news.

01:35:06.972 --> 01:35:08.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
For today

01:35:08.932 --> 01:35:10.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was born to you

01:35:10.267 --> 01:35:13.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
in David’s city a savior,

01:35:13.979 --> 01:35:16.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is Christ the Lord.

01:35:21.236 --> 01:35:22.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look!

01:35:22.696 --> 01:35:24.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s slave girl!

01:35:27.242 --> 01:35:30.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
May it happen to me according to your declaration.

01:36:11.828 --> 01:36:13.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
The true light

01:36:13.538 --> 01:36:15.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gives light

01:36:15.540 --> 01:36:18.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
to every sort of man

01:36:18.251 --> 01:36:20.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
was about to come into the world.

01:36:49.908 --> 01:36:53.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
The dramas over the next several years

01:36:53.995 --> 01:36:56.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have this kind of realism

01:36:56.373 --> 01:37:01.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will truly bring
the Gospel account to life

01:37:01.378 --> 01:37:04.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
—<i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

01:37:04.255 --> 01:37:05.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what you saw was just

01:37:05.924 --> 01:37:10.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
a two-and-a-half-minute teaser video,

01:37:10.095 --> 01:37:11.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little video.

01:37:11.554 --> 01:37:14.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we mentioned, we’re going to—

01:37:14.432 --> 01:37:16.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was just for Episode 1,

01:37:16.476 --> 01:37:19.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we are actively, speedily,

01:37:19.354 --> 01:37:24.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
fast-movingly preparing more episodes.

01:37:24.025 --> 01:37:27.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, you’ll be happy to know
that we’re working right now

01:37:27.153 --> 01:37:29.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the next four episodes

01:37:29.322 --> 01:37:31.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the two that

01:37:31.658 --> 01:37:35.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the one, really, teaser of the one—
you saw.

01:37:35.412 --> 01:37:37.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Four more are being worked on,

01:37:37.872 --> 01:37:42.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Episode 3 is almost totally finished.

01:37:42.419 --> 01:37:45.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve almost got Episode 3 done.

01:37:45.130 --> 01:37:50.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
has already been reviewing Episode 1

01:37:50.135 --> 01:37:53.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an early edition of Episode 2.

01:37:53.096 --> 01:37:57.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how powerful indeed they are!

01:37:57.058 --> 01:38:01.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know personally I can say
that I’ve been inspired;

01:38:01.020 --> 01:38:02.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been motivated

01:38:02.564 --> 01:38:05.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even brought
to the point of tears several times.

01:38:05.859 --> 01:38:10.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
And other Governing Body brothers
and helpers were affected similarly.

01:38:10.196 --> 01:38:12.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
The realism, the impact,

01:38:12.949 --> 01:38:17.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the power is absolutely amazing.

01:38:17.203 --> 01:38:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re confident
that you appreciate receiving

01:38:21.124 --> 01:38:24.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
these two very important updates

01:38:24.002 --> 01:38:27.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
concerning significant fast-moving projects.

01:38:27.255 --> 01:38:31.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Governing Body
wants to keep you fully informed.

01:38:31.593 --> 01:38:34.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really want you to be up-to-date

01:38:34.304 --> 01:38:37.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we need your prayers,
we need your support,

01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:40.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want you to know what is happening.

01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:43.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re confident
that with Jehovah’s blessing,

01:38:43.271 --> 01:38:45.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is going to be something

01:38:45.607 --> 01:38:49.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s going to benefit
the spiritual brotherhood

01:38:49.194 --> 01:38:52.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a tremendous and profound way.

01:38:52.489 --> 01:38:56.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re just so anxious
to be able to give you more of this,

01:38:56.576 --> 01:38:59.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we gave you what we could now.

01:38:59.954 --> 01:39:02.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some might ask:

01:39:02.248 --> 01:39:06.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are we embarking

01:39:06.211 --> 01:39:08.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on two projects like this

01:39:08.463 --> 01:39:11.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when the new world is so close?

01:39:11.549 --> 01:39:13.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We might not even finish one of them.

01:39:13.593 --> 01:39:15.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
The end may come.”

01:39:15.595 --> 01:39:17.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we just don’t know, do we?

01:39:17.597 --> 01:39:21.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know exactly
when the end is going to come.

01:39:21.601 --> 01:39:24.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an illustration:

01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:27.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many carefully selected smooth stones

01:39:27.482 --> 01:39:30.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
did David take out
when he went to fight Goliath?

01:39:31.277 --> 01:39:32.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took five, didn’t he?

01:39:32.779 --> 01:39:34.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many did he need?

01:39:34.614 --> 01:39:35.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
One.

01:39:35.824 --> 01:39:37.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just didn’t know, did he?

01:39:37.450 --> 01:39:40.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he was prepared for whatever it took.

01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in the same way,
we don’t know when the end is going to come.

01:39:42.914 --> 01:39:45.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another thought,
food for thought:

01:39:45.792 --> 01:39:49.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could not these projects, if needed,

01:39:49.337 --> 01:39:52.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
be finished after the great tribulation

01:39:52.507 --> 01:39:55.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then be used powerfully in the new world?

01:39:55.301 --> 01:39:59.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thinking of <i>The Good News</i>
<i>According to Jesus </i> episodes,

01:39:59.722 --> 01:40:02.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
would they not be wonderful tools

01:40:02.225 --> 01:40:05.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach resurrected ones about God’s Son?

01:40:05.895 --> 01:40:07.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, only Jehovah knows.

01:40:07.730 --> 01:40:09.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time will tell.

01:40:09.732 --> 01:40:13.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did <i>The Watchtower</i>  say
some years ago

01:40:13.152 --> 01:40:17.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the activity

01:40:17.031 --> 01:40:20.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s people
right when the end would come?

01:40:20.285 --> 01:40:22.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what it said;
let me read you this quote.

01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:25.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said:

01:40:25.331 --> 01:40:30.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The arrival of the Lord Jesus
to execute judgment

01:40:30.044 --> 01:40:34.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will come as a complete surprise

01:40:34.424 --> 01:40:37.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—even to Jehovah’s people,

01:40:37.302 --> 01:40:42.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
for it will no doubt find them
at their busiest time of activity!”

01:40:42.891 --> 01:40:45.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re going to be surprised.

01:40:45.101 --> 01:40:47.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to be very busy
when the end comes.

01:40:47.145 --> 01:40:49.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we say— If the end comes

01:40:49.188 --> 01:40:51.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we finish
either one of these projects,

01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:53.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we say: “Hallelujah!

01:40:54.861 --> 01:40:56.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Praise Jah!”

01:40:56.863 --> 01:41:00.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re going to be busy
right up until the end

01:41:00.366 --> 01:41:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah with his help and his support.

01:41:02.911 --> 01:41:04.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you think of the scripture

01:41:04.746 --> 01:41:08.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Kings 13:18.

01:41:08.249 --> 01:41:11.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was not at all pleased

01:41:11.085 --> 01:41:13.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
with King Jehoash.

01:41:13.338 --> 01:41:15.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, he took the arrows,

01:41:15.340 --> 01:41:19.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
he struck the ground three times,
and then he stopped.

01:41:19.260 --> 01:41:20.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:41:20.678 --> 01:41:22.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah does not like

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:26.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and he doesn’t bless—
a lack of zeal and enthusiasm.

01:41:26.059 --> 01:41:29.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to make sure
we’re zealously working

01:41:29.395 --> 01:41:32.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
right up until the end comes.

01:41:32.523 --> 01:41:34.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in conclusion,

01:41:34.525 --> 01:41:37.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
we say with your continued support

01:41:37.153 --> 01:41:40.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prayers in our behalf,

01:41:40.198 --> 01:41:43.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
fast-moving and amazing things are happening

01:41:43.159 --> 01:41:46.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the earthly part
of Jehovah’s organization.

01:41:46.537 --> 01:41:49.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we give all thanks to Jehovah,

01:41:49.374 --> 01:41:53.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
that great celestial chariot Rider.

01:41:53.711 --> 01:41:55.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
We give thanks to him,

01:41:55.755 --> 01:41:59.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we give thanks
to the heavenly part of his organization.

01:41:59.968 --> 01:42:02.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
How we appreciate

01:42:02.595 --> 01:42:05.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
the direction we are receiving

01:42:05.682 --> 01:42:08.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of holy spirit!

01:42:14.023 --> 01:42:16.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
You keep clapping,
and I’ll just keep smiling.

01:42:17.860 --> 01:42:22.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wonderful.
That was a very rich series of talks.

01:42:22.573 --> 01:42:24.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank you, dear brothers, very much.

01:42:24.951 --> 01:42:27.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And above all, we thank Jehovah

01:42:27.161 --> 01:42:31.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
for how he is guiding us
through all of these wonderful things.

01:42:31.416 --> 01:42:35.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, those of you listening
no doubt picked up on adjustments being made

01:42:35.795 --> 01:42:40.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
by “the faithful and discreet slave,”
based on Scriptural principles

01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:43.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s precious Word, the Bible.

01:42:45.596 --> 01:42:48.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at the beginning of the program,
we mentioned

01:42:48.349 --> 01:42:52.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was
a landmark annual meeting ten years ago.

01:42:52.645 --> 01:42:54.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now with what we’ve learned today

01:42:54.772 --> 01:42:58.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s mercy and his judgment

01:42:58.484 --> 01:43:02.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as our personal responsibility
before him,

01:43:02.822 --> 01:43:04.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see the power of God’s Word

01:43:04.991 --> 01:43:09.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its principles at work, don’t we?

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:12.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, this program too is truly landmark.

01:43:12.165 --> 01:43:14.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as one of the branches wrote in,

01:43:14.333 --> 01:43:18.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is indeed one
that we will always remember.

01:43:18.504 --> 01:43:21.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s fitting,
as we approach the great tribulation,

01:43:21.549 --> 01:43:24.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we now have received
a better understanding of these things,

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t you agree?

01:43:25.553 --> 01:43:26.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very good.

01:43:26.888 --> 01:43:29.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Proverbs 3:5 urges us,

01:43:29.599 --> 01:43:34.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
keep “[trusting] in Jehovah
with all your heart . . .

01:43:34.020 --> 01:43:37.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not rely on your own understanding,”

01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:41.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as we do this,
our heavenly Father promises

01:43:41.235 --> 01:43:43.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “make [our] paths straight.”

01:43:43.738 --> 01:43:45.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he is certainly doing that.

01:43:45.406 --> 01:43:48.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we love him so much for doing that.

01:43:48.117 --> 01:43:51.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gets the praise for everything

01:43:51.704 --> 01:43:54.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has come out in this annual meeting,

01:43:54.207 --> 01:43:56.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we give much credit

01:43:56.876 --> 01:43:59.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his dear Son, our King, Christ Jesus.

01:43:59.504 --> 01:44:01.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a delight to serve

01:44:01.839 --> 01:44:04.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this way under their guidance!

01:44:05.259 --> 01:44:08.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are sure you enjoyed
Part 2 of the annual meeting.

01:44:08.805 --> 01:44:12.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always a joy to share
this momentous occasion with all of you.

01:44:13.810 --> 01:44:15.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our postcard for this month

01:44:15.645 --> 01:44:19.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
is from the smallest country
in the Western Hemisphere

01:44:19.232 --> 01:44:22.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.

01:44:22.693 --> 01:44:25.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
St. Kitts and Nevis
lie in the Leeward Islands

01:44:25.613 --> 01:44:28.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the eastern Caribbean Sea.

01:44:28.366 --> 01:44:30.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
The islands are known for their beaches,

01:44:30.368 --> 01:44:32.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
reefs, and tropical weather.

01:44:34.330 --> 01:44:38.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
A channel called The Narrows
separates the two volcanic isles.

01:44:38.543 --> 01:44:41.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mount Liamuiga, at the center of St. Kitts,

01:44:41.796 --> 01:44:44.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
is one of the highest volcanoes
in the Caribbean.

01:44:44.423 --> 01:44:47.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Liamuiga is the name given to the island

01:44:47.009 --> 01:44:49.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the Kalinago Indians.

01:44:49.095 --> 01:44:52.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be translated as “fertile land,”

01:44:52.181 --> 01:44:55.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
a fitting description
for how the volcanic soil

01:44:55.393 --> 01:44:57.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
yields abundant crops.

01:44:57.979 --> 01:45:02.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
But St. Kitts and Nevis have proven
to be spiritually fruitful as well.

01:45:02.650 --> 01:45:06.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news spread
to St. Kitts and Nevis in the 1930’s.

01:45:07.446 --> 01:45:09.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
During World War II, however,

01:45:09.657 --> 01:45:12.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
the importation of our literature was banned.

01:45:12.451 --> 01:45:14.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cartons containing the books

01:45:14.453 --> 01:45:16.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Children </i> and <i>The New World </i>

01:45:16.664 --> 01:45:18.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as the Watch Tower edition

01:45:18.875 --> 01:45:21.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>American Standard Version </i> Bible

01:45:21.085 --> 01:45:25.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
were confiscated
to be burned at a sugar factory.

01:45:25.047 --> 01:45:28.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two courageous brothers
worked at the factory

01:45:28.009 --> 01:45:32.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saved enough books and Bibles
for the congregation.

01:45:32.138 --> 01:45:34.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
When going door to door,

01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:36.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers generally don’t knock.

01:45:36.726 --> 01:45:40.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, they call out “Inside!”

01:45:40.021 --> 01:45:43.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make it clear that they are looking
for someone inside the house,

01:45:43.733 --> 01:45:47.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
not calling for someone on the street
or in a neighboring yard.

01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:49.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people of St. Kitts and Nevis

01:45:49.822 --> 01:45:54.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
spend much time outside the home,
working or visiting with family and friends,

01:45:55.411 --> 01:45:57.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
so it can be difficult to find them at home.

01:45:57.830 --> 01:46:01.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Publishers look for opportunities to witness
wherever they are.

01:46:02.585 --> 01:46:06.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tourism makes up a large part of the economy,

01:46:06.297 --> 01:46:10.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
with hundreds of thousands
—that is, many times the local population—

01:46:10.301 --> 01:46:12.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
visiting each year by cruise ship.

01:46:12.303 --> 01:46:16.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of these tourists
will pass one of our literature carts.

01:46:17.016 --> 01:46:18.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since it’s expensive

01:46:18.434 --> 01:46:22.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
to travel to another island
for assemblies and conventions,

01:46:22.146 --> 01:46:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
St. Kitts has what is called

01:46:24.440 --> 01:46:26.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
an expandable Kingdom Hall.

01:46:26.651 --> 01:46:31.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
For most of the year, it functions as
a normal Kingdom Hall for two congregations.

01:46:31.072 --> 01:46:34.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for our three
larger theocratic events each year,

01:46:34.617 --> 01:46:37.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
added chairs increase the capacity.

01:46:37.245 --> 01:46:41.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baptismal candidates travel to the nearby
Timothy Bay for water immersion.

01:46:42.333 --> 01:46:43.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
The expandable Kingdom Hall

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:47.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
also provides needed space
for the Memorial attendees,

01:46:47.338 --> 01:46:50.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
often three times
the number of the publishers!

01:46:50.633 --> 01:46:53.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 326 publishers

01:46:53.219 --> 01:46:56.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all four congregations
in St. Kitts and Nevis

01:46:56.222 --> 01:46:58.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their warm love and greetings

01:46:58.683 --> 01:47:00.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the entire brotherhood!

01:47:01.185 --> 01:47:04.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:47:04.105 --> 01:47:06.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
