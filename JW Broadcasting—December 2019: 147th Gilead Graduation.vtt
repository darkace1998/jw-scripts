We extend a warm welcome to all of you

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:07.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the December 2019 edition

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:09.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting®.

The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:35.431 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
began on February 1, 1943.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:37.433 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Since then,

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.768 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
thousands of students have benefited

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the school’s in-depth course

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Bible study.

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After months of intense study,

00:00:46.734 --> 00:00:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
graduation day is a highlight for the class.

00:00:50.613 --> 00:00:52.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll enjoy Part 1 of the graduation

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:59.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 147th class of Gilead.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:01.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay close attention

00:01:01.624 --> 00:01:04.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to these encouraging Scriptural talks

00:01:04.084 --> 00:01:06.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivered to the graduates

00:01:06.086 --> 00:01:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Saturday, September 14, 2019.

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is a very happy day

00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:15.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those
who are very soon to graduate

00:01:15.554 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from this 147th class of Gilead.

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:22.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to begin by asking them a question,

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:27.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is, How far will you go?

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:30.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well now,
when people ask that question,

00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:32.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How far will you go?

00:01:32.029 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(normally in connection
with secular education)

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the meaning of the question is,

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to get your bachelor’s degree

00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:42.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or are you going to go for your master’s

00:01:42.581 --> 00:01:45.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or are you going to go for a PhD
and get your doctorate?

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:52.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, in that sense,
often going far in secular education

00:01:52.424 --> 00:01:56.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is solely a means of self-fulfillment

00:01:56.971 --> 00:02:00.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not necessarily to help others.

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:03.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some study what’s called pure science,

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:07.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meant just to advance
mankind’s understanding of science

00:02:07.481 --> 00:02:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but with no practical benefit;

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:13.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some study dead languages;

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some study bacteria or insects,

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is wonderful if you like insects.

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may increase knowledge,

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:26.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it doesn’t necessarily help anyone.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, divine education is so different.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, it motivates us to ask the question,

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How far can I go,

00:02:36.218 --> 00:02:39.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘not to further myself,

00:02:39.596 --> 00:02:42.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but to help others?’

00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:45.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jehovah God and Christ Jesus

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really set the example for us here.

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:48.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you join me?

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Psalm 113,

00:02:54.403 --> 00:02:56.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s look here at verse 6.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of our wonderful God, Jehovah,

00:03:00.451 --> 00:03:04.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:
“He stoops down

00:03:04.455 --> 00:03:08.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look on heaven and earth.”

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, how high
do you imagine Jehovah to be?

00:03:13.714 --> 00:03:15.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no matter how high you imagine it,

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:18.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know it’s still higher.

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is so high as the Almighty God.

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:24.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it say here in verse 6?

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He stoops down.”

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:29.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just think.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:34.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might think of an illustration
of a man who is perhaps very, very tall,

00:03:34.485 --> 00:03:37.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s talking to a very, very small child.

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:38.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does he do?

00:03:38.822 --> 00:03:41.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, oftentimes he might crouch down,

00:03:41.325 --> 00:03:43.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get down on one knee,

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get right down onto the level
of the child to speak to him.

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result,
how does the little child feel?

00:03:50.542 --> 00:03:52.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, not so afraid,

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:57.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not so intimidated by that large man.

00:03:57.007 --> 00:03:59.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The child becomes calm.

00:03:59.676 --> 00:04:01.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about Jehovah.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How far has Jehovah gone
to “stoop down”

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we feel loved?

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:11.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we feel valued?

00:04:11.021 --> 00:04:13.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we feel appreciated?

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:17.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful example Jehovah sets

00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in going far to make us feel

00:04:21.824 --> 00:04:24.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so comfortable with him!

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:26.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what about our Lord Jesus?

00:04:26.411 --> 00:04:30.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think how far he went
to help each one of us.

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:33.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just look at the scripture here
in Philippians chapter 2.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians chapter 2

00:04:39.633 --> 00:04:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that Jesus, of course,
came from heaven, didn’t he?

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how far that is?

00:04:45.013 --> 00:04:48.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says in verse 5:
“Keep this mental attitude in you

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that was also in Christ Jesus,

00:04:50.227 --> 00:04:52.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who, although he was existing in God’s form,

00:04:52.604 --> 00:04:55.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gave no consideration to a seizure,

00:04:55.274 --> 00:04:57.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“namely, that he should be equal to God.

00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, but he emptied himself.”

00:04:59.695 --> 00:05:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did he do?

00:05:01.738 --> 00:05:06.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He “took a slave’s form and became human.”

00:05:06.451 --> 00:05:08.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was pretty far to go.

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:11.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while you and I think the earth

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:13.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is pretty amazing and pretty wonderful,

00:05:13.959 --> 00:05:16.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have you ever seen heaven?

00:05:16.962 --> 00:05:20.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s where Jesus left
—willingly—

00:05:20.257 --> 00:05:24.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come down to be among us, to serve us.

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in the end, how far did he go?

00:05:27.764 --> 00:05:29.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does verse 8 say?

00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:32.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“More than that, when he came as a man,

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:36.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he humbled himself
and became obedient [to what?]

00:05:36.773 --> 00:05:39.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the point of death,

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:42.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, death on a torture stake.”

00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:47.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was willing to go very, very far

00:05:47.534 --> 00:05:49.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help people.

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:53.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, you have all come to Gilead.

00:05:53.457 --> 00:05:55.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did you come to Gilead?

00:05:55.459 --> 00:05:56.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the purpose of it?

00:05:56.877 --> 00:06:00.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
was it to increase your Bible knowledge?

00:06:00.088 --> 00:06:04.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it to give you
some grand knowledge of Bible history

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to give you
some comprehensive knowledge

00:06:07.304 --> 00:06:10.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Biblical Greek or Hebrew?

00:06:10.182 --> 00:06:11.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The purpose of your coming to Gilead

00:06:14.186 --> 00:06:17.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to help you so that you could strengthen

00:06:17.606 --> 00:06:21.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stabilize the field and branch territory.

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:23.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the purpose of Gilead.

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
what is the field and the branch territory?

00:06:26.782 --> 00:06:28.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that?

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s people
—it’s people that need to be loved;

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s people that need to be organized;

00:06:34.748 --> 00:06:38.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s people that need
to be trained and helped.

00:06:38.752 --> 00:06:41.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at Gilead, you have learned

00:06:41.421 --> 00:06:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Colossians 4:11

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:48.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says to be “a source of great comfort” or,

00:06:48.971 --> 00:06:51.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the footnote says,

00:06:51.014 --> 00:06:54.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be “a strengthening aid” to other people.

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:58.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, the question
that sits before you now is,

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:01.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How far will you go?

00:07:01.775 --> 00:07:05.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How far will you go to be
fathers and mothers?

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:09.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be brothers and sisters
to all of these ones?

00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:11.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There has never been a need,

00:07:11.576 --> 00:07:15.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such a great need,
for this type of help.

00:07:15.122 --> 00:07:17.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have now in the world

00:07:17.416 --> 00:07:21.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more of our brothers
facing persecution than we have ever seen,

00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:24.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we expect that that is going to increase.

00:07:24.548 --> 00:07:27.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some lands, we have lawlessness

00:07:27.342 --> 00:07:30.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a level previously unheard of,

00:07:30.178 --> 00:07:35.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where kidnapping and rampant violence
occur on a daily basis.

00:07:35.142 --> 00:07:39.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And many of our brothers
are facing anxieties and pressures

00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:44.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they have never ever
had to experience before.

00:07:44.067 --> 00:07:47.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They need your help;

00:07:47.404 --> 00:07:52.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they need to be strengthened
and comforted by you.

00:07:52.075 --> 00:07:55.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, sometimes
you’re going to feel overwhelmed.

00:07:55.662 --> 00:08:00.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you’re going to wonder,
‘What should I do?’

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:04.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you won’t know exactly what to do.

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:07.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes even your best efforts
of working very, very hard

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:11.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
won’t work out the way
that you want them to.

00:08:11.636 --> 00:08:14.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember that the brothers and sisters

00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:17.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re working with,
the people that you’re trying to help,

00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:19.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are wonderful people,

00:08:19.686 --> 00:08:22.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will work with you,

00:08:22.147 --> 00:08:24.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will support you.

00:08:24.149 --> 00:08:26.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But most of all,

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:28.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our wonderful and amazing God, Jehovah,

00:08:28.987 --> 00:08:30.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be there to support you.

00:08:30.989 --> 00:08:33.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an experience that I just heard

00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:36.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really brought this
to my mind and strengthened it.

00:08:36.161 --> 00:08:39.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It comes from Abaco in the Bahamas.

00:08:39.581 --> 00:08:42.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember that just about a week ago,

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:46.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had this terrible Hurricane Dorian
that struck this part of the world.

00:08:46.338 --> 00:08:48.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Disaster Relief Committee in the Bahamas

00:08:48.757 --> 00:08:51.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was working very hard to evacuate

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:53.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers from Abaco Island to Nassau.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they had an airplane.

00:08:56.014 --> 00:09:00.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They worked very hard to have
an airplane ready to go in the evening.

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:05.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And although almost all communication
had been cut off with Abaco Island,

00:09:05.565 --> 00:09:08.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they sent a message on all possible channels

00:09:08.735 --> 00:09:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the brothers in Abaco
to make their way to the airstrip.

00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:17.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as they were loading
the plane with all the necessary materials,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were told that the government

00:09:19.204 --> 00:09:23.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would not grant permission
for the plane to land that day.

00:09:23.708 --> 00:09:25.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the brothers tried everything.

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:27.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They persisted, 

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:29.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the government authorities
would not budge.

00:09:29.756 --> 00:09:31.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how they felt?

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:36.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But an hour or so later,
much to their surprise,

00:09:36.054 --> 00:09:39.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they heard reports
that 14 brothers and sisters

00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:43.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Abaco would be landing soon in Nassau.

00:09:43.228 --> 00:09:46.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they wondered,
‘How could this be possible?’

00:09:46.148 --> 00:09:48.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, they made preparations immediately

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:50.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Nassau Assembly Hall,

00:09:50.819 --> 00:09:55.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 14 exhausted, hungry brothers and sisters

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
arrived who had just been evacuated.

00:09:57.826 --> 00:10:00.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a congregation meeting
just ending at the Assembly Hall.

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:03.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers all went out greeting them

00:10:03.165 --> 00:10:06.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and singing our new song “Unfailing Love.”

00:10:06.168 --> 00:10:10.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine what the scene
must have been there at Nassau?

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:13.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, the question was,
How could this have happened?

00:10:13.425 --> 00:10:15.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the brothers explained:

00:10:15.469 --> 00:10:17.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We heard the message to go to the airstrip,

00:10:17.804 --> 00:10:20.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so we made our journey there.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:24.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A plane arrived,
and we thought it was the brothers,

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:28.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it was a company
who had a plane circling the island.

00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:30.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When they saw
a group of people at the airstrip,

00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:33.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they landed and evacuated us.”

00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:36.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone was in tears.

00:10:36.156 --> 00:10:38.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fourteen of the brothers got the message.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They followed the direction.

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:42.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They assembled to be rescued,

00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:44.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Disaster Relief Committee said,

00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:47.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah made sure that his people
were evacuated to safety.”

00:10:47.959 --> 00:10:49.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:10:59.596 --> 00:11:03.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even when your best
doesn’t seem to be good enough,

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:05.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will make up for it.

00:11:05.894 --> 00:11:09.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do your best, and Jehovah will do the rest.

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:11.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have love for God

00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:14.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have love
for your brothers in your heart,

00:11:14.945 --> 00:11:16.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how far will you go?

00:11:16.947 --> 00:11:20.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will go very, very far.

00:11:21.576 --> 00:11:23.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re looking
forward now to our first talk

00:11:23.828 --> 00:11:27.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a member of the Governing Body,
our dear Brother Samuel Herd,

00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:31.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is going to give us
a very fine warning.

00:11:31.711 --> 00:11:33.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His talk is entitled

00:11:33.713 --> 00:11:36.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be Careful! ‘Knowledge Puffs Up.’”

00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:51.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m looking at you.

00:11:52.983 --> 00:11:55.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m looking at you too.

00:11:56.987 --> 00:11:59.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you have something that I can’t see.

00:12:00.907 --> 00:12:05.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in your head and in your heart.

00:12:05.495 --> 00:12:07.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s knowledge.

00:12:07.497 --> 00:12:10.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been cramming now for five months,

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:15.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stuffing things into that brain

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allowing it through meditation

00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:21.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trickle down into your heart.

00:12:21.303 --> 00:12:26.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you may feel that you have enough.

00:12:27.142 --> 00:12:30.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I can’t get any more into the brain.”

00:12:30.145 --> 00:12:32.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know better.

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:35.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s still room for you

00:12:35.025 --> 00:12:38.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put a little more knowledge
into the brain.

00:12:38.528 --> 00:12:40.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re going to do that,

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you may feel right now
that you are ready to explode.

00:12:45.493 --> 00:12:47.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you do it.

00:12:48.872 --> 00:12:50.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here’s something to think about:

00:12:50.999 --> 00:12:54.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Knowledge puffs up,

00:12:54.753 --> 00:12:58.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but love builds up.”

00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:03.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a scripture
found at 1 Corinthians 8:1.

00:13:03.345 --> 00:13:05.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it doesn’t have to be this way,

00:13:05.889 --> 00:13:08.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially with divine knowledge,

00:13:08.308 --> 00:13:11.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the knowledge that you receive from Jehovah.

00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:14.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not designed to puff you up

00:13:14.773 --> 00:13:18.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to make you feel better
than your neighbors

00:13:18.026 --> 00:13:20.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your brothers and your sisters—

00:13:20.028 --> 00:13:23.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who may not have the amount
of knowledge and education

00:13:23.823 --> 00:13:27.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you have
and what you have just now received.

00:13:27.994 --> 00:13:31.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that’s not the purpose
of the knowledge that you have acquired

00:13:31.873 --> 00:13:34.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in Gilead School.

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:38.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is something
we have to think about.

00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:39.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is that?

00:13:39.881 --> 00:13:41.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles.

00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:44.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to 2 Peter,

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:46.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s take a look

00:13:46.721 --> 00:13:51.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at what is stated here at 2 Peter

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:56.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first chapter, verses 5 and 6.

00:13:57.691 --> 00:14:00.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “For this very reason,

00:14:00.068 --> 00:14:04.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“put forth all earnest effort
to supply to your faith virtue,

00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:08.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your virtue knowledge,
to your knowledge self-control,

00:14:08.827 --> 00:14:11.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to your self-control endurance,

00:14:11.705 --> 00:14:15.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your endurance godly devotion.”

00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:18.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see what you must apply
to your knowledge?

00:14:18.628 --> 00:14:20.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Self-control.

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can’t allow our mouths to just run wild

00:14:24.592 --> 00:14:26.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the information that we’ve received

00:14:26.845 --> 00:14:29.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just spreading it everywhere.

00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:33.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter who may receive it,

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have to control

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:39.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much knowledge you permit

00:14:39.816 --> 00:14:43.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to flow out of your mouth at a given time.

00:14:43.945 --> 00:14:46.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Self-control is needed.

00:14:46.948 --> 00:14:51.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means we should not boast
over our accomplishments.

00:14:51.661 --> 00:14:54.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All glory must go to Jehovah God

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:57.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to ourselves.

00:14:57.125 --> 00:15:00.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s easy for others

00:15:00.503 --> 00:15:04.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to feel that we are putting them
down a little bit

00:15:04.758 --> 00:15:07.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the vast knowledge that we have.

00:15:07.969 --> 00:15:12.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to be careful
and control it and not boast.

00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:15.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminded me of a story,
a fable, I heard years ago

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:21.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about a little flea by the name of Herman.

00:15:21.983 --> 00:15:25.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Herman the Flea got on the back
of a giant elephant.

00:15:26.863 --> 00:15:31.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he rode on that elephant
across the rickety bridge,

00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:36.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the bridge just shook as if it was
going to explode and fall apart.

00:15:36.873 --> 00:15:39.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they made it to the other side.

00:15:39.125 --> 00:15:42.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when they made it to the other side
and the flea left the elephant

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:44.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and found his friends,

00:15:44.714 --> 00:15:49.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he bragged about what he was able to do,

00:15:49.719 --> 00:15:51.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with the elephant,

00:15:51.721 --> 00:15:56.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in making that bridge shake
as they crossed it.

00:15:56.142 --> 00:16:00.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how much do you feel
that that flea contributed

00:16:00.104 --> 00:16:02.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the shaking of that bridge?

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:04.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what we’re going to do, though—

00:16:04.526 --> 00:16:07.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to leave the fable,
and we’re going to go to the Bible.

00:16:07.612 --> 00:16:09.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to the Bible,

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:13.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re going to trade that flea
in for a grasshopper.

00:16:13.993 --> 00:16:18.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here it is—Isaiah 40:22.

00:16:18.998 --> 00:16:21.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a look at it:

00:16:21.334 --> 00:16:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is One who dwells
above the circle of the earth,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:28.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and its inhabitants are like grasshoppers.

00:16:28.675 --> 00:16:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He is stretching out the heavens
like a fine gauze,

00:16:32.303 --> 00:16:36.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he spreads them out
like a tent to dwell in.”

00:16:36.891 --> 00:16:41.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what we can do is we
can apply this to ourselves.

00:16:41.688 --> 00:16:44.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course,
in this scripture’s context,

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:48.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is really not talking
about his people as grasshoppers

00:16:48.319 --> 00:16:52.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but of people with worldly knowledge

00:16:52.198 --> 00:16:54.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’ve acquired.

00:16:54.325 --> 00:16:57.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are like grasshoppers
as far as Jehovah is concerned.

00:16:57.745 --> 00:17:00.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see the whole context
of what he’s talking about.

00:17:00.748 --> 00:17:03.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re going to apply it to ourselves

00:17:03.084 --> 00:17:05.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are so small
in the eyes of Jehovah

00:17:05.545 --> 00:17:09.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can be just like a grasshopper

00:17:09.674 --> 00:17:14.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the back of a giant elephant.

00:17:15.513 --> 00:17:18.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our accomplishments that we make

00:17:18.516 --> 00:17:22.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not of our own abilities,

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:25.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s because of the help that we have

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming from heaven—Jehovah.

00:17:29.152 --> 00:17:32.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we find that the apostle Paul

00:17:32.906 --> 00:17:36.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set a fine example of not being a braggart.

00:17:36.659 --> 00:17:37.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he have?

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:40.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he had so much knowledge.

00:17:40.121 --> 00:17:44.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, when known
as the man Saul of Tarsus,

00:17:44.125 --> 00:17:47.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was highly educated and was a Pharisee,

00:17:47.503 --> 00:17:52.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was viewed
as an impeccable Jewish pedigree

00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:54.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this man had.

00:17:54.218 --> 00:17:58.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he wrote letters,
he didn’t glorify himself.

00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:02.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance,
take a look at 1 Corinthians chapter 2,

00:18:02.268 --> 00:18:07.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and read along with me verses 1 through 5.

00:18:07.273 --> 00:18:12.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ll find that he did not
allow knowledge to puff him up.

00:18:12.278 --> 00:18:14.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is how it reads:

00:18:14.364 --> 00:18:17.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So when I came to you, brothers,
I did not come with extravagant speech

00:18:17.909 --> 00:18:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or wisdom declaring
the sacred secret of God to you.

00:18:21.204 --> 00:18:25.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I decided not to know anything
among you except Jesus Christ,

00:18:25.166 --> 00:18:28.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and him executed on the stake.

00:18:28.753 --> 00:18:32.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I came to you in weakness
and in fear and with much trembling;

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and my speech and what I preached were

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:37.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not with persuasive words of wisdom

00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:41.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but with a demonstration
of spirit and power,

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that your faith might be,

00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:46.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not in men’s wisdom,

00:18:46.020 --> 00:18:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in God’s power.”

00:18:49.399 --> 00:18:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s the example.

00:18:51.401 --> 00:18:54.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try our best to follow that example

00:18:54.654 --> 00:18:57.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not be like men and women of the world

00:18:57.991 --> 00:19:00.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who attend these great universities.

00:19:00.410 --> 00:19:03.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they come out,
and they’re able to get doctorate degrees

00:19:03.955 --> 00:19:08.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in science or this or that,
and they kind of show all that off.

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re not like that.

00:19:12.547 --> 00:19:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we could be if we’re not careful.

00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the Bible shows

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:21.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what worldly wisdom can accomplish
and what it cannot accomplish.

00:19:21.931 --> 00:19:26.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, in Ecclesiastes 1:16-18,

00:19:26.936 --> 00:19:29.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the account starts off this way.

00:19:29.689 --> 00:19:33.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Then I said in my heart: ‘Look!

00:19:33.067 --> 00:19:35.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I have acquired great wisdom,

00:19:35.194 --> 00:19:38.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘more than anyone
who was before me in Jerusalem,

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:42.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my heart gained a great deal
of wisdom and knowledge.’”

00:19:42.744 --> 00:19:47.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It goes on:
“I applied my heart to knowing wisdom

00:19:47.331 --> 00:19:49.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to knowing madness and to knowing folly,

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:53.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and this too is a chasing after the wind.

00:19:53.838 --> 00:19:58.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For an abundance of wisdom
brings an abundance of frustration,

00:19:58.509 --> 00:20:03.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that whoever increases
knowledge increases pain.”

00:20:04.849 --> 00:20:08.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’ve got a little whiff of that,

00:20:08.561 --> 00:20:11.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Know-it-all,

00:20:11.189 --> 00:20:14.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then blow it away.

00:20:14.442 --> 00:20:16.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Move away from it.

00:20:16.444 --> 00:20:18.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t want to think that way.

00:20:18.571 --> 00:20:21.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s never try to be a know-it-all.

00:20:21.866 --> 00:20:25.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus doesn’t know everything
that he has been learning

00:20:25.036 --> 00:20:27.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah for aeons of time.

00:20:27.663 --> 00:20:29.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how long is an aeon?

00:20:29.749 --> 00:20:33.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An aeon is a really, really, superlong,

00:20:33.294 --> 00:20:36.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
impossible-to-measure length of time.

00:20:36.923 --> 00:20:38.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an aeon.

00:20:38.966 --> 00:20:41.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah knows everything.

00:20:41.594 --> 00:20:43.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep that in mind.

00:20:43.596 --> 00:20:46.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is nothing beyond his understanding.

00:20:46.349 --> 00:20:47.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know that?

00:20:47.767 --> 00:20:49.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible tells us.

00:20:49.185 --> 00:20:52.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That same chapter where he mentions
a grasshopper

00:20:52.188 --> 00:20:54.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 40—

00:20:54.232 --> 00:20:57.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this time verses 13 and 14 say:

00:20:57.693 --> 00:21:00.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who has taken the measurements
of the spirit of Jehovah,

00:21:00.446 --> 00:21:03.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and who can instruct him as [an] adviser?

00:21:03.157 --> 00:21:06.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With whom did he consult
to gain understanding,

00:21:06.369 --> 00:21:11.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or who teaches him in the path of justice,
or teaches him knowledge,

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or shows him the way of true understanding?”

00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:17.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:21.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can know what we need to know

00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:24.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the time we need to know it.

00:21:24.137 --> 00:21:26.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s a mouthful!

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:30.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or should we say, “a headful”?

00:21:32.353 --> 00:21:37.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, all of you graduates of Gilead School,

00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:43.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please share with others
what you’ve learned here at Gilead School.

00:21:43.614 --> 00:21:46.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t walk away from this talk thinking
you should keep your mouths closed.

00:21:46.659 --> 00:21:48.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not saying that.

00:21:48.077 --> 00:21:51.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But control what you say and when you say it

00:21:51.956 --> 00:21:54.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to whom you tell it to.

00:21:56.961 --> 00:22:01.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know that you’ve learned
so much at this school,

00:22:01.966 --> 00:22:04.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but share it discreetly.

00:22:04.385 --> 00:22:07.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep in mind these words of King Solomon.

00:22:07.763 --> 00:22:10.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “There is an appointed time
for everything, . . .

00:22:10.766 --> 00:22:15.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a time to be silent and a time to speak.”

00:22:15.146 --> 00:22:19.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t point to yourselves; point heavenward.

00:22:19.066 --> 00:22:23.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always glorify Jehovah; point to Jehovah.

00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:27.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Governing Body members
—all of us—

00:22:27.366 --> 00:22:30.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to be very careful ourselves

00:22:30.786 --> 00:22:35.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we get credit for things
that we are not responsible for.

00:22:35.082 --> 00:22:37.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers will come and hug you:

00:22:37.084 --> 00:22:40.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh, thank you, brother,
you Governing Body member

00:22:40.004 --> 00:22:42.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you really, wow, whoo, how, wah!”

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know we didn’t do anything.

00:22:52.266 --> 00:22:56.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could have done
what we did if you’d been in our seat.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:23:00.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jehovah’s spirit that causes
these things to happen.

00:23:00.274 --> 00:23:03.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it’s true that we’re tools that he uses,

00:23:03.277 --> 00:23:05.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he’s the One.

00:23:05.571 --> 00:23:07.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re not saying that you can’t say,

00:23:07.782 --> 00:23:10.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Thank you, brother,
for what you’re doing, the work that you do.”

00:23:10.576 --> 00:23:12.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, we’re not saying that.

00:23:12.078 --> 00:23:12.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just—

00:23:12.828 --> 00:23:16.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be careful that you’re not glorifying men,

00:23:16.791 --> 00:23:20.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but glorify God.

00:23:20.294 --> 00:23:24.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body gets credit
that we don’t deserve.

00:23:24.423 --> 00:23:26.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It belongs to Jehovah and Jesus,

00:23:26.926 --> 00:23:29.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we haven’t been able to close the mouths

00:23:29.887 --> 00:23:33.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of over eight million bleating sheep.

00:23:33.432 --> 00:23:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we will keep trying.

00:23:38.229 --> 00:23:40.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in conclusion,

00:23:42.775 --> 00:23:47.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be like the grasshopper
that rode on the back of the elephant.

00:23:47.655 --> 00:23:51.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay close to Jehovah, and enjoy the ride;

00:23:51.659 --> 00:23:54.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but always give Him the credit

00:23:54.453 --> 00:23:57.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your accomplishments.

00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:11.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we thank you so much, Brother Herd,

00:24:11.887 --> 00:24:13.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that excellent warning for us.

00:24:13.931 --> 00:24:17.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the one day
I mention insects in my introduction,

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:19.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Herd uses insects in his talk.

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:21.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess we do need to know about insects.

00:24:23.482 --> 00:24:25.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now we’re looking forward to hearing

00:24:25.526 --> 00:24:29.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a helper to the Service Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:24:29.238 --> 00:24:31.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Christopher Mavor,

00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:33.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Mavor
is going to speak to us on the topic

00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:36.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Count Your Days.’”

00:24:37.872 --> 00:24:42.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it true that we often “count our days”
when we anticipate an exciting event?

00:24:42.293 --> 00:24:44.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt you Gilead students

00:24:44.295 --> 00:24:46.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were counting your days
in anticipation of this day.

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:50.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, if you were,
you know that today is

00:24:50.509 --> 00:24:55.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 138th day
of your Gilead School experience.

00:24:56.557 --> 00:25:00.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after today,
will you continue to ‘count your days’?

00:25:00.436 --> 00:25:02.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should you?

00:25:02.146 --> 00:25:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that question,
please open your Bibles to the 90th Psalm,

00:25:06.609 --> 00:25:09.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s a prayer that Moses said to Jehovah.

00:25:09.403 --> 00:25:11.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what Moses
asked him in verse 12:

00:25:13.366 --> 00:25:16.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Teach us how to count our days

00:25:16.369 --> 00:25:20.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we may acquire a heart of wisdom.”

00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:27.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the answer to this question is,
Yes, we should continue to count our days.

00:25:27.088 --> 00:25:30.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does that mean—count your days?

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:35.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why will we need God’s help to do it?

00:25:35.054 --> 00:25:37.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is this:

00:25:37.056 --> 00:25:41.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we are dedicated servants
of Jehovah God.

00:25:41.352 --> 00:25:45.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each and every day,
we need to make sure that we are using it

00:25:45.689 --> 00:25:49.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his service to bring him glory.

00:25:49.777 --> 00:25:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’re imperfect,
so this is not always easy to do.

00:25:53.656 --> 00:25:56.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if we look at verse 10
of the 90th Psalm,

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we notice that Moses said
that our days are few

00:25:58.702 --> 00:26:02.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are filled
with a lot of difficulties.

00:26:02.039 --> 00:26:06.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need God’s help
to fulfill our dedication.

00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to count our days,
and Jehovah promises

00:26:09.463 --> 00:26:11.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he will be there to help us.

00:26:11.966 --> 00:26:16.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice this promise at Isaiah 30:21.

00:26:19.014 --> 00:26:22.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah says: “And your own ears
will hear a word behind you saying,

00:26:22.643 --> 00:26:24.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This is the way.

00:26:24.562 --> 00:26:26.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Walk in it,’ 

00:26:26.397 --> 00:26:30.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in case you should go to the right
or in case you should go to the left.”

00:26:30.025 --> 00:26:32.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the reality is that we need Jehovah

00:26:32.445 --> 00:26:36.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to live a dedicated life to him.

00:26:36.407 --> 00:26:38.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thankfully,
we don’t need to figure it out on our own.

00:26:38.701 --> 00:26:40.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s there to guide and direct us.

00:26:40.703 --> 00:26:42.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you note what he expects of us?

00:26:42.997 --> 00:26:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking back at that scripture,
he says that when he tells you something,

00:26:46.876 --> 00:26:49.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“walk in it.”

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:52.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an emphatic statement, isn’t it?

00:26:52.298 --> 00:26:54.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t leave any doubt.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to do it
and make it happen in our life.

00:26:58.095 --> 00:27:02.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot be passive about our dedication.

00:27:02.266 --> 00:27:04.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, as Christians,
we live a very busy life.

00:27:04.685 --> 00:27:06.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have various events to go to.

00:27:06.687 --> 00:27:08.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And especially
if you’re in full-time service,

00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:10.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, you are given an assignment

00:27:10.774 --> 00:27:13.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and oftentimes
that assignment is spelled out for you,

00:27:13.903 --> 00:27:17.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the schedule in which
to accomplish that work is set for us.

00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t really need
to think too much about it.

00:27:20.701 --> 00:27:22.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if we’re not careful,

00:27:22.828 --> 00:27:25.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could just get carried along
with the flow of time

00:27:25.998 --> 00:27:30.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the flow of the work and not remember

00:27:30.002 --> 00:27:34.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why we are doing it
and who we are doing it for.

00:27:34.089 --> 00:27:37.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we could become like
this fine young brother on a raft.

00:27:37.259 --> 00:27:40.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is enjoying himself;
he’s going with the flow of the time.

00:27:40.471 --> 00:27:44.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is he really mindful
of where he is going and why?

00:27:46.393 --> 00:27:48.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s sitting down; he’s looking all around.

00:27:48.479 --> 00:27:50.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The oar is not in his hand.

00:27:50.314 --> 00:27:53.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s not actively steering his life;
he’s passive.

00:27:53.859 --> 00:27:57.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, being passive
in our dedication to Jehovah

00:27:57.488 --> 00:28:00.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a very dangerous situation

00:28:00.282 --> 00:28:03.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as Ecclesiastes 9:11 tells us:

00:28:03.285 --> 00:28:06.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Time and unexpected events overtake us.’

00:28:06.997 --> 00:28:09.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this fine brother
is about to get a rude awakening.

00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:13.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An unexpected rock has popped up.

00:28:13.087 --> 00:28:16.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sudden storm of difficulties
has overtaken him.

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:20.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he was passive,
he was caught off guard.

00:28:20.052 --> 00:28:21.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He lost his balance.

00:28:21.679 --> 00:28:23.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he’s suffering spiritual shipwreck.

00:28:24.848 --> 00:28:28.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not count his days.

00:28:28.394 --> 00:28:30.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He forgot to listen to Jehovah God

00:28:30.813 --> 00:28:34.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to pay attention
to his dedication in his life.

00:28:34.483 --> 00:28:36.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t listening.

00:28:37.570 --> 00:28:40.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus emphasized
that it’s so important for us

00:28:40.656 --> 00:28:43.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be passive
about our dedication to God.

00:28:43.826 --> 00:28:46.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 13:24, Jesus made it clear

00:28:46.996 --> 00:28:52.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are to ‘exert ourselves vigorously,’

00:28:52.042 --> 00:28:54.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just at a work assignment,

00:28:54.878 --> 00:28:57.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in our life as a Christian

00:28:57.923 --> 00:29:02.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—being personally involved in what
we are doing in our Christian dedication.

00:29:02.928 --> 00:29:06.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul also gave good counsel
to the young man Timothy

00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:07.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we benefit from today.

00:29:07.808 --> 00:29:11.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Timothy 4:7,
you’ll recall that Paul said:

00:29:11.103 --> 00:29:13.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Train yourself

00:29:13.188 --> 00:29:16.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with godly devotion as your aim.”

00:29:18.235 --> 00:29:21.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when we’re training ourselves,
that means we’re not finished yet;

00:29:21.572 --> 00:29:25.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re still in the competition;
we’re still in training.

00:29:25.326 --> 00:29:29.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Godly devotion
must be something that we personally do

00:29:29.663 --> 00:29:32.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for ourselves and work at it.

00:29:32.082 --> 00:29:36.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just doesn’t happen on its own.

00:29:36.712 --> 00:29:39.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But thankfully, Jehovah helps us.

00:29:39.048 --> 00:29:41.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s given us his Word, the Bible.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:45.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s given us his organization, which
helps us apply Bible principles in our life

00:29:45.387 --> 00:29:48.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gives us warnings
on the things to look out for.

00:29:48.807 --> 00:29:51.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s up to us to do it.

00:29:51.894 --> 00:29:54.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if Jehovah gives us the oar,

00:29:54.396 --> 00:29:58.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he says, ‘Now pick it up,
and use it in your stream of time.’

00:29:58.525 --> 00:30:01.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we do,
then we’re like this young brother now.

00:30:01.612 --> 00:30:04.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s taking a firm hold on the oar.

00:30:04.823 --> 00:30:08.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s using it even during
peaceful times in his life,

00:30:08.285 --> 00:30:13.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making sure that his life is continuing on
in a faithful Christian course.

00:30:13.290 --> 00:30:18.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, when he encounters
temptations or trials,

00:30:18.087 --> 00:30:21.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, he’s got his oar in his hand.

00:30:21.215 --> 00:30:24.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is there to help him
and to guide and direct him,

00:30:24.093 --> 00:30:27.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to navigate through the difficult times.

00:30:27.429 --> 00:30:31.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes effort;
it can be distressing,

00:30:31.558 --> 00:30:34.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah has given us the means

00:30:34.937 --> 00:30:38.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to navigate through these difficult times
and to continue on in pursuing

00:30:38.816 --> 00:30:41.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our dedicated Christian life.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus set the perfect example in this.

00:30:47.282 --> 00:30:52.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day, Jesus relied
heavily on Jehovah’s direction.

00:30:52.246 --> 00:30:54.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not take it for granted.

00:30:54.707 --> 00:30:58.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus knew that when he was sent
to the earth, he had an assignment;

00:30:58.419 --> 00:31:01.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was on a very strict time budget.

00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:04.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was humanly impossible, really,

00:31:04.383 --> 00:31:06.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a man, even a perfect man,

00:31:06.885 --> 00:31:09.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accomplish what Jesus did.

00:31:09.888 --> 00:31:11.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He relied on Jehovah.

00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:14.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did not take a casual viewpoint of it,

00:31:14.309 --> 00:31:17.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but every day he looked to Jehovah

00:31:17.271 --> 00:31:22.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help him to apply the principles
that he learned through His Word

00:31:22.276 --> 00:31:25.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the direction that he received
from Jehovah God

00:31:25.028 --> 00:31:28.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in going through this difficult assignment.

00:31:28.073 --> 00:31:30.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus knew at the end of the day

00:31:30.117 --> 00:31:32.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—after the things he preached
and the things he did—

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:34.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that that was a miracle.

00:31:34.788 --> 00:31:38.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said so at John 14:10.

00:31:38.208 --> 00:31:43.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “The Father who remains
in union with me is doing his works.”

00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:47.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew that Jehovah was backing him up,

00:31:47.050 --> 00:31:49.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus worked with Jehovah.

00:31:49.845 --> 00:31:52.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t take a casual view of it.

00:31:53.766 --> 00:31:58.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can have
the same kind of confidence in Jehovah.

00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:01.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is there for us,
even when we are encountering something

00:32:01.732 --> 00:32:05.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we feel is humanly impossible.

00:32:05.068 --> 00:32:07.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a good example of that.

00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:11.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a couple
who graduated in the 24th class of Gilead.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:14.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their names are Malcolm and Grace Allen.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, their life story
is in the October 15, 2013, <i>Watchtower, </i>

00:32:18.791 --> 00:32:20.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s really worthwhile reading.

00:32:20.793 --> 00:32:23.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will find that in their early life
they both pioneered;

00:32:23.921 --> 00:32:26.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they got married; they pioneered together;

00:32:26.089 --> 00:32:28.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were in the circuit work
for a number of years;

00:32:28.175 --> 00:32:30.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were invited to Gilead;

00:32:30.177 --> 00:32:32.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after Gilead,
they were assigned to Brooklyn Bethel.

00:32:32.805 --> 00:32:36.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there Brother Allen served
in some very responsible positions,

00:32:36.517 --> 00:32:38.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his wife was a housekeeper.

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:42.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They loved their Bethel service.

00:32:42.356 --> 00:32:45.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But 25 years into their Bethel career,

00:32:45.818 --> 00:32:49.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their course in life took a sudden change
—a detour.

00:32:49.321 --> 00:32:51.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unexpectedly,

00:32:51.490 --> 00:32:55.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both sets of parents
became very ill and needy,

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:59.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it became apparent that they
would have to relinquish their Bethel service

00:32:59.206 --> 00:33:02.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and full-time service
in order to care for them.

00:33:02.626 --> 00:33:07.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, mind you, at this point in their life,
they’re both in their late 50’s.

00:33:07.256 --> 00:33:11.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They used their youth in service to God,
so Brother Allen did not really have

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:15.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a secular career
or a skill on which to go back to.

00:33:16.974 --> 00:33:20.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He needed to start in his late 50’s

00:33:20.352 --> 00:33:22.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the breadwinner of the family.

00:33:22.729 --> 00:33:27.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Allen now needed
to take care of both sets of parents.

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:30.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a sharp change in events for them,

00:33:30.404 --> 00:33:33.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they held firm to their oar

00:33:33.532 --> 00:33:35.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God had given them.

00:33:35.659 --> 00:33:39.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They learned to rely on Jehovah God
and to lean on him

00:33:39.496 --> 00:33:42.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every inch of the way,
and they were successful.

00:33:42.374 --> 00:33:44.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Allen found a job
as an insurance salesman,

00:33:44.751 --> 00:33:47.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which provided for the family.

00:33:47.212 --> 00:33:50.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they kept going,
even though it was stressful times.

00:33:50.173 --> 00:33:52.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were successful.

00:33:52.259 --> 00:33:54.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, eventually,
their parents died, and they thought,

00:33:54.845 --> 00:33:57.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, maybe
we can return to Bethel service.’

00:33:57.180 --> 00:34:00.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But unfortunately,
at this point in their life,

00:34:00.017 --> 00:34:03.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their own health and age overtook them.

00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:05.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now they had to be content with being

00:34:05.731 --> 00:34:08.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
good, local, congregation publishers.

00:34:09.943 --> 00:34:11.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they view this?

00:34:11.945 --> 00:34:15.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was this a view of failure on their part?

00:34:15.073 --> 00:34:19.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they think, ‘I failed’ or ‘I’m bitter
because of things that happened’?

00:34:19.286 --> 00:34:24.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Brother Allen makes
this very profound statement

00:34:24.124 --> 00:34:26.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about life in Jehovah’s service.

00:34:26.877 --> 00:34:29.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what he says:

00:34:29.046 --> 00:34:32.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Life is unpredictable at times, uncertain,

00:34:32.049 --> 00:34:35.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and even hard to deal with.

00:34:35.135 --> 00:34:40.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jehovah blesses those who lean on him,
not on their own understanding.

00:34:40.140 --> 00:34:42.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what my wife and I have experienced

00:34:42.601 --> 00:34:47.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over our long and rewarding life.”

00:34:47.189 --> 00:34:51.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They rejoiced in their life
as dedicated servants of God

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:55.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by taking advantage
of every opportunity to express

00:34:55.739 --> 00:34:57.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their dedication to him

00:34:57.824 --> 00:35:02.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pursuing and practicing
godly devotion in their life.

00:35:02.329 --> 00:35:04.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they saw Jehovah’s hand

00:35:04.331 --> 00:35:08.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their life in truly miraculous ways.

00:35:08.168 --> 00:35:10.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, they will experience
another miracle of God,

00:35:10.212 --> 00:35:13.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because both of them
are now sleeping in the grave.

00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:17.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that Jehovah
has already calculated the days

00:35:17.761 --> 00:35:20.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he will resurrect Malcolm and Grace

00:35:20.514 --> 00:35:24.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and bring them back to life
so that they can continue serving him

00:35:24.351 --> 00:35:27.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a dedicated way
for an eternity of days to come.

00:35:29.272 --> 00:35:31.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is certainly
a good lesson for all of us:

00:35:31.608 --> 00:35:35.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to count our days
and to be fully invested in our journey

00:35:35.237 --> 00:35:38.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a dedicated Christian to Jehovah.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:42.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, you Gilead students
and really all of us,

00:35:42.411 --> 00:35:44.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let us continue to lean on Jehovah

00:35:44.788 --> 00:35:49.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to work vigorously
at doing what Jehovah directs us to do

00:35:49.167 --> 00:35:53.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these difficult last days
—living up to our dedication to God!

00:35:53.505 --> 00:35:56.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by doing so, we can be assured

00:35:56.967 --> 00:36:00.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we too will be blessed by Jehovah.

00:36:00.053 --> 00:36:02.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will give us an eternity of days to enjoy

00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:05.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his glorious new world soon to come.

00:36:16.403 --> 00:36:18.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we thank you very much, Brother Mavor,

00:36:18.447 --> 00:36:20.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that very good reminder.

00:36:20.991 --> 00:36:23.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now we have the privilege to hear

00:36:23.243 --> 00:36:27.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from one of our more recently
appointed helpers to the Governing Body

00:36:27.539 --> 00:36:30.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Brother Leonard Myers—
a helper to the Writing Committee.

00:36:30.792 --> 00:36:33.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to speak to us on the topic

00:36:33.003 --> 00:36:35.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You Trusted in Me.’”

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You trusted in me.”

00:36:40.427 --> 00:36:43.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you may be saying:
“Brother Myers, I don’t even know you.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:45.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I trust in you?”

00:36:45.807 --> 00:36:48.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s true that we need
to have a relationship

00:36:48.018 --> 00:36:51.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an individual to truly trust him.

00:36:51.021 --> 00:36:54.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the “me” in our talk title
isn’t referring to any human;

00:36:54.691 --> 00:36:58.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s referring to our
trustworthy God, Jehovah.

00:36:58.361 --> 00:37:00.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that phrase
“you trusted in me” was stated

00:37:00.781 --> 00:37:04.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah to the faithful man Ebed-melech.

00:37:04.576 --> 00:37:06.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why could Jehovah tell him that?

00:37:06.870 --> 00:37:10.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how can his example help you students?

00:37:10.373 --> 00:37:13.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, turn with me, please,
to Jeremiah chapter 38.

00:37:13.668 --> 00:37:16.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we review his example,
look for ways

00:37:16.630 --> 00:37:20.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Ebed-melech trusted in Jehovah.

00:37:20.217 --> 00:37:23.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you know,
Ebed-melech was an Ethiopian eunuch

00:37:23.428 --> 00:37:25.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
employed in the house of King Zedekiah,

00:37:25.931 --> 00:37:29.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was a friend of the prophet Jeremiah.

00:37:29.351 --> 00:37:33.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time, Jerusalem
was under siege by the Babylonians,

00:37:33.146 --> 00:37:37.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jeremiah had repeatedly declared
that this city was doomed.

00:37:37.234 --> 00:37:41.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had encouraged the people
to save themselves by surrendering.

00:37:41.822 --> 00:37:46.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that enraged certain princes
who were Zedekiah’s advisers.

00:37:46.326 --> 00:37:49.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were determined
to defend the city at all costs,

00:37:49.621 --> 00:37:53.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jeremiah was an obstacle to that defense.

00:37:53.834 --> 00:37:57.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you look in verse 4
of Jeremiah chapter 38,

00:37:57.504 --> 00:38:01.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the princes went to Zedekiah,
and they accused Jeremiah of weakening

00:38:01.633 --> 00:38:04.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the morale of the soldiers
and all the people.

00:38:04.845 --> 00:38:09.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Weak king that he was,
Zedekiah stated in verse 5:

00:38:09.516 --> 00:38:12.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! He is in your hands,

00:38:12.519 --> 00:38:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the king cannot do anything to stop you.”

00:38:16.606 --> 00:38:18.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know what that resulted in.

00:38:18.608 --> 00:38:22.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those princes had Jeremiah
lowered into a miry, muddy cistern.

00:38:23.905 --> 00:38:27.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the food supply
being virtually exhausted in Jerusalem,

00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:31.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no hope
of Jeremiah receiving food from anyone.

00:38:31.496 --> 00:38:35.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His death was just a matter of time.

00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:37.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in stepped Ebed-melech.

00:38:37.794 --> 00:38:42.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He heard what those princes had done,
and trusting in Jehovah,

00:38:42.215 --> 00:38:46.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he approached the king,
not privately and not secretly,

00:38:46.094 --> 00:38:48.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in public at one of the city gates.

00:38:48.930 --> 00:38:51.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what he stated in verse 9:

00:38:51.766 --> 00:38:54.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O my lord the king,

00:38:54.102 --> 00:38:57.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“what these men have done
to Jeremiah the prophet is evil!

00:38:57.689 --> 00:39:00.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They have thrown him into the cistern,

00:39:00.066 --> 00:39:02.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will die there because of the famine,

00:39:02.652 --> 00:39:05.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for there is no bread left in the city.”

00:39:06.531 --> 00:39:10.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was the result
of his bold action and trust in Jehovah?

00:39:10.202 --> 00:39:13.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king stated in verse 10:

00:39:13.079 --> 00:39:15.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take 30 men with you from here,

00:39:15.916 --> 00:39:20.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pull Jeremiah the prophet
up out of the cistern before he dies.”

00:39:21.796 --> 00:39:25.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, 30 men certainly
would have served as a protection.

00:39:25.467 --> 00:39:30.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Ebed-melech may still have feared
what those princes would do to him.

00:39:30.013 --> 00:39:33.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But his concern was outweighed
by his friendship

00:39:33.183 --> 00:39:35.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and respect for Jehovah’s prophet

00:39:35.268 --> 00:39:38.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by his trust in Jehovah.

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:43.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we know, verses 11-13
outline his successful rescue mission.

00:39:45.445 --> 00:39:48.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why could Ebed-melech be so courageous

00:39:48.531 --> 00:39:52.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he approached
the king and rescued Jeremiah?

00:39:52.327 --> 00:39:55.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was because he trusted in Jehovah.

00:39:55.330 --> 00:39:58.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of that trust,
notice how Jehovah would reward him.

00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:03.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In chapter 39, we’ll start reading
in the <i>B </i> portion of verse 16.

00:40:03.421 --> 00:40:07.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Jehovah’s words
through Jeremiah to Ebed-melech:

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Here I am fulfilling my words
on this city for calamity and not for good,

00:40:12.847 --> 00:40:16.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and in that day you will see it happen.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I will rescue you
in that day,’ declares Jehovah,

00:40:20.021 --> 00:40:23.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and you will not be handed over
to the men you fear.

00:40:23.108 --> 00:40:28.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For I will surely provide you with escape,
and you will not fall by the sword.

00:40:28.029 --> 00:40:30.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You will have your life as a spoil,

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:33.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you trusted in me.’”

00:40:34.911 --> 00:40:36.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ebed-melech didn’t need to fear.

00:40:36.913 --> 00:40:39.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As he had viewed Jeremiah’s life as precious,

00:40:39.874 --> 00:40:42.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so Jehovah viewed his life as precious

00:40:42.919 --> 00:40:44.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would preserve him alive

00:40:44.921 --> 00:40:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all because, as verse 18 says,
‘he trusted in Jehovah.’

00:40:49.926 --> 00:40:54.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, whether he was deported
to Babylon and died a natural death

00:40:54.097 --> 00:40:57.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or was left back in the land of Judah,
the Bible doesn’t say, 

00:40:57.475 --> 00:40:59.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his life would be spared,

00:40:59.936 --> 00:41:03.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he could continue to worship
the God in whom he trusted.

00:41:05.066 --> 00:41:09.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this point,
Ebed-melech vanishes from Bible history

00:41:09.154 --> 00:41:13.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not his name nor the example 
that he set for you and me

00:41:13.325 --> 00:41:15.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to trust in Jehovah.

00:41:16.745 --> 00:41:20.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this thought of trusting
in Jehovah isn’t new to you students.

00:41:20.623 --> 00:41:23.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trusting in Jehovah got you to Gilead.

00:41:23.835 --> 00:41:26.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your assignments at Bethel or the field,

00:41:26.296 --> 00:41:29.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you proved your trust in God.

00:41:29.257 --> 00:41:32.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust helped you
through your studies at Gilead.

00:41:32.886 --> 00:41:35.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the times
when you prayed for Jehovah’s help

00:41:35.513 --> 00:41:37.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an assignment or a test 

00:41:37.807 --> 00:41:42.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, as one recent graduate said,
“when your brain was full and you needed

00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:44.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a full week off to digest all the material”?

00:41:44.481 --> 00:41:46.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember those times?

00:41:46.524 --> 00:41:49.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, that took trust
that Jehovah would help you.

00:41:49.944 --> 00:41:53.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you look to the future,
trusting in Jehovah

00:41:53.323 --> 00:41:56.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help you to be successful
in your assignments.

00:41:56.576 --> 00:42:01.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice these comments from graduates
of the last class of Gilead.

00:42:01.122 --> 00:42:06.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother wrote: 
“We have placed our lives in Jehovah’s hands.

00:42:06.127 --> 00:42:09.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We pray to Jehovah
with an intensity and trust

00:42:09.839 --> 00:42:12.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that never existed before.”

00:42:12.425 --> 00:42:14.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another brother wrote:

00:42:14.719 --> 00:42:18.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At times I have felt like, ‘What do we do?’

00:42:18.681 --> 00:42:23.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then I’m reminded that we confidently leave
the matter in Jehovah’s hands,

00:42:23.144 --> 00:42:27.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting that he will handle it
or make clear to us the course to take.”

00:42:29.567 --> 00:42:31.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally another brother wrote:

00:42:31.903 --> 00:42:34.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At times we have felt quite overwhelmed

00:42:34.614 --> 00:42:38.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the new language,
responsibilities, culture, and so forth.

00:42:38.785 --> 00:42:41.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, our trust in Jehovah

00:42:41.579 --> 00:42:44.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“reminds us that this is his organization

00:42:44.165 --> 00:42:46.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—his work—
and they are his sheep.

00:42:46.584 --> 00:42:51.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If we do our part and work hard,
there is no doubt that he’ll help us.

00:42:51.423 --> 00:42:54.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never have to rely on ourselves.”

00:42:56.177 --> 00:42:59.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Ebed-melech, trusting in Jehovah

00:42:59.055 --> 00:43:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help you
to be successful in your assignments.

00:43:03.351 --> 00:43:07.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are two ways
that you can add to your trust.

00:43:07.355 --> 00:43:10.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Trusting in Jehovah

00:43:10.817 --> 00:43:14.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves trusting
in the power of holy spirit.

00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
trusting in that spirit will help you

00:43:19.033 --> 00:43:21.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deal with your brothers and sisters.

00:43:21.661 --> 00:43:25.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, your assignments
will involve close contact with them.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will there be challenges at times?

00:43:27.917 --> 00:43:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very likely.
We’re all imperfect.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:34.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust that holy spirit can help you
to cultivate the love, 

00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:37.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace, patience, mildness, and self-control

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’ll need
to deal with those situations.

00:43:41.764 --> 00:43:45.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) Trusting in Jehovah means

00:43:45.101 --> 00:43:48.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusting those whom he trusts.

00:43:49.731 --> 00:43:52.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has arranged for
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:43:52.275 --> 00:43:55.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for earthly Kingdom interests.

00:43:55.403 --> 00:43:58.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in the appointment of the slave,

00:43:58.781 --> 00:44:00.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trust in Jehovah’s arrangement,

00:44:00.825 --> 00:44:04.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
follow any direction that the slave provides.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are two ways
that you can add to your trust in Jehovah.

00:44:08.583 --> 00:44:11.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We encourage you to trust in Jehovah,

00:44:11.044 --> 00:44:13.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when you face
challenging situations.

00:44:13.963 --> 00:44:17.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During those times,
remember scriptures such as these:

00:44:17.383 --> 00:44:20.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 3:5:

00:44:20.845 --> 00:44:24.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Trust in Jehovah with all your heart,

00:44:24.057 --> 00:44:27.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not rely on your own understanding”;

00:44:27.227 --> 00:44:31.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 56:3, 4:

00:44:31.689 --> 00:44:35.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.

00:44:35.443 --> 00:44:38.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In God
—whose word I praise—

00:44:38.029 --> 00:44:41.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in God I put my trust”;

00:44:41.407 --> 00:44:45.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Isaiah 26:3, 4:

00:44:45.828 --> 00:44:48.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will safeguard those
who fully lean on you;

00:44:48.915 --> 00:44:51.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you will give them continuous peace,

00:44:51.334 --> 00:44:54.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because it is in you that they trust.

00:44:54.254 --> 00:44:57.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah forever.”

00:44:58.424 --> 00:45:02.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scriptures like those
can really help you during challenging times.

00:45:02.428 --> 00:45:05.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust got you here to Gilead,

00:45:05.682 --> 00:45:07.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trust helped you through your studies,

00:45:07.892 --> 00:45:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trust in Jehovah
will help you in your assignments.

00:45:11.563 --> 00:45:15.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Ebed-melech,
continue to trust in Jehovah.

00:45:17.193 --> 00:45:20.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, one day I hope
to get to know all of you students.

00:45:20.488 --> 00:45:23.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we can truly say
that we trust one another.

00:45:23.950 --> 00:45:27.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until then, continue to trust in Jehovah

00:45:27.495 --> 00:45:30.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he can say
of you dear Gilead students:

00:45:30.623 --> 00:45:32.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You trusted in me.”

00:45:45.179 --> 00:45:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we thank you
for that excellent advice, Brother Myers.

00:45:48.725 --> 00:45:52.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we’re looking forward to hearing
from one of the Gilead instructors,

00:45:52.478 --> 00:45:56.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure all the students are going
to be interested to hear what he has to say.

00:45:56.190 --> 00:46:00.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother James Cauthon
is going to speak to us on the subject

00:46:00.278 --> 00:46:03.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Shaken but Not Forsaken.”

00:46:06.701 --> 00:46:08.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Congratulations.

00:46:08.828 --> 00:46:13.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, you become a graduate
of the 147th class of Gilead.

00:46:14.709 --> 00:46:18.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a day to be celebrated;
it’s a day to be enjoyed.

00:46:18.546 --> 00:46:21.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you deserve it; you worked hard.

00:46:21.382 --> 00:46:24.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even when you thought
you had reached your limit,

00:46:24.636 --> 00:46:26.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you didn’t give up.

00:46:26.679 --> 00:46:29.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You kept coming in;
you kept trusting in Jehovah.

00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:35.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As your instructors, we’re very pleased

00:46:35.229 --> 00:46:38.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see your happy, smiling faces.

00:46:38.650 --> 00:46:41.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we could, we’d wish that for you

00:46:41.944 --> 00:46:45.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every day for the rest of your lives.

00:46:45.156 --> 00:46:48.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, as much as we try,

00:46:48.076 --> 00:46:52.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can’t control what happens
to us in life, isn’t that true?

00:46:52.413 --> 00:46:56.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A change comes for everyone.

00:46:56.042 --> 00:46:59.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sooner or later, it’s inevitable.

00:46:59.087 --> 00:47:01.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some changes are small.

00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:06.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other changes,
however, can rock our world

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:08.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and leave us shaken to the core.

00:47:08.596 --> 00:47:11.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when that happens,
we may suddenly find

00:47:11.432 --> 00:47:14.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re no longer
the person we thought we were.

00:47:14.435 --> 00:47:17.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can seem as if our very identity

00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been ripped away from us.

00:47:20.775 --> 00:47:22.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider Moses.

00:47:22.944 --> 00:47:27.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses grew up in one of the most
luxuriant places on earth at the time,

00:47:27.323 --> 00:47:30.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, the Egyptian royal court.

00:47:30.493 --> 00:47:34.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Members of the royal household
resided in opulent mansions

00:47:34.706 --> 00:47:37.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were dotted along the Nile.

00:47:37.083 --> 00:47:40.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These homes
were decorated in precious stones,

00:47:40.211 --> 00:47:43.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
incorporated with pools and gardens.

00:47:43.047 --> 00:47:47.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They housed a large staff
that prepared lavish meals.

00:47:47.635 --> 00:47:50.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses likely had a knowledge
and understanding of some

00:47:50.972 --> 00:47:55.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the most amazing structures
the world has ever seen, and why?

00:47:55.977 --> 00:47:59.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, it’s because
he was schooled from a young age

00:47:59.605 --> 00:48:01.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in subjects such as writing,

00:48:01.691 --> 00:48:06.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
math, science, and architecture.

00:48:06.112 --> 00:48:08.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition,

00:48:08.156 --> 00:48:12.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses may have witnessed
Egypt’s rise to become a mighty empire

00:48:12.952 --> 00:48:15.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a powerful military force.

00:48:15.872 --> 00:48:19.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses enjoyed a privileged
and extravagant upbringing,

00:48:19.792 --> 00:48:23.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no doubt he became
a man of confidence and influence.

00:48:23.629 --> 00:48:26.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 7:22 says:

00:48:26.883 --> 00:48:30.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Moses was instructed
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians.

00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:35.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, he was powerful
in his words and deeds.”

00:48:35.641 --> 00:48:40.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when he killed an Egyptian
on behalf of his fellow Hebrew brother,

00:48:40.646 --> 00:48:43.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saw himself as a deliverer.

00:48:43.775 --> 00:48:45.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was confident,

00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:49.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was ready, but he was wrong.

00:48:49.697 --> 00:48:51.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know what happened.

00:48:51.324 --> 00:48:52.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He fled to Midian.

00:48:52.992 --> 00:48:56.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was no longer the favorite prince
and no longer in charge of anyone

00:48:56.579 --> 00:48:58.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
except some sheep.

00:49:00.124 --> 00:49:02.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The confidence he knew back in Egypt

00:49:02.752 --> 00:49:07.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been replaced
with confusion, loss, and fear.

00:49:07.423 --> 00:49:10.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses must have been shaken.

00:49:12.011 --> 00:49:15.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So often, disappointments in life
bring on feelings of sadness,

00:49:15.973 --> 00:49:18.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
self-doubt, and worthlessness.

00:49:18.726 --> 00:49:23.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those things, in effect,
strip us of our cherished identity.

00:49:23.731 --> 00:49:26.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re especially vulnerable

00:49:26.818 --> 00:49:31.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we define ourselves
by our natural skills and qualities

00:49:31.781 --> 00:49:34.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by what others think of us

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even by our assignment or position.

00:49:37.912 --> 00:49:40.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, when we do that, we’re saying:

00:49:40.748 --> 00:49:45.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am what I do”
or “I am what others think of me.”

00:49:45.253 --> 00:49:47.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are deceptive filters

00:49:47.797 --> 00:49:51.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that cause us to lose sight
of who we really are

00:49:51.592 --> 00:49:55.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, then, when change comes, 
we’re shaken.

00:49:55.972 --> 00:49:58.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But are we forsaken?

00:49:58.474 --> 00:50:01.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider Moses again.

00:50:01.394 --> 00:50:03.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was the chosen one to—

00:50:03.938 --> 00:50:07.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was Moses the chosen one
to deliver the Hebrews?

00:50:07.233 --> 00:50:09.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the answer is yes.

00:50:09.569 --> 00:50:11.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it Jehovah’s time?

00:50:11.821 --> 00:50:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is no,

00:50:13.823 --> 00:50:17.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and neither was he fully qualified
for the appointment

00:50:17.034 --> 00:50:19.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the assignment.

00:50:19.078 --> 00:50:21.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, he needed divine training,

00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:25.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was something
that he could not get in Egypt.

00:50:25.585 --> 00:50:30.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that he had worldly education;
he had confidence; he had poise,

00:50:30.590 --> 00:50:34.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he needed the qualities
of patience, meekness,

00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:39.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humility, and self-control
to be developed to a greater degree.

00:50:39.348 --> 00:50:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saw that,

00:50:41.350 --> 00:50:44.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knew just how to accomplish it.

00:50:44.896 --> 00:50:49.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be the lowly occupation
of being a shepherd in Midian.

00:50:50.943 --> 00:50:54.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after 40 years,

00:50:54.614 --> 00:50:57.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses sees the flaming thorn bush,

00:50:57.950 --> 00:51:00.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to his surprise and shock,

00:51:00.953 --> 00:51:05.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah commissions him 40 years later.

00:51:05.958 --> 00:51:09.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now think about how Moses
must have felt at that moment

00:51:09.629 --> 00:51:12.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the realization that he wasn’t worthless

00:51:12.548 --> 00:51:15.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that Jehovah still valued him.

00:51:15.384 --> 00:51:20.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His daily pain of heart
over the suffering of his fellow Hebrews

00:51:20.389 --> 00:51:25.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was now being replaced
with a keen anticipation

00:51:25.394 --> 00:51:27.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for what Jehovah was going to do,

00:51:27.772 --> 00:51:29.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no doubt in a marvelous way.

00:51:31.067 --> 00:51:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, you see,
Moses was never really forsaken by God.

00:51:35.905 --> 00:51:36.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:51:36.739 --> 00:51:41.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, Jehovah had been with him
every step of the way

00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:43.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during those 40 years,

00:51:43.329 --> 00:51:48.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
molding him and preparing him
for an incredible future assignment

00:51:48.334 --> 00:51:52.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could never have possibly imagined.

00:51:52.505 --> 00:51:56.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will do the same for you.

00:51:56.133 --> 00:51:58.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, he takes a long-range view.

00:51:58.928 --> 00:52:00.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees your potential.

00:52:00.930 --> 00:52:03.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows how to accomplish it.

00:52:03.599 --> 00:52:08.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember that Jehovah
will do it at the right time

00:52:08.604 --> 00:52:10.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at his time

00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:14.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that his view must be our view.

00:52:14.110 --> 00:52:18.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when a change comes,
whatever it may be,

00:52:18.489 --> 00:52:20.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just the scene;

00:52:20.658 --> 00:52:22.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not the entire movie;

00:52:22.743 --> 00:52:26.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a chapter; it’s not the book.

00:52:26.497 --> 00:52:29.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not know
what’s coming next, but don’t worry,

00:52:29.917 --> 00:52:32.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does.

00:52:32.628 --> 00:52:36.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Decades later, after leading
Jehovah’s people out of Egypt

00:52:36.632 --> 00:52:39.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and navigating through the wilderness,

00:52:39.010 --> 00:52:43.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was now time for Joshua to step up.

00:52:43.305 --> 00:52:46.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Deuteronomy 31:8

00:52:46.058 --> 00:52:48.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses said to Joshua:

00:52:48.436 --> 00:52:53.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah . . . will neither desert you
nor abandon you.”

00:52:53.024 --> 00:52:56.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those must have been
very encouraging words.

00:52:56.736 --> 00:53:01.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Moses never forgot the lesson
he learned all those years ago.

00:53:01.282 --> 00:53:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had been shaken, yes,

00:53:03.826 --> 00:53:06.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was not forsaken.

00:53:06.495 --> 00:53:11.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And perhaps that was his motivation
for writing another passage in the Bible.

00:53:12.418 --> 00:53:14.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if you remember this:

00:53:14.879 --> 00:53:19.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anyone dwelling
in the secret place of the Most High

00:53:19.550 --> 00:53:22.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will lodge under the shadow of the Almighty.

00:53:22.762 --> 00:53:24.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will say to Jehovah:

00:53:24.972 --> 00:53:27.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You are my refuge and my stronghold,

00:53:27.975 --> 00:53:30.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my God in whom I trust.’”

00:53:30.603 --> 00:53:34.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that sound familiar?—Psalm 91.

00:53:34.148 --> 00:53:37.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses had become absolutely convinced 

00:53:37.318 --> 00:53:39.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was always with him

00:53:39.945 --> 00:53:44.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the good times
and through the hard times.

00:53:44.116 --> 00:53:46.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So like Moses,

00:53:46.327 --> 00:53:49.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll experience joys

00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:51.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some disappointments

00:53:51.290 --> 00:53:54.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, sooner or later, change

00:53:54.335 --> 00:53:58.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps a change
away from a cherished assignment.

00:53:58.589 --> 00:54:01.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may feel devastating.

00:54:01.133 --> 00:54:05.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can either roll with it
or you can be rolled over by it.

00:54:07.431 --> 00:54:09.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will you roll with it?

00:54:09.433 --> 00:54:12.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can roll with it if you remember

00:54:12.603 --> 00:54:14.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you’re not your career;

00:54:14.730 --> 00:54:18.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not your assignment;
you’re not your privilege.

00:54:18.859 --> 00:54:22.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are, however, loved by God,

00:54:22.154 --> 00:54:24.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have a spiritual heritage,

00:54:24.365 --> 00:54:27.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have a wonderful, bright future.

00:54:27.076 --> 00:54:29.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you remember that,

00:54:29.245 --> 00:54:32.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can gracefully
accept the changes that come.

00:54:32.456 --> 00:54:34.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s something else you can do:

00:54:34.667 --> 00:54:38.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can use your experience to help others.

00:54:38.212 --> 00:54:41.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, your willingness 
to help others even when you’re shaken

00:54:41.799 --> 00:54:44.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a personal experience,

00:54:44.301 --> 00:54:47.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will reveal your loyalty and your maturity.

00:54:49.598 --> 00:54:53.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do little things
as if they were great things.

00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:56.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Small tasks reveal a big heart.

00:54:56.981 --> 00:55:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all a part of our training
now and for life in the new world.

00:55:01.443 --> 00:55:03.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember this too:

00:55:03.654 --> 00:55:08.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A change of circumstances
is rarely as important

00:55:08.159 --> 00:55:11.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a change of attitude.

00:55:11.537 --> 00:55:14.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s not your position,

00:55:14.039 --> 00:55:16.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it will be your disposition

00:55:16.876 --> 00:55:21.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will bring Jehovah’s blessing.

00:55:21.297 --> 00:55:25.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in conclusion: Yes, change will come.

00:55:25.259 --> 00:55:27.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world changes;

00:55:27.261 --> 00:55:30.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
circumstances change; we change.

00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:34.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Jehovah does not change,

00:55:34.185 --> 00:55:36.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Word does not change,

00:55:36.353 --> 00:55:39.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his love for you will never change.

00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:43.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while you may be shaken at times,

00:55:43.944 --> 00:55:48.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rest assured,
you will never ever be forsaken.

00:56:04.548 --> 00:56:07.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I don’t know about you,
but I marked down,

00:56:07.218 --> 00:56:09.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s not your position;
it’s your disposition.”

00:56:09.637 --> 00:56:11.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be using that one in the future.

00:56:11.639 --> 00:56:13.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very, very much, Brother Cauthon,

00:56:13.682 --> 00:56:15.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those excellent thoughts.

00:56:15.726 --> 00:56:17.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now we have the privilege to hear

00:56:17.728 --> 00:56:20.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from another of the Gilead instructors,
Brother Mark Noumair.

00:56:20.898 --> 00:56:23.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to speak to us on the topic

00:56:23.192 --> 00:56:25.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember the Vision.”

00:56:29.782 --> 00:56:32.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the rarest privileges

00:56:32.785 --> 00:56:35.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a human has ever had

00:56:35.704 --> 00:56:40.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to see a vision of Jehovah’s throne.

00:56:40.084 --> 00:56:42.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s good for us now

00:56:42.461 --> 00:56:45.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look on with a man

00:56:45.923 --> 00:56:48.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had this privilege

00:56:48.133 --> 00:56:52.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how the vision changed his life.

00:56:52.304 --> 00:56:55.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were the circumstances
around this event?

00:56:55.516 --> 00:56:59.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And more importantly for you,
how does it affect you?

00:56:59.895 --> 00:57:03.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what lessons
do we want you to take to heart?

00:57:03.649 --> 00:57:06.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please open your Bibles

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or listen closely to these words

00:57:09.488 --> 00:57:13.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded at Isaiah 6:1.

00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 6:1:

00:57:18.205 --> 00:57:22.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the year that King Uzziah died,

00:57:22.584 --> 00:57:25.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I saw Jehovah sitting

00:57:25.379 --> 00:57:28.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on a lofty and elevated throne,

00:57:28.382 --> 00:57:32.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the skirts of his robe
filled the temple.”

00:57:33.554 --> 00:57:37.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The skirts of Jehovah’s magnificent garment

00:57:37.683 --> 00:57:39.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filling the temple

00:57:39.685 --> 00:57:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this is what Isaiah saw.

00:57:41.937 --> 00:57:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it show?

00:57:43.939 --> 00:57:48.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows that Jehovah
was figuratively present in the temple

00:57:48.319 --> 00:57:51.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he was keenly aware of everything

00:57:51.947 --> 00:57:53.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was going on there,

00:57:53.949 --> 00:57:57.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including what had happened with King Uzziah.

00:57:59.121 --> 00:58:02.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, recall that Uzziah

00:58:02.082 --> 00:58:04.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was not content with his role as king.

00:58:04.626 --> 00:58:06.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he do?

00:58:06.628 --> 00:58:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He forced his way
into the holy compartment of the temple.

00:58:09.798 --> 00:58:10.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:58:10.841 --> 00:58:13.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To burn incense like a priest.

00:58:13.969 --> 00:58:17.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for that, he was struck with leprosy.

00:58:18.682 --> 00:58:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is of interest

00:58:20.809 --> 00:58:24.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah inspired Isaiah to write,

00:58:24.605 --> 00:58:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in the year

00:58:26.607 --> 00:58:31.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jotham (Uzziah’s son) became king,

00:58:31.612 --> 00:58:36.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather,
“in the year that King Uzziah died.”

00:58:37.493 --> 00:58:41.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By directing Isaiah to pen those words

00:58:41.163 --> 00:58:44.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the year that Uzziah died,

00:58:44.208 --> 00:58:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could be said
that Jehovah was setting the stage

00:58:48.837 --> 00:58:52.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for teaching Isaiah what qualities he loves

00:58:52.883 --> 00:58:56.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what qualities he hates.

00:58:56.261 --> 00:58:59.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you see, this vision is going to be

00:58:59.264 --> 00:59:01.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
life-changing for Isaiah,

00:59:01.683 --> 00:59:05.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want it to be
life-changing for you.

00:59:05.062 --> 00:59:07.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what happens next?

00:59:07.064 --> 00:59:11.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, verse 2 shows
that Jehovah reveals something

00:59:11.652 --> 00:59:16.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps no other human has seen in vision

00:59:16.448 --> 00:59:18.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—seraphs.

00:59:18.450 --> 00:59:21.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah is the only Bible writer
that mentions them.

00:59:23.372 --> 00:59:27.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the privileges these seraphs enjoy

00:59:27.251 --> 00:59:32.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—their high rank and serving close
to the Universal Sovereign—

00:59:32.256 --> 00:59:36.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
move them to humbly cover their faces

00:59:36.176 --> 00:59:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their wings

00:59:38.220 --> 00:59:41.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sing Jehovah’s praises with such power

00:59:41.807 --> 00:59:44.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the temple foundation shakes.

00:59:46.145 --> 00:59:48.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lesson in contrast

00:59:48.772 --> 00:59:53.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could Jehovah have been impressing on Isaiah?

00:59:53.277 --> 00:59:55.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider this:

00:59:55.863 --> 01:00:00.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uzziah became king at only 16 years old

01:00:00.868 --> 01:00:04.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and showed
tremendous potential at the outset.

01:00:04.913 --> 01:00:07.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Isaiah became a prophet,

01:00:07.833 --> 01:00:12.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he too was a young man,
most likely in his twenties.

01:00:12.754 --> 01:00:16.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was married to a supportive wife;
she’s called a prophetess.

01:00:17.968 --> 01:00:22.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So by showing Isaiah
the example of these humble seraphs

01:00:22.973 --> 01:00:25.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the same year Uzziah died,

01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:28.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was as if Jehovah was saying:

01:00:28.687 --> 01:00:32.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You know, Isaiah, you’re a fine young man.

01:00:32.483 --> 01:00:34.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You have a bright future.

01:00:34.485 --> 01:00:36.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You have a good wife.

01:00:36.487 --> 01:00:41.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But don’t become presumptuous like Uzziah.’

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:45.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful contrast
for Isaiah to meditate on!

01:00:45.913 --> 01:00:49.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt this affected him deeply.

01:00:49.374 --> 01:00:52.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is your first lesson:

01:00:52.544 --> 01:00:57.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Isaiah, you have a bright future.

01:00:57.007 --> 01:01:00.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t miss the purpose
of why you’ve been called to Gilead.

01:01:00.969 --> 01:01:04.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your assignment is to honor Jehovah God.

01:01:04.139 --> 01:01:07.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been trained
to support his organization.

01:01:07.726 --> 01:01:11.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are investing in you for the future.

01:01:11.396 --> 01:01:15.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So remember the vision.

01:01:15.234 --> 01:01:17.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate the seraphs.

01:01:17.528 --> 01:01:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cover your face,

01:01:19.988 --> 01:01:22.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and don’t spoil your humility

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:26.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by drawing undue attention to yourself.

01:01:26.578 --> 01:01:29.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, even the most subtle boasting

01:01:29.706 --> 01:01:34.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
invites others to take
a peek at you and look in.

01:01:34.545 --> 01:01:36.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Who are you?
What are you doing?’

01:01:36.588 --> 01:01:41.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that detracts from Jehovah’s glory.

01:01:41.009 --> 01:01:43.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when tempted to blow your own horn,

01:01:43.845 --> 01:01:47.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember the mighty song of the seraphs.

01:01:47.099 --> 01:01:50.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sing Jehovah’s praises, not your own.

01:01:50.394 --> 01:01:52.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Any privilege you receive

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:56.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should make you
more humble like the seraphs,

01:01:56.775 --> 01:01:59.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not puff you up like Uzziah.

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:03.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by remaining humble,
Jehovah can use you to a greater extent.

01:02:03.991 --> 01:02:05.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:09.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he can trust you
to give him the glory.

01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seraphs
—they don’t aspire to be kings;

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t aspire to be priests.

01:02:15.002 --> 01:02:19.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they’re content
with their role as workers.

01:02:19.339 --> 01:02:22.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So be like the seraphs by doing your part

01:02:22.759 --> 01:02:25.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance pure worship.

01:02:25.846 --> 01:02:29.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else could Isaiah learn from this song?

01:02:29.474 --> 01:02:34.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, chapter 6, verse 3b says:

01:02:34.229 --> 01:02:37.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The whole earth is filled with his glory.”

01:02:37.566 --> 01:02:40.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s an interesting statement.

01:02:40.611 --> 01:02:45.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why may Jehovah have included
those words as part of the vision?

01:02:45.324 --> 01:02:47.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider this:

01:02:47.784 --> 01:02:51.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah was faced
with extreme apathy in his assignment.

01:02:51.455 --> 01:02:53.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The land of Judah was full of false worship.

01:02:53.832 --> 01:02:58.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rebellious ten-tribe kingdom of Samaria
had rejected Jehovah.

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:01.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To Isaiah, it could have felt
like no one was glorifying Jehovah.

01:03:01.506 --> 01:03:03.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Where’s the glory for Jehovah?’

01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:06.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he focused on those trials,

01:03:06.595 --> 01:03:09.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it could have been so easy for him
to get discouraged, to give up.

01:03:09.973 --> 01:03:12.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What’s the use?
Why should I put up with this?

01:03:12.184 --> 01:03:14.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one is listening.’

01:03:14.394 --> 01:03:17.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what would help him not to give up?

01:03:17.397 --> 01:03:20.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would need to go back to the vision

01:03:20.942 --> 01:03:23.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and imagine a future time

01:03:23.195 --> 01:03:26.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the whole earth
being filled with Jehovah’s glory.

01:03:26.657 --> 01:03:30.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with eyes of faith,
Isaiah would focus on what Jehovah

01:03:30.702 --> 01:03:33.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was yet to accomplish as part of His purpose.

01:03:33.997 --> 01:03:38.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah strengthened Isaiah
with prophecies about the future

01:03:38.919 --> 01:03:41.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the whole earth
would be filled with His glory

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—prophecies about the Messiah
and the restoration of true worship.

01:03:46.677 --> 01:03:49.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah himself even witnessed

01:03:49.054 --> 01:03:52.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophecy
being fulfilled in his own lifetime

01:03:52.015 --> 01:03:55.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the fall of the ten-tribe kingdom
to the Assyrians.

01:03:57.437 --> 01:04:02.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then more than 40 years later
after his hard work,

01:04:02.192 --> 01:04:04.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imagine, he was honored to record

01:04:04.361 --> 01:04:06.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of the most spectacular demonstrations

01:04:06.822 --> 01:04:10.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God’s executional power in all Scripture

01:04:10.575 --> 01:04:15.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the destruction
of 185,000 soldiers in one night.

01:04:15.205 --> 01:04:17.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An outstanding reminder:

01:04:17.249 --> 01:04:22.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Isaiah, my glory
is indeed filling the whole earth.’

01:04:23.004 --> 01:04:25.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if Jehovah was saying:

01:04:25.132 --> 01:04:27.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Isaiah, listen;

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know you see badness among people,

01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:31.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘but keep your focus.

01:04:31.763 --> 01:04:35.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Focus on the good things
that I’m accomplishing right now

01:04:35.350 --> 01:04:38.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will accomplish in the future.’

01:04:39.271 --> 01:04:42.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is lesson number two for you:

01:04:42.482 --> 01:04:46.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you find yourself
becoming consumed with trials

01:04:46.528 --> 01:04:48.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the imperfections of others

01:04:48.530 --> 01:04:51.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(maybe some you work with two,
three, four, five here and there),

01:04:51.908 --> 01:04:53.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the frustrations of the work,

01:04:53.952 --> 01:04:56.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being passed over again for a privilege,

01:04:56.538 --> 01:04:59.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you start thinking:
‘What’s the use of working hard?

01:04:59.708 --> 01:05:03.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why am I trying so hard to apply
the good training I’ve received at Gilead?

01:05:03.545 --> 01:05:05.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one here cares’

01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:07.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—take a deep breath.

01:05:07.591 --> 01:05:09.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back away;

01:05:09.593 --> 01:05:11.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
return to the vision;

01:05:11.636 --> 01:05:16.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shift the focus off yourself
and onto the big picture,

01:05:16.641 --> 01:05:21.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is the whole earth
being filled with Jehovah’s glory.

01:05:23.607 --> 01:05:28.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put your focus
on the 8.5 million people earth wide

01:05:28.528 --> 01:05:32.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are glorifying Jehovah God
in his great spiritual temple.

01:05:32.157 --> 01:05:34.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each one is playing
a small but valuable role

01:05:34.993 --> 01:05:37.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accomplishing Jehovah’s purpose.

01:05:37.454 --> 01:05:40.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do that,
it will help you to cherish

01:05:40.332 --> 01:05:44.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your place in God’s global arrangement.

01:05:45.921 --> 01:05:48.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next comes the invitation.

01:05:48.924 --> 01:05:52.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The invitation
—here it comes.

01:05:52.803 --> 01:05:55.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that invitation in verse 8

01:05:55.847 --> 01:06:00.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so real, so vivid,
to Isaiah that he’s moved to declare:

01:06:00.352 --> 01:06:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here I am! [Here I am!] Send me!”

01:06:04.147 --> 01:06:07.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No hesitation
—he didn’t ask what he would gain.

01:06:07.734 --> 01:06:11.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t ask what other assignments
his contemporary prophets got.

01:06:11.238 --> 01:06:13.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What about that one?
What about this one?

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s Micah going to do?
Hosea and what—?’

01:06:15.242 --> 01:06:16.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just said:
“Here I am! Send me!”

01:06:20.664 --> 01:06:22.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

01:06:22.707 --> 01:06:26.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the fact is he didn’t know
everything he was signing up for.

01:06:26.878 --> 01:06:29.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those details would come later,

01:06:29.881 --> 01:06:32.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they did

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:34.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—about 17 years later.

01:06:35.554 --> 01:06:40.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now Isaiah is told to take
his small son Shear-jashub

01:06:40.559 --> 01:06:44.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go meet King Ahaz
—wicked King Ahaz—

01:06:44.229 --> 01:06:46.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and offer him help.

01:06:46.231 --> 01:06:48.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, can you imagine?

01:06:48.233 --> 01:06:50.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah
—what was he thinking?

01:06:50.527 --> 01:06:52.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute, Jehovah.

01:06:52.821 --> 01:06:55.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Ahaz murders his own children,

01:06:55.574 --> 01:06:58.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and now you want me
to take my son along?

01:06:58.994 --> 01:07:02.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said:
“Here I am! Send me—not us.”’

01:07:02.372 --> 01:07:05.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about his wife?

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:07.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about his wife?

01:07:07.794 --> 01:07:10.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Isaiah, you’re not taking my little boy.

01:07:10.213 --> 01:07:12.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shear-jashub, get back here.’

01:07:12.215 --> 01:07:16.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, you don’t know,
but it just helps you to think about this.

01:07:16.636 --> 01:07:20.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So both Isaiah and his wife

01:07:20.807 --> 01:07:24.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would need to return
to the vision for reassurance

01:07:24.686 --> 01:07:28.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s skirts, his attention,
was indeed filling Judah.

01:07:28.607 --> 01:07:30.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was aware of everything.

01:07:30.609 --> 01:07:34.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would need to trust in Jehovah
—follow his direction.

01:07:34.738 --> 01:07:37.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah, in effect, said:
‘I’ll go; I’ll go.

01:07:37.699 --> 01:07:41.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be faithful even if the king is not.’

01:07:41.244 --> 01:07:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah did not let
the tests of others make him fail his.

01:07:47.751 --> 01:07:49.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lesson number three:

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assignments to support the Kingdom work

01:07:52.672 --> 01:07:55.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not always easy,

01:07:55.216 --> 01:07:57.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you wives feel it too.

01:07:57.928 --> 01:08:01.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When your husband receives
an assignment perhaps no one else wants,

01:08:01.765 --> 01:08:04.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you play a crucial role.

01:08:04.267 --> 01:08:07.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will you respond
when he tells you of the assignment?

01:08:07.479 --> 01:08:09.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why did they pick you?

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can’t you tell them to find someone else?

01:08:11.942 --> 01:08:13.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You did it last time.’

01:08:13.985 --> 01:08:17.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or will you be proud of your husband

01:08:17.656 --> 01:08:19.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—proud of him for being Isaiah-like,

01:08:19.741 --> 01:08:21.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accepting the assignments faithfully,

01:08:21.952 --> 01:08:24.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even volunteering for them?

01:08:24.037 --> 01:08:29.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wives,
your support is priceless in God’s eyes,

01:08:29.042 --> 01:08:31.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it can make all the difference.

01:08:33.296 --> 01:08:37.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you think
Isaiah remembered the vision?

01:08:37.717 --> 01:08:42.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt he recalled
not only the images but the sounds 

01:08:42.222 --> 01:08:44.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s skirts stretching,

01:08:44.432 --> 01:08:46.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filling the temple;

01:08:46.434 --> 01:08:49.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the seraphs’ powerful wings
beating through the air;

01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:52.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the melodious words echoing in song.

01:08:52.023 --> 01:08:55.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would no doubt be
permanently etched in his mind.

01:08:55.944 --> 01:08:58.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can only imagine
that Isaiah and his wife

01:08:58.446 --> 01:09:02.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
replayed that vision
over and over again in their minds.

them to hold on to Jehovah

and never let go for those 40 plus years.

01:09:08.665 --> 01:09:11.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the vision can do the same for you.

That’s the point.

especially when times are hard.

01:09:22.095 --> 01:09:24.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you are struggling

you have a challenge
you have to overcome,

01:09:26.599 --> 01:09:30.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might even feel at times
like you’re swimming in mud,

01:09:30.603 --> 01:09:32.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t give up.

01:09:32.605 --> 01:09:35.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make the vision come alive in your mind.

And then
—and then apply the lessons in your life.

Apply these wonderful Scriptural lessons

Imitate the seraphs:
Cover your face; stay humble.

01:09:52.125 --> 01:09:54.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See God’s glory filling the whole earth.

01:09:54.753 --> 01:09:56.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on the big picture.
