00:01.283 --> 00:03.285
The theme for our program is 


00:03.285 --> 00:06.622
“The Women Proclaiming the Good News.” 


00:06.622 --> 00:09.759
Sadly, throughout human history 


00:09.758 --> 00:14.763
women have been subjected 
to injustice, violence, and abuse. 


00:14.763 --> 00:16.800
Why is that? 


00:16.800 --> 00:19.868
The Bible explains. 


00:19.868 --> 00:24.873
In the latter part of Genesis 3:16, 


00:24.873 --> 00:28.143
notice what God says: 


00:28.143 --> 00:30.346
“Your longing will be for your husband, 


00:30.347 --> 00:34.000
and he will dominate you.” 


00:35.052 --> 00:39.455
When God said 
that Adam would “dominate” his wife, 


00:39.455 --> 00:44.460
God was not indicating His approval 
of the subjugation of woman by man. 


00:44.460 --> 00:47.463
He was simply foretelling 
the sad consequences 


00:47.463 --> 00:50.300
of sin on the first couple. 


00:50.300 --> 00:54.970
So abuse of women 
is a direct outcome 


00:54.970 --> 00:59.275
of the sinful nature of humans, 
not of God’s will. 


00:59.275 --> 01:01.477
Right down to our day, 


01:01.477 --> 01:03.647
rarely have women been accorded 


01:03.647 --> 01:07.150
the dignity that God 
wants them to receive. 


01:07.150 --> 01:12.022
However, Jehovah makes clear 
in his Word, the Bible, 


01:12.022 --> 01:15.992
that women and men 
have equal standing before him. 


01:15.992 --> 01:20.230
In fact, he indicated 
that women would play a vital role 


01:20.230 --> 01:23.733
in the outworking of his purpose.


01:23.733 --> 01:29.738
Our theme is based on Psalm 68:11. 


01:29.738 --> 01:31.808
Let’s read it: 


01:31.808 --> 01:34.543
“Jehovah gives the command; 


01:34.543 --> 01:38.000
the women proclaiming 
the good news are a large army.” 


01:39.048 --> 01:41.383
Those words were inspired by God. 


01:41.383 --> 01:45.000
But what did the psalmist 
have in mind when he penned them?


01:46.322 --> 01:48.992
The context of Psalm 68 


01:48.992 --> 01:54.730
shows that David was praising 
Jehovah as a God of saving acts. 


01:54.730 --> 01:57.600
From the time of their Exodus from Egypt, 


01:57.600 --> 02:01.637
the men of Israel often had to fight 
against enemy nations. 


02:01.637 --> 02:05.375
With Jehovah’s help, 
they defeated them. 


02:05.375 --> 02:07.877
And the entire nation would then rejoice 


02:07.877 --> 02:10.880
over the victory Jehovah had given them.


02:10.880 --> 02:15.083
The first of the victory celebrations 
recorded in the Bible 


02:15.083 --> 02:17.720
was at the time 
that Jehovah gave his people 


02:17.720 --> 02:21.000
the victory over Pharaoh 
and the Egyptians who were pursuing them. 


02:22.692 --> 02:27.697
Exodus 15:20, 21 


02:27.697 --> 02:32.769
tells what happened 
after this miraculous victory: 


02:32.768 --> 02:36.705
“Then Miriam the prophetess, 
Aaron’s sister, 


02:36.705 --> 02:38.942
“took a tambourine in her hand, 


02:38.942 --> 02:43.345
“and all the women followed her 
with tambourines and with dances. 


02:43.345 --> 02:46.815
“Miriam sang in response to the men: 


02:46.815 --> 02:48.918
“‘Sing to Jehovah, 


02:48.918 --> 02:52.255
“‘for he has become highly exalted. 


02:52.255 --> 02:56.860
The horse and its rider 
he has hurled into the sea.’” 


02:56.860 --> 02:59.428
Picture that scene. 


02:59.428 --> 03:02.031
There were 
an estimated three million people 


03:02.032 --> 03:04.034
in the nation of Israel. 


03:04.033 --> 03:07.636
Imagine
—out of that large number, 


03:07.637 --> 03:11.640
“all the women” were dancing 
and singing praises to Jehovah. 


03:11.640 --> 03:15.978
That was undoubtedly a large army! 


03:15.978 --> 03:20.000
What a great shout of praise 
to Jehovah that was!


03:21.283 --> 03:24.653
Another example was 
when King Saul and his general David 


03:24.653 --> 03:27.590
returned from victory over the Philistines. 


03:27.590 --> 03:29.625
Let’s read the account 


03:29.625 --> 03:35.000
at 1 Samuel 18:6. 


03:36.165 --> 03:38.300
“When David and the others would return 


03:38.300 --> 03:40.270
“from striking down the Philistines, 


03:40.270 --> 03:42.272
“the women would come out 


03:42.272 --> 03:43.974
“from all the cities of Israel 


03:43.973 --> 03:46.910
“with song and dances to meet King Saul 


03:46.910 --> 03:48.912
“with tambourines, 


03:48.912 --> 03:51.714
with rejoicing, and with lutes.” 


03:51.713 --> 03:54.016
Notice that the account says 


03:54.017 --> 03:57.420
that the women came out of “all the cities” 


03:57.420 --> 04:01.257
to greet them with music, song, and dance. 


04:01.257 --> 04:03.359
Occasions such as these 


04:03.358 --> 04:07.130
were not simply expressions of rejoicing 


04:07.130 --> 04:10.300
that originated with human emotion. 


04:10.300 --> 04:13.135
Recall that under inspiration, David said: 


04:13.135 --> 04:16.138
“Jehovah gives the command; 


04:16.138 --> 04:19.108
the women proclaiming 
the good news are a large army.” 


04:19.108 --> 04:22.645
Yes, and Jehovah valued 
their expressions of praise, 


04:22.645 --> 04:27.983
just as he valued the contributions 
of the men who had engaged in battle.


04:27.983 --> 04:30.520
What about today? 


04:30.520 --> 04:35.057
The report for the 2017 service year 


04:35.057 --> 04:38.962
shows that there were 
over 8.3 million publishers 


04:38.962 --> 04:42.665
proclaiming the good news 
throughout the earth. 


04:42.665 --> 04:45.668
Keep in mind that in most lands, 


04:45.668 --> 04:47.803
it is not unusual for our dear sisters 


04:47.803 --> 04:51.206
to make up over half 
of our special pioneers 


04:51.207 --> 04:56.812
and nearly three quarters of those 
who serve in the regular pioneer work. 


04:56.812 --> 04:59.215
In addition, many other sisters 


04:59.215 --> 05:02.218
are wholeheartedly spreading 
the good news of the Kingdom 


05:02.218 --> 05:06.588
to the best of their ability 
within their circumstances. 


05:06.588 --> 05:10.360
There are many single-parent families 
where our sisters 


05:10.360 --> 05:14.000
are providing materially 
and spiritually for their children. 


05:15.230 --> 05:17.367
Many of our faithful single sisters 


05:17.367 --> 05:20.035
are expending themselves 
in Jehovah’s service 


05:20.035 --> 05:23.538
in theocratic construction 
and maintenance work, 


05:23.538 --> 05:27.476
Bethel service, 
and serving where the need is greater


05:27.477 --> 05:31.847
—which includes 
serving in foreign-language fields. 


05:31.847 --> 05:35.685
Faithful wives 
loyally support their husbands 


05:35.685 --> 05:39.488
as well as fulfill their own roles 
as preachers and teachers. 


05:39.488 --> 05:42.758
Yes, how Jehovah must be pleased 


05:42.758 --> 05:46.195
to see all of you 
who serve in various ways! 


05:46.195 --> 05:48.197
And we’re grateful 


05:48.197 --> 05:51.367
for the warm spirit and positive influence 


05:51.367 --> 05:54.000
our dear sisters have on our congregations.


05:55.137 --> 05:57.140
Clearly, 


05:57.140 --> 06:02.945
Jehovah values 
this “large army” of sisters. 


06:02.945 --> 06:05.882
But does he take note 
of the individual circumstances 


06:05.882 --> 06:09.052
and sacrifices of each sister? 


06:09.052 --> 06:11.554
We do not have to wonder. 


06:11.553 --> 06:13.790
By means of his Word, 


06:13.790 --> 06:16.358
Jehovah makes it evident that he sees 


06:16.358 --> 06:19.895
and appreciates each of his servants.


06:19.895 --> 06:21.930
For example, 


06:21.930 --> 06:26.402
did you notice when we read 
the scripture in Exodus chapter 15 


06:26.402 --> 06:30.000
that Miriam was described 
as a “prophetess”? 


06:31.040 --> 06:33.242
Evidently, 
she was privileged to be used 


06:33.242 --> 06:36.045
as an instrument 
of divine communication. 


06:36.045 --> 06:38.748
In some instances, 


06:38.748 --> 06:43.418
this no doubt included singing songs 
that were inspired by Jehovah. 


06:43.418 --> 06:48.256
Miriam was not the only one 
in the Scriptures with this designation. 


06:48.257 --> 06:50.527
Other women in the Bible record, 


06:50.527 --> 06:53.864
such as Anna and Isaiah’s wife, 


06:53.863 --> 06:57.666
were also spoken of as prophetesses.


06:57.667 --> 07:00.035
In the book of Judges, 


07:00.035 --> 07:05.073
another faithful servant, 
Deborah, is identified. 


07:05.073 --> 07:11.000
Let’s read Judges 4:4, 5: 


07:12.682 --> 07:14.850
“Now Deborah, a prophetess, 


07:14.850 --> 07:16.852
“the wife of Lappidoth, 


07:16.852 --> 07:19.222
“was judging Israel at that time. 


07:19.222 --> 07:21.924
“She used to sit under Deborah’s palm tree 


07:21.923 --> 07:23.926
“between Ramah and Bethel 


07:23.927 --> 07:26.062
“in the mountainous region of Ephraim; 


07:26.062 --> 07:28.764
the Israelites 
would go up to her for judgment.” 


07:28.763 --> 07:31.066
Evidently, 


07:31.067 --> 07:34.770
Deborah was assigned to settle 
disputes that arose among Israelites 


07:34.770 --> 07:38.000
by giving Jehovah’s answer 
to problems that came up.


07:39.442 --> 07:42.379
Much later in Israel’s history, 


07:42.378 --> 07:45.146
during the reign of faithful King Josiah, 


07:45.147 --> 07:48.819
Huldah served as a prophetess. 


07:48.818 --> 07:53.823
At 2 Kings 22:8, 


07:53.823 --> 07:57.326
we read that while the temple 
was being repaired, 


07:57.327 --> 08:00.597
the original book of the Law was found. 


08:00.597 --> 08:02.599
When it was read to Josiah, 


08:02.598 --> 08:05.868
he was distraught at seeing how far off 


08:05.868 --> 08:09.038
the nation had strayed from Jehovah’s Law. 


08:09.038 --> 08:11.306
In verse 13, 


08:11.307 --> 08:14.577
he directed the priest, the secretary, 


08:14.577 --> 08:17.814
and other influential men: 


08:17.813 --> 08:22.285
“Go, inquire of Jehovah in my behalf, 


08:22.285 --> 08:24.853
“in behalf of the people, 


08:24.853 --> 08:28.590
“and in behalf of all Judah 
concerning the words of this book 


08:28.590 --> 08:31.393
that has been found.” 


08:31.393 --> 08:33.795
How did they accomplish this? 


08:33.795 --> 08:36.698
Verse 14 continues: 


08:36.698 --> 08:38.901
“So Hilkiah the priest, 


08:38.902 --> 08:43.539
“Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah 


08:43.538 --> 08:46.000
went to Huldah the prophetess.” 


08:47.210 --> 08:50.212
It’s interesting that Jehovah 
used this faithful woman 


08:50.212 --> 08:52.215
to convey his direction 


08:52.215 --> 08:54.583
and that prominent men and priests 


08:54.583 --> 08:57.000
sought her divinely inspired advice.


08:58.955 --> 09:01.557
The Christian Greek Scriptures, however, 


09:01.557 --> 09:04.294
do not permit sisters 
to serve in such a capacity 


09:04.293 --> 09:06.961
as did Deborah 
and other prophetesses 


09:06.962 --> 09:08.965
in the nation of Israel. 


09:08.965 --> 09:10.967
However, 


09:10.967 --> 09:15.537
Titus 2:3, 4 


09:15.537 --> 09:20.542
encourages “older women” 
to display spiritual qualities, 


09:20.542 --> 09:22.912
“so that they may advise 
the younger women” 


09:22.912 --> 09:24.914
in spiritual matters. 


09:24.913 --> 09:28.050
Let’s read those verses: 


09:28.050 --> 09:32.455
“Likewise, let the older women 
be reverent in behavior, 


09:32.455 --> 09:36.592
“not slanderous, 
not enslaved to a lot of wine, 


09:36.592 --> 09:38.894
“teachers of what is good, 


09:38.893 --> 09:41.363
“so that they may advise 
the younger women 


09:41.363 --> 09:45.066
to love their husbands,
to love their children.”


09:45.067 --> 09:49.539
How we appreciate 
the spiritually mature sisters among us 


09:49.538 --> 09:53.208
who provide 
such fine assistance to younger sisters 


09:53.208 --> 09:56.845
or those who are newer in the truth!


09:56.845 --> 10:01.783
However, today Jehovah 
has delegated authority to men. 


10:01.783 --> 10:06.121
They Scripturally qualify 
to serve as elders and ministerial servants 


10:06.122 --> 10:10.994
in order to serve, guide, 
and protect his people. 


10:10.993 --> 10:14.730
It is obvious that this is not due 
to a lack of respect 


10:14.730 --> 10:17.265
for the gifts of our sisters 
in the congregation. 


10:17.265 --> 10:20.903
In fact, 
many responsible brothers will acknowledge 


10:20.903 --> 10:23.505
that they have benefited 
from the experience 


10:23.505 --> 10:28.000
and practical wisdom 
of our humble, spiritually mature sisters.


10:29.212 --> 10:31.214
Finally, 


10:31.213 --> 10:33.448
think of the outstanding faith 


10:33.448 --> 10:37.000
of another woman 
mentioned in the Bible, Mary. 


10:38.220 --> 10:43.092
What an awesome responsibility 
Jehovah entrusted her with


10:43.092 --> 10:48.097
—bearing and raising 
his own Son as a human! 


10:48.097 --> 10:52.335
We can only imagine the thoughts 
that were going through her mind 


10:52.335 --> 10:55.370
when she was told of this assignment. 


10:55.370 --> 11:00.375
But the account in Luke chapter 1 


11:00.375 --> 11:04.480
tells us much about her spirituality. 


11:04.480 --> 11:07.917
In verse 38, 


11:07.917 --> 11:12.689
after the angel Gabriel 
finished speaking with her, 


11:12.688 --> 11:16.391
Mary’s response was simply: 


11:16.392 --> 11:19.895
“Look! Jehovah’s slave girl! 


11:19.895 --> 11:23.732
May it happen to me 
according to your declaration.” 


11:23.732 --> 11:28.037
She must have wondered 
how Jehovah would accomplish these things, 


11:28.037 --> 11:31.307
but she was humble and obedient. 


11:31.307 --> 11:35.010
Faithful men such as Moses 
and Jeremiah hesitated 


11:35.010 --> 11:37.178
when given 
a challenging assignment from God. 


11:37.178 --> 11:39.181
Not Mary! 


11:39.182 --> 11:41.917
What a beautiful example 
she set for all of us


11:41.917 --> 11:44.820
—men and women!


11:44.820 --> 11:49.825
Clearly, 
Jehovah has always highly valued women. 


11:49.825 --> 11:52.093
And we are privileged to serve today 


11:52.093 --> 11:55.530
with millions of hardworking sisters. 


11:55.530 --> 11:58.533
How pleased Jehovah must be 


11:58.533 --> 12:03.305
to see dear sisters 
serving him humbly and faithfully! 


12:03.305 --> 12:05.307
We urge you sisters, 


12:05.307 --> 12:08.144
please keep up your good work 


12:08.143 --> 12:12.681
and continue to be 
a positive influence in the congregation. 


12:12.682 --> 12:15.852
God has indeed granted 
you faithful women 


12:15.852 --> 12:19.989
the privilege of participating 
in the fulfillment of the psalmist’s words: 


12:19.988 --> 12:22.491
“Jehovah gives the command; 


12:22.492 --> 12:31.952
the women proclaiming 
the good news are a large army.”
