00:01.283 --> 00:05.888
Welcome to another edition 
of JW Broadcasting! 


00:05.888 --> 00:08.391
Have you ever felt discouraged 


00:08.392 --> 00:12.062
due to circumstances beyond your control? 


00:12.062 --> 00:17.000
We’ll discuss how we can still have joy 
despite our limitations. 


00:17.000 --> 00:21.003
And we’ll see examples, 
both Biblical and modern day, 


00:21.003 --> 00:25.641
that will encourage us 
to keep giving Jehovah our best.


00:25.642 --> 00:28.479
Jonah had faced several reasons 


00:28.478 --> 00:30.913
to become discouraged and give up. 


00:30.913 --> 00:35.685
How did Jehovah help him carry on 
with courage and faith? 


00:35.685 --> 00:38.353
And what lessons from his experience 


00:38.353 --> 00:41.958
can we apply to problems we face today?


00:41.958 --> 00:45.661
Can we change 
our personality for the better? 


00:45.662 --> 00:48.899
We can with Jehovah’s spirit 
and diligent effort. 


00:48.898 --> 00:50.800
This brother describes 


00:50.800 --> 00:54.370
how far his personality and lifestyle 


00:54.370 --> 00:55.972
took him away from Jehovah. 


00:55.972 --> 01:00.477
He explains how he regained 
a clean conscience 


01:00.477 --> 01:02.945
and freeness of speech.


01:02.945 --> 01:06.817
Jehovah can turn tragic events 
caused by man 


01:06.817 --> 01:09.885
into open doors of activity 
for His loyal Witnesses. 


01:09.885 --> 01:12.788
In this report from Greece, 


01:12.788 --> 01:16.291
we’ll learn how our brothers 
are bringing spiritual comfort 


01:16.292 --> 01:18.529
to refugees. 


01:18.528 --> 01:22.931
You’re watching the June 2017 edition 


01:22.932 --> 01:25.000
of JW Broadcasting!


01:44.920 --> 01:47.890
There are many exciting things happening


01:47.890 --> 01:49.958
in Jehovah’s organization.


01:49.958 --> 01:52.495
Why, month after month, we read articles,


01:52.495 --> 01:55.932
watch videos, and hear personal experiences


01:55.932 --> 01:59.569
about our brothers and sisters 
who are doing more for Jehovah. 


01:59.568 --> 02:02.971
They are serving where 
the need is greater or reaching out 


02:02.972 --> 02:05.575
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers. 


02:05.575 --> 02:08.878
They are working 
on construction, renovation, 


02:08.878 --> 02:12.948
maintenance of Kingdom Halls, 
or other theocratic projects. 


02:12.948 --> 02:16.185
No doubt, 
many of you watching this program 


02:16.185 --> 02:18.387
are excitedly looking forward 


02:18.387 --> 02:21.590
to expanding your ministry 
in one of these areas. 


02:21.590 --> 02:24.493
We encourage you to do so. 


02:24.493 --> 02:28.363
You can be assured 
that you will receive much fulfillment 


02:28.363 --> 02:31.633
and many blessings from Jehovah.


02:31.633 --> 02:33.636
On the other hand,  


02:33.637 --> 02:36.072
there are others 
who are watching this program


02:36.072 --> 02:39.642
who may feel discouraged 
because their circumstances 


02:39.642 --> 02:44.280
may seem to limit 
their being as involved as they would like. 


02:44.280 --> 02:46.883
What are some of these circumstances? 


02:46.883 --> 02:49.885
These may include our age, our health, 


02:49.885 --> 02:54.290
our economic situation, 
or our physical limitations. 


02:54.290 --> 02:57.893
For some of us, 
perhaps our upbringing 


02:57.893 --> 03:00.930
or past errors 
we have made in our life 


03:00.930 --> 03:04.200
may cause us to feel 
that we are limited 


03:04.200 --> 03:07.103
as to what we can do 
for Jehovah. 


03:07.103 --> 03:10.473
As we know well, 
focusing on our limitations 


03:10.473 --> 03:13.408
can affect our joy, 
causing discouragement. 


03:13.408 --> 03:15.578
What can we do?


03:15.578 --> 03:19.881
There are many examples 
in the Scriptures of men and women 


03:19.882 --> 03:22.719
who had circumstances 
beyond their control 


03:22.718 --> 03:26.555
that seemed to limit how much 
they could do for Jehovah. 


03:26.555 --> 03:31.227
Others had to deal with the effects 
of their upbringing and family life 


03:31.227 --> 03:34.397
or with serious errors they made. 


03:34.397 --> 03:37.400
Did they allow themselves to be limited 


03:37.400 --> 03:40.437
by their circumstances or their past? 


03:40.437 --> 03:42.805
How did Jehovah feel about them? 


03:42.805 --> 03:46.075
How does Jehovah feel about us? 


03:46.075 --> 03:50.212
That is what we are going to discuss 
in this month’s broadcast, 


03:50.212 --> 03:51.614
which has the theme 


03:51.613 --> 03:55.618
“Are You Defined by Your Circumstances?” 


03:55.618 --> 03:57.786
Let’s start by looking at some 


03:57.787 --> 04:01.390
who could have let 
their circumstances limit them.


04:01.390 --> 04:06.128
Consider first the example 
of Joseph in the book of Genesis. 


04:06.128 --> 04:08.965
Now, Joseph faced injustice at its worst. 


04:08.965 --> 04:12.135
His situation was especially hurtful 


04:12.135 --> 04:15.872
since it was initially brought on by those 
who should have been closest to him


04:15.872 --> 04:17.874
—his family! 


04:17.873 --> 04:20.976
As a slave in Egypt 
and later as a prisoner, 


04:20.977 --> 04:24.514
Joseph was indeed limited 
in what he could do. 


04:24.513 --> 04:27.850
How might Joseph have reacted? 


04:27.850 --> 04:30.853
Well, 
Joseph could have become so preoccupied 


04:30.853 --> 04:32.988
with what he could not do 


04:32.988 --> 04:35.991
that he lost sight of what he could do.


04:35.992 --> 04:39.095
Did Joseph let his circumstances 


04:39.095 --> 04:41.297
paralyze his life? 


04:41.297 --> 04:42.899
No! 


04:42.898 --> 04:45.735
He chose to make 
the best of his situation. 


04:45.735 --> 04:47.803
In fact, 
note what Joseph did 


04:47.803 --> 04:50.306
while serving as a slave 
in Potiphar’s house 


04:50.307 --> 04:55.077
if we turn together 
to Genesis 39:4: 


04:55.077 --> 04:58.580
“Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes, 


04:58.580 --> 05:01.417
“and he became his personal attendant. 


05:01.417 --> 05:03.854
“So he appointed him over his house, 


05:03.853 --> 05:07.390
and he put him 
in charge of all that was his.” 


05:07.390 --> 05:09.992
Joseph worked diligently 


05:09.992 --> 05:13.162
within the limitations 
of his circumstances. 


05:13.162 --> 05:15.432
He took a similar approach while in prison. 


05:15.432 --> 05:18.500
Joseph focused on what he could do 


05:18.500 --> 05:22.305
despite suffering the effects of injustice.


05:22.305 --> 05:25.642
As a second example, 
consider Hezekiah. 


05:25.642 --> 05:28.679
Hezekiah is one 
who might easily have felt 


05:28.678 --> 05:31.913
that he was defined by his upbringing. 


05:31.913 --> 05:36.651
Look at the terrible example 
that was set by his father, Ahaz, 


05:36.652 --> 05:40.724
as recorded in 2 Kings chapter 16. 


05:40.723 --> 05:43.358
Second Kings chapter 16, 


05:43.358 --> 05:47.430
and notice what verse 3 says about Ahaz: 


05:47.430 --> 05:52.000
“Instead, he walked in the way 
of the kings of Israel, 


05:52.000 --> 05:56.172
“and he even made his own son 
pass through the fire, 


05:56.172 --> 05:59.609
“following the detestable practices 
of the nations 


05:59.608 --> 06:03.545
that Jehovah had driven out 
from before the Israelites.” 


06:03.545 --> 06:07.417
Hezekiah’s father did detestable things 


06:07.417 --> 06:09.552
in opposition to Jehovah. 


06:09.552 --> 06:11.554
But Hezekiah showed 


06:11.553 --> 06:13.655
that he was not the helpless victim 


06:13.655 --> 06:15.692
of a poor parental example. 


06:15.692 --> 06:17.694
What did he do? 


06:17.693 --> 06:21.563
Well, turn in your Bibles 
to 2 Kings chapter 18 


06:21.563 --> 06:23.766
and notice verse 3, 


06:23.767 --> 06:26.002
what it says about Hezekiah: 


06:26.002 --> 06:30.139
“He kept doing what was right
in Jehovah’s eyes,


06:30.138 --> 06:33.943
just as David his forefather
had done.”


06:33.943 --> 06:36.645
Verse 5 says of Hezekiah: 


06:36.645 --> 06:40.717
“There was no one like him 
among all the kings of Judah.” 


06:40.717 --> 06:43.019
He became fully involved in true worship. 


06:43.018 --> 06:45.888
Verses 6 and 7 say that Hezekiah 


06:45.888 --> 06:50.000
‘held fast to Jehovah, 
and Jehovah proved to be with him.’


06:51.727 --> 06:56.132
How encouraging 
Hezekiah’s example is for us! 


06:56.132 --> 06:58.567
We can choose to be loyal to Jehovah 


06:58.567 --> 07:00.804
and do much in our worship of Jehovah, 


07:00.803 --> 07:03.538
even if we did not grow up in a family 


07:03.538 --> 07:05.541
that served Jehovah fully. 


07:05.542 --> 07:09.679
We are not helpless victims 
of our environment. 


07:09.678 --> 07:13.950
Hezekiah’s example 
reassures us that our past 


07:13.950 --> 07:17.120
does not have to control our future.


07:17.120 --> 07:21.257
As a third example, 
consider the apostle Paul. 


07:21.257 --> 07:23.725
He did not let his own past mistakes 


07:23.725 --> 07:27.163
involving religious prejudice and violence 


07:27.163 --> 07:30.131
stop him from giving his all to Jehovah. 


07:30.132 --> 07:33.804
How did Paul feel about his past? 


07:33.803 --> 07:39.441
Well, let’s read together 
at 1 Corinthians 15:9: 


07:39.442 --> 07:43.245
“For I am the least of the apostles, 


07:43.245 --> 07:46.448
“and I am not worthy 
of being called an apostle, 


07:46.448 --> 07:50.486
because I persecuted 
the congregation of God.” 


07:50.487 --> 07:53.455
“I am the least of the apostles.” 


07:53.455 --> 07:57.660
Later, when writing to the Ephesians 
as recorded at Ephesians 3:8, 


07:57.660 --> 08:01.863
he calls himself 
“less than the least of all holy ones.” 


08:01.863 --> 08:05.433
Finally, at 1 Timothy 1:15, 


08:05.433 --> 08:09.438
he now calls himself 
the “foremost” of all sinners. 


08:09.438 --> 08:13.041
Yes, 
Paul’s prior treatment of the congregation 


08:13.042 --> 08:15.310
weighed heavily upon him.


08:15.310 --> 08:19.082
Could Paul have reasoned 
that he was damaged? 


08:19.082 --> 08:21.350
Could he have reasoned that his past 


08:21.350 --> 08:23.920
limited what he could do for Jehovah? 


08:23.920 --> 08:27.257
He could have, 
but Paul did not do that. 


08:27.257 --> 08:30.125
He poured himself out 
for the congregation. 


08:30.125 --> 08:33.295
Why, Paul was privileged to write 
more books and letters 


08:33.295 --> 08:35.832
in the Christian Greek Scriptures 
than anyone else. 


08:35.832 --> 08:39.435
He demonstrated 
an outstanding zeal for the ministry. 


08:39.435 --> 08:42.938
Paul did not let his conduct in the past 


08:42.938 --> 08:46.808
dictate what he could do for Jehovah.


08:46.808 --> 08:49.345
And there are many other examples as well. 


08:49.345 --> 08:53.917
For example, 
are we in a difficult economic situation? 


08:53.917 --> 08:56.552
The account in 2 Corinthians chapter 8


08:56.552 --> 08:58.720
tells us about the Macedonians.


08:58.720 --> 09:02.090
Paul says that they were in deep poverty. 


09:02.090 --> 09:05.027
Yet they begged to have a financial share


09:05.027 --> 09:07.062
in the relief work.


09:07.062 --> 09:09.399
Are we older in years? 


09:09.398 --> 09:11.400
We may think of Anna. 


09:11.400 --> 09:14.803
The account at Luke 2:36-38


09:14.803 --> 09:17.740
tells us that she was 84 years old 


09:17.740 --> 09:19.742
and that her husband had died


09:19.742 --> 09:22.177
after just seven years of marriage.


09:22.177 --> 09:24.547
Yet, 
“she was never missing from the temple.” 


09:24.547 --> 09:28.750
She rendered
‘sacred service day and night.’


09:28.750 --> 09:32.000
What lessons do we learn 
from these accounts? 


09:33.288 --> 09:37.191
Our dear brothers and sisters
in Bible times were just like us.


09:37.192 --> 09:41.097
Many were in circumstances
that they would not have chosen.


09:41.097 --> 09:44.367
Yet,
they did not let their circumstances


09:44.367 --> 09:47.370
or their past define them. 


09:47.370 --> 09:50.205
They joyfully did what they could 


09:50.205 --> 09:52.908
within the limits of their situation. 


09:52.908 --> 09:55.310
And these are just a few examples. 


09:55.310 --> 09:57.480
There are many others in the Bible. 


09:57.480 --> 10:00.983
Why not make it a personal study project 


10:00.983 --> 10:02.985
to research faithful ones 


10:02.985 --> 10:06.055
who were in circumstances 
similar to yours? 


10:06.055 --> 10:09.558
How did they stay involved 
in Jehovah’s work? 


10:09.558 --> 10:14.030
We are sure 
that you will be greatly encouraged.


10:14.030 --> 10:16.598
In fact, 
let’s look at an example 


10:16.598 --> 10:20.368
of how you might do this 
with a familiar Bible character. 


10:20.368 --> 10:22.538
In this dramatization, 


10:22.538 --> 10:26.741
a brother and two sisters 
use their personal study time 


10:26.742 --> 10:29.045
to learn about Jonah. 


10:29.045 --> 10:31.847
Sometimes, as we know, 
Jonah was discouraged 


10:31.847 --> 10:34.417
by events beyond his control; 


10:34.417 --> 10:38.887
at other times it was 
because of his own failings. 


10:38.887 --> 10:41.390
Does Jonah’s experience relate 


10:41.390 --> 10:43.125
to what they are feeling? 


10:43.125 --> 10:46.295
And how do the lessons 
Jonah learned help them 


10:46.295 --> 10:50.000
to not remain trapped 
in their circumstances?


10:56.172 --> 10:59.542
But John, there’s still plenty 


10:59.542 --> 11:01.544
you can do 
in the congregation. 


11:01.543 --> 11:04.580
Sure, that sounds good. 


11:04.580 --> 11:07.717
But I’m no longer 
a ministerial servant. 


11:07.717 --> 11:12.254
Why did I let my zeal 
for the ministry cool off? 


11:12.253 --> 11:15.000
I know what the brothers 
must think of me now.


11:18.260 --> 11:20.697
Hello?


11:20.697 --> 11:22.365
Oh, good morning. 
My name is Jane. 


11:22.365 --> 11:23.365
How are you?


11:23.365 --> 11:24.733
Not bad, thanks.


11:24.733 --> 11:27.301
I know you may not be interested, 


11:27.302 --> 11:29.539
but I have this tract 
I’d like to leave with you . . .


11:29.538 --> 11:31.273
“You may not be interested?” 


11:31.273 --> 11:33.000
Where did that come from? 


11:35.077 --> 11:37.780
Not my best presentation, 


11:37.780 --> 11:42.000
but it didn’t seem like she wanted 
to talk more anyway.


11:43.118 --> 11:46.721
Well, what does that mean?


11:46.722 --> 11:48.057
It may be manageable, 


11:48.057 --> 11:50.559
but long term, 
given your other conditions, 


11:50.558 --> 11:51.560
you’re looking at possibly 
some further tests . . .


11:51.560 --> 11:52.995
Manageable? 


11:52.995 --> 11:54.997
Long term? 


11:54.997 --> 11:58.000
Oh, Jehovah, 
how can I do this by myself?


12:17.787 --> 12:20.689
Of course Jehovah values you. 


12:20.688 --> 12:23.325
Try to think of someone in the Bible 


12:23.325 --> 12:27.028
who may have felt like you do, 
like Jonah.


12:27.028 --> 12:29.030
Jonah? 


12:29.030 --> 12:33.000
Felt like I do?


12:40.375 --> 12:44.113
“What comes to your mind
when you think of Jonah?


12:44.113 --> 12:49.000
Do you think of him 
as a disobedient prophet?”


12:59.462 --> 13:02.297
“Reluctant to obey Jehovah’s command, 


13:02.297 --> 13:05.835
“Jonah boarded a ship that carried him 


13:05.835 --> 13:09.000
farther and farther away 
from his assignment.”


13:20.348 --> 13:22.416
“Did Jonah’s recent actions 


13:22.417 --> 13:26.422
“disqualify him 
from ever again serving God 


13:26.422 --> 13:29.000
in an official capacity?” 


13:32.393 --> 13:35.030
He sure could have thought so. 


13:35.030 --> 13:38.000
I know I do.


13:39.535 --> 13:40.937
“No, 


13:40.937 --> 13:43.672
“Jehovah mercifully and lovingly 


13:43.672 --> 13:46.000
renewed the prophet’s commission.”


14:02.190 --> 14:05.928
So if Jehovah didn’t see Jonah 
as a total failure, 


14:05.928 --> 14:09.000
then what must he think of me? 


14:12.267 --> 14:15.704
First Samuel 16:7: 


14:15.703 --> 14:18.406
“For the way man sees 


14:18.407 --> 14:21.000
is not the way God sees.”


14:22.210 --> 14:27.000
“Jonah did not see Nineveh 
as Jehovah did.”


14:50.472 --> 14:52.240
Well,


14:52.240 --> 14:53.642
with all that they were doing, 


14:53.642 --> 14:55.000
how could he view them any differently? 


14:57.412 --> 14:59.014
But the account says: 


14:59.013 --> 15:02.250
‘When God saw they had turned back 
from their evil ways, 


15:02.250 --> 15:04.487
‘he reconsidered the calamity, 


15:04.487 --> 15:07.000
and he did not bring it.’ 


15:08.123 --> 15:10.691
“Despite the people’s badness, 


15:10.692 --> 15:13.029
“Jehovah cared about them. 


15:13.028 --> 15:15.463
“He values human life 


15:15.463 --> 15:18.266
“and the potential 
that each individual has 


15:18.267 --> 15:22.000
for repenting and learning 
to do what is right.”


15:23.172 --> 15:26.009
Well, of course that’s true. 


15:26.008 --> 15:29.000
Why didn’t Jonah see that? 


15:30.845 --> 15:34.000
But am I seeing people
the way Jehovah does?


15:36.052 --> 15:38.287
Am I assuming they won’t listen 


15:38.287 --> 15:40.000
and then not giving my best? 


15:42.057 --> 15:45.000
How can I know 
how a person will respond? 


15:47.697 --> 15:51.134
‘Jonah learned to be merciful. 


15:51.133 --> 15:54.000
Will we?’


15:57.907 --> 16:00.909
Matthew 5:7 says: 


16:00.908 --> 16:03.245
“Happy are the merciful, 


16:03.245 --> 16:07.000
since they will be shown mercy.”


16:09.518 --> 16:12.688
“Then Jonah prayed to Jehovah his God 


16:12.688 --> 16:15.000
“from the belly of the fish, and he said: 


16:16.892 --> 16:18.927
“‘Out of my distress 


16:18.927 --> 16:20.997
“‘I called out to Jehovah, 


16:20.997 --> 16:23.199
“‘and he answered me. 


16:23.198 --> 16:27.335
“‘Out of the depths of the Grave 
I cried for help. 


16:27.335 --> 16:31.000
You heard my voice.’”


16:33.242 --> 16:37.847
God heard Jonah and delivered him. 


16:37.847 --> 16:40.000
But I can’t expect a miracle.


16:45.220 --> 16:49.000
“Then my prayer came in to you, 
into your holy temple.” 


16:50.958 --> 16:53.295
“My prayer.”


16:53.295 --> 16:56.000
“My prayer came in to you.” 


16:57.098 --> 16:59.100
Jonah didn’t know 


16:59.100 --> 17:01.137
if Jehovah would rescue him, 


17:01.137 --> 17:04.000
but he prayed in faith 
that Jehovah cared.


17:05.740 --> 17:07.743
“But as for me, 


17:07.743 --> 17:09.778
“with the voice of thanksgiving 


17:09.778 --> 17:12.613
“I will sacrifice to you. 


17:12.613 --> 17:15.916
“What I have vowed, I will pay. 


17:15.917 --> 17:19.000
Salvation is from Jehovah.”


17:25.960 --> 17:28.930
As long as I still can, 


17:28.930 --> 17:31.000
I’ll keep sacrificing to God. 


17:35.770 --> 17:39.000
Salvation is from Jehovah!


17:44.078 --> 17:46.081
Like those in our video, 


17:46.082 --> 17:49.384
do you sometimes feel as Jonah did? 


17:49.383 --> 17:53.021
Can you apply the lessons 
from Jonah’s account 


17:53.022 --> 17:56.559
to better see God’s mercy 
in your life? 


17:56.558 --> 17:59.828
A personal failing 
discouraged our brother. 


17:59.828 --> 18:01.830
But like Jonah, 


18:01.830 --> 18:05.167
he realized Jehovah still valued him. 


18:05.167 --> 18:09.270
Our young sister 
reinvigorated her ministry 


18:09.270 --> 18:11.740
after meditating on the way Jehovah 


18:11.740 --> 18:14.543
mercifully viewed the Ninevites. 


18:14.543 --> 18:19.046
And our sister was determined 
to imitate Jonah’s faith 


18:19.047 --> 18:21.350
that God hears our prayers 


18:21.350 --> 18:25.353
about circumstances beyond our control.


18:25.353 --> 18:27.488
Sometimes, however, 


18:27.488 --> 18:31.360
our circumstances 
are only perceived barriers


18:31.360 --> 18:33.362
to doing more for Jehovah.


18:33.362 --> 18:36.932
For example, some may feel limited 
by economic concerns


18:36.932 --> 18:40.102
if they reach out for special privileges. 


18:40.102 --> 18:43.539
In the Netherlands, 
many brothers and sisters 


18:43.538 --> 18:47.541
assisted with the construction 
of the Swifterbant Assembly Hall. 


18:47.542 --> 18:51.714
Some had to make adjustments 
to be able to work on this project. 


18:51.713 --> 18:56.618
Listen, however, to their comments 
on the blessings they received  


18:56.618 --> 19:01.000
and what their goals are 
now that the project is completed.


19:04.560 --> 19:07.195
In the Netherlands, 
there was a need for a new, 


19:07.195 --> 19:10.198
suitable Assembly Hall, 
which could accommodate almost all 


19:10.198 --> 19:15.503
of the 300 congregations 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


19:15.503 --> 19:19.975
Additional building ground 
was acquired next to the existing hall, 


19:19.975 --> 19:22.000
so that a second, 
completely new hall could be constructed.


19:26.715 --> 19:29.000
More than 200 volunteers 
worked on this project. 


19:31.187 --> 19:34.055
What challenges did they face? 


19:34.055 --> 19:37.000
And what blessings did they receive?


19:41.095 --> 19:44.498
We had to sell our house 
and close our business.


19:44.498 --> 19:47.870
It’s a step into the unknown.


19:47.870 --> 19:49.000
I had to quit my job.


19:51.105 --> 19:53.108
It was exciting to step 


19:53.108 --> 19:54.876
out of my comfort zone 


19:54.877 --> 19:57.000
and rely completely on Jehovah.


19:58.380 --> 20:00.848
Everything is structured, organized. 


20:00.848 --> 20:01.000
That is why things run smoothly. 


20:02.183 --> 20:05.000
That doesn’t come naturally to me.


20:06.222 --> 20:08.890
We were invited to come 
and work in the kitchen. 


20:08.890 --> 20:10.892
I love to cook at home. 


20:10.892 --> 20:12.694
I’m really fond of it. 


20:12.693 --> 20:14.495
What was my assignment? 


20:14.495 --> 20:17.000
Doing the dishes.


20:25.940 --> 20:28.310
Working on yourself, 


20:28.310 --> 20:30.312
your Christian personality, 


20:30.312 --> 20:33.049
and cooperating 
with your brothers and sisters


20:33.048 --> 20:37.185
—that has everlasting value.


20:37.185 --> 20:39.888
It was wonderful training for the future 


20:39.888 --> 20:42.756
when we will be building together 
in Paradise.


20:42.757 --> 20:44.392
You realize that everyone 


20:44.392 --> 20:46.629
sacrifices something and becomes happier. 


20:46.628 --> 20:48.996
No one regrets their decision.


20:48.997 --> 20:52.034
That Jehovah takes into account 
your personal makeup, 


20:52.033 --> 20:54.970
that he is patient with us.


20:54.970 --> 20:57.772
I’ve really learned how to work together 


20:57.772 --> 21:00.000
in a theocratic arrangement 
and still have fun.


21:01.543 --> 21:04.278
You can work on yourself all day long 


21:04.278 --> 21:07.115
and therefore be able to improve.


21:07.115 --> 21:12.053
I really learned to study more 
and to read the Bible more often.


21:12.053 --> 21:15.356
Because we worked together so closely, 


21:15.357 --> 21:17.359
you got to know each other very well 


21:17.358 --> 21:20.000
and I really started 
to love and appreciate people.


21:23.832 --> 21:26.100
We really came to appreciate 


21:26.100 --> 21:31.000
that every brother and sister 
has this beautiful inner person.


21:35.677 --> 21:38.847
Visitors and contractors 
were always very surprised 


21:38.847 --> 21:42.000
that there were so many women 
working at the construction site.


21:43.352 --> 21:45.554
It’s great working with sisters. 


21:45.553 --> 21:47.255
I have a construction background, 


21:47.255 --> 21:49.257
and communication with men 
can be really up front. 


21:49.257 --> 21:51.394
That doesn’t work with sisters. 


21:51.393 --> 21:53.395
You just have to be calm, 


21:53.395 --> 21:57.000
talk, and listen.


22:05.673 --> 22:08.710
I had to work on a lift platform, 


22:08.710 --> 22:11.780
but that was kind of a problem 
because I’m afraid of heights. 


22:11.780 --> 22:15.183
The brothers were so kind 
to seal the sides up completely 


22:15.183 --> 22:18.386
so that I could not look down.


22:18.387 --> 22:21.189
It was fun working together 
on that lift platform. 


22:21.188 --> 22:23.391
We called it our little flat.


22:23.392 --> 22:28.000
The atmosphere was amazing, 
and we all had a great time.


22:34.502 --> 22:36.672
Now we work in the kitchen 


22:36.672 --> 22:40.309
at the Swifterbant School Facility
—a real privilege. 


22:40.308 --> 22:42.676
We’ve been trained 
to cook during construction, 


22:42.677 --> 22:45.000
but if needed,
I’ll even do the dishes as well.


22:48.183 --> 22:50.451
I’ll never work five days again. 


22:50.452 --> 22:52.054
Now I work three days, 


22:52.053 --> 22:54.021
and since July 1st, 
I started pioneering. 


22:54.022 --> 22:55.690
That’s just great.


22:55.690 --> 22:57.692
He was offered a job. 


22:57.692 --> 22:59.694
He could even choose between two jobs. 


22:59.693 --> 23:03.000
Now he works three days a week, 
which always seemed impossible.


23:04.298 --> 23:08.136
Eventually, we were 
in Swifterbant for one month only.


23:08.137 --> 23:11.239
Then we went to Mozambique 
for three months.


23:11.238 --> 23:13.275
Then for five months 
to Swifterbant again.


23:13.275 --> 23:16.000
Then three months in South Africa.


23:17.145 --> 23:22.000
Bethel called and assigned us 
to Congo (Kinshasa).


23:38.667 --> 23:42.037
All the volunteers who helped 
to make a success of this project— 


23:42.037 --> 23:44.039
Well, they had to give up a lot. 


23:44.038 --> 23:47.000
As a result, 
we can enjoy this beautiful hall.


23:49.377 --> 23:51.514
It’s amazing to be here. 


23:51.513 --> 23:53.448
It’s great to be encouraged 


23:53.448 --> 23:55.950
and to be strengthened for the ministry.


23:55.950 --> 23:58.420
If you think about it, 


23:58.420 --> 24:01.790
every day we have 
around 700 new brothers and sisters. 


24:01.790 --> 24:03.792
That means every three days 


24:03.792 --> 24:06.695
we could fill a hall like this 
with new brothers and sisters. 


24:06.695 --> 24:09.865
These kinds of halls 
are really needed worldwide 


24:09.865 --> 24:14.000
in order to provide education 
to all those additional brothers and sisters.


24:16.672 --> 24:19.474
It’s so faith-strengthening to be here. 


24:19.473 --> 24:21.910
Words cannot express it. 


24:21.910 --> 24:26.213
I feel so united, so warm, peaceful. 


24:26.213 --> 24:31.000
It’s so wonderful to be able 
to serve Jehovah together.


24:44.198 --> 24:48.203
Did you notice a common thread 
in the volunteers’ comments? 


24:48.203 --> 24:51.038
Any economic concerns they may have had 


24:51.038 --> 24:53.541
just faded into the background,
didn’t they?


24:53.542 --> 24:58.247
They reached out to help, 
and in turn Jehovah helped them. 


24:58.247 --> 25:02.084
In fact, the Assembly Hall project
was finished at a lower cost


25:02.083 --> 25:05.420
and a year earlier than originally planned.


25:05.420 --> 25:07.755
And did you note that after the project,


25:07.755 --> 25:10.758
some who previously felt
they couldn’t pioneer


25:10.758 --> 25:13.026
reduced their secular workdays 


25:13.027 --> 25:16.464
and are now doing 
what they thought was out of reach? 


25:16.463 --> 25:21.001
It brings us joy to see 
so many making adjustments 


25:21.002 --> 25:24.439
and reaching out to do more 
for the organization, 


25:24.438 --> 25:29.000
and in turn they experience 
something they’ll never forget.


25:30.378 --> 25:32.880
Now, 
we’ve considered examples of those 


25:32.880 --> 25:36.217
who did not let 
their circumstances hinder them 


25:36.217 --> 25:38.554
from giving their all to Jehovah. 


25:38.553 --> 25:41.021
But another question is: 


25:41.022 --> 25:44.859
How does Jehovah 
view his faithful servants 


25:44.858 --> 25:47.195
despite their limitations?


25:47.195 --> 25:50.698
Now, I’ve often thought 
about the example of John the Baptizer. 


25:50.698 --> 25:55.403
As we know, he was arrested 
shortly after Jesus started his ministry. 


25:55.403 --> 25:57.405
John could have felt 


25:57.405 --> 26:01.643
that he was no longer of use 
to Jehovah or the work. 


26:01.643 --> 26:05.546
Yet, as recorded at Matthew 11:11, 


26:05.547 --> 26:07.715
Jesus said about John: 


26:07.715 --> 26:09.985
“Among those born of women, 


26:09.985 --> 26:14.655
there has not been raised up 
anyone greater than John the Baptist.” 


26:14.655 --> 26:16.892
Jehovah’s and Jesus’ view of John 


26:16.892 --> 26:19.494
was not based 
on the man’s circumstances 


26:19.493 --> 26:21.630
of being in prison. 


26:21.630 --> 26:25.700
Their view of John was based on
who he was on the inside


26:25.700 --> 26:28.470
and on his relationship with Jehovah. 


26:28.470 --> 26:32.073
Jehovah did not focus on the limitations. 


26:32.073 --> 26:35.343
In Jehovah’s eyes, 
John was great. 


26:35.343 --> 26:39.146
He was still a faithful servant 
doing the best that he could, 


26:39.147 --> 26:42.417
and that was all that really mattered.


26:42.417 --> 26:45.254
Another example 
that may come to your mind 


26:45.253 --> 26:47.288
is that of King David. 


26:47.288 --> 26:51.291
As we know, 
King David committed serious sins. 


26:51.292 --> 26:53.795
Yet, 
David repented for his sins, 


26:53.795 --> 26:57.698
and there is no record
that he repeated them.


26:57.698 --> 27:00.568
How did Jehovah view him? 


27:00.568 --> 27:03.905
Did Jehovah see David as damaged, 


27:03.905 --> 27:07.908
as a man who would always be
limited in serving him?


27:07.908 --> 27:12.346
Notice Jehovah’s words 
directed to King Jeroboam 


27:12.347 --> 27:16.584
at 1 Kings 14:8:


27:16.583 --> 27:20.921
“But you have not become 
like my servant David, 


27:20.922 --> 27:22.924
“who kept my commandments 


27:22.923 --> 27:25.793
“and who walked after me 
with all his heart, 


27:25.793 --> 27:28.963
doing only what was right in my eyes.” 


27:28.963 --> 27:31.833
Jehovah viewed David 
as a special servant. 


27:31.833 --> 27:34.335
He says that he 
“kept my commandments.” 


27:34.335 --> 27:37.238
He did 
“what was right in my eyes.” 


27:37.238 --> 27:40.675
That’s what Jehovah remembered.


27:40.675 --> 27:43.243
How encouraging that is for us! 


27:43.243 --> 27:45.846
If we have repented 
of our past mistakes 


27:45.847 --> 27:49.384
and set matters straight 
to the best of our circumstances, 


27:49.383 --> 27:54.421
we too can be assured 
that Jehovah loves us dearly. 


27:54.422 --> 27:59.000
He appreciates whatever we can do 
in our worship of him. 


28:00.128 --> 28:02.130
So, what’s the point? 


28:02.130 --> 28:06.200
Well, our past 
or our present circumstances 


28:06.200 --> 28:10.205
do not define our value before Jehovah. 


28:10.205 --> 28:13.442
Our Father loves us for who we are, 


28:13.442 --> 28:15.444
and he values our efforts 


28:15.443 --> 28:18.946
as we do the best 
that we can to serve him.


28:18.947 --> 28:22.017
Why do you think it is important 


28:22.017 --> 28:25.787
that we strive to see ourselves 
as Jehovah does? 


28:25.787 --> 28:30.659
Because we can weaken, 
discourage, or limit ourselves 


28:30.658 --> 28:35.663
if we see ourselves only 
in the framework of our circumstances. 


28:35.663 --> 28:39.666
May we work hard not to do that. 


28:39.667 --> 28:42.070
What does Jehovah see 


28:42.070 --> 28:45.807
when he looks 
at his faithful servants today? 


28:45.807 --> 28:50.812
Well, turn, please, 
to 1 Samuel 16:7. 


28:50.812 --> 28:53.380
And the setting is 
that Samuel was about to go 


28:53.380 --> 28:55.383
to anoint the next king of Israel; 


28:55.383 --> 28:58.820
and he goes to the house of Jesse; 
and Jesse lines up all of his sons, 


28:58.820 --> 29:01.322
except for David,
who is still out in the field; 


29:01.322 --> 29:05.059
and Samuel walks in 
and he sees Eliab. 


29:05.058 --> 29:07.561
And based on what he sees, 


29:07.562 --> 29:10.299
Samuel concludes that this surely must be 


29:10.298 --> 29:12.366
the next king of Israel. 


29:12.367 --> 29:15.069
Yet, note what Jehovah saw. 


29:15.068 --> 29:20.073
Please read with me 1 Samuel 16:7: 


29:20.073 --> 29:23.076
“But Jehovah said to Samuel: 


29:23.077 --> 29:27.615
“‘Do not pay attention 
to his appearance and how tall he is, 


29:27.615 --> 29:29.917
“‘for I have rejected him. 


29:29.917 --> 29:34.655
“‘For the way man sees
is not the way God sees,


29:34.655 --> 29:38.192
“‘because mere man sees
what appears to the eyes,


29:38.192 --> 29:41.462
but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”


29:41.462 --> 29:44.599
That’s the way Jehovah sees. 


29:44.598 --> 29:47.601
He does not look 
at our outward appearance and our abilities; 


29:47.602 --> 29:49.470
he sees into our hearts. 


29:49.470 --> 29:50.972
He sees what we would be doing 


29:50.972 --> 29:53.709
if all of the limitations 
were lifted off of us. 


29:53.708 --> 29:56.210
Why, just the fact 
that we keep going, 


29:56.210 --> 29:59.513
that we keep putting 
one foot in front of the other, 


29:59.513 --> 30:02.683
endears us to Jehovah. 


30:02.683 --> 30:05.520
We understand the truth 
of that statement, 


30:05.520 --> 30:07.522
and we all may agree 


30:07.522 --> 30:10.525
that this is how 
Jehovah views his people. 


30:10.525 --> 30:15.230
However, we may have 
a hard time convincing ourselves 


30:15.230 --> 30:18.633
if this really applies to me. 


30:18.633 --> 30:22.736
Have you ever wondered: 
‘Does Jehovah really see me? 


30:22.737 --> 30:24.839
‘Does he see what’s in my heart 


30:24.838 --> 30:28.408
and value my desire to do more for him?’ 


30:28.408 --> 30:30.411
The answer is yes. 


30:30.412 --> 30:35.284
In fact, Jehovah has already seen 
what is in your heart.


30:35.283 --> 30:37.618
Think about this: 


30:37.618 --> 30:40.821
Why are you watching this program? 


30:40.822 --> 30:43.659
Why do you care about spiritual things? 


30:43.658 --> 30:46.593
Why are you, perhaps, 
the only one in your family 


30:46.593 --> 30:49.530
who is a dedicated, 
baptized servant of Jehovah? 


30:49.530 --> 30:53.100
Or why are you, perhaps, 
the only one at your place of employment 


30:53.100 --> 30:57.105
or the only one near where you live 
who’s serving Jehovah? 


30:57.105 --> 30:59.707
Is it because you are 
so much more studious 


30:59.707 --> 31:02.010
or smarter than everyone else? 


31:02.010 --> 31:04.012
No! 


31:04.012 --> 31:07.115
Haggai 2:7 tells us 


31:07.115 --> 31:10.385
that Jehovah 
“will shake all the nations, 


31:10.385 --> 31:14.188
and the precious things 
of all the nations will come in.” 


31:14.188 --> 31:17.725
John 6:44 says 


31:17.725 --> 31:20.995
that ‘no man can come to Jesus 


31:20.995 --> 31:24.598
unless the Father draws him.’ 


31:24.598 --> 31:29.003
Jeremiah 31:3, Jehovah says: 


31:29.003 --> 31:32.740
“I have loved you with an everlasting love. 


31:32.740 --> 31:36.077
That is why I have drawn you.”


31:36.077 --> 31:39.980
So again, why are you serving Jehovah? 


31:39.980 --> 31:41.983
Because Jehovah loves you. 


31:41.983 --> 31:43.985
Jehovah drew you. 


31:43.985 --> 31:45.620
As he was shaking the nations, 


31:45.620 --> 31:49.257
he looked down into your heart 
and he saw something very precious 


31:49.257 --> 31:51.425
and he drew you to him. 


31:51.425 --> 31:53.995
He said, 
“I want to draw this person to my Son. 


31:53.995 --> 31:56.297
“I want to draw this person to me. 


31:56.297 --> 31:59.734
I love this person.” 


31:59.733 --> 32:01.936
Jehovah drew you, 


32:01.937 --> 32:04.672
not because you have
perfect circumstances,


32:04.672 --> 32:08.575
but because of your heart
and because he loves you.


32:08.575 --> 32:13.000
He greatly appreciates 
that his servants give their best to him.


32:15.115 --> 32:19.487
But how do we know 
that Jehovah really sees each one of us, 


32:19.487 --> 32:21.655
no matter where we are? 


32:21.655 --> 32:23.692
Consider an example: 


32:23.692 --> 32:26.194
Thousands of refugees who faced 


32:26.193 --> 32:28.696
severe hardships in their home countries 


32:28.697 --> 32:32.134
have sought shelter in parts of Europe. 


32:32.133 --> 32:36.136
Watch how Jehovah 
has lovingly assured them 


32:36.137 --> 32:42.000
that they’re not alone 
by satisfying their spiritual thirst.


32:44.112 --> 32:46.147
Welcome to Greece!


32:46.147 --> 32:49.984
We really feel that Jehovah is blessing us 


32:49.983 --> 32:51.986
by opening a large door 


32:51.987 --> 32:55.590
of opportunities to preach the good news 


32:55.590 --> 32:59.000
to the many refugees 
who are streaming into the country.


33:01.695 --> 33:06.600
For this reason, the brothers 
immediately informed us of the situation 


33:06.600 --> 33:09.270
and we directed the bodies of elders 


33:09.270 --> 33:13.007
to concentrate on the harbors, 
especially in Chios.


33:13.007 --> 33:16.177
The brothers were willing to work in shifts


33:16.177 --> 33:20.000
—24 hours a day.


33:21.948 --> 33:25.586
The refugee shelters in our area 
only have families with children 


33:25.587 --> 33:28.589
and are located near a military airport.


33:28.588 --> 33:31.158
Whenever military planes flew overhead 


33:31.158 --> 33:33.160
and the children would see and hear them, 


33:33.160 --> 33:37.032
they would immediately run 
and try to hide because they were afraid.


33:37.032 --> 33:39.600
They sought protection 
from the tragic conditions 


33:39.600 --> 33:41.802
they had experienced during warfare. 


33:41.802 --> 33:43.939
This impressed upon us 
how greatly they needed 


33:43.938 --> 33:46.106
the comforting message of the good news, 


33:46.107 --> 33:49.000
so we felt the urge to approach them.


33:50.177 --> 33:54.215
Therefore, 
the Service Department arranged 


33:54.215 --> 33:57.000
for four language classes 
to be held for the brothers.


33:59.320 --> 34:01.322
We try to speak to people 


34:01.322 --> 34:03.557
in a language quite different from our own. 


34:03.557 --> 34:04.859
At times, we might think: 


34:04.858 --> 34:06.960
‘Will these people understand us? 


34:06.960 --> 34:10.000
Will we be able to reach 
their heart with these basic truths?’


34:12.533 --> 34:14.235
Something that helped me not to hesitate 


34:14.235 --> 34:15.537
to approach these people 


34:15.537 --> 34:17.272
despite the language barrier 


34:17.272 --> 34:19.374
is what our teachers told us 
in the language class: 


34:19.373 --> 34:21.375
“Go and talk to them. 


34:21.375 --> 34:23.110
“Show them things from the Bible. 


34:23.110 --> 34:24.412
“Even if you don’t say things perfectly, 


34:24.412 --> 34:27.682
they will understand you.”


34:27.682 --> 34:29.684
After we received permission 


34:29.683 --> 34:32.986
from the branch office, 
we also printed thousands of tracts, 


34:32.987 --> 34:35.022
since we did not have enough. 


34:35.022 --> 34:39.000
This whole effort created 
an atmosphere of enthusiasm.


34:41.395 --> 34:44.032
I’m deeply moved when I see how lovingly


34:44.032 --> 34:45.767
Jehovah cares for these people 


34:45.767 --> 34:47.169
who have never had the opportunity 


34:47.168 --> 34:48.601
to hear the Kingdom message 


34:48.602 --> 34:51.000
that gives them a future and a hope.


34:52.673 --> 34:54.708
It was exciting 


34:54.708 --> 34:56.710
for them to hear that we have 


34:56.710 --> 34:59.000
a Bible-based video in their language. 


35:00.380 --> 35:03.250
We told them that the problems, calamities, 


35:03.250 --> 35:05.653
and the terrible war they had experienced 


35:05.653 --> 35:07.655
were not punishment from God, 


35:07.655 --> 35:09.657
but the result of the influence 


35:09.657 --> 35:12.227
Satan the Devil exercises 
over this system of things. 


35:12.227 --> 35:16.000
And this provided 
a good answer to their question.


35:17.365 --> 35:19.367
On a return visit, 


35:19.367 --> 35:23.337
after two days, 
a refugee girl said something very touching: 


35:23.337 --> 35:26.040
“Now I understand why 
we have to go through all this. 


35:26.040 --> 35:29.043
It’s very difficult, 
but it’s not God’s fault.”


35:29.043 --> 35:32.846
On another occasion, 
Gardinia, a refugee woman 


35:32.847 --> 35:34.849
who showed interest, told us: 


35:34.848 --> 35:37.050
“Since meeting you, 
I have a purpose in life. 


35:37.050 --> 35:39.053
“I have a reason to live. 


35:39.053 --> 35:42.000
Until now, I was just waiting to die.”


35:46.293 --> 35:48.295
A refugee approached 
the Arabic witnessing cart, 


35:48.295 --> 35:51.998
and we read Revelation 21:4 to him. 


35:51.998 --> 35:54.735
He said, “Please, 
could you read that to me once again?” 


35:54.735 --> 35:56.737
So we read it a second time. 


35:56.737 --> 35:57.605
He replied, 


35:57.605 --> 35:59.607
“May I have a Bible of my own?” 


35:59.607 --> 36:01.275
So we gave him a Bible. 


36:01.275 --> 36:02.910
Then he said, 
“Would you please show me 


36:02.910 --> 36:05.278
the sentence you read in my Bible?” 


36:05.278 --> 36:07.281
So we marked the verse for him.


36:07.282 --> 36:09.117
And on the way back 


36:09.117 --> 36:11.319
to our home at about 11 o’clock at night, 


36:11.318 --> 36:13.320
on the same road, at a well-lit point, 


36:13.320 --> 36:15.188
we saw that same refugee 


36:15.188 --> 36:19.160
sitting on the sidewalk reading the Bible.


36:19.160 --> 36:23.330
About two and a half years ago, 
I met Moustafa. 


36:23.330 --> 36:26.100
He attended the meetings 
and made speedy progress. 


36:26.100 --> 36:28.135
Moustafa was baptized a few months 


36:28.135 --> 36:30.538
before the refugees started pouring in. 


36:30.538 --> 36:33.106
We do not believe 
that this was a coincidence. 


36:33.107 --> 36:36.510
He would say, 
“I want to speak about Jehovah, 


36:36.510 --> 36:38.000
but I can’t do that 
in the Greek language.”


36:39.680 --> 36:42.717
When I can speak to people who are refugees


36:42.717 --> 36:44.819
—just as I am a refugee—


36:44.818 --> 36:46.853
in my own language, 


36:46.853 --> 36:50.056
this is a great opportunity for me. 


36:50.057 --> 36:54.362
And when I see that they listen 
to the truth and are loving it, 


36:54.362 --> 36:56.364
it makes my heart beat faster. 


36:56.363 --> 36:58.498
It touches my heart.


36:58.498 --> 37:00.500
By expanding my ministry, 


37:00.500 --> 37:02.503
I’m sharing in a form of service 


37:02.503 --> 37:04.838
that could even be described 
as missionary work, 


37:04.838 --> 37:07.106
since I’m helping 
people hear about Jehovah  


37:07.107 --> 37:09.110
for the very first time. 


37:09.110 --> 37:14.000
I’m living what I have only read 
about in experiences.


37:15.115 --> 37:17.985
Many were
—perhaps for the first time—


37:17.985 --> 37:21.588
discovering new skills in themselves, 


37:21.588 --> 37:25.993
indicating how Jehovah 
through his spirit can enable certain ones 


37:25.993 --> 37:29.000
to cultivate qualities they didn’t realize 
they had to such an extent.


37:33.433 --> 37:35.435
We are so grateful to Jehovah 
for opening a door 


37:35.435 --> 37:37.672
leading to such wonderful activity. 


37:37.672 --> 37:42.000
It gives us great joy, 
and we praise him daily for this.


37:45.045 --> 37:47.515
At the time this report was prepared, 


37:47.515 --> 37:50.852
over 100 Bible studies had been started. 


37:50.852 --> 37:53.120
One refugee told the brothers: 


37:53.120 --> 37:57.123
“You are the best thing 
that has happened to us here in Greece. 


37:57.123 --> 37:59.960
We thank Jehovah for meeting you.” 


37:59.960 --> 38:03.030
Another said: 
“We do not need material things. 


38:03.030 --> 38:04.832
“We need hope, 


38:04.832 --> 38:07.000
and you are giving this 
to us through the Bible.”


38:08.068 --> 38:10.536
In our program, we have been discussing 


38:10.537 --> 38:13.640
how Jehovah values each one of us, 


38:13.640 --> 38:16.043
no matter what our circumstances are. 


38:16.043 --> 38:18.078
In some parts of the world, 


38:18.078 --> 38:20.881
our brothers and sisters 
are in deep poverty 


38:20.882 --> 38:24.052
and lack even the basic needs for life. 


38:24.052 --> 38:27.889
But this does not diminish 
Jehovah’s feelings for them. 


38:27.888 --> 38:30.390
He loves them dearly. 


38:30.390 --> 38:32.393
In this next report, 


38:32.393 --> 38:36.230
see what’s been done 
to care for faithful brothers and sisters


38:36.230 --> 38:40.000
in the Democratic Republic of Congo.


38:45.605 --> 38:48.975
My name is Maska Mahamba. 


38:48.975 --> 38:50.978
I love the preaching work. 


38:50.978 --> 38:52.980
However, my various illnesses 


38:52.980 --> 38:55.000
prevent me from giving 
my all in the ministry.


38:57.785 --> 39:01.000
My first wife died, 
and we had six children. 


39:04.125 --> 39:06.627
I was alone with the six children, 


39:06.627 --> 39:10.000
and then I married Beatrice, 
who has five children. 


39:13.967 --> 39:18.000
Since we are living in the last days 
of this system, it is not easy.


39:20.540 --> 39:22.543
I like the example of Jesus, 


39:22.543 --> 39:26.913
who was passionate about preaching 
the message that he shared. 


39:26.913 --> 39:28.548
At the same time, 


39:28.548 --> 39:31.751
he took into account 
the suffering of the people of his time. 


39:31.752 --> 39:34.055
He would take time to show kindness, 


39:34.055 --> 39:37.000
to encourage, and to heal.


39:38.758 --> 39:40.895
The branch sees where there is a need 


39:40.895 --> 39:44.000
and then organizes a humanitarian mission.


39:46.833 --> 39:49.603
I believe I can use my medical skills 


39:49.603 --> 39:52.071
to help our brothers. 


39:52.072 --> 39:54.275
It is love, 


39:54.275 --> 39:56.610
not just in writing, 


39:56.610 --> 39:58.945
but in action.


39:58.945 --> 40:00.380
It’s a real joy 


40:00.380 --> 40:01.782
to help these brothers who need us 


40:01.782 --> 40:04.519
in remote locations far from towns. 


40:04.518 --> 40:09.000
It is always a pleasure.


40:42.122 --> 40:46.000
Well, the two are the same; 
both eardrums are completely perforated.


41:08.282 --> 41:10.284
Well, we are here 


41:10.283 --> 41:12.285
in the village of Walikale in the middle 


41:12.285 --> 41:14.322
of the forest on the main road


41:14.322 --> 41:16.424
—well, the only road in the village. 


41:16.423 --> 41:18.758
It serves as our runway. 


41:18.758 --> 41:23.330
I can’t bear to see anyone suffer, 


41:23.330 --> 41:25.498
so I use all my skills to try 


41:25.498 --> 41:28.435
to find a solution.


41:28.435 --> 41:30.703
What moves me to help the brothers 


41:30.703 --> 41:32.706
is what Jesus said, 


41:32.707 --> 41:35.009
that “there is more happiness in giving than


41:35.008 --> 41:37.010
. . . in receiving.”


41:37.010 --> 41:39.347
A long day
—really very tiring—


41:39.347 --> 41:41.382
but at the same time, 


41:41.382 --> 41:42.617
there was an encouraging case: 


41:42.617 --> 41:46.354
Brother Munyakaragwe, 68 years old, 


41:46.353 --> 41:50.456
10 years in the regular pioneer service, 
and he has 15 Bible studies. 


41:50.457 --> 41:53.727
This brother came 
from the territory on a motorcycle. 


41:53.727 --> 41:57.665
It took him two and a half hours 
on a very rough road 


41:57.665 --> 41:59.900
instead of an hour and a half 


41:59.900 --> 42:02.637
because he has a paralyzed leg. 


42:02.637 --> 42:04.639
And he was able to go 
back to his field service, 


42:04.638 --> 42:06.540
well, with some medication. 


42:06.540 --> 42:08.708
So it was really encouraging to see him 


42:08.708 --> 42:11.000
getting on the motorcycle 
with a smile on his face.


42:22.890 --> 42:25.225
These are mosquito nets for those in need, 


42:25.225 --> 42:26.860
and there’s a big need here. 


42:26.860 --> 42:29.000
So we give them to each family.


42:31.198 --> 42:34.568
You know, to protect your baby, 
one of the best things is for him  


42:34.568 --> 42:38.405
to sleep under a mosquito net.


42:38.405 --> 42:40.773
Jehovah has done well because he has gone 


42:40.773 --> 42:42.843
through you to provide us with care.


42:42.843 --> 42:44.778
We are very grateful. 


42:44.778 --> 42:46.246
We thank the many brothers 


42:46.247 --> 42:48.515
who have volunteered to serve us.


42:48.515 --> 42:51.118
I thank Jehovah because without him 


42:51.118 --> 42:55.923
our identifying mark of unity wouldn’t exist.


42:55.923 --> 42:57.456
You have helped me. 


42:57.457 --> 42:59.460
I had this problem for two years. 


42:59.460 --> 43:00.793
Now I’m so happy. 


43:00.793 --> 43:03.396
I will be able to hear at the meetings again. 


43:03.397 --> 43:04.865
Thank you.


43:04.865 --> 43:07.802
The brothers are aware 
that they must thank Jehovah, 


43:07.802 --> 43:09.804
and we ourselves are aware 


43:09.803 --> 43:11.271
that all of this is possible 


43:11.272 --> 43:12.940
thanks to Jehovah’s holy spirit 


43:12.940 --> 43:15.000
and his organization.


43:42.502 --> 43:44.505
How heartwarming!


43:44.505 --> 43:48.575
Those dear ones are not defined 
by their circumstances. 


43:48.575 --> 43:52.880
They have been serving Jehovah 
whole-souled despite their challenges, 


43:52.880 --> 43:56.550
and they’re determined 
to use the relief assistance 


43:56.550 --> 43:59.587
to continue worshipping him.


43:59.587 --> 44:03.557
Earlier, we discussed 
the examples of King David 


44:03.557 --> 44:06.794
and the apostle Paul 
and the mistakes they made.


44:06.793 --> 44:08.828
Perhaps for us, 


44:08.828 --> 44:12.498
our past mistakes are keeping us 
from moving forward. 


44:12.498 --> 44:14.635
That was the challenge for Jim Loyd. 


44:14.635 --> 44:17.037
He was raised in the truth 


44:17.037 --> 44:19.440
but did not progress to baptism. 


44:19.440 --> 44:22.475
By his teen years, 
he was getting into trouble. 


44:22.475 --> 44:26.780
As he describes it, 
in his heart he had left Jehovah. 


44:26.780 --> 44:29.750
His later involvement 
with gangs and violence 


44:29.750 --> 44:32.953
put him in a place 
he never expected to be. 


44:32.953 --> 44:35.655
But you will be greatly encouraged 


44:35.655 --> 44:38.125
to see where he is now.


44:38.125 --> 44:41.328
Things that have happened to you, 
you can’t change


44:41.328 --> 44:44.731
—but your personality you can. 


44:44.732 --> 44:47.735
We can change our personality 
with Jehovah’s help.


44:47.735 --> 44:49.737
By the time I was 25, 


44:49.737 --> 44:52.874
I was associating with notorious criminals.


44:52.873 --> 44:55.408
I guess I was a criminal too


44:55.408 --> 44:57.911
—just took a wrong turn and kept going.


44:57.912 --> 45:02.000
I found myself a fugitive on the run. 


45:03.850 --> 45:06.000
I was sentenced to many years in prison. 


45:07.353 --> 45:11.491
At 25, I felt like it might as well 
have been a life sentence. 


45:11.492 --> 45:15.029
Isolation and lockdown 


45:15.028 --> 45:17.163
was a very lonely place, 


45:17.163 --> 45:21.000
and I thought, 
‘How did I get here?’


45:22.502 --> 45:25.272
I remember a happier time in my life. 


45:25.272 --> 45:27.942
My mom would take us to meetings. 


45:27.942 --> 45:31.845
I was in the Theocratic Ministry School. 


45:31.845 --> 45:35.882
All the friends were so loving. 


45:35.882 --> 45:39.887
My mom sent me subscriptions 
to The Watchtower and Awake! 


45:39.887 --> 45:42.990
I had a box under my bunk, 


45:42.990 --> 45:46.427
and I’d toss them in there


45:46.427 --> 45:48.295
—never opened them. 


45:48.295 --> 45:50.263
And I must have had a years’ worth. 


45:50.263 --> 45:52.900
You know, I never told her: 


45:52.900 --> 45:54.133
“Stop sending them, Mom. 


45:54.133 --> 45:57.971
I’m not reading them.”


45:57.972 --> 45:59.974
I found out through my mom


45:59.973 --> 46:01.000
that my dad had died. 


46:04.978 --> 46:08.000
I felt that I broke his heart. 


46:10.250 --> 46:13.820
I pulled out the box from under my bunk. 


46:13.820 --> 46:16.657
Right on top was a book,


46:16.657 --> 46:20.227
The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life. 


46:20.227 --> 46:23.430
And at that moment, I knew 


46:23.430 --> 46:26.000
Jehovah hadn’t forgotten me. 


46:27.300 --> 46:29.603
I remembered that book. 


46:29.603 --> 46:32.305
I remembered that book when I was a boy. 


46:32.305 --> 46:35.000
I placed that book out in service. 


46:36.477 --> 46:38.012
I opened it up. 


46:38.012 --> 46:41.782
And, of course, the theme scripture 
for that publication 


46:41.782 --> 46:44.485
was Revelation 21:3, 4: 


46:44.485 --> 46:47.420
“The tent of God is with mankind.” 


46:47.420 --> 46:50.057
I read it that night the whole night. 


46:50.057 --> 46:51.325
I read the whole book. 


46:51.325 --> 46:53.793
Of course, that little bell went off. 


46:53.793 --> 46:55.928
I couldn’t deny that this was the truth. 


46:55.928 --> 46:57.000
So what was I going to do about it?


47:00.167 --> 47:02.735
Shortly after that, I got transferred, 


47:02.735 --> 47:04.303
so I called my mom and told her. 


47:04.303 --> 47:05.938
It was funny; she asked, 


47:05.938 --> 47:07.806
“Do you think there are
any Jehovah’s Witnesses


47:07.807 --> 47:09.544
that go up there?”


47:09.543 --> 47:11.178
I told her: “I don’t think so. 


47:11.178 --> 47:12.278
“It’s way up in the mountains. 


47:12.278 --> 47:16.000
I don’t think they go up there; 
it’s a little fire camp.”


47:17.050 --> 47:19.218
I wasn’t a spiritual person yet. 


47:19.218 --> 47:22.721
All the magazines and books 


47:22.722 --> 47:27.000
went back into the box 
and back under my bunk. 


47:29.630 --> 47:31.030
I’d only been there five minutes,


47:31.030 --> 47:33.333
and a guard came in and said, 


47:33.333 --> 47:35.868
“Are you a Jehovah’s Witness?” 


47:35.868 --> 47:37.536
I couldn’t believe it. 


47:37.537 --> 47:41.909
And I told him, “I studied with, 
been studying with Jehovah’s Witnesses.” 


47:41.908 --> 47:44.376
And he said: 
“Oh, good. Follow me.” 


47:44.377 --> 47:46.547
And I followed him, 
and he took me 


47:46.547 --> 47:49.315
and introduced me to a brother 


47:49.315 --> 47:52.552
who had been coming up 
there regularly 


47:52.552 --> 47:55.589
to study the Bible 
with inmates there.


47:55.588 --> 47:57.856
And I realized 


47:57.857 --> 47:59.994
at that moment that once again 


47:59.993 --> 48:02.000
Jehovah had not forgotten me.


48:04.163 --> 48:07.901
That brother faithfully came up there


48:07.902 --> 48:10.000
for the next two years 
every Friday night. 


48:11.705 --> 48:14.340
He thought that it’d be 
a good idea to have 


48:14.340 --> 48:16.743
a Theocratic Ministry School, 
so he got it approved. 


48:16.743 --> 48:18.745
He would do the number one talk, 


48:18.745 --> 48:20.747
and the other brother 
that would come with him 


48:20.747 --> 48:23.650
would do the highlights,
and then the three of us inmates


48:23.650 --> 48:25.418
would do the other parts. 


48:25.418 --> 48:27.000
I was giving a talk every week.


48:28.088 --> 48:30.090
And he started making 


48:30.090 --> 48:32.625
tape recordings of the meetings. 


48:32.625 --> 48:34.027
I’d listen to them over and over, 


48:34.027 --> 48:37.330
until the next week. 


48:37.330 --> 48:40.733
I knew that if I was going 
to return to Jehovah, 


48:40.733 --> 48:43.736
I had to make some adjustments. 


48:43.737 --> 48:46.374
With Jehovah’s help
—I leaned on him more, 


48:46.373 --> 48:48.275
relied on his strength more—


48:48.275 --> 48:52.000
it was then that I really felt 
that I could do this.


48:53.080 --> 48:57.450
The beard became a goatee, 
and then it just became a mustache. 


48:57.450 --> 48:59.720
No drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, 


48:59.720 --> 49:02.888
and I cleaned up my language. 


49:02.888 --> 49:05.791
Then I finally got released, 


49:05.792 --> 49:07.962
got a job as an electrician, 


49:07.962 --> 49:11.332
and was able to get my own place


49:11.332 --> 49:14.000
and started going to meetings. 


49:15.635 --> 49:19.740
I was listening to the Watchtower, 
and different ones were commenting. 


49:19.740 --> 49:21.742
‘Oh, that’s his wife’


49:21.742 --> 49:24.779
—one of the brothers 
who came up to visit me. 


49:24.778 --> 49:28.781
I kept looking to see, 
so I could finally put a face 


49:28.782 --> 49:31.685
to the voices
that I’d been listening to.


49:31.685 --> 49:34.320
I let Jehovah mold me


49:34.320 --> 49:38.000
into something good.


49:39.292 --> 49:43.164
There are many blessings 
since dedicating my life to Jehovah. 


49:43.163 --> 49:46.031
I’ve been an elder for ten years now. 


49:46.032 --> 49:48.035
One of my sons came into the truth. 


49:48.035 --> 49:50.370
I met my wonderful wife. 


49:50.370 --> 49:52.372
She’s helped me 


49:52.372 --> 49:56.710
to grow spiritually 
and to love Jehovah even more. 


49:56.710 --> 50:02.582
One thing I kept praying for and he’s blessed
me with is to forgive myself


50:02.582 --> 50:06.152
—to have a clean conscience 
and freeness of speech. 


50:06.152 --> 50:10.000
And he’s done that.


50:11.858 --> 50:15.961
Jim shares the same joy as so many others 


50:15.962 --> 50:18.132
who return to Jehovah. 


50:18.132 --> 50:21.535
The feelings common 
in such real-life experiences 


50:21.535 --> 50:24.805
are what we’ll see depicted 
in our music video. 


50:24.805 --> 50:27.673
It’s called I Can Get Back Up. 


50:27.673 --> 50:32.111
It is especially touching 
for those of us who have stumbled 


50:32.112 --> 50:37.000
but need encouragement 
to move ahead with Jehovah’s help.


50:52.232 --> 51:00.807
This loneliness I feel inside 
is hard to bear.


51:00.807 --> 51:07.000
Jehovah, I can see where I went wrong.


51:08.582 --> 51:16.122
Feeling so downhearted, 
I need strength to carry on.


51:16.122 --> 51:23.664
I’m yearning to be back where I belong.


51:23.663 --> 51:32.038
I remember things you taught me
—things I still recall—


51:32.038 --> 51:40.346
The precious truths found 
in your Holy Word.


51:40.347 --> 51:55.829
That even if I stumble, even if I fall,
I can get back up.


51:55.828 --> 52:03.000
I know the ones who care for me,
Who showed their love before,


52:04.470 --> 52:11.000
Those who love Jehovah from the heart.


52:12.078 --> 52:20.420
Your word is like a lamp 
that lights the way that leads me back.


52:20.420 --> 52:28.828
The road to life is where I want to be.


52:28.828 --> 52:35.701
Ev’rywhere I go, ev’rything I see, 
reminds me of the truth:


52:35.702 --> 52:43.000
The end is drawing near.


52:44.043 --> 52:52.385
So Jehovah, Father, 
please hear my prayer tonight


52:52.385 --> 53:00.260
And help me now, 
I’m in my time of need.


53:00.260 --> 53:08.902
You know that when I stumble 
so many times,


53:08.902 --> 53:15.000
I can get back up.


53:16.275 --> 53:31.000
I know Jehovah understands; 
sometimes I need a helping hand.


53:32.225 --> 53:39.798
He knows that I am weak 
and sees what others cannot see.


53:39.798 --> 53:47.673
He’s looking for the best in me.


53:47.673 --> 53:56.515
So I’m going to the hall tonight 
to feel the love I lost,


53:56.515 --> 54:04.590
Back to where I know I belong.


54:04.590 --> 54:20.000
And even if I stumble, 
even if I fall, I will get back up.


54:29.015 --> 54:38.592
I can get back up.


54:38.592 --> 54:41.862
What a beautiful reminder 
that if we stumble, 


54:41.862 --> 54:44.397
we can get back up! 


54:44.397 --> 54:47.534
Having seen the examples 
throughout the program,


54:47.533 --> 54:51.170
can you confidently answer 
the question of our theme, 


54:51.170 --> 54:54.873
“Are You Defined by Your Circumstances?” 


54:54.873 --> 54:56.876
What do you think?


54:56.877 --> 55:01.514
Remember, 
not the way man sees is the way God sees


55:01.513 --> 55:04.116
—Jehovah sees what the heart is. 


55:04.117 --> 55:08.389
May we work hard
to see ourselves as Jehovah does


55:08.388 --> 55:11.958
and be determined to never give up. 


55:11.958 --> 55:16.028
May we never forget that it is
the privilege of bearing Jehovah’s name,


55:16.028 --> 55:18.130
having a relationship with him, 


55:18.130 --> 55:21.433
and our love for Jehovah that defines us. 


55:21.433 --> 55:26.105
Jehovah is happy 
if we give the best that we can. 


55:26.105 --> 55:28.307
So may we do our part


55:28.307 --> 55:31.845
by not limiting ourselves 
due to our circumstances,


55:31.845 --> 55:35.615
but always look for ways 
to give our best to Jehovah.


55:35.615 --> 55:38.083
You beautiful older ones, 


55:38.083 --> 55:40.286
even those with severe health problems, 


55:40.287 --> 55:43.557
can do much to help 
in the great work that’s taking place today. 


55:43.557 --> 55:45.859
Now, you may wonder 
what can you do. 


55:45.858 --> 55:47.993
You can pray for your brothers and sisters. 


55:47.993 --> 55:49.461
We need your prayers. 


55:49.462 --> 55:51.097
Pray for the Governing Body. 


55:51.097 --> 55:52.965
Pray for those who are taking the lead. 


55:52.965 --> 55:55.535
Pray for the elders in your congregations. 


55:55.535 --> 55:59.072
Pray for those who 
are going through difficult times. 


55:59.072 --> 56:02.542
Do such prayers help 
the work of the organization? 


56:02.542 --> 56:04.544
Absolutely! 


56:04.543 --> 56:07.513
James 5:16 tells us 


56:07.513 --> 56:10.183
that ‘a righteous person’s supplication 


56:10.183 --> 56:12.718
has a powerful effect.’ 


56:12.718 --> 56:17.290
No matter who we are 
and whatever our situation in life, 


56:17.290 --> 56:22.295
may we find joy 
in giving what we can for Jehovah. 


56:22.295 --> 56:26.332
And may each one of us 
rejoice at the privilege we have 


56:26.332 --> 56:29.935
of being part of what Jehovah 
is accomplishing 


56:29.935 --> 56:32.705
in these last days.


56:32.705 --> 56:37.143
Of course, we share that privilege 
with our worldwide brotherhood


56:37.143 --> 56:40.280
—a part of which we enjoy 
seeing each month. 


56:40.280 --> 56:42.448
To conclude this program, 


56:42.448 --> 56:46.753
we visit with our brothers 
and sisters in Togo.


56:46.753 --> 56:49.288
Located in western Africa, 


56:49.288 --> 56:54.160
Togo enjoys 
a very pleasant climate year-round. 


56:54.160 --> 56:58.397
The southern coast contains 
extensive lagoons with sandy beaches, 


56:58.397 --> 57:02.069
while farther north are 
rolling forested hills 


57:02.068 --> 57:04.836
and yellow tinges of savanna land. 


57:04.837 --> 57:08.475
Togo may be one 
of the smaller countries in Africa. 


57:08.475 --> 57:12.612
Yet, it is sending up a great shout 
of praise to Jehovah. 


57:12.612 --> 57:14.647
In the town of Kpalimé, 


57:14.647 --> 57:18.585
there are 577 of our brothers and sisters, 


57:18.585 --> 57:21.988
56 of whom are pioneers.


57:21.988 --> 57:25.000
Kpalimé is located 
on a scenic woodland plateau. 


57:26.725 --> 57:29.762
Steep hillsides can sometimes 
make service a challenge 


57:29.762 --> 57:32.132
but not a deterrent. 


57:32.132 --> 57:36.002
Our faithful brothers and sisters 
not only meet this challenge 


57:36.002 --> 57:39.005
but are very zealous 
in carrying out their ministry. 


57:39.005 --> 57:41.875
They diligently search out all persons, 


57:41.875 --> 57:43.877
no matter where they are. 


57:43.877 --> 57:46.947
And many honesthearted ones are listening 


57:46.947 --> 57:49.000
to the good news from God’s Word.


57:50.115 --> 57:54.987
The first congregation in Kpalimé 
was formed in 1961. 


57:54.987 --> 57:58.859
Now there are seven 
in this small town alone! 


57:58.858 --> 58:02.000
The Kingdom Halls 
are very well cared for by the brothers. 


58:03.395 --> 58:05.498
This is the newest Kingdom Hall, 


58:05.498 --> 58:07.233
Kpalimé-Nogo. 


58:07.233 --> 58:11.803
It was just dedicated 
in December 2016. 


58:11.803 --> 58:15.000
And here is their Assembly Hall, 
constructed in 2008. 


58:16.877 --> 58:20.000
All 577 send you 
their love and greetings. 


58:21.047 --> 58:24.084
And we, in turn, 
send them our love 


58:24.083 --> 58:27.586
and pray for Jehovah’s strength and blessing 


58:27.587 --> 58:30.824
to be upon each and every one of them.


58:30.823 --> 58:33.660
From the world headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


58:33.660 --> 58:43.153
this is JW Broadcasting!
