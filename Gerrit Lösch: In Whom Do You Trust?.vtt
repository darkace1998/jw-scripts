00:01.985 --> 00:03.987
The theme for this month is


00:03.987 --> 00:06.022
“In Whom Do You Trust?” 


00:06.022 --> 00:08.190
Do you trust me? 


00:08.190 --> 00:09.192
I hope so. 


00:09.192 --> 00:11.560
All of us want to be trusted. 


00:11.560 --> 00:15.965
Trust is a basic element of everyday life. 


00:15.965 --> 00:18.868
To trust others is a normal reaction. 


00:18.868 --> 00:22.371
Many of us have traveled on a train or a bus. 


00:22.372 --> 00:25.175
Did we worry whether 
the conductor or driver


00:25.175 --> 00:27.677
would bring us safely to our destination? 


00:27.677 --> 00:30.414
Normally, we do not worry. 


00:30.413 --> 00:35.718
We trust an airplane captain
to take us safely to our destination. 


00:35.718 --> 00:37.953
We trust that when we enter an elevator, 


00:37.953 --> 00:40.723
it will not crash at the bottom of the shaft,


00:40.723 --> 00:44.793
but safely take us to the desired floor. 


00:44.793 --> 00:49.031
When we marry, we trust that
our partner will remain faithful. 


00:49.032 --> 00:53.302
In many situations in life we need trust.


00:53.302 --> 00:54.670
What is trust? 


00:54.670 --> 00:58.575
Trust is the “firm belief in the reliability,


00:58.575 --> 01:02.000
truth, or ability of someone or something.” 


01:03.212 --> 01:06.649
Webster’s dictionary says
that it is “confidence”; 


01:06.648 --> 01:10.586
a “reliance [or] resting
of the mind on the integrity,


01:10.587 --> 01:13.690
“veracity, justice, friendship,


01:13.690 --> 01:17.000
or other sound principle, of another person.” 


01:18.093 --> 01:20.630
Trust is related to confidence,


01:20.630 --> 01:24.000
belief, faith, and assurance.


01:25.168 --> 01:29.871
Experiments conducted
by Professor Dr. Michael Kosfeld,


01:29.872 --> 01:33.510
a professor at a university
in Frankfurt, Germany,


01:33.510 --> 01:35.978
led him to the conclusion that trust 


01:35.978 --> 01:40.000
is “a biologically-based part
of human nature.” 


01:41.517 --> 01:46.522
Kosfeld discovered that when there is
interaction between two people, 


01:46.522 --> 01:51.000
the human brain releases
a hormone that stimulates trust. 


01:52.095 --> 01:54.797
“It is, in fact,
one of the distinguishing features


01:54.797 --> 01:58.000
of the human species,” Kosfeld states.


01:59.602 --> 02:03.974
In everyday life, how discouraged
some are if they are not trusted. 


02:03.973 --> 02:07.110
The phrase “Don’t you trust me?”


02:07.110 --> 02:12.848
is frequently heard with an undertone
of sadness or complaint. 


02:12.848 --> 02:15.985
Sometimes children or teenagers
ask their parents


02:15.985 --> 02:20.357
“Don’t you trust me?” when the parents
place some restrictions on them,


02:20.357 --> 02:23.694
perhaps in connection
with leisure-time activities. 


02:23.693 --> 02:27.163
Parents do that because they
love you young ones


02:27.163 --> 02:32.535
and want to prevent any spiritual
or physical harm befalling you. 


02:32.535 --> 02:35.772
If you cooperate, you will see that parents 


02:35.772 --> 02:38.207
will gradually trust you ever more


02:38.207 --> 02:41.000
and grant more liberty to you. 


02:42.112 --> 02:46.449
You can prove to them
that you are trustworthy.


02:46.448 --> 02:49.151
In the world, 
many people are not trustworthy. 


02:49.152 --> 02:52.055
Since we are living in the time of the end


02:52.055 --> 02:56.292
and the demons are desperate 
and have influenced many people,


02:56.292 --> 03:01.000
we have to admit that
trusting in everybody is not wise. 


03:02.065 --> 03:05.268
Many trusted in religion
and were disappointed. 


03:05.268 --> 03:08.938
Others trusted in governments
or the United Nations,


03:08.938 --> 03:10.940
but they were disappointed. 


03:10.940 --> 03:14.510
They trusted political leaders
that made all kinds of promises


03:14.510 --> 03:16.745
but did not keep all of them. 


03:16.745 --> 03:20.000
Some politicians were
even exposed as being liars. 


03:22.018 --> 03:24.453
Proverbs 14:15 says: 


03:24.453 --> 03:27.290
“The naive person believes every word,


03:27.290 --> 03:31.860
but the shrewd one ponders each step.” 


03:31.860 --> 03:36.632
If somebody, even in the truth,
promises us big monetary returns


03:36.632 --> 03:39.435
if we give him money
for his planned investment,


03:39.435 --> 03:43.907
we need to be careful
and not believe every word. 


03:43.907 --> 03:47.444
Some that spent their money
were in for a disappointment 


03:47.443 --> 03:50.000
when they learned that everything was lost. 


03:51.613 --> 03:54.150
We also should not trust everything we read


03:54.150 --> 03:57.000
in newspapers or see on television.


03:58.622 --> 04:02.559
There is another thing
we should not trust in—riches. 


04:02.558 --> 04:07.296
Psalm 49:6 speaks
about “those who are trusting in their wealth 


04:07.297 --> 04:11.567
and who boast about their great riches.” 


04:11.567 --> 04:15.539
Trusting in riches
often leads to disappointment. 


04:15.538 --> 04:18.641
“The one trusting in his riches will fall,” 


04:18.642 --> 04:21.000
says Proverbs 11:28. 


04:22.445 --> 04:27.417
It is not wrong to be rich; 
just do not trust in riches. 


04:27.417 --> 04:30.000
Riches are a risk factor. 


04:31.287 --> 04:34.290
Many people today are dishonest and cheat. 


04:34.290 --> 04:36.592
Some business owners have installed


04:36.592 --> 04:38.729
cameras at the workplace,


04:38.728 --> 04:43.431
since they do not trust their employees
to put in a full day of work. 


04:43.432 --> 04:47.000
They know that some would play
video games during work hours.


04:48.537 --> 04:53.242
But Jehovah created us
with the inclination to trust. 


04:53.242 --> 04:56.779
We can especially trust
our spiritual brothers. 


04:56.778 --> 05:00.650
True, once in a while
such trust is misplaced. 


05:00.650 --> 05:04.920
A few commit serious sins
and have to be disfellowshipped. 


05:04.920 --> 05:07.000
But that is rare. 


05:08.057 --> 05:12.895
Jehovah himself is
the best example of trusting in others. 


05:12.895 --> 05:15.932
He trusted the Logos to faithfully cooperate


05:15.932 --> 05:20.135
with him as the “master worker”
in creating the universe, 


05:20.135 --> 05:25.508
the earth, and all the living things
on earth, including mankind. 


05:25.508 --> 05:31.513
What tremendous trust Jehovah showed
in Jesus when He sent him to the earth. 


05:31.513 --> 05:34.350
Jehovah trusted that
Jesus would remain faithful


05:34.350 --> 05:39.188
and redeem mankind 
so that His will and purpose with mankind


05:39.188 --> 05:41.790
and the earth could be accomplished. 


05:41.790 --> 05:46.228
Jehovah trusted him so much
that he arranged for prophecies


05:46.228 --> 05:50.966
to be written that foretold
that he would die faithfully. 


05:50.967 --> 05:54.937
This trust on the part of Jehovah
was not a risk. 


05:54.937 --> 06:00.000
It was based on the collaboration
between the two for aeons of time. 


06:01.443 --> 06:04.746
Think of the prophecy at Psalm 16:10: 


06:04.747 --> 06:08.000
“For you will not leave me in the Grave.”


06:09.718 --> 06:11.486
Jesus had free will. 


06:11.487 --> 06:14.957
This means that theoretically 
he could have sinned. 


06:14.957 --> 06:17.227
If he could not have sinned, 


06:17.227 --> 06:22.000
Satan probably would not have tried
three times to tempt Jesus to sin. 


06:23.332 --> 06:25.234
If Jesus could not have sinned, 


06:25.233 --> 06:27.403
why would he be so heavily distressed


06:27.403 --> 06:31.740
in the garden of Gethsemane
that he was sweating blood? 


06:31.740 --> 06:34.943
Why send an angel
to comfort and strengthen him 


06:34.943 --> 06:37.000
if he could not sin or fail anyway? 


06:39.448 --> 06:43.986
No question that Jesus
felt the unfathomable load


06:43.987 --> 06:47.190
on his shoulders to remain faithful, 


06:47.190 --> 06:51.260
since not only the salvation
of mankind depended on him


06:51.260 --> 06:55.397
but also the vindication
of Jehovah’s sovereignty. 


06:55.397 --> 06:58.300
He did not want to disappoint Jehovah. 


06:58.300 --> 07:01.337
Jesus used his own free will


07:01.337 --> 07:04.574
and was determined to stay loyal. 


07:04.573 --> 07:08.000
How glad we are that he did!


07:09.078 --> 07:13.215
On the other hand, 
Jesus also trusted Jehovah completely. 


07:13.215 --> 07:18.000
He trusted Jehovah that he would
resurrect him if he would die faithfully. 


07:19.322 --> 07:23.592
Actually, Jesus was publicly known
to trust in Jehovah. 


07:23.592 --> 07:28.497
People that passed by when he was
on the torture stake were saying:


07:28.497 --> 07:31.267
“He has put his trust in God;


07:31.267 --> 07:34.670
“let Him now rescue him if He wants him, 


07:34.670 --> 07:37.773
for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”


07:37.773 --> 07:40.576
Another example of trust was Abraham. 


07:40.577 --> 07:44.047
When God told him
to kill his beloved son Isaac, 


07:44.047 --> 07:46.515
Abraham was willing to do so. 


07:46.515 --> 07:50.000
He trusted that Jehovah could resurrect him. 


07:51.220 --> 07:53.488
Hebrews 11:19 says: 


07:53.488 --> 07:58.260
“He reasoned that God was able to raise
him up even from the dead, 


07:58.260 --> 08:02.865
and he did receive him from there
in an illustrative way.”


08:02.865 --> 08:05.802
First Corinthians 13:7 says that


08:05.802 --> 08:08.000
love “believes all things.” 


08:09.805 --> 08:13.108
Love trusts that prophecies will come true. 


08:13.108 --> 08:16.000
It also believes what our brothers tell us. 


08:17.078 --> 08:19.981
It also helps to grant others
the benefit of the doubt


08:19.982 --> 08:23.000
if a matter could be interpreted
in different ways. 


08:24.387 --> 08:28.590
Yes, trusting others
is an expression of love. 


08:28.590 --> 08:33.000
If you love somebody, you only assume
and think the best of him.


08:34.830 --> 08:38.667
Another example of trust
in Jehovah was Moses. 


08:38.667 --> 08:43.139
He led the nation of Israel
out of Egypt into the desert


08:43.138 --> 08:46.741
—a nation upwards of three million people. 


08:46.742 --> 08:50.000
And they had flocks
of cattle and sheep with them. 


08:51.147 --> 08:54.150
When he left Egypt, 
did he know how to provide


08:54.150 --> 08:57.220
these great crowds with water in the desert? 


08:57.220 --> 08:59.655
Did he know what they would be eating


08:59.655 --> 09:03.000
after the initial foodstuffs
that they took out of Egypt ran out? 


09:04.627 --> 09:09.000
Did he know in advance that Jehovah 
would miraculously provide the manna? 


09:10.065 --> 09:12.100
It doesn’t seem so. 


09:12.100 --> 09:17.000
But he trusted that Jehovah 
would take care of the people.


09:18.173 --> 09:22.311
The three friends of Daniel
were another fine example of trust. 


09:22.312 --> 09:25.982
They did not bow and worship
in front of an idol


09:25.982 --> 09:28.000
that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 


09:29.352 --> 09:35.490
They were told they would be thrown
into a fiery furnace if they disobeyed. 


09:35.490 --> 09:39.762
They remained firm
and were protected by an angel, 


09:39.762 --> 09:42.932
so that the fire did not do any harm to them. 


09:42.932 --> 09:44.467
After that


09:44.467 --> 09:47.169
“Nebuchadnezzar then declared: 


09:47.168 --> 09:51.640
“‘Praised be the God of Shadrach, 
Meshach, and Abednego, 


09:51.640 --> 09:54.877
“‘who sent his angel
and rescued his servants. 


09:54.877 --> 09:59.182
“‘They trusted in him and went against
the command of the king


09:59.182 --> 10:01.417
“‘and were willing to die rather than serve


10:01.417 --> 10:05.755
or worship any god except their own God.’”


10:05.755 --> 10:09.258
As we are getting ever closer
to the great tribulation, 


10:09.258 --> 10:12.395
we might be confronted with scary challenges


10:12.395 --> 10:15.798
and tests related to nationalism. 


10:15.798 --> 10:18.566
Will we keep trusting Jehovah? 


10:18.567 --> 10:20.602
We trust we will. 


10:20.602 --> 10:25.340
Jehovah will miraculously save his 
people throughout the great tribulation 


10:25.340 --> 10:28.000
and arrange for their survival.


10:29.078 --> 10:34.083
Today, the faithful slave is put in charge
of providing spiritual food for God’s people, 


10:34.083 --> 10:37.185
who number into the millions. 


10:37.185 --> 10:40.622
The slave also shows
complete trust in Jehovah


10:40.622 --> 10:43.000
that he will guide them with his holy spirit. 


10:44.593 --> 10:47.830
What makes it possible 
for the “faithful and discreet slave” 


10:47.830 --> 10:50.000
to provide precious spiritual food? 


10:51.800 --> 10:56.605
“I will give you insight and instruct you
in the way you should go,” 


10:56.605 --> 11:00.000
says Jehovah at Psalm 32:8. 


11:01.610 --> 11:05.948
Today, Jehovah provides direction
to the slave through Jesus. 


11:05.948 --> 11:09.385
Jesus, in turn, 
provides direction for his people


11:09.385 --> 11:12.287
through “the faithful and discreet slave.” 


11:12.287 --> 11:15.892
We can therefore have full confidence


11:15.892 --> 11:20.000
in the Scriptural insight, 
understanding, and guidance.


11:21.963 --> 11:24.566
Satan tries to sow mistrust. 


11:24.567 --> 11:27.404
Under Communist dictatorship in Romania,


11:27.403 --> 11:30.605
secret police officers
forced a responsible brother


11:30.605 --> 11:33.742
to walk with them
on a heavily frequented street


11:33.742 --> 11:36.379
hoping that other brothers would see this 


11:36.378 --> 11:40.000
and wrongly conclude that this brother
works with the secret police. 


11:41.350 --> 11:43.352
Did the scheme work out? 


11:43.352 --> 11:45.654
No, it failed. 


11:45.653 --> 11:49.958
Brothers did see him but kept trusting him. 


11:49.958 --> 11:54.000
We learn that we should not quickly
lose trust in our brothers. 


11:56.298 --> 12:01.103
Satan also has the scheme 
to spread rumors about faithful brothers,


12:01.103 --> 12:04.373
including the faithful slave. 


12:04.373 --> 12:07.576
The method of spreading rumors is not new. 


12:07.577 --> 12:10.914
When Jesus was resurrected
and the tomb was empty, 


12:10.913 --> 12:14.416
the soldiers who reported it 
were told to spread the rumor


12:14.417 --> 12:18.000
that the disciples came 
and stole the body at night. 


12:19.020 --> 12:23.758
Matthew 28:15 relates:


12:23.758 --> 12:27.796
“So they took the silver pieces
and did as they were instructed, 


12:27.797 --> 12:33.000
and this story has been spread abroad
among the Jews up to this very day.” 


12:34.002 --> 12:36.872
Another rumor in the first century
was that Christians


12:36.872 --> 12:40.175
were responsible for the great fire of Rome. 


12:40.175 --> 12:43.712
Could such an accusation be true? 


12:43.712 --> 12:46.815
Historians say that it was Nero, 


12:46.815 --> 12:50.000
the emperor, who set fire to the city.


12:51.520 --> 12:56.558
Today, rumors are occasionally being spread
in electronic form about the faithful slave. 


12:56.558 --> 13:00.095
This has caused some concern
on the part of some brothers,


13:00.095 --> 13:04.300
especially when the reports
are commenting on court cases


13:04.300 --> 13:07.000
where some in the organization were accused. 


13:08.270 --> 13:13.208
Sometimes reference is made to certain quotes
and then readers think, 


13:13.208 --> 13:15.676
‘How can a quote be a rumor?’ 


13:15.677 --> 13:19.182
A quote can be taken out of context. 


13:19.182 --> 13:23.519
Critical reports often 
give only part of a matter


13:23.518 --> 13:26.555
and leave out other aspects. 


13:26.555 --> 13:30.000
Often, such rumors play on the emotions. 


13:31.793 --> 13:35.796
Ask yourself: ‘Am I prone to believe rumors? 


13:35.797 --> 13:39.435
‘And even if I am, should I spread it


13:39.435 --> 13:42.470
‘and undermine the trust
that others have in the slave 


13:42.470 --> 13:47.977
or in representatives of the branch office?’ 


13:47.977 --> 13:51.214
Avoid sensationalism 
by not saying something like


13:51.213 --> 13:55.050
“Can you believe what I heard
about this matter or that matter


13:55.050 --> 13:59.455
or this person or that person?” 
referring to a statement 


13:59.455 --> 14:04.460
that may have appeared
on Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter. 


14:04.460 --> 14:09.465
The spread of rumors is like wildfire
that is hard to control. 


14:09.465 --> 14:14.000
It spreads distrust
and can undermine someone’s faith. 


14:15.037 --> 14:19.642
This is not to say that the slave is perfect
and never makes mistakes. 


14:19.642 --> 14:23.479
But Jehovah and Jesus
trust the imperfect slave 


14:23.478 --> 14:26.315
who cares for things
to the best of his ability


14:26.315 --> 14:28.750
and with the best of motives. 


14:28.750 --> 14:33.000
Shouldn’t we then trust
the imperfect slave as well?


14:34.990 --> 14:39.995
To appreciate the extent of Jehovah
and Jesus’ trust in the faithful slave,


14:39.995 --> 14:43.732
reflect on what he has promised its members. 


14:43.732 --> 14:48.000
He has promised them
immortality and incorruption. 


14:49.305 --> 14:51.707
Soon, just before Armageddon,


14:51.707 --> 14:55.979
the remaining members of the slave
will be taken to heaven. 


14:55.978 --> 14:58.446
Since 1919 of our Common Era,


14:58.447 --> 15:03.085
the slave has been put in charge
of some belongings of Christ. 


15:03.085 --> 15:06.488
According to Matthew 24:47, 


15:06.488 --> 15:11.426
when the anointed are taken to heaven,
Jesus will at that point entrust


15:11.427 --> 15:14.000
“all his belongings” to them. 


15:15.297 --> 15:19.000
Does this not reveal immense trust? 


15:20.535 --> 15:24.940
Revelation 4:4 describes 
these resurrected anointed


15:24.940 --> 15:27.542
as corulers with Christ. 


15:27.542 --> 15:31.547
Revelation 22:5 says they will rule,


15:31.547 --> 15:33.782
not only for a thousand years


15:33.782 --> 15:37.000
but “forever and ever.” 


15:38.253 --> 15:42.000
What immense trust 
Jesus shows toward them! 


15:43.758 --> 15:46.128
Since Jehovah God and Jesus Christ


15:46.128 --> 15:49.598
completely trust
“the faithful and discreet slave,” 


15:49.598 --> 15:52.000
should we not do the same?


15:54.370 --> 15:57.907
Many servants of Jehovah in the past 
showed trust in Jehovah


15:57.907 --> 16:01.710
when confronted with obstacles or opposition. 


16:01.710 --> 16:06.715
We can trust that Jehovah will not let us
be tested beyond what we can bear


16:06.715 --> 16:09.250
but will provide a “way out” 


16:09.250 --> 16:13.755
so we can remain faithful under trials. 


16:13.755 --> 16:16.925
So whom do you trust? 


16:16.925 --> 16:22.732
You fully trust in Jehovah, 
Jesus, and the faithful slave. 


16:22.732 --> 16:27.000
To a reasonable degree, you also trust all
your fellow brothers and sisters.


16:28.337 --> 16:33.375
The writer of Psalm 119:42
mentioned something else we need to trust in


16:33.375 --> 16:35.443
—God’s Word. 


16:35.443 --> 16:37.478
He wrote: 


16:37.478 --> 16:41.416
“For I put my trust in your word.” 


16:41.417 --> 16:46.489
The prophecies in God’s Word
have always come true at the proper time. 


16:46.488 --> 16:51.060
Based on that, we can fully trust that
the remaining prophecies


16:51.060 --> 16:54.530
pointing to the survival
of the great tribulation


16:54.530 --> 16:59.435
and to the Paradise to follow
will also come true, 


16:59.435 --> 17:02.000
without the slightest possibility of failure.


17:04.072 --> 17:07.275
Of course, we should trust
not only Jehovah, Jesus,


17:07.275 --> 17:12.280
the faithful slave, and the Bible 
but also our fellow brothers. 


17:12.280 --> 17:15.383
The apostle Paul is a fine example of this. 


17:15.383 --> 17:18.886
He wrote to Philemon 


17:18.887 --> 17:21.190
asking him to kindly receive back 


17:21.190 --> 17:26.228
the runaway slave Onesimus
who had become a brother. 


17:26.228 --> 17:30.398
Paul wrote at Philemon 21: 


17:30.398 --> 17:33.335
“I am confident that you will comply,


17:33.335 --> 17:38.473
so I am writing you, knowing that you
will do even more than what I say.”


17:38.473 --> 17:40.508
When we speak of trust, 


17:40.508 --> 17:43.245
we sometimes think of a little child


17:43.245 --> 17:46.000
walking hand in hand with his father. 


17:47.750 --> 17:51.420
The child does not question
where the father will take him. 


17:51.420 --> 17:54.122
The child trusts the father. 


17:54.122 --> 17:56.225
All throughout the last days, 


17:56.225 --> 18:01.230
true Christians have faced hostility 
of so many in the world. 


18:01.230 --> 18:03.965
How strengthening Jehovah’s promise is


18:03.965 --> 18:07.770
in view of the impending attack
by Satan’s hordes! 


18:07.770 --> 18:12.673
When they attack, Jehovah’s people
will seem as defenseless. 


18:12.673 --> 18:15.176
But we do not need to quake with fear. 


18:15.177 --> 18:18.447
We trust that Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels


18:18.447 --> 18:21.000
will fight to deliver us. 


18:22.183 --> 18:25.086
We will not shrink back in fear. 


18:25.087 --> 18:27.957
At Hebrews 10:39, Paul wrote:


18:27.957 --> 18:31.394
“Now we are not the sort 
who shrink back to destruction,


18:31.393 --> 18:36.131
but the sort who have faith
for the preserving of our lives.” 


18:36.132 --> 18:38.767
Today and after Armageddon, all can say,


18:38.767 --> 18:43.072
according to Psalm 26:1 and 52:8:


18:43.072 --> 18:46.342
“I have trusted [in Jehovah]
without wavering.” 


18:46.342 --> 18:52.180
“My trust is in God’s loyal love,
forever and ever.” 


18:52.180 --> 19:03.308
Therefore, keep trusting in Jehovah
and those who are proving loyal to him.
