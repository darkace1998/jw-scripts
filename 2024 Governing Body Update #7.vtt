00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:03.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:05.734 line:10% position:50% align:center
Since our last update,

00:00:05.734 --> 00:00:09.196 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’ve had two more special conventions

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both were held in Chile.

00:00:11.532 --> 00:00:15.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 4,700 delegates traveled

00:00:15.244 --> 00:00:19.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 21 countries
to attend these two conventions.

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:23.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a combined peak attendance

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
of over 17,000,

00:00:26.255 --> 00:00:29.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 123 were baptized.

00:00:29.091 --> 00:00:32.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
The special convention
touched the hearts of many,

00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
including a delegate named Jonathan.

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:37.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The love you have shown us
at every step of this trip

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:47.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—from the welcome at the airport
to all the different activities,

00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the beautiful gifts,
the friends at the convention,

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:55.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the wonderful reception personnel
at the hotel—

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been unbelievable!

00:00:57.786 --> 00:00:59.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We thank Jehovah

00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:05.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
for allowing us to have this
incredible experience,” he said.

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
A delegate named Jésica said:

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:12.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you for giving us a preview
of the new world!”

00:01:15.387 --> 00:01:20.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, we’ve had a number
of significant natural disasters.

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:24.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
In mid-September,
Storm Boris affected Central Europe,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
bringing heavy rain and powerful wind.

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:32.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hundreds of our brothers and sisters
were displaced

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:35.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
and received relief aid.

00:01:35.324 --> 00:01:39.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, southern Africa
continues to be affected

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
by an unprecedented drought.

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:45.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Various branch offices, including Malawi,

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:48.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mozambique, and Zimbabwe,

00:01:48.504 --> 00:01:51.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
have helped tens of thousands of our brothers

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:53.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have the food they need.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
In late September and early October,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hurricanes Helene and Milton

00:02:00.683 --> 00:02:04.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
devastated the southeastern United States.

00:02:04.311 --> 00:02:08.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two storms caused
devastating floods and landslides.

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:12.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, three publishers were killed.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 11,000 of our brothers were displaced.

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:21.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
The storms damaged or destroyed
17 Kingdom Halls

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more than 2,500 of our brothers’ homes.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray for all of our brothers

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are affected by these disasters.

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:36.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we are grateful for the many volunteers

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:39.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are supporting disaster relief.

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:42.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
we also appreciate the generous donations

00:02:42.516 --> 00:02:45.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
that allow us to care
for the needs of our brothers

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are facing these terrible situations.

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:55.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
On September 27, 2024,

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:59.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
authorities in Eritrea raided a private home

00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:03.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
where a peaceful meeting
of Jehovah’s Witnesses was being held.

00:03:04.413 --> 00:03:09.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Initially, the police arrested
24 of our brothers and sisters,

00:03:09.334 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
including 2 minor children.

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:13.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, the children were released.

00:03:13.964 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
This raid occurred nearly 30 years

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:21.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the president of Eritrea
revoked the citizenship

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:25.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in 1994.

00:03:25.934 --> 00:03:28.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
This decree is still in force

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:31.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prevents the majority
of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:03:31.607 --> 00:03:34.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
from leading a normal life,

00:03:34.234 --> 00:03:37.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
owning property, running a business,

00:03:37.529 --> 00:03:40.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even finding employment.

00:03:40.074 --> 00:03:43.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Days after the raid,
the police arrested and imprisoned

00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:48.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
85-year-old Sister Letebrhan Tesfay.

00:03:48.207 --> 00:03:52.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Letebrhan
was one of the first in Eritrea

00:03:52.294 --> 00:03:55.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:55.047 --> 00:03:59.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was baptized in 1957.

00:03:59.343 --> 00:04:02.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eight of her children
and eight of her grandchildren

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
are serving Jehovah.

00:04:04.973 --> 00:04:09.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her daughter, Hadassa Zerisenay,
is imprisoned with her.

00:04:09.978 --> 00:04:12.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Saron Ghebru

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and her husband were also arrested.

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saron is about six months pregnant.

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:20.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saron’s brother, Henok,

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:24.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the longest-imprisoned brother
in Eritrea at this time.

00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:28.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was first arrested in January 2005.

00:04:28.747 --> 00:04:32.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
As of November 1,
64 of our brothers and sisters

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:35.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Eritrea are in prison.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray

00:04:37.172 --> 00:04:41.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the 223 brothers and sisters
around the world

00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:44.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are currently imprisoned for their faith.

00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:50.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the annual meeting on October 5, 2024,

00:04:50.144 --> 00:04:53.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a very exciting announcement:

00:04:53.522 --> 00:04:57.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Jody Jedele
and Jacob Rumph were appointed

00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:01.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve as members of the Governing Body.

00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:04.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy
to have them with us in the studio.

00:05:04.992 --> 00:05:08.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s spend a few minutes
getting better acquainted with them.

00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:11.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, brothers.

00:05:11.874 --> 00:05:15.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have so many questions
that we’d like to ask you.

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:18.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
But maybe you could help us
to know a little bit

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:21.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how you came to love Jehovah.

00:05:21.967 --> 00:05:25.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, what helped you
to come to know Jehovah

00:05:25.137 --> 00:05:27.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you wanted to serve him?

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:28.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Jedele.

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:30.601 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, I was raised in the truth.

00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:33.478 line:10% position:50% align:center
Dad was baptized in the 1940’s,

00:05:33.478 --> 00:05:34.897 line:10% position:50% align:center
and he served faithfully

00:05:34.897 --> 00:05:36.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
until he passed away.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Mom was baptized in the 1950’s.

00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:42.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
They loved Jehovah and his organization,

00:05:42.404 --> 00:05:44.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
so their love for Jehovah

00:05:44.406 --> 00:05:48.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped my sister and me
form a relationship with Jehovah as well.

00:05:48.327 --> 00:05:53.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I grew up and I learned the truth,
the truth just made sense.

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:56.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what really convinced me
that it was the best way of living

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the love among Jehovah’s people.

00:05:59.755 --> 00:06:02.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember during the summer vacations,

00:06:02.341 --> 00:06:05.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers and sisters
would come from around the country

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:07.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach in unassigned territory near us.

00:06:07.846 --> 00:06:11.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we didn’t know these friends
before they came,

00:06:11.183 --> 00:06:14.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when they arrived,
we were instant family,

00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:17.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was simply because we
all served Jehovah.

00:06:17.648 --> 00:06:19.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that had a real impression on me.

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:22.945 line:10% position:50% align:center
My parents were raised around the truth.

00:06:22.945 --> 00:06:25.739 line:10% position:50% align:center
However, my mother was inactive.

00:06:25.739 --> 00:06:27.574 line:10% position:50% align:center
And as I was growing up,

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:30.160 line:10% position:50% align:center
my father was also not a Witness.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we never really associated
with the congregation,

00:06:33.247 --> 00:06:36.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mother did teach us basic Bible truths.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:40.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew God’s name is Jehovah,
I knew that I should only pray to him,

00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:44.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I also knew that the earth
would be converted into a paradise.

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:49.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, when I would visit
my paternal grandmother once or twice a year

00:06:49.513 --> 00:06:51.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was a very faithful Witness,

00:06:51.807 --> 00:06:54.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really felt drawn to Jehovah by her

00:06:54.476 --> 00:06:57.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of her words
and her beautiful Christian qualities.

00:06:57.396 --> 00:07:00.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to know who Jehovah really was.

00:07:00.315 --> 00:07:04.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I was about 13 years old,
I asked my mother if I could study the Bible.

00:07:04.987 --> 00:07:07.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
I reasoned:
“Well, if this really is the truth,

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:10.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then I want to be
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:07:10.534 --> 00:07:14.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if it isn’t the truth,
well, then I still want to be a good person.”

00:07:15.163 --> 00:07:20.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, my mother had already
been wanting to come back to Jehovah,

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:22.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we progressed together.

00:07:23.422 --> 00:07:25.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon after my study started,

00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:29.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that this was the truth
that I was looking for.

00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:32.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother was reactivated,
and a month later,

00:07:32.014 --> 00:07:35.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was approved to be an unbaptized publisher.

00:07:35.017 --> 00:07:38.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’m happy to say that my
whole immediate family is in the truth,

00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:42.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they continue to be
an excellent example of faith for me.

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:47.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rumph, what motivated you
to pursue full-time service?

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:51.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say that the good example
of mature pioneers

00:07:51.366 --> 00:07:55.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made the pioneer service their career

00:07:55.037 --> 00:07:59.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as circuit overseers
who took an interest in me

00:07:59.041 --> 00:08:01.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
really had a big impact on me growing up.

00:08:01.877 --> 00:08:03.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how happy they were

00:08:03.879 --> 00:08:07.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the stories they had of serving
where the need was greater

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:11.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some of them even expanding
their service into distant lands.

00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:15.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
So all of that made me
really want to be a missionary.

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:19.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after high school,
I started in the pioneer service.

00:08:19.353 --> 00:08:22.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
My story is similar to Jake’s.

00:08:22.856 --> 00:08:26.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being around those
who enjoyed full-time service helped.

00:08:26.568 --> 00:08:29.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
our parents had the pioneer spirit.

00:08:29.196 --> 00:08:32.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
They both pioneered
until the children came along.

00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:37.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later, Mom was able to start pioneering
again, and she continues until now.

00:08:37.537 --> 00:08:41.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
During summer vacations,
we would auxiliary pioneer as a family.

00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:43.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d go in the ministry
with the circuit overseer.

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
And most summers,
we’d also visit Bethel.

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:50.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of those activities
helped us to see firsthand

00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:54.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
that full-time service
was simply a great way of life.

00:08:54.054 --> 00:08:57.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I finished high school,
I began pioneering

00:08:57.182 --> 00:08:59.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and later was invited to Bethel at 19.

00:08:59.434 --> 00:09:02.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
My sister and her husband
also served at Bethel.

00:09:02.312 --> 00:09:05.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have been some of your assignments
over the years,

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:08.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how have you benefited from them?

00:09:08.276 --> 00:09:10.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I was assigned
to the Cleaning Department

00:09:10.112 --> 00:09:11.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I came to Bethel at Wallkill,

00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:13.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was a great crew.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
We enjoyed working with each other.

00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
And working on different teams
and on rotating schedules

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:23.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me see the need
to be adaptable to get work done.

00:09:24.042 --> 00:09:26.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
About two and a half years later,
I was transferred to the office

00:09:26.711 --> 00:09:29.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I worked with staffing matters
and medical matters,

00:09:29.297 --> 00:09:33.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was even able to help missionaries
with medical care that they needed.

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:37.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, Damaris and I got married
and we were transferred to Brooklyn,

00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:40.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I also continued to work
with medical matters.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
We served in Brooklyn until 2005,

00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:46.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we left Bethel
to help take care of parents.

00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:50.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
We both pioneered, and I served
on the Hospital Liaison Committee

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on the Regional Building Committee.

00:09:52.237 --> 00:09:55.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
We came back to Bethel eight years later
for a two-week assignment

00:09:55.574 --> 00:09:57.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the Warwick construction project.

00:09:57.742 --> 00:09:59.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess it’s lasted a little bit longer.

00:09:59.744 --> 00:10:02.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve been at Bethel ever since.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2015, we were transferred to Patterson

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:09.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work with the newly formed
Local Design/Construction Department, or LDC.

00:10:10.422 --> 00:10:13.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2018, the LDC was moved to Wallkill.

00:10:13.467 --> 00:10:14.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we went full circle.

00:10:14.885 --> 00:10:17.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
We came back to where we started.

00:10:17.387 --> 00:10:21.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in 2021, I was assigned
to the Hospital Information Department.

00:10:21.933 --> 00:10:25.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 2022, we were transferred to Warwick

00:10:25.145 --> 00:10:27.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work with Hospital Information Services.

00:10:28.857 --> 00:10:31.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
In every assignment along the way,

00:10:31.693 --> 00:10:35.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s been a privilege to learn
from spiritual men and women.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the years,
it was faith-strengthening to see brothers

00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:42.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
who carried heavy theocratic responsibilities

00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:46.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
set the example of being kind and humble.

00:10:46.166 --> 00:10:49.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were glad to share their knowledge
with the rest of us.

00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:51.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we were outside of Bethel,

00:10:51.588 --> 00:10:55.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
we saw how hard parents worked
to raise their children in the truth

00:10:55.342 --> 00:10:59.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how the brothers and sisters
loved to support theocratic activities.

00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:03.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah truly has wonderful people,
and I treasure those examples.

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, as for me,
at the 1998 regional convention,

00:11:07.479 --> 00:11:10.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember
that there was a talk that highlighted

00:11:10.357 --> 00:11:14.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
several countries where
there was a need for pioneers,

00:11:14.069 --> 00:11:16.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one of those mentioned was Ecuador.

00:11:17.239 --> 00:11:18.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I prayed about it.

00:11:18.698 --> 00:11:22.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
I looked at my circumstances;
I did some investigation;

00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:25.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and after that convention,
I decided to write

00:11:25.038 --> 00:11:27.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Ecuador branch for information.

00:11:27.916 --> 00:11:31.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after visiting to check it out,
I was happy,

00:11:31.002 --> 00:11:33.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s help,
to be able to make the move.

00:11:33.797 --> 00:11:37.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the territory
was so amazing at that time.

00:11:37.676 --> 00:11:40.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many righthearted ones
were searching for the truth.

00:11:40.762 --> 00:11:44.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dream to serve in a missionary field
was becoming a reality.

00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:48.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, really, the greatest blessing for me
in serving in Ecuador

00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:51.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
was meeting my future wife, Inga.

00:11:51.731 --> 00:11:54.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then after marriage,
we continued serving

00:11:54.651 --> 00:11:57.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the need was great there in Ecuador.

00:11:58.113 --> 00:12:02.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several years later,
we were assigned as special pioneers,

00:12:02.534 --> 00:12:04.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually
we started in the circuit work,

00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:07.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
caring for a circuit that even included

00:12:07.455 --> 00:12:11.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
some congregations in the Amazon jungle,
and that was a lot of fun.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then in 2011, we were surprised

00:12:14.713 --> 00:12:19.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be invited to the 132nd class of Gilead,

00:12:19.134 --> 00:12:22.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was also a great privilege for us.

00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:26.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after Gilead,
our life has seen a lot of changes.

00:12:26.182 --> 00:12:28.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve served in different parts of the world

00:12:28.852 --> 00:12:32.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoyed many different privileges.

00:12:32.022 --> 00:12:34.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in all of these assignments,

00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:36.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we’ve really learned
is to just be content

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:40.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do our best with what Jehovah
allows us to do each day

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:44.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to not get too worried
about what we can’t control.

00:12:44.618 --> 00:12:47.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing that we’ve learned

00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:50.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that it’s never the place
that makes an assignment special,

00:12:50.624 --> 00:12:53.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s the people, really,
whom you get to serve with.

00:12:53.752 --> 00:12:57.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we love those precious friends so much.

00:12:57.756 --> 00:13:01.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a Scriptural thought
that has strengthened you

00:13:01.343 --> 00:13:03.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you begin this new assignment?

00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:06.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think for me,
the example of Joshua helps

00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:10.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what Jehovah told him
when he received a new assignment.

00:13:11.686 --> 00:13:16.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua had always been
a courageous servant of Jehovah for decades.

00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:18.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
He walked through the Red Sea,

00:13:18.026 --> 00:13:22.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
he led the Israelites in battle
against the Amalekites, he was a spy,

00:13:22.947 --> 00:13:27.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he helped Moses for years
in very difficult situations.

00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:32.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, at Joshua 1:9,
it’s interesting what Jehovah tells him.

00:13:32.415 --> 00:13:35.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tells him: “Have I not commanded you?

00:13:35.543 --> 00:13:38.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be courageous and strong.

00:13:38.171 --> 00:13:40.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be struck with terror or fear.”

00:13:40.674 --> 00:13:43.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
And next, Jehovah reminds Joshua

00:13:43.385 --> 00:13:45.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
of why he could take on his new assignment.

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tells him:

00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:50.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For Jehovah your God

00:13:50.225 --> 00:13:53.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
is with you wherever you go.”

00:13:54.521 --> 00:13:56.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s really the point.

00:13:56.523 --> 00:14:00.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is with us
as we take on new assignments.

00:14:00.193 --> 00:14:04.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look back and I know he helped me
on all the other assignments over the years.

00:14:04.572 --> 00:14:07.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I know he’ll help me
with this assignment too.

00:14:07.742 --> 00:14:10.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also like that Jehovah told Joshua

00:14:10.537 --> 00:14:12.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was with him.

00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:15.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was personal with Jehovah.

00:14:15.041 --> 00:14:17.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hasn’t changed.

00:14:17.001 --> 00:14:19.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s not about what I can do.

00:14:19.713 --> 00:14:23.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s about what he can do,
and Jehovah can do anything.

00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:27.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
He personally supports each of his servants.

00:14:27.303 --> 00:14:31.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I can trust that Jehovah
will be with me personally.

00:14:31.891 --> 00:14:35.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will help me care for the new assignment,
and that helps.

00:14:35.854 --> 00:14:40.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
I personally feel a lot like Gideon felt
when he received his assignment.

00:14:40.608 --> 00:14:42.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
He came from a normal background,

00:14:42.736 --> 00:14:46.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he didn’t think that he would really ever
be able to make much of a difference.

00:14:47.782 --> 00:14:51.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah, through an angel,
reminded him of an important fact.

00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:54.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Judges 6:14,

00:14:55.498 --> 00:14:56.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told him:

00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go with the strength you have,

00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:02.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will save Israel
out of Midian’s hand.

00:15:02.464 --> 00:15:05.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it not I who send you?”

00:15:05.258 --> 00:15:09.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reality is, with Gideon’s own strength,
he couldn’t do much.

00:15:09.596 --> 00:15:12.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah is basically telling Gideon,

00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:16.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You just bring what you have to offer,
and I’ll bring the rest.’

00:15:16.895 --> 00:15:20.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be honest,
the thought of serving in this capacity

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:22.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
was scary for me and my wife.

But we just want to try to imitate Gideon

00:15:26.362 --> 00:15:28.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to just do our best

00:15:28.448 --> 00:15:30.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let Jehovah make up the difference.

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:32.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
This work is his,

00:15:32.952 --> 00:15:36.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will make sure
that it continues successfully.

Thank you, brothers.

I remember 30 years ago when I first started
serving on the Governing Body,

00:15:43.505 --> 00:15:46.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had some of those feelings as well,

00:15:46.508 --> 00:15:49.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I know He’ll help you too.

00:15:49.761 --> 00:15:53.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so happy to have you
on the Governing Body!

00:15:53.515 --> 00:15:56.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we wish you Jehovah’s blessing

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your new assignment.

00:15:59.979 --> 00:16:03.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we continue to pray for all of you.

00:16:03.358 --> 00:16:06.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you all very much.
