WEBVTT

00:01.752 --> 00:03.754
As Jehovah’s people, 


00:03.753 --> 00:05.755
we enjoy many undeserved


00:05.755 --> 00:07.757
and precious privileges. 


00:07.757 --> 00:11.194
Among them, we bear Jehovah’s name


00:11.193 --> 00:13.896
and render him sacred service. 


00:13.897 --> 00:16.365
As we carry out his will, 


00:16.365 --> 00:20.603
he dignifies us in a very special way. 


00:20.603 --> 00:25.341
At 1 Corinthians 3:9,
the apostle Paul under inspiration


00:25.342 --> 00:30.000
stated that “we are God’s fellow workers.”


00:31.013 --> 00:34.783
What an honor to be a fellow worker
with the Universal Sovereign,


00:34.783 --> 00:37.786
our loving heavenly Father! 


00:37.787 --> 00:41.324
To build appreciation for the privilege
of working with Jehovah, 


00:41.323 --> 00:46.000
we’re going to review events
in the life of Jonathan, a son of King Saul. 


00:47.563 --> 00:51.868
First Samuel 14:45 
describes Jonathan when it says:


00:51.868 --> 00:55.000
“For it was with God
that he acted this day.” 


00:56.272 --> 00:59.000
What was the background
that led to this statement? 


01:00.008 --> 01:04.000
How did Jonathan act, or work,
with Jehovah on that day? 


01:05.047 --> 01:09.352
What lessons can we learn
from their working relationship? 


01:09.352 --> 01:13.000
And what blessings result
from being a fellow worker with God?


01:14.557 --> 01:17.000
Let us begin with some background. 


01:18.528 --> 01:22.131
First Samuel 12:20 


01:22.132 --> 01:24.234
records the encouraging words 


01:24.233 --> 01:27.770
spoken by the prophet Samuel 
to the nation of Israel: 


01:27.770 --> 01:29.872
“Do not be afraid.  . . .


01:29.872 --> 01:33.242
“Only do not turn away
from following Jehovah, 


01:33.242 --> 01:36.112
and serve Jehovah 
with all your heart.” 


01:36.112 --> 01:38.247
Verse 22 adds:


01:38.247 --> 01:40.950
“For the sake of his great name, 


01:40.950 --> 01:43.000
Jehovah will not abandon his people.” 


01:44.320 --> 01:46.488
As long as they remained faithful, 


01:46.488 --> 01:52.695
Jehovah would always be there to guide,
protect, and rescue them. 


01:52.695 --> 01:56.732
These words no doubt strengthened
Jonathan to carry out Jehovah’s directive


01:56.732 --> 01:58.902
to subdue the enemy nations


01:58.902 --> 02:01.000
and take possession of the Promised Land.


02:02.772 --> 02:05.375
At  1 Samuel chapter 13, 


02:05.375 --> 02:08.978
we read that Jonathan 
was assigned 1,000 men


02:08.978 --> 02:11.000
to attack a Philistine garrison at Geba. 


02:12.882 --> 02:17.000
Although poorly equipped,
Jonathan and his men succeeded. 


02:18.053 --> 02:21.690
This victory strengthened 
Jonathan’s confidence in Jehovah


02:21.690 --> 02:24.000
and provides a valuable lesson for us: 


02:25.528 --> 02:27.530
While we gain strength and courage


02:27.530 --> 02:30.567
from Jehovah’s reassuring
words of the Scriptures, 


02:30.567 --> 02:34.637
our confidence in Jehovah’s support
becomes even stronger


02:34.637 --> 02:37.674
when we successfully
carry out our assignments 


02:37.673 --> 02:40.000
that may seem overwhelming.


02:41.377 --> 02:43.714
The account then relates
how the Philistines


02:43.713 --> 02:48.000
were infuriated over their defeat
and mounted a massive counterattack. 


02:49.152 --> 02:51.154
They sent out raiding parties 


02:51.153 --> 02:54.556
from their camp 
at Michmash near Jerusalem. 


02:54.557 --> 02:56.860
Many Israelite men hid out of fear, 


02:56.860 --> 03:00.000
and some even fled
to the other side of the Jordan River.


03:01.497 --> 03:05.000
In contrast,
Jonathan remained courageous. 


03:06.402 --> 03:08.939
Determined to put a stop to the raids, 


03:08.938 --> 03:11.440
he confronted the Philistine outpost


03:11.440 --> 03:14.000
at the ravine pass of Michmash. 


03:15.010 --> 03:20.483
The approach was by way of a deep gorge
with nearly vertical cliffs. 


03:20.483 --> 03:25.421
This would have seemed next to impossible
to someone unfamiliar with the area, 


03:25.422 --> 03:30.000
but Jonathan grew up in this territory
and apparently knew it well.


03:31.627 --> 03:35.000
His knowledge of the surroundings
provides another practical lesson:


03:36.565 --> 03:39.602
Whatever theocratic assignment
we may be given,


03:39.602 --> 03:43.505
putting forth time and effort 
to get to know the terrain, 


03:43.505 --> 03:47.410
so to speak,
will contribute to our effectiveness. 


03:47.410 --> 03:49.912
When we show interest
in our assigned work, 


03:49.912 --> 03:53.000
we become even more effective
fellow workers of Jehovah.


03:54.817 --> 03:59.000
Let’s read as Jonathan prepares
to take action against the Philistines. 


04:00.590 --> 04:03.225
First Samuel 14:6 states:


04:03.225 --> 04:05.928
“So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer:


04:05.928 --> 04:10.766
“‘Come and let us cross over 
to the outpost of these uncircumcised men. 


04:10.767 --> 04:13.770
“‘Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf, 


04:13.770 --> 04:19.542
for nothing can hinder Jehovah
from saving by many or by few.’”


04:19.542 --> 04:22.000
What contributed
to his confidence in Jehovah? 


04:23.312 --> 04:26.682
Recall that he put faith
in Jehovah’s reassuring words


04:26.682 --> 04:30.620
through the prophet Samuel: 
“Do not be afraid. . . . 


04:30.620 --> 04:35.000
For the sake of his great name,
Jehovah will not abandon his people.” 


04:36.892 --> 04:38.962
He experienced Jehovah’s support 


04:38.962 --> 04:42.000
when he struck down
the Philistine garrison at Geba. 


04:43.398 --> 04:46.000
Jonathan could also
think back on Israel’s history. 


04:47.370 --> 04:50.407
He could reflect
on how Gideon and his 300 men


04:50.407 --> 04:55.812
were victorious over 135,000 Midianites. 


04:55.812 --> 04:59.949
He could meditate
on Samson killing 1,000 Philistines


04:59.948 --> 05:02.000
with the jawbone of a donkey. 


05:03.687 --> 05:06.689
Such examples 
would bolster his confidence


05:06.688 --> 05:10.000
that he was working 
with the Almighty God, Jehovah.


05:12.262 --> 05:16.565
We too can meditate on fellow workers
of God recorded in the Scriptures


05:16.565 --> 05:21.870
as well as published life stories
of modern-day faithful servants. 


05:21.870 --> 05:25.007
Such examples
reinforce our faith in Jehovah


05:25.007 --> 05:28.000
as we rely on him for success.


05:29.545 --> 05:33.148
Another lesson comes from the response
of Jonathan’s armor-bearer


05:33.148 --> 05:36.018
at 1 Samuel 14:7: 


05:36.018 --> 05:38.855
“At this his armor-bearer said to him:


05:38.855 --> 05:42.058
“‘Do whatever your heart impels you to do. 


05:42.058 --> 05:44.293
“‘Turn wherever you wish, 


05:44.293 --> 05:48.663
and I will follow you 
wherever your heart impels you.’”


05:48.663 --> 05:50.866
It is unlikely that the attendant


05:50.867 --> 05:53.000
would have initiated
this challenging mission on his own. 


05:54.903 --> 05:59.000
Jonathan’s confident lead was a positive, 
motivating influence on the man. 


06:01.243 --> 06:04.180
What happens today
when elders and overseers


06:04.180 --> 06:09.818
take the lead and display zeal
in Jehovah’s work like Jonathan? 


06:09.818 --> 06:15.000
Others in the congregation are also
motivated to action by their fine example.


06:16.692 --> 06:19.595
Let us now read verses 8-10:


06:19.595 --> 06:22.065
“Then Jonathan said:


06:22.065 --> 06:26.735
“‘We will cross over to those men
and reveal our presence to them. 


06:26.735 --> 06:31.107
“‘If they say to us,
“Stand still until we come to you!” 


06:31.107 --> 06:34.344
“‘we will stand where we are
and not go up to them. 


06:34.343 --> 06:37.913
“‘But if they say, “Come up against us!” 


06:37.913 --> 06:42.685
“‘we will go up, because Jehovah 
will give them into our hand. 


06:42.685 --> 06:45.522
This will be our sign.’”


06:45.522 --> 06:49.000
Jonathan once again demonstrated
humble reliance on Jehovah.


06:50.292 --> 06:52.295
Later in Second Samuel, 


06:52.295 --> 06:55.498
Jonathan is described
as “swifter than the eagles”


06:55.498 --> 06:58.466
and “mightier than the lions.” 


06:58.467 --> 07:02.505
However, these qualities
and abilities did not cause him


07:02.505 --> 07:06.542
to be self-reliant or overconfident. 


07:06.542 --> 07:10.000
He sought Jehovah’s direction
by means of a sign. 


07:11.713 --> 07:14.483
What a powerful reminder for us! 


07:14.483 --> 07:17.386
Regardless of any natural abilities,


07:17.387 --> 07:20.690
acquired skills,
or experience we may have,


07:20.690 --> 07:25.000
the key to success is seeking
Jehovah’s guidance and support. 


07:26.095 --> 07:29.498
We seek his direction
through specific prayers, 


07:29.498 --> 07:32.100
Bible reading and meditation, 


07:32.100 --> 07:36.000
and applying direction
from “the faithful and discreet slave.” 


07:37.273 --> 07:40.543
We also consult 
with longtime faithful brothers and sisters 


07:40.543 --> 07:44.000
who can share their rich experience
as God’s fellow workers.


07:49.285 --> 07:52.000
What else can we learn
from Jonathan’s account? 


07:53.588 --> 07:57.726
Picking up at 1 Samuel 14:12, 


07:57.727 --> 08:02.000
Jonathan and his armor-bearer
advance toward the Philistines. 


08:03.132 --> 08:07.437
From their elevated location,
the Philistines shout to them: 


08:07.437 --> 08:11.374
“‘Come up to us,
and we will teach you a lesson!’ 


08:11.373 --> 08:14.776
“At once Jonathan said to his armor-bearer:


08:14.777 --> 08:19.000
“‘Follow me, for Jehovah will give them
into the hand of Israel.’”


08:20.382 --> 08:24.620
Jonathan had requested a specific sign,
and he got it. 


08:24.620 --> 08:28.925
But it meant advancing 
up a steep and treacherous incline 


08:28.925 --> 08:31.000
right into enemy hands. 


08:32.060 --> 08:35.665
Someone lacking complete trust 
in Jehovah might have said,


08:35.665 --> 08:40.502
“Before proceeding,
perhaps we should ask for another sign,” 


08:40.502 --> 08:42.939
but not Jonathan. 


08:42.938 --> 08:46.508
Without hesitation,
he told his attendant to follow him 


08:46.508 --> 08:50.746
because Jehovah would give
the enemy into their hand. 


08:50.747 --> 08:53.049
When we receive Jehovah’s direction, 


08:53.048 --> 08:56.851
we should without hesitation
put our hearts into the work, 


08:56.852 --> 08:59.000
confident of Jehovah’s backing.


09:00.557 --> 09:02.559
What happened next? 


09:02.558 --> 09:07.430
First Samuel 14:13, 14 reports:


09:07.430 --> 09:11.667
“And Jonathan climbed up
on his hands and feet, 


09:11.667 --> 09:14.604
“and his armor-bearer was behind him;


09:14.603 --> 09:18.040
“and the Philistines began
to fall before Jonathan,


09:18.040 --> 09:21.477
“and his armor-bearer was putting 
them to death behind him. 


09:21.477 --> 09:25.280
“In the first attack that Jonathan
and his armor-bearer made,


09:25.280 --> 09:28.817
they struck down about 20 men.” 


09:28.817 --> 09:31.820
Even after receiving
a clear sign from Jehovah, 


09:31.820 --> 09:33.822
it took great effort. 


09:33.822 --> 09:37.260
They had to ‘climb up
on their hands and feet,’


09:37.260 --> 09:41.797
exerting themselves
vigorously over rugged terrain. 


09:41.797 --> 09:43.832
The lesson? 


09:43.832 --> 09:48.437
Even when we receive clear direction
and are ready to obey, 


09:48.437 --> 09:52.942
carrying out our assignments
will not always be easy. 


09:52.942 --> 09:55.410
We have to exert ourselves vigorously, 


09:55.410 --> 10:00.000
being willing to work hard 
with all of our mind, heart, and strength.


10:02.017 --> 10:06.922
How did the Philistines react to seeing
Jehovah’s support for his people? 


10:06.922 --> 10:09.359
First Samuel 14:15 reads:


10:09.358 --> 10:12.661
“Then terror spread in the field camp 


10:12.662 --> 10:15.230
“and among all the people of the outpost, 


10:15.230 --> 10:18.500
“and even the raiding parties were terrified. 


10:18.500 --> 10:23.000
The earth began quaking, 
and a terror from God ensued.”


10:24.040 --> 10:28.310
The earthquake Jehovah caused
melted the Philistines’ hearts. 


10:28.310 --> 10:32.748
Soon, the Israelites, even those 
who had previously fled in fear,


10:32.748 --> 10:36.000
joined the victory battle
over the Philistines. 


10:37.018 --> 10:41.356
Likewise, when we put our hearts 
into theocratic assignments,


10:41.357 --> 10:45.060
Jehovah, our best Fellow Worker,


10:45.060 --> 10:50.000
will always come through with whatever
we need to accomplish his will.


10:51.100 --> 10:55.805
But there is another lesson to be learned
from this exciting Bible account. 


10:55.805 --> 10:57.807
During the height of the battle, 


10:57.807 --> 11:01.000
King Saul gave an unwise order saying:


11:02.077 --> 11:05.715
“Cursed is the man who eats
any food before the evening


11:05.715 --> 11:09.000
and until I have taken 
vengeance on my enemies!” 


11:10.218 --> 11:14.156
Jonathan, however, was not aware
of his father’s order


11:14.157 --> 11:17.000
and ate some wild honey 
that he had found.


11:18.293 --> 11:24.833
How did Saul react when he discovered
that his own son had disobeyed him? 


11:24.833 --> 11:29.438
First Samuel 14:43, 44 tells us: 


11:29.438 --> 11:32.340
“Then Saul said to Jonathan:


11:32.340 --> 11:35.143
“‘Tell me, what have you done?’ 


11:35.143 --> 11:37.680
“So Jonathan told him:


11:37.680 --> 11:42.985
“‘I merely tasted a little honey
on the tip of the staff in my hand. 


11:42.985 --> 11:46.488
“Here I am! 
I am ready to die!’ 


11:46.488 --> 11:48.690
“At this Saul said:


11:48.690 --> 11:51.893
“‘Thus may God do and may he add to it


11:51.893 --> 11:54.963
if you do not die, Jonathan.’”


11:54.963 --> 11:58.433
Imagine, after all that Jonathan had done


11:58.433 --> 12:01.436
in risking his life in behalf of his people


12:01.437 --> 12:04.640
and seeing Jehovah grant so much success, 


12:04.640 --> 12:09.000
he is now being condemned
to death by his own father. 


12:10.045 --> 12:13.715
How his heart must have sank in disbelief, 


12:13.715 --> 12:17.000
disappointment, and sadness!


12:18.453 --> 12:22.123
Would Jehovah now abandon 
his loyal fellow worker? 


12:22.123 --> 12:25.726
First Samuel 14:45 reads:


12:25.727 --> 12:28.730
“But the people said to Saul: 


12:28.730 --> 12:30.933
“‘Should Jonathan die


12:30.933 --> 12:33.868
“‘—the one who brought
this great victory to Israel? 


12:33.868 --> 12:35.871
“‘It is unthinkable! 


12:35.872 --> 12:38.374
“‘As surely as Jehovah is alive, 


12:38.373 --> 12:41.610
“‘not even a single hair of his head
should fall to the ground, 


12:41.610 --> 12:45.000
“for it was with God that he acted this day.’ 


12:46.515 --> 12:51.987
With that the people rescued Jonathan,
and he did not die.” 


12:51.987 --> 12:55.792
Jonathan’s success
provided undeniable evidence


12:55.792 --> 12:58.000
that he was truly Jehovah’s fellow worker. 


12:59.495 --> 13:03.398
Jehovah, who had been
at Jonathan’s side the whole time, 


13:03.398 --> 13:05.801
saw everything that had happened


13:05.802 --> 13:10.000
and would not allow his loyal worker
to die at Saul’s hands.


13:11.573 --> 13:15.845
How comforting to know that when we
faithfully carry out our assignments,


13:15.845 --> 13:19.715
he will never forget our zealous efforts! 


13:19.715 --> 13:22.050
If someone as close as a father


13:22.050 --> 13:25.922
fails to see and appreciate 
the work we do in Jehovah’s service


13:25.922 --> 13:30.000
or even turns against us,
Jehovah will never forget our work. 


13:31.627 --> 13:34.095
He will always be there to guide, 


13:34.095 --> 13:38.933
support, protect, and bless us.


13:38.933 --> 13:40.936
What a faith-building account 


13:40.937 --> 13:44.000
we’ve considered 
in 1 Samuel chapters 13 and 14! 


13:45.407 --> 13:49.479
Why not take the time
to read these chapters for yourself? 


13:49.478 --> 13:53.615
You’ll be moved to imitate
Jonathan’s excellent example of loyalty,


13:53.615 --> 13:56.000
courage, and obedience. 


13:57.485 --> 14:02.490
We want to be described 
just as Jonathan was at 1 Samuel 14:45:


14:02.490 --> 14:06.000
“For it was with God
that he acted this day.” 


14:07.262 --> 14:10.765
By continuing 
as industrious fellow workers with Jehovah, 


14:10.765 --> 14:13.868
we are assured
that ‘through faith and patience 


14:13.868 --> 14:22.828
we will inherit the promised reward.’
