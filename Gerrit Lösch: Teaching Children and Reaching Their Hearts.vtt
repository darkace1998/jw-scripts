00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:03.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we will talk about those

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are close to all of our hearts

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:09.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our children.

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.095 line:10% position:50% align:center
I am sure that you dear parents

00:00:12.095 --> 00:00:15.331 line:10% position:50% align:center
greatly love and appreciate your children.

00:00:15.331 --> 00:00:18.435 line:10% position:50% align:center
What a privilege it is to have them!

00:00:19.536 --> 00:00:23.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about it: There are millions of angels.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:27.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, angels were not given
the privilege to produce children.

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:32.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jesus was on earth, he was not married,

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:36.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he did not have the privilege
of having children.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you parents have that privilege.

00:00:38.922 --> 00:00:41.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a treasure!

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:46.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does the Governing Body
want to tell you children?

00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:48.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
That we love you!

00:00:48.932 --> 00:00:52.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so happy to have you with us,

00:00:52.168 --> 00:00:56.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we would like to help you
to become and remain

00:00:56.005 --> 00:00:58.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
worshippers of Jehovah.

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:00.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are like a beautiful gift,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
a special gift, from Jehovah.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christian parents value and appreciate
you children

00:01:07.083 --> 00:01:09.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than a million dollars!

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:11.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know?

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:16.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Psalm 127:3 says

00:01:16.793 --> 00:01:21.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “[children] are
an inheritance from Jehovah.”

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:23.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:27.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
An inheritance is a very valuable gift

00:01:27.604 --> 00:01:30.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has been given to someone.

00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:33.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, the gift is
from an older family relative.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:39.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah views you children
as a very valuable gift

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:42.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he has given to your parents.

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:46.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
He expects parents
to take good care of this gift.

00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:52.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
He entrusts parents with the welfare
and happiness of their children.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when parents do their best for you,

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:02.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
it especially makes us happy
when you children

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:05.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
do your best to please and serve Jehovah.

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:09.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many children earth wide

00:02:09.145 --> 00:02:11.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are fine examples for others

00:02:11.781 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of their love
for Jehovah and the truth.

00:02:17.187 --> 00:02:20.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, will your children
become good examples

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
for other young ones in the truth?

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
One father of seven children,
all of whom grew up as lovers of Jehovah,

00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:31.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
would always tell new parents

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there are no guarantees with children.

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:37.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
They each have their own personality

00:02:37.073 --> 00:02:41.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are exposed
to various outside influences.

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:45.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he would always urge new parents
to do the best they can

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:48.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach their children
and reach their hearts.

00:02:49.552 --> 00:02:52.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your conscientious effort
increases the possibility

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:56.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
of them becoming
a success in Jehovah’s service.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
So parents, how are you caring

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your “inheritance”?

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:05.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some vital steps

00:03:05.635 --> 00:03:08.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach and reach the heart of your child?

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, please locate

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judges 13:8.

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:21.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parents of Samson likely prayed often

00:03:21.184 --> 00:03:24.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s help
to properly raise their son.

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:27.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says:

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:33.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Manoah pleaded with Jehovah and said:
‘Pardon me, Jehovah.

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:37.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Please let the man of the true God
whom you just sent

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘come again to instruct us

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what we should do
with the child who will be born.’”

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:47.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you parents do the same,

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:52.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will answer your prayers
through the Scriptures, Bible literature,

00:03:52.382 --> 00:03:55.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
or possibly by means
of a congregation meeting.

00:03:56.286 --> 00:03:59.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, being consistent
with family worship

00:03:59.789 --> 00:04:04.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
is vital to reach the heart of one’s child.

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:07.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is true that it takes some planning

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
and absorbs some of your time each week.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember that in 2008,

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body gave us all

00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
the extra time each week for family worship

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:22.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
by adjusting the weekly meeting schedule.

00:04:24.013 --> 00:04:26.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother from Portugal wrote:

00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:28.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Aside from family worship,

00:04:28.251 --> 00:04:31.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
“my father had a separate Bible study
on a different day

00:04:31.754 --> 00:04:34.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with each of us three children.

00:04:34.524 --> 00:04:37.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am sure that these studies
were very important

00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to resist
all of the pressures at school.”

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is no surprise that all three children

00:04:45.234 --> 00:04:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been in special full-time service
for a number of years now.

00:04:51.374 --> 00:04:54.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, a brother
from northern Italy wrote:

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:59.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We studied with each one of our children
personally

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:02.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony with their age and gender.”

00:05:03.186 --> 00:05:07.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each family head must decide
what is best for his family.

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:11.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, a well-prepared
Family Worship program

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:13.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
is essential.

00:05:14.697 --> 00:05:19.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another excellent way to teach your children
is by example.

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Children often pick up mannerisms

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their parents.

00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:26.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
They often walk and talk

00:05:26.242 --> 00:05:28.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
like one of the parents.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:33.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they also pick up
on godly personality traits and attitudes.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be the kind of person
that you want your child to be.

00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:43.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though Jesus was the only perfect child
ever born on earth,

00:05:43.526 --> 00:05:47.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
it appears that his mother, Mary,
and adoptive father, Joseph,

00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:50.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
were good examples for him.

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:54.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 2:41, 42

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:58.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us that Jesus’ parents
“were accustomed to go from year to year

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jerusalem for . . . the Passover.”

00:06:03.046 --> 00:06:05.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph could have viewed the trip

00:06:05.048 --> 00:06:08.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
as inconvenient and even too expensive.

00:06:08.518 --> 00:06:12.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as parents, he and Mary
set a good example

00:06:12.221 --> 00:06:14.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the young boy Jesus.

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most young ones can quote
1 Corinthians 15:33 by heart.

00:06:21.664 --> 00:06:24.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it is because their parents
have reminded them

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:27.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the principle so often.

00:06:27.603 --> 00:06:32.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Bad associations spoil useful habits.”

00:06:33.943 --> 00:06:37.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember in Luke chapter 8
that Jesus spoke

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:39.649 line:10% position:50% align:center
about the different kinds of soil

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.319 line:10% position:50% align:center
that “the word of God” might fall on?

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:46.656 line:10% position:50% align:center
The “soil” represents your child’s heart.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our hope and prayer
that your child’s heart

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
is like “good,” or “fine,” soil.

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:58.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 15,

00:06:58.534 --> 00:07:02.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus applied the illustration
of the fine soil,

00:07:02.371 --> 00:07:03.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying:

00:07:03.739 --> 00:07:06.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These are the ones who,

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:09.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“after hearing the word
with a fine and good heart,

00:07:09.378 --> 00:07:12.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
retain it and bear fruit with endurance.”

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:18.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what can happen if after responding
to your training from God’s Word,

00:07:18.387 --> 00:07:22.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
your child is somehow exposed
to bad association?

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:27.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
When young ones spend considerable time
with other young ones

00:07:27.563 --> 00:07:30.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have not been trained
by Bible principles,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can counteract
your training from God’s Word.

00:07:35.004 --> 00:07:38.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such association is like a severe rainstorm

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:43.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
that erodes the fine soil
that you have built up.

00:07:43.546 --> 00:07:47.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can quickly wash away
the good training that you have given.

00:07:48.518 --> 00:07:52.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 1:1 says that we can be happy

00:07:52.421 --> 00:07:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we do not “walk” with, “stand” with,

00:07:56.192 --> 00:08:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “sit” with those who do what is bad.

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:02.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we could add to that

00:08:02.532 --> 00:08:06.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and do not text or email others

00:08:06.369 --> 00:08:09.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
who do not think wholesome thoughts.

00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:13.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help your children to choose good associates.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:17.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many young ones around the world

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:20.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
have responded
to their parents’ fine instruction

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:24.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
and express themselves from the heart.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:28.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me share a few experiences
that demonstrate this.

00:08:29.392 --> 00:08:34.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
One young person from the United States
wrote in saying:

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am 11 years old,

00:08:36.966 --> 00:08:39.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I am an unbaptized publisher.

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:43.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can’t thank you enough
for all that you do!

00:08:43.005 --> 00:08:46.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I especially appreciate
all the time and effort you put

00:08:46.909 --> 00:08:50.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“into the Caleb and Sophia videos.

00:08:50.713 --> 00:08:52.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I love these videos.

00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:56.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They help me to show good conduct at school.

00:08:56.786 --> 00:09:00.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am grateful that you encourage
family worship.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see, I used to have
doubts about Jehovah.

00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:07.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If it were not for the time
at family worship,

00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:12.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I probably would have drifted more and more.

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:15.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I love Jehovah and want to serve him,

00:09:15.671 --> 00:09:18.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I still have lots to work on.

00:09:18.975 --> 00:09:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I hope you will make more videos
to help me and other young ones

00:09:23.379 --> 00:09:27.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve Jehovah with our whole heart
and whole soul.”

00:09:29.952 --> 00:09:32.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received this message:

00:09:32.154 --> 00:09:35.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hi, I am ten years old.

00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I just wanted to say thank you!

00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:41.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I grow up, I want to work in Bethel

00:09:41.163 --> 00:09:45.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because I love Jehovah
and want to make him happy.

00:09:45.434 --> 00:09:49.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In Paradise, I want to open a zoo
without cages.

00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:52.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sending all my love!”

00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:57.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall I once met an eight-year-old girl
in Denver, Colorado,

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was baptized at eight years of age.

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:05.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
By that time, she had read
the entire Bible through twice.

00:10:06.322 --> 00:10:09.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, each child is unique;

00:10:09.392 --> 00:10:12.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
not all children become mature
at the same rate

00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:14.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
or at the same point in life.

00:10:14.964 --> 00:10:16.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may recall that we read

00:10:16.966 --> 00:10:20.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 127:3 earlier,

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:25.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
which said that “[children] are
an inheritance from Jehovah.”

00:10:26.642 --> 00:10:29.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the next verse, number 4:

00:10:29.645 --> 00:10:33.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like arrows in the hand of a mighty man,

00:10:33.049 --> 00:10:35.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
so are the sons of one’s youth.”

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:39.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Children are likened to “arrows”

00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:42.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
that should be aimed at a target.

00:10:42.191 --> 00:10:46.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
An archer cannot recall an arrow
once it leaves his bow.

00:10:46.962 --> 00:10:49.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents have “arrows.”

00:10:49.098 --> 00:10:52.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have their children to aim at the target

00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:55.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a relatively brief time.

00:10:55.838 --> 00:10:57.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is the target?

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:00.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the goal?

00:11:00.142 --> 00:11:04.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
For your children to become
wholesome, dedicated,

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
and baptized servants of Jehovah.

00:11:08.351 --> 00:11:12.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, arrows can be made
from different materials,

00:11:12.221 --> 00:11:14.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they can vary in size.

00:11:14.423 --> 00:11:16.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents must remember

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:20.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no two children are precisely alike.

00:11:20.596 --> 00:11:22.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some have a good measure

00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:26.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
of mental and emotional maturity
at a young age

00:11:26.669 --> 00:11:30.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
and express a desire to get baptized.

00:11:30.473 --> 00:11:34.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others may not be ready for baptism
until they are a bit older.

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:38.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, discerning parents

00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:41.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not pressure their children
to get baptized.

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, they assist each child

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
in keeping with his or her own growth
and spiritual progress.

00:11:50.559 --> 00:11:53.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is also true that some parents

00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
underestimate their children.

00:11:55.531 --> 00:12:00.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some hold them back
from dedicating their life to Jehovah,

00:12:00.403 --> 00:12:02.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they have developed

00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:06.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
a close relationship with Him as a youngster.

00:12:07.443 --> 00:12:11.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received this comment
from a sister in Russia:

00:12:11.013 --> 00:12:15.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you very much
for taking care of younger ones.

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:19.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I particularly appreciate your support.

00:12:19.088 --> 00:12:21.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your loving words inspire me.

00:12:21.757 --> 00:12:23.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am 17.

00:12:23.793 --> 00:12:26.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am invigorated by articles and videos

00:12:26.929 --> 00:12:29.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which are prepared by you.

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:33.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your work and love bring me to tears.

00:12:33.335 --> 00:12:36.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you very much!

00:12:36.772 --> 00:12:41.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am touched by your affectionate care
of us here in Russia.

00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:46.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your warm words and prayers
are the best comfort for us.

00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:48.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am grateful to you.

00:12:48.651 --> 00:12:51.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thanks to your taking care of me,

00:12:51.053 --> 00:12:54.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was able to begin pioneering
two years ago.

00:12:54.089 --> 00:12:57.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s the best life ever.

00:12:57.092 --> 00:12:59.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am happy.

00:12:59.094 --> 00:13:01.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can’t be silent.

00:13:01.096 --> 00:13:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m filled with gratitude.”

00:13:04.099 --> 00:13:06.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once commented:

00:13:06.402 --> 00:13:10.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It has been said that raising children
is a 20-year project,

00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:14.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
but parents never really stop being parents.”

00:13:15.744 --> 00:13:19.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among the very best things
you can give to your children

00:13:19.982 --> 00:13:24.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
are love, time, and Bible-based training

00:13:24.587 --> 00:13:28.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, endeavoring to reach their hearts.

00:13:28.858 --> 00:13:33.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Admittedly, each child
will respond differently to the training.

00:13:34.296 --> 00:13:38.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, many who have been raised
by parents that love Jehovah

00:13:38.667 --> 00:13:42.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel like Joanna Mae, a sister in Asia.

00:13:42.571 --> 00:13:43.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says:

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:47.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Looking back on the training
I received from my parents,

00:13:47.943 --> 00:13:50.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am so thankful that they disciplined me

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:54.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and taught me to love Jehovah.

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They did not just give me life,

00:13:56.352 --> 00:13:59.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
they gave me a meaningful life.”

00:14:00.723 --> 00:14:03.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are millions of adult Christians

00:14:03.759 --> 00:14:07.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would express similar sentiments
of appreciation.

00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:13.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, take care of your inheritance,
your precious children,

00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:17.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
by training them and reaching their heart.
