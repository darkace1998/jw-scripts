00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:02.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:04.525 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re going to discuss

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:06.486 line:10% position:50% align:center
the importance of setting personal goals

00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:07.987 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the ministry.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:11.324 line:10% position:50% align:center
But first, here are some updates.

00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:14.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
On January 1 of this year,

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
a magnitude 7.6 earthquake

00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:18.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
struck central Japan.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, none of our brothers were killed.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
But over 100 of their homes were damaged,

00:00:29.593 --> 00:00:31.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 2 were destroyed.

00:00:33.431 --> 00:00:36.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, nine Kingdom Halls were damaged.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:38.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch office

00:00:38.978 --> 00:00:42.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
quickly provided accommodations
and other necessities

00:00:42.232 --> 00:00:43.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our brothers and sisters.

00:00:44.192 --> 00:00:46.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon after, the branch appointed

00:00:46.653 --> 00:00:48.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Disaster Relief Committee

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sent branch representatives

00:00:51.408 --> 00:00:54.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
to visit our brothers in the affected areas.

00:00:54.495 --> 00:00:57.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within just a few days,
additional relief aid

00:00:57.831 --> 00:01:00.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
was delivered
to congregations in need.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:02.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Wajima Congregation,

00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:06.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders couldn’t account for one sister.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
To reach her, an elder walked

00:01:08.468 --> 00:01:11.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
for eight hours,
avoiding landslides

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:13.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cracks in the ground,
until he was able

00:01:13.598 --> 00:01:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
to confirm that she was safe.

00:01:17.185 --> 00:01:18.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Congregations in the area,

00:01:18.687 --> 00:01:22.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
including those severely affected,
have held their meetings

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the very week the earthquake hit.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:28.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of the publishers
have gathered in person

00:01:28.072 --> 00:01:30.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage one another.

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:33.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re praying
for our brothers and sisters in Japan

00:01:33.202 --> 00:01:37.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in other lands
affected by recent disasters.

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:42.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
On January 1, the Patterson Visitors’ Center

00:01:42.295 --> 00:01:45.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
officially opened for tours!

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:47.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Construction began in early 2021

00:01:47.926 --> 00:01:51.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was completed in September 2023.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will you experience
when you come for a visit?

00:01:54.767 --> 00:01:56.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a look!

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Patterson Visitors’ Center
features three museums and a coin display.

00:02:12.202 --> 00:02:14.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first exhibit you’ll notice is entitled

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:17.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Defending and Legally Establishing
the Good News.”

00:02:18.417 --> 00:02:20.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
It presents the powerful experiences

00:02:20.627 --> 00:02:22.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
of men, women, and even schoolchildren

00:02:22.754 --> 00:02:26.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
who held to their Bible-based beliefs
despite legal opposition.

00:02:27.051 --> 00:02:29.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
This exhibit shows how Jehovah’s organization

00:02:29.512 --> 00:02:32.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
supported them through difficult tests.

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Biblical coin gallery

00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:37.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
presents a unique display of original coins

00:02:37.812 --> 00:02:40.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were in circulation
in the first century,

00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:42.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with their Scriptural context

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and significance.

00:02:44.235 --> 00:02:45.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another exhibit,

00:02:45.487 --> 00:02:49.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “All Your Sons
Will Be Taught by Jehovah,”

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:52.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
features some of the training programs
and schools that have been used

00:02:52.578 --> 00:02:54.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Jehovah’s modern-day organization

00:02:54.621 --> 00:02:57.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
to equip us as ministers and teachers.

00:02:58.375 --> 00:03:00.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
We trust that it will motivate you

00:03:00.377 --> 00:03:02.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see additional ways
that you can take advantage

00:03:02.672 --> 00:03:05.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the education Jehovah provides.

00:03:05.925 --> 00:03:09.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our feature museum
is a first-century Bible village.

00:03:11.055 --> 00:03:13.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “local villagers” are very welcoming

00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:16.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will be eager to show you
how they live and work together

00:03:16.144 --> 00:03:17.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a community.

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll see firsthand what life was like

00:03:20.524 --> 00:03:22.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jesus walked the earth.

00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:24.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll walk through agricultural areas,

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
a marketplace, residences,

00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:30.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
a synagogue,

00:03:30.201 --> 00:03:32.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even by the seashore.

00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:34.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt these new museums

00:03:34.956 --> 00:03:38.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
will enhance your appreciation for the Bible

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for what Jehovah is accomplishing

00:03:39.961 --> 00:03:41.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
through his organization today.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
We welcome all who are able to come and see

00:03:46.802 --> 00:03:49.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
the new Patterson Visitors’ Center!

00:03:54.685 --> 00:03:58.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Patterson Visitors’ Center
is outstanding!

00:03:59.106 --> 00:04:01.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank all who worked on this project.

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:05.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
We now invite all of you to come and tour.

00:04:05.321 --> 00:04:08.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can request a tour on jw.org.

00:04:10.118 --> 00:04:13.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s talk about the recent adjustments

00:04:13.204 --> 00:04:15.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the way we report our ministry

00:04:15.457 --> 00:04:18.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how these affect our personal goals.

00:04:18.835 --> 00:04:20.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the recent annual meeting,

00:04:20.921 --> 00:04:23.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learned that as of last November,

00:04:23.298 --> 00:04:27.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’d no longer be submitting
a detailed field service report.

00:04:27.678 --> 00:04:30.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a big change, wasn’t it?

00:04:30.723 --> 00:04:34.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
But although we’ve changed
the way we report our activity,

00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:37.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
we haven’t changed the way we view
the ministry itself.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:40.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
The focus is on people.

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love people, and we want to help them.

00:04:44.446 --> 00:04:47.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re ready to share the good news
wherever we find them.

00:04:48.283 --> 00:04:50.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
On Saturday morning,

00:04:50.035 --> 00:04:53.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may spend a couple of hours
preaching from door to door.

00:04:53.497 --> 00:04:56.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, we go grocery shopping.

00:04:56.458 --> 00:04:59.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we “off the clock,” so to speak,

00:04:59.044 --> 00:05:01.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we’re no longer
in the formal preaching work?

00:05:02.715 --> 00:05:04.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t look at it that way.

00:05:04.592 --> 00:05:06.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re at the grocery store,

00:05:06.344 --> 00:05:09.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re still on the lookout for people
we can share the good news with.

00:05:10.557 --> 00:05:15.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may be able to talk to someone
standing next to us in a long checkout line

00:05:15.353 --> 00:05:18.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps with the clerk
who processes our order.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can keep it simple.

00:05:21.652 --> 00:05:24.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
After exchanging a few friendly words,

00:05:24.238 --> 00:05:26.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might pull out
a contact card and simply say:

00:05:26.782 --> 00:05:29.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is a website I think you’d enjoy.

00:05:29.452 --> 00:05:33.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has interesting articles
in more than 1,000 languages.”

00:05:33.748 --> 00:05:38.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or, after a few appropriate comments,
you might offer a tract.

00:05:38.503 --> 00:05:41.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
If time permits and the person is receptive,

00:05:41.381 --> 00:05:43.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can say more.

00:05:43.383 --> 00:05:47.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same principle can apply
when we’re waiting at a doctor’s office,

00:05:47.012 --> 00:05:51.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
an airport, shopping,
or on public transportation.

00:05:52.017 --> 00:05:53.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an idea:

00:05:53.477 --> 00:05:56.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not have a small supply of contact cards

00:05:56.063 --> 00:05:58.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other literature with you wherever you go?

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:03.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve said that we’re ready
to share the good news

00:06:03.654 --> 00:06:05.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever we find people.

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:09.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about the people we don’t find

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those who are often not at home?

00:06:13.373 --> 00:06:17.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever driven through a neighborhood
on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:20.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
and noticed that there was a car
in every driveway?

00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:23.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, when you called on those same homes
in the morning,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
no one was at home.

00:06:25.928 --> 00:06:29.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder how many of those people
would accept a Bible study

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we were able to offer one.

00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our love for people will move us
to call when they’re at home.

00:06:37.732 --> 00:06:39.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember on one occasion

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were going out for supper
at a nearby restaurant with another couple.

00:06:43.613 --> 00:06:45.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother was driving.

00:06:45.574 --> 00:06:48.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we passed a certain house
in the neighborhood,

00:06:48.285 --> 00:06:51.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
he stopped, parked, and said:

00:06:51.622 --> 00:06:55.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Excuse me, but I see a car in the driveway.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We’ve been trying for weeks
to find this person at home.

00:06:58.212 --> 00:06:59.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t be long.”

00:06:59.839 --> 00:07:02.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he and his wife 
got out and made the call.

00:07:02.967 --> 00:07:04.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bravo!

00:07:06.346 --> 00:07:08.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another area where diligence is needed

00:07:08.806 --> 00:07:11.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves following up on interest.

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:14.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
A person doing cart work
has a conversation with an interested person

00:07:14.521 --> 00:07:16.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
who requests a visit.

00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:20.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
That person lives in your territory,
and you agree to make the call.

00:07:21.278 --> 00:07:24.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saturday morning, you knock on the door,
and what happens?

00:07:24.782 --> 00:07:28.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know the answer:
The person isn’t at home.

00:07:28.786 --> 00:07:32.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we going to throw up our hands
and say, “Well, I tried”?

00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:33.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:35.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
That person showed interest,

00:07:35.752 --> 00:07:39.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to keep calling back
at different times until we contact him.

00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:44.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we no longer fill out
a detailed field service report,

00:07:44.553 --> 00:07:47.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can still
set personal goals for ourselves.

00:07:47.931 --> 00:07:50.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some worthwhile goals might be

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
listening more carefully
when the householder is speaking

00:07:52.728 --> 00:07:55.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
or showing more personal interest.

00:07:55.648 --> 00:07:58.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another goal might be
to cover our territory more thoroughly.

00:08:00.111 --> 00:08:03.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having personal goals
is in line with Paul’s counsel

00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:06.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Galatians 6:4.

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:08.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can follow on-screen as we read this.

00:08:09.537 --> 00:08:11.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote:

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:15.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But let each one
examine his own actions,

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:20.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and then he will have cause for rejoicing
in regard to himself alone,

00:08:20.048 --> 00:08:23.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not in comparison with the other person.”

00:08:25.095 --> 00:08:28.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personal goals can give us
the motivation we need

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:30.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get out in this all-important work.

00:08:32.019 --> 00:08:36.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear how some of our brothers
and sisters feel about the recent adjustments

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:38.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they’re doing to expand their share.

00:08:39.486 --> 00:08:41.112 line:10% position:50% align:center
Thanks to these adjustments,

00:08:41.112 --> 00:08:42.447 line:10% position:50% align:center
I can now enjoy my ministry

00:08:42.447 --> 00:08:44.658 line:10% position:50% align:center
and making disciples even more.

00:08:44.658 --> 00:08:47.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
And honestly, I love it.

00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:51.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like the new adjustment
to reporting hours has really helped me

00:08:51.832 --> 00:08:53.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’m not so worried

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.960 line:10% position:50% align:center
about starting my time and ending my time.

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.088 line:10% position:50% align:center
I feel like I’m in the ministry all the time.

00:08:57.088 --> 00:08:58.297 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, the first thing is

00:08:58.297 --> 00:08:59.674 line:10% position:50% align:center
that I’ve completely changed my schedule,

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:02.051 line:10% position:50% align:center
so I’m going out when people are out there.

00:09:02.051 --> 00:09:04.220 line:10% position:50% align:center
Previously in the ministry,

00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:06.514 line:10% position:50% align:center
I expected people to listen to me,

00:09:06.514 --> 00:09:09.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now I want to listen to them.

00:09:09.976 --> 00:09:11.144 line:10% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t matter

00:09:11.144 --> 00:09:13.188 line:10% position:50% align:center
how many publications I leave with people.

00:09:13.188 --> 00:09:14.689 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now I see the importance

00:09:14.689 --> 00:09:17.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
of taking every opportunity to talk to people

00:09:17.234 --> 00:09:19.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the goal of making disciples.

00:09:21.697 --> 00:09:23.574 line:10% position:50% align:center
Before, I was so happy

00:09:23.574 --> 00:09:24.783 line:10% position:50% align:center
when I could leave something

00:09:24.783 --> 00:09:26.577 line:10% position:50% align:center
from my witnessing bag,

00:09:26.577 --> 00:09:31.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now I’m really happy
if I leave someone a piece of my heart.

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:34.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has helped me

00:09:34.627 --> 00:09:36.963 line:10% position:50% align:center
really focus on what’s more important,

00:09:36.963 --> 00:09:39.424 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that is making disciples.

00:09:39.758 --> 00:09:41.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love this new approach to the ministry

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:45.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’m not memorizing
a specific conversation.

00:09:46.306 --> 00:09:48.267 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now I can talk to them more naturally

00:09:48.267 --> 00:09:49.601 line:10% position:50% align:center
and really enjoy

00:09:49.601 --> 00:09:51.228 line:10% position:50% align:center
what we discuss about the Bible.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our activity isn’t defined

00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:57.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
by what we might call quantities.

00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:00.279 line:10% position:50% align:center
But rather, it’s motivated

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:02.323 line:10% position:50% align:center
by the love we have for people.

00:10:04.242 --> 00:10:06.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve noticed
that the brothers and sisters 

00:10:06.077 --> 00:10:07.662 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the circuit are really excited

00:10:07.662 --> 00:10:10.040 line:10% position:50% align:center
about this adjusted approach to our ministry.

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.042 line:10% position:50% align:center
Before it was more structured

00:10:12.042 --> 00:10:13.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a topic then a scripture.

00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now it’s a conversation.

00:10:17.965 --> 00:10:20.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
I used to be worried about what I would say

00:10:20.634 --> 00:10:22.219 line:10% position:50% align:center
and how I would bring the conversation

00:10:22.219 --> 00:10:23.971 line:10% position:50% align:center
to the Bible.

00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:25.848 line:10% position:50% align:center
But now I realize that

00:10:25.848 --> 00:10:28.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
what matters more than what I say

00:10:28.643 --> 00:10:32.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that the person feels
that I genuinely care about them.

00:10:33.272 --> 00:10:36.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
So just like Jesus
approached the woman at the well,

00:10:36.526 --> 00:10:38.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like to approach people about their dogs

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I like to talk to them
and ask if I could pet the dog.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:43.158 line:10% position:50% align:center
It starts a nice, relaxed conversation,

00:10:43.158 --> 00:10:44.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that can lead into,

00:10:44.409 --> 00:10:45.744 line:10% position:50% align:center
like, giving them a card

00:10:45.744 --> 00:10:47.454 line:10% position:50% align:center
or talking about the truth a bit.

00:10:47.454 --> 00:10:49.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And oftentimes when I leave, I’ll look back

00:10:49.581 --> 00:10:51.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ll be scanning
the card with their phone

00:10:51.917 --> 00:10:54.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’ll be looking
at the website already.

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:58.382 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’ve noticed that now in the congregation,

00:10:58.382 --> 00:11:00.635 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’ve become more observant,

00:11:00.635 --> 00:11:03.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we can use those observations
in our conversations.

00:11:05.682 --> 00:11:07.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m kind of 

00:11:07.559 --> 00:11:09.519 line:10% position:50% align:center
quiet and shy by nature,

00:11:09.519 --> 00:11:12.022 line:10% position:50% align:center
so there’s this new method that says,

00:11:12.022 --> 00:11:13.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t talk too much.’

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:15.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I heard that, I was like: ‘Yes!

00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:17.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s something that I can do really well.’

00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:18.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just love it.

00:11:18.904 --> 00:11:20.656 line:10% position:50% align:center
I feel much more relaxed

00:11:20.656 --> 00:11:21.865 line:10% position:50% align:center
because now

00:11:21.865 --> 00:11:24.118 line:10% position:50% align:center
our goal is to start conversations.

00:11:24.118 --> 00:11:26.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I focus on preparing ideas

00:11:26.078 --> 00:11:28.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on the needs
of the people in the territory.

00:11:29.749 --> 00:11:32.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel really excited by the adjustment

00:11:32.085 --> 00:11:33.419 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the preaching work

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:35.755 line:10% position:50% align:center
because it’s encouraging us

00:11:35.755 --> 00:11:37.507 line:10% position:50% align:center
to engage in different forms of the ministry,

00:11:37.507 --> 00:11:38.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as informal.

00:11:38.717 --> 00:11:40.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while these don’t come naturally to me,

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel really supported
by Jehovah and his organization

00:11:43.555 --> 00:11:45.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try these different avenues

00:11:45.057 --> 00:11:47.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to really pursue my goal
of regular pioneering.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.145 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s definitely made us

00:11:50.145 --> 00:11:52.898 line:10% position:50% align:center
want to expand our ministry so much more

00:11:52.898 --> 00:11:54.316 line:10% position:50% align:center
just so that we can go out

00:11:54.316 --> 00:11:57.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help people to get to know Jehovah.

00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:01.866 line:10% position:50% align:center
I see many in the congregation

00:12:01.866 --> 00:12:03.826 line:10% position:50% align:center
who find great joy in pioneering.

00:12:04.911 --> 00:12:06.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to feel the same.

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I am very happy
to be a regular pioneer starting this month.

00:12:13.628 --> 00:12:15.380 line:10% position:50% align:center
As a couple, we want to attend

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.883 line:10% position:50% align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:12:17.883 --> 00:12:19.343 line:10% position:50% align:center
because we want to improve

00:12:19.343 --> 00:12:21.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
in learning new ways
of showing our love for people.

00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:24.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t wait to pioneer.

00:12:24.348 --> 00:12:26.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to pioneer,
and then I’m going to go to SKE,

00:12:26.892 --> 00:12:29.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I want to go wherever SKE sends me,

00:12:29.186 --> 00:12:31.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it sounds like a fun adventure.

00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:32.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s fantastic!

00:12:32.398 --> 00:12:35.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
All I have to do now is focus on people,
and that’s great.

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what it’s all about.

00:13:02.305 --> 00:13:03.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:13:03.932 --> 00:13:08.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
we love you for doing all you can
according to your circumstances!

00:13:08.979 --> 00:13:12.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said, as found at John 14:15:

00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you love me,
you will observe my commandments.”

00:13:16.737 --> 00:13:19.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love our Master, and we love people,

00:13:19.907 --> 00:13:23.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we gladly obey
Jesus’ command to his disciples:

00:13:23.744 --> 00:13:26.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As you go, preach.”

00:13:26.706 --> 00:13:29.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:13:29.709 --> 00:13:32.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
