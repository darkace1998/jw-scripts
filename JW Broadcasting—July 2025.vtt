Greetings, and welcome
to JW Broadcasting!®

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month we’ll learn
what it means to be faithful

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how to make it our way of life.

00:00:12.867 --> 00:00:16.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we remain faithful
while enduring severe tests?

00:00:17.037 --> 00:00:19.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maria Fernanda, Matias,

00:00:19.957 --> 00:00:22.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Esteban
each faced intense trials.

00:00:23.502 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ll share
how they found peace and comfort.

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:30.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you sometimes hesitate
to offer a Bible study?

00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:33.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
This episode of <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron”</i> 

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:37.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
offers practical suggestions
that will boost your confidence.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:40.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our new music video

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:43.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
encourages young people to stay faithful

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:45.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on the right path in life.

00:00:47.026 --> 00:00:49.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting!

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.425 line:10% position:50% align:center
Old Faithful is the name of a geyser

00:01:11.425 --> 00:01:13.052 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Yellowstone National Park

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:14.803 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the United States.

00:01:14.803 --> 00:01:16.805 line:10% position:50% align:center
The geyser was given this name

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:20.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the relative
regularity of its eruptions.

00:01:20.893 --> 00:01:25.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, it erupts thousands of liters
or gallons of boiling water

00:01:25.356 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
about every 90 minutes on average.

00:01:29.026 --> 00:01:32.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Old Faithful erupts,
the timing of its next eruption

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be predicted about 90 percent of the time

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
within a ten-minute variation.

00:01:38.327 --> 00:01:41.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s not even the most
regular geyser in the park!

00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:43.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

00:01:44.792 --> 00:01:47.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shouldn’t surprise us
that the word “faithful”

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
is applied to inanimate things,

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
since we see faithfulness
and dependability in creation.

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:58.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Psalm 89:37 describes the moon

00:01:58.222 --> 00:02:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a faithful witness in the skies”
because of its reliability.

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:06.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its appearance in the sky
follows a fixed pattern,

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:09.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it faithfully completes its orbit
around the earth

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:12.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
every 27.3 days.

00:02:13.988 --> 00:02:16.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we admire faithfulness in creation,

00:02:16.782 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
we especially appreciate people who make

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithfulness their way of life.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:26.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such individuals are reliable,
dependable, and trustworthy.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read about this quality of faithfulness
at 1 Corinthians 4:2:

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In this regard, what is expected of stewards

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that they be found faithful.”

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
The term “steward” can mean “house manager.”

00:02:41.598 --> 00:02:44.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
His work could include
caring for his master’s business,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
property, and other servants.

00:02:46.937 --> 00:02:48.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a lot of responsibility!

00:02:49.481 --> 00:02:51.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
But think of this:

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:55.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
A steward might have
many fine qualities and abilities.

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:58.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, none of them would matter
if he was irresponsible,

00:02:58.323 --> 00:03:01.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
disloyal, and unfaithful to his master.

00:03:02.494 --> 00:03:06.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithfulness is essential
to be an effective and successful steward.

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:11.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
As true Christians, we must prove ourselves
faithful and trustworthy.

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:16.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah feel about faithfulness?

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:18.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same way as King David did,

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:21.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
who wrote at Psalm 101:6:

00:03:21.138 --> 00:03:23.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will look
to the faithful ones of the earth,

00:03:23.974 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they may dwell with me.”

00:03:26.685 --> 00:03:28.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using a similar expression,

00:03:28.687 --> 00:03:33.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Jeremiah wrote the words
found at Jeremiah 5:3:

00:03:33.317 --> 00:03:38.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, do your eyes
not look for faithfulness?”

00:03:39.031 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Psalm 37:3 encourages us

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “reside in the earth,
and act with faithfulness.”

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:49.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the theme of this month’s broadcast is

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Make Faithfulness Your Way of Life.”

00:03:53.504 --> 00:03:56.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll examine two examples of faithfulness,

00:03:56.423 --> 00:04:01.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we’ll consider some practical ways
that we can prove ourselves faithful.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
We began our discussion
by talking about the example of a geyser.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
A geyser might be a fitting symbol
of the faithfulness of humans

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
because geysers continually erupt,

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they do so unpredictably.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a geyser would be a poor representation

00:04:19.822 --> 00:04:23.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the unchanging faithfulness
of our “faithful Creator,”

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah is described at 1 Peter 4:19.

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:31.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ever-present sun and moon
are more appropriate symbols

00:04:31.416 --> 00:04:34.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the unchangeableness of his faithfulness.

00:04:35.963 --> 00:04:38.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his words to the nation of Israel,

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:42.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses stated, as found at Deuteronomy 32:4:

00:04:42.427 --> 00:04:47.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Rock, perfect is his activity,
for all his ways are justice.

00:04:47.432 --> 00:04:51.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
A God of faithfulness who is never unjust.”

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:55.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Jehovah prove faithful to that nation?

00:04:55.149 --> 00:04:57.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course he did.

00:04:57.151 --> 00:05:00.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Moses spoke those words
to the Israelites,

00:05:00.112 --> 00:05:02.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may have remembered
the time when Jehovah

00:05:02.156 --> 00:05:05.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
had faithfully brought their forefathers
out of Egypt

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rescued them at the Red Sea.

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:10.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had faithfully preserved
millions of people alive

00:05:10.455 --> 00:05:14.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the Israelites’ 40-year journey
in the wilderness.

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:16.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had led them
to the border of the Promised Land.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses’ successor, Joshua,

00:05:19.047 --> 00:05:22.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
also could testify to Jehovah’s faithfulness.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a child growing up in Egypt,

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:28.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua must have
come to know of Jehovah’s promise

00:05:28.223 --> 00:05:30.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give the Israelites a land of their own.

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:34.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the time came to enter that land,

00:05:34.021 --> 00:05:38.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua was an eyewitness of how
Jehovah fought in behalf of His people.

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:42.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua saw
the walls of Jericho fall down flat.

00:05:42.946 --> 00:05:46.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw the sun stand still
until the Amorites could be routed.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time,
one nation after another was defeated

00:05:51.705 --> 00:05:54.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the faithful God
was fighting for Israel.

00:05:56.752 --> 00:05:58.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once they defeated their enemies,

00:05:58.795 --> 00:06:03.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua could say to the nation
what is recorded at Joshua 23:14:

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You well know with all your heart
and with all your soul

00:06:07.471 --> 00:06:10.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that not one word
out of all the good promises

00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:14.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah your God has spoken
to you has failed.

00:06:14.353 --> 00:06:16.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They have all come true for you.

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not one word of them has failed”

00:06:19.524 --> 00:06:22.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“not one word.”

00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:26.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua had seen that Jehovah
faithfully kept His promises.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:32.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you can probably think of many other
examples of Jehovah’s faithfulness,

00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the fulfillment
of Messianic prophecies,

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:40.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fulfillment of the promise to feed
God’s people spiritually in our day

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:44.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of “the faithful
and discreet slave,” and so on.

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:50.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sets the perfect example
for us in showing faithfulness.

00:06:52.057 --> 00:06:54.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
The thought of making faithfulness
our way of life

00:06:54.726 --> 00:06:57.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also be illustrated in the example

00:06:57.062 --> 00:07:00.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the three Hebrew companions of Daniel.

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:04.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they were young,
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah

00:07:04.736 --> 00:07:07.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
set an excellent example of faithfulness

00:07:07.364 --> 00:07:10.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what some people
may view as a small thing.

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:14.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember how they were
pressured to eat unclean food?

00:07:15.622 --> 00:07:19.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apparently, their faithful parents
must have instructed them

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:23.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
to adhere strictly to the dietary
restrictions found in the Mosaic Law.

00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:29.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah considered these so important
that after listing such restrictions,

00:07:29.594 --> 00:07:33.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
he stated the words
recorded at Leviticus 11:45:

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must be holy, because I am holy.”

00:07:38.103 --> 00:07:42.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
The king of Babylon assigned
the three Hebrew youths and other young men

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:45.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a daily ration from [his] delicacies,”

00:07:45.402 --> 00:07:49.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
among which were foods forbidden by the Law.

00:07:49.489 --> 00:07:51.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
The three Hebrews could have reasoned

00:07:51.491 --> 00:07:53.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the dietary restrictions
of the Mosaic Law

00:07:53.994 --> 00:07:55.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
were not so important,

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:59.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
at least not when compared
to the Ten Commandments.

00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:02.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no, those faithful youths were concerned

00:08:02.294 --> 00:08:06.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
with living up to all features of God’s Law.

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
They determined not to pollute
themselves with such food

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:12.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and requested to eat vegetables.

00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:15.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
The matter of which tasted better

00:08:15.265 --> 00:08:18.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
was of no concern to them
in this important decision.

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel asked that they be permitted
to try out this diet for ten days.

00:08:24.858 --> 00:08:26.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result?

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:28.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the ten days,

00:08:28.862 --> 00:08:32.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah blessed those young men
for their faithfulness.

00:08:32.282 --> 00:08:36.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
They looked ‘better and healthier
than any of the other youths’!

00:08:37.496 --> 00:08:40.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was the choice of food a small thing?

00:08:40.123 --> 00:08:42.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not to Jehovah!

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:44.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was of serious concern to him,

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:47.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the young Hebrews
had his view of the matter.

00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:53.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their faithfulness in what
may have seemed a small thing

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:55.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
prepared them
for a bigger trial in the future.

00:08:55.931 --> 00:09:00.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
had already established a pattern

00:09:00.685 --> 00:09:03.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
of making faithfulness their way of life

00:09:03.397 --> 00:09:05.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
when King Nebuchadnezzar ordered them

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:09.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bow before an image of gold
on the plains of Dura.

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:14.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
In faithfulness to Jehovah, they refused.

00:09:14.116 --> 00:09:16.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they made that decision despite knowing

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:20.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it would result in their being
thrown into a fiery furnace.

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:24.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read their words to the king,

00:09:24.334 --> 00:09:27.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Daniel 3:17, 18,

00:09:27.587 --> 00:09:30.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
see if you can sense their faithfulness:

00:09:31.299 --> 00:09:33.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If it must be,

00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:36.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our God whom we serve is able to rescue us

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:39.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the burning fiery furnace, O king,

00:09:39.141 --> 00:09:41.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to rescue us from your hand.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But even if he does not,

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let it be known to you, O king,

00:09:46.481 --> 00:09:49.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we will not serve your gods

00:09:49.025 --> 00:09:52.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
or worship the image of gold
that you have set up.”

00:09:53.655 --> 00:09:58.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
That courageous stand resulted
in their being thrown into the furnace.

00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:00.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we know, Jehovah rescued them.

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:03.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an outstanding witness they provided

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:05.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to the king and his court

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:08.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to all those
who through the centuries

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
have read about that account
in the book of Daniel!

00:10:12.424 --> 00:10:15.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
The three Hebrews
looked to Jehovah as their Sovereign,

00:10:15.552 --> 00:10:17.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they proved themselves faithful

00:10:17.929 --> 00:10:20.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
in both large and small matters.

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:25.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can we imitate Jehovah
and the three Hebrews

00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:28.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we too can make
faithfulness our way of life?

00:10:30.066 --> 00:10:33.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ statement recorded
at Luke 16:10 can help.

00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:35.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:10:35.405 --> 00:10:38.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The person faithful in what is least

00:10:38.158 --> 00:10:40.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
is faithful also in much.”

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those words uttered almost 2,000 years ago

00:10:44.289 --> 00:10:46.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
are still as true as ever.

00:10:47.751 --> 00:10:51.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it may be that you’ll never be asked
to take a stand that demonstrates

00:10:51.630 --> 00:10:54.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
what some might view
as outstanding faithfulness,

00:10:54.674 --> 00:10:58.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
as was shown by the three Hebrews
when they didn’t bow down to the image.

00:10:59.846 --> 00:11:02.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
But your constancy in doing what is right

00:11:02.974 --> 00:11:06.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your reliability and dependability
in small things

00:11:06.978 --> 00:11:11.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
give evidence of your deep appreciation
for what it means to be faithful.

00:11:12.984 --> 00:11:15.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 31:23 assures us

00:11:15.362 --> 00:11:18.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Jehovah protects the faithful,”

00:11:18.281 --> 00:11:22.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is true even when
we’re faithful in seemingly small matters.

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:26.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many areas of our lives
in which we need

00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:29.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
to display faithfulness to Jehovah

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:33.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, having a regular share
in the ministry each month

00:11:33.421 --> 00:11:35.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reporting our participation.

00:11:35.632 --> 00:11:40.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithfulness to our marriage mate
is very important to Jehovah.

00:11:40.554 --> 00:11:44.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about showing our faithfulness
by staying neutral

00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:48.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to the political
and social conflicts of the world?

00:11:48.186 --> 00:11:50.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we make faithfulness our way of life

00:11:50.272 --> 00:11:53.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes
to our personal conduct each day?

00:11:54.776 --> 00:11:57.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
During a personal study session
or family worship,

00:11:57.862 --> 00:12:02.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
why not consider how you can continue
to be faithful in these areas?

00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:06.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about you young ones?

00:12:06.121 --> 00:12:10.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so proud of you when you prove
your faithfulness to Jehovah.

00:12:10.250 --> 00:12:13.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that many of you
face tests of your faith

00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:16.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
that involve the pressure
to engage in immorality

00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:19.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in other forms of bad behavior.

00:12:19.593 --> 00:12:21.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s one thing to know what to do

00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:23.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what choice you should make

00:12:23.972 --> 00:12:27.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
but quite another to have the courage
to do what is right

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:29.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you’re under pressure or temptation.

00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:33.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
The three Hebrews could have concluded

00:12:33.273 --> 00:12:36.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could get away with eating
the food God’s Law prohibited,

00:12:36.985 --> 00:12:40.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
since they were far away
from their parents and friends.

00:12:41.489 --> 00:12:44.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
They could also have reasoned
that it was the king’s order,

00:12:44.701 --> 00:12:47.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they had no choice
but to do what they were told.

00:12:48.246 --> 00:12:52.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Besides, other youths may have
readily accepted the food arrangements

00:12:52.542 --> 00:12:54.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and viewed it as a privilege.

00:12:55.754 --> 00:13:00.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Hebrew youths knew that,
as mentioned at Proverbs 15:3:

00:13:00.258 --> 00:13:03.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The eyes of Jehovah are everywhere.”

00:13:04.054 --> 00:13:07.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those youths
were determined to remain faithful.

00:13:09.017 --> 00:13:12.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones,
if you learn to deal successfully with trials

00:13:12.604 --> 00:13:15.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some may view as small things,

00:13:15.231 --> 00:13:19.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you’ll be able to face
bigger tests of your faith.

00:13:19.235 --> 00:13:22.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never forget
that the benefits of faithfulness

00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:26.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
far outweigh any temporary relief
that comes from compromising.

00:13:28.953 --> 00:13:32.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider one more area
that involves faithfulness:

00:13:32.248 --> 00:13:34.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
our dress and grooming.

00:13:34.876 --> 00:13:39.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
How glad we were to learn
in the <i>2024 Governing Body Update #2</i>

00:13:39.673 --> 00:13:44.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the adjustments to our standard of dress
at theocratic events and in the ministry!

00:13:45.261 --> 00:13:47.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
We commend you brothers and sisters

00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:52.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
for wanting to dress and be groomed
in a dignified way on those occasions.

00:13:53.978 --> 00:13:57.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can we show our faithfulness
in our selection of clothing

00:13:57.107 --> 00:14:00.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
during our leisure time, when on vacation,

00:14:00.485 --> 00:14:03.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when at social gatherings
with our fellow Christians?

00:14:05.115 --> 00:14:09.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Timothy 2:9, 10
admonishes our Christian sisters

00:14:09.536 --> 00:14:12.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “adorn themselves in appropriate dress,

00:14:12.997 --> 00:14:16.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with modesty and soundness of mind, . . .

00:14:16.543 --> 00:14:20.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way that is proper
for women professing devotion to God.”

00:14:21.965 --> 00:14:26.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the principle of modesty
applies to Christian brothers too.

00:14:26.052 --> 00:14:29.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4 states

00:14:29.931 --> 00:14:34.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “in no way are we giving
any cause for stumbling,

00:14:34.102 --> 00:14:37.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that no fault
may be found with our ministry;

00:14:37.731 --> 00:14:40.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in every way we recommend ourselves

00:14:40.483 --> 00:14:42.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
as God’s ministers.”

00:14:42.485 --> 00:14:47.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In every way” includes
our choice of dress and grooming.

00:14:49.367 --> 00:14:53.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
An article entitled
“Are You Faithful in All Things?”

00:14:53.037 --> 00:14:57.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the July 15, 2005,
issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>  states this:

00:14:58.835 --> 00:15:02.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our dress needs
to be practical and presentable.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:06.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This serves as a witness to others
who observe us. . . .

00:15:06.718 --> 00:15:10.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In fact, we should always
be appropriately attired.

00:15:11.598 --> 00:15:15.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To some,
faithfulness in the choice of clothing

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“may seem to be a small matter,

00:15:18.229 --> 00:15:21.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in God’s eyes it is important.”

00:15:23.026 --> 00:15:26.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should remember this when it comes
to our choice of dress and grooming.

00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:31.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what will you remember
from this consideration?

00:15:32.869 --> 00:15:36.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us admire faithfulness in creation.

00:15:36.206 --> 00:15:38.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we especially appreciate people

00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:42.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have made faithfulness their way of life.

00:15:42.128 --> 00:15:44.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have outstanding examples of faithfulness

00:15:44.422 --> 00:15:46.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded in the Bible that we can imitate,

00:15:46.841 --> 00:15:50.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Jehovah,
the three Hebrews, and many others.

00:15:52.096 --> 00:15:55.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
The principle found at Luke 16:10
can help us to be faithful

00:15:55.809 --> 00:15:57.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only in large matters

00:15:57.936 --> 00:16:01.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also in what some may regard
as small matters.

00:16:02.273 --> 00:16:05.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, we encourage you

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:08.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue to prove
your faithfulness to Jehovah.

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:12.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
As noted at Proverbs 28:20:

00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:15.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A faithful man will receive many blessings.”

00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:19.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
our main reason for being faithful is,

00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:22.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because of what we get out of it,

00:16:22.252 --> 00:16:25.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of our love for Jehovah.

00:16:25.463 --> 00:16:29.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can be sure that Jehovah
will continue to bless us richly

00:16:29.676 --> 00:16:33.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we make faithfulness our way of life.

00:16:35.807 --> 00:16:40.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus displayed unmatched faithfulness
through all that he suffered.

00:16:40.061 --> 00:16:42.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our first segment,

00:16:42.063 --> 00:16:44.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how his words and example

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped Maria Fernanda,
Matias, and Esteban

00:16:47.735 --> 00:16:49.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
during their darkest moments.

00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:05.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were spending the afternoon
in the pool with my family.

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:06.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next day,

00:17:06.754 --> 00:17:10.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
I woke up 
and I was having trouble catching my breath.

00:17:10.049 --> 00:17:12.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we went to the doctor.

00:17:15.054 --> 00:17:16.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
A blood test revealed

00:17:16.431 --> 00:17:18.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I had a bacterial infection in my leg

00:17:18.558 --> 00:17:21.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
called staphylococcus.

00:17:21.352 --> 00:17:23.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
I ended up in the hospital for 55 days.

00:17:28.943 --> 00:17:30.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a colonoscopy,

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:34.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a few days later,
they told me I had colon cancer.

00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
They ran some more tests
and discovered

00:17:37.744 --> 00:17:39.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
it had also spread to my liver.

00:17:48.463 --> 00:17:52.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a very humble person, caring.

00:17:52.342 --> 00:17:54.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:17:57.972 --> 00:18:00.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loved Jehovah very much.

00:18:00.016 --> 00:18:02.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a good companion and a great friend.

00:18:02.810 --> 00:18:05.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were married for almost 25 years.

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:09.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly, I don’t know why,

00:18:09.359 --> 00:18:11.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
but

00:18:11.653 --> 00:18:14.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
he decided to take his own life.

00:18:15.073 --> 00:18:17.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never thought

00:18:17.992 --> 00:18:20.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would choose
to do something like that.

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think a word
that’s even more terrifying than cancer

00:18:35.218 --> 00:18:37.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
is metastasis.

00:18:38.429 --> 00:18:42.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like being caught up in a whirlwind
and then plummeting to the ground.

00:18:42.016 --> 00:18:46.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life as I knew it
had now completely changed.

00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:51.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
In total, there were ten operations.

00:18:51.192 --> 00:18:53.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first four were the most difficult

00:18:53.194 --> 00:18:56.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there was a possibility
that they would have to amputate my leg.

00:18:57.365 --> 00:19:02.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every morning,
you wake up with an intense anxiety,

00:19:02.036 --> 00:19:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
like a weight on your chest,
and you can’t breathe.

00:19:08.376 --> 00:19:11.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, I thought
that Jehovah was just letting all this happen

00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:13.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he wasn’t doing anything.

00:19:13.756 --> 00:19:16.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jesus himself

00:19:16.592 --> 00:19:18.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not expect Jehovah

00:19:18.803 --> 00:19:21.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
to shield him from trials

00:19:21.305 --> 00:19:23.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to get him out of them,

00:19:23.891 --> 00:19:27.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
then I had no right to think,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:30.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why is this happening to me?’

00:19:30.690 --> 00:19:32.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually,
the correct thinking is the opposite,

00:19:32.984 --> 00:19:35.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why shouldn’t it also be me?’

00:19:36.821 --> 00:19:39.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,
the doctors came in with some papers

00:19:39.323 --> 00:19:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that the judge had given them
permission to operate on me

00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:44.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give me a blood transfusion
that very day.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because I was still a minor at the time,

00:19:47.749 --> 00:19:50.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found that my opinion and my decisions
were being ignored.

00:19:50.543 --> 00:19:51.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at that moment,

00:19:51.836 --> 00:19:54.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that all of this wasn’t against me

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:55.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
but against Jehovah.

00:19:55.506 --> 00:19:56.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
It became clear to me

00:19:56.716 --> 00:19:58.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everything was in his hands.

00:20:02.346 --> 00:20:04.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see Jehovah’s hand
through my brothers and sisters

00:20:04.432 --> 00:20:06.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are always looking out for me.

00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:08.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided
to speak openly about it with others,

00:20:08.853 --> 00:20:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially with our close friends.

00:20:11.147 --> 00:20:13.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wanted to tell them
even before they asked.

00:20:16.694 --> 00:20:18.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
One scripture

00:20:18.112 --> 00:20:20.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
that others often shared with me

00:20:20.364 --> 00:20:23.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that Jehovah is “a protector of widows.”

00:20:24.077 --> 00:20:27.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a constant reminder
that Jehovah was going to take care of me,

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:29.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he did.

00:20:29.373 --> 00:20:32.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was three months of chemotherapy

00:20:32.168 --> 00:20:34.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the operation.

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told us
the operation could last ten hours.

00:20:39.634 --> 00:20:41.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing I remember thinking was,

00:20:41.719 --> 00:20:45.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, when I open my eyes,

00:20:45.765 --> 00:20:48.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I will either see the ceiling
of the operating room

00:20:48.976 --> 00:20:51.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
or I’ll see the new world.’

00:20:54.273 --> 00:20:58.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our family faced economic hardships,
my mom made fruit jams to sell.

00:20:58.486 --> 00:21:02.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said,
“Well, I guess I need to do the same.”

00:21:02.323 --> 00:21:04.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister who had a business

00:21:04.325 --> 00:21:06.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
offered to sell them for me.

00:21:06.077 --> 00:21:07.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
This helped me so much

00:21:07.787 --> 00:21:10.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I am not naturally gifted

00:21:10.081 --> 00:21:12.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
at doing sales.

00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:14.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
While reviewing the legal order,

00:21:14.252 --> 00:21:16.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
it turned out that it contained an error.

00:21:16.921 --> 00:21:20.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
My last name is Canal,
and they added an <i>S</i>  to it.

00:21:21.467 --> 00:21:23.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they weren’t able to use the document

00:21:23.469 --> 00:21:26.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ordered the transfusion that day.

00:21:26.222 --> 00:21:28.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
With time, I began to recover,

00:21:28.307 --> 00:21:31.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I started feeling reassured by the fact

00:21:31.352 --> 00:21:34.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I had not been judging Jehovah
by asking where he was.

00:21:37.358 --> 00:21:40.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asking that question
was a sign that I needed his help.

00:21:42.113 --> 00:21:45.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever anything worries me, I tell myself,

00:21:45.283 --> 00:21:50.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Wait, Jehovah has always cared for you,
so he’s not going to stop now.’

00:21:50.079 --> 00:21:53.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have full confidence
that Jehovah will take care of me.

00:21:55.877 --> 00:21:58.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
My physical health is now the best it can be.

00:21:59.797 --> 00:22:03.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my spiritual condition with Jehovah
—my friendship with him—

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:05.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been greatly strengthened.

00:22:07.096 --> 00:22:10.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve definitely experienced more good things
than bad things.

00:22:10.266 --> 00:22:12.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not that we would want
to go through it all again

00:22:12.768 --> 00:22:14.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
—absolutely not.

00:22:14.812 --> 00:22:17.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the reality is that in hindsight

00:22:17.023 --> 00:22:20.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
with everything I learned about Jehovah,

00:22:20.151 --> 00:22:22.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know
that I would have learned these things

00:22:22.403 --> 00:22:25.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
had I not gone through a situation like this.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re facing a hardship or trial,
remember you’re not alone.

00:22:43.507 --> 00:22:46.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never hesitate to ask for help.

00:22:46.469 --> 00:22:49.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too can count on
Jehovah’s loving support

00:22:49.013 --> 00:22:51.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
to endure and remain faithful.

00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:57.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love moves us
to help others come to know him.

00:22:57.271 --> 00:23:00.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Offering a Bible study
is one of the best ways to do this.

00:23:01.943 --> 00:23:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes, though,
we may feel unsure or uncomfortable.

00:23:06.781 --> 00:23:09.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this episode of <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron,”</i>

00:23:09.408 --> 00:23:12.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll learn how to offer
a Bible study with confidence.

00:23:14.497 --> 00:23:16.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, I am Byungchul Lim.

00:23:16.832 --> 00:23:19.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron</i>.<i>”</i>

00:23:28.552 --> 00:23:30.554 line:10% position:50% align:center
Have you ever had this experience?

00:23:30.554 --> 00:23:32.598 line:10% position:50% align:center
You share the truth with someone,

00:23:32.598 --> 00:23:35.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can see that it touches their heart.

00:23:35.351 --> 00:23:37.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the best feeling, isn’t it?

00:23:37.478 --> 00:23:41.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it makes you want to take the initiative
to offer them a Bible study.

00:23:41.357 --> 00:23:44.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, we love God and people.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:48.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at times
we may hesitate to offer a study.

00:23:48.572 --> 00:23:53.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might worry about seeming pushy
or being rejected.

00:23:53.869 --> 00:23:58.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we do
to effectively offer a Bible study?

00:24:04.463 --> 00:24:08.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, you’re out for exercise again today.
You’re really diligent.

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:11.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got to do
at least this much to stay healthy.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:14.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
But hey, look at this news.

00:24:14.307 --> 00:24:16.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said so a few months ago, didn’t I?

00:24:17.435 --> 00:24:19.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is the world such a mess?

00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
True.

00:24:21.188 --> 00:24:23.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t you think
the world will get better someday?

00:24:24.066 --> 00:24:25.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:29.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can the world’s problems be solved
by people’s efforts?

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:32.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
If anything, it’ll get worse.
What can people do?

00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if people are powerless,
do you think there is another way?

00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:38.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way?

00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:41.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, doesn’t seem likely.

00:24:43.336 --> 00:24:46.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brother did an excellent job!

00:24:46.005 --> 00:24:48.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed personal interest,

00:24:48.007 --> 00:24:52.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a good listener,
and asked appropriate questions.

00:24:52.011 --> 00:24:54.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
But can you guess what he did next?

00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:58.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
He offered a brief, silent prayer
to Jehovah for help.

00:24:58.601 --> 00:25:02.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
When offering a Bible study,
prayer is the first step.

00:25:02.813 --> 00:25:06.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if the fear of rejection
makes you hesitate,

00:25:06.275 --> 00:25:10.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you pray for courage,
as Philippians 2:13 tells us to do,

00:25:10.237 --> 00:25:14.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will give you
“both the desire and the power to act”

00:25:14.533 --> 00:25:16.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will bless your efforts.

00:25:16.744 --> 00:25:21.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even if you feel hesitant
to speak up, don’t give up.

00:25:21.582 --> 00:25:26.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pause, pray,
and turn your thoughts into actions.

00:25:28.631 --> 00:25:32.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, the Bible
tells us about the solution.

00:25:32.968 --> 00:25:34.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here, let me show you.

00:25:37.932 --> 00:25:40.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Under God’s Kingdom

00:25:40.142 --> 00:25:41.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Peace Will Abound.’”

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:47.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom
—sounds like a possible solution.

00:25:48.776 --> 00:25:51.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now I’ve got a lot of questions.

00:25:52.154 --> 00:25:53.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right.

00:25:53.572 --> 00:25:56.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a lot of questions too,

00:25:56.575 --> 00:25:59.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I found the answers
by studying the Bible.

00:25:59.578 --> 00:26:01.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the best way, really.

00:26:02.373 --> 00:26:03.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Studying the Bible?

00:26:03.582 --> 00:26:04.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:26:05.209 --> 00:26:07.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people might think a Bible study

00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:11.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves attending classes
with many others or taking exams.

00:26:12.425 --> 00:26:15.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we avoid this misunderstanding?

00:26:15.386 --> 00:26:17.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the second step:

00:26:17.638 --> 00:26:20.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Demonstrate how a Bible study is conducted.

00:26:21.267 --> 00:26:23.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Showing them this video

00:26:23.602 --> 00:26:26.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Teaching Toolbox in <i> JW Library®</i> 

00:26:26.272 --> 00:26:30.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only answers frequently asked questions
about Bible studies

00:26:30.651 --> 00:26:35.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
but is also one of the best ways
to help them want to study the Bible.

00:26:35.406 --> 00:26:37.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
You also studied the Bible like this?

00:26:37.908 --> 00:26:40.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I really enjoyed studying the Bible.

00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:44.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
The video said the future becomes brighter
if you study the Bible.

00:26:44.748 --> 00:26:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does it become brighter?

00:26:47.334 --> 00:26:48.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like this.

00:26:50.337 --> 00:26:53.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:26:53.841 --> 00:26:56.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can watch the video together

00:26:56.135 --> 00:26:58.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then show them the back cover

00:26:58.137 --> 00:27:00.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  brochure.

00:27:01.307 --> 00:27:03.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they respond positively,

00:27:03.684 --> 00:27:07.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can build their anticipation
by moving on to the third step.

00:27:08.647 --> 00:27:12.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
This involves finding out
what they are interested in.

00:27:12.109 --> 00:27:15.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
To do this, show them page 15 
of the brochure

00:27:15.446 --> 00:27:18.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask them to choose a topic
that interests them.

00:27:18.908 --> 00:27:22.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one: “How to find real peace.”

00:27:22.161 --> 00:27:24.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, peace is really important.

00:27:24.997 --> 00:27:27.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then how about we explore this topic together

00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:29.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our first Bible study?

00:27:29.502 --> 00:27:30.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sounds good.

00:27:30.961 --> 00:27:32.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
What time works for you?

00:27:32.338 --> 00:27:36.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother did an excellent job
of starting a Bible study!

00:27:36.091 --> 00:27:38.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let us review.

00:27:38.093 --> 00:27:40.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
To offer a Bible study,
there are three steps.

00:27:40.804 --> 00:27:42.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is prayer.

00:27:42.765 --> 00:27:45.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might feel hesitant
about offering a Bible study,

00:27:45.893 --> 00:27:50.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah can give you
“both the desire and the power” to do so.

00:27:50.898 --> 00:27:55.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second is to demonstrate
how a Bible study is conducted.

00:27:55.903 --> 00:27:59.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have effective tools
that help us to do this.

00:27:59.114 --> 00:28:03.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you can use the
<i>What Happens at a Bible Study?</i>  video

00:28:03.118 --> 00:28:06.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i> brochure.

00:28:06.288 --> 00:28:10.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third is to find out
the other person’s interests.

00:28:10.501 --> 00:28:15.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use page 15 of the brochure
to find out which topics interest them.

00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:21.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember that more important
than any method or technique

00:28:21.554 --> 00:28:25.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
is showing genuine love
for God and people,

00:28:25.683 --> 00:28:27.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Jesus did.

00:28:28.644 --> 00:28:33.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will no doubt help you
to achieve your goal of making disciples.

00:28:34.817 --> 00:28:38.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
After what we’ve explored together today,

00:28:38.112 --> 00:28:41.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel motivated to go out
and start a Bible study.

00:28:41.907 --> 00:28:44.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you also feel the same way.

00:28:45.035 --> 00:28:47.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
What practical suggestions!

00:28:47.913 --> 00:28:52.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look for ways to apply them
in our daily interactions with people.

00:28:53.127 --> 00:28:55.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we stay alert in our conversations,

00:28:55.838 --> 00:28:59.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll find opportunities
to offer Bible studies.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:05.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than ever, people urgently need
to learn about Jehovah

00:29:05.055 --> 00:29:07.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his purpose for mankind.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
The knowledge they gain
can truly transform their lives,

00:29:11.562 --> 00:29:14.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ll see in the story
of Moses Maphoto.

00:29:19.236 --> 00:29:22.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
One night, the police came into our home.

00:29:22.406 --> 00:29:25.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
They kicked open the doors,

00:29:25.159 --> 00:29:27.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they broke the windows.

00:29:36.462 --> 00:29:39.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told us that they were taking the house,

00:29:39.214 --> 00:29:41.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was no longer ours.

00:29:41.258 --> 00:29:43.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that incident,

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:45.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I became an angry person.

00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:47.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was angry,

00:29:47.931 --> 00:29:50.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I told myself that I would do anything

00:29:50.976 --> 00:29:53.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find justice and freedom.

00:29:55.397 --> 00:29:58.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
Apartheid caused divisions among people.

00:29:58.901 --> 00:29:59.902 line:10% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:29:59.902 --> 00:30:02.404 line:10% position:50% align:center
there was education meant for white people

00:30:02.404 --> 00:30:04.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and education meant for black people.

00:30:04.948 --> 00:30:06.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
The education for black people

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:10.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
was of a very low standard.

00:30:10.371 --> 00:30:12.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the government made a budget,

00:30:12.581 --> 00:30:16.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of that money was going to white people.

00:30:16.418 --> 00:30:18.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in the classrooms,

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
the black students’ classrooms were overcrowded

00:30:21.507 --> 00:30:24.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
compared to the white students’ classrooms.

00:30:25.052 --> 00:30:28.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
While I was growing up,
I was determined to become a lawyer

00:30:28.764 --> 00:30:32.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I would be able
to fight apartheid legally.

00:30:32.810 --> 00:30:37.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that cruel incident
and that harsh treatment,

00:30:37.022 --> 00:30:40.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
my view changed immediately.

00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:42.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I wanted an immediate solution

00:30:42.861 --> 00:30:45.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would help us find peace,

00:30:45.197 --> 00:30:48.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
find freedom, and find justice.

00:30:49.618 --> 00:30:53.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went on to join a political organization.

00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:57.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
I agreed to cross the border,

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I was being trained in the military.

00:31:01.046 --> 00:31:06.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
The political organization
made me a military commander of soldiers

00:31:06.677 --> 00:31:09.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were fighting for freedom.

00:31:10.639 --> 00:31:14.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
My responsibility

00:31:14.017 --> 00:31:16.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a commander

00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:19.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
was to establish cells

00:31:19.773 --> 00:31:24.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we could store our weapons for war

00:31:24.653 --> 00:31:27.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to train others

00:31:27.072 --> 00:31:30.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
who came to join that organization.

00:31:33.245 --> 00:31:37.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were training them in guerrilla warfare

00:31:37.291 --> 00:31:40.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
—showing them how to use guns

00:31:40.335 --> 00:31:43.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
or different explosives

00:31:43.297 --> 00:31:45.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we stored in those cells.

00:31:46.467 --> 00:31:50.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a very cruel person
who did not respect anyone,

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:53.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was not afraid of anything.

00:31:54.183 --> 00:31:56.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was not happy

00:31:56.185 --> 00:31:59.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I expected that

00:31:59.646 --> 00:32:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one organization,
we would be united

00:32:02.191 --> 00:32:04.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we had the same purpose.

00:32:06.403 --> 00:32:10.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my experience, there was hatred;

00:32:10.449 --> 00:32:12.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was prejudice;

00:32:12.451 --> 00:32:14.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was quarreling.

00:32:15.996 --> 00:32:20.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife
was already one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:32:20.459 --> 00:32:23.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
We agreed that she should find someone

00:32:23.295 --> 00:32:25.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would teach me about the Bible.

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:28.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister came

00:32:28.759 --> 00:32:31.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started telling me about the good news

00:32:31.637 --> 00:32:34.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s Kingdom.

00:32:34.348 --> 00:32:37.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
But things turned sour when she said

00:32:37.142 --> 00:32:39.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this Kingdom of God

00:32:39.603 --> 00:32:42.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
will crush all these other kingdoms,

00:32:42.773 --> 00:32:45.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
including my political organization.

00:32:49.446 --> 00:32:52.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was furious as I was talking to her,

00:32:52.366 --> 00:32:55.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I saw that she was just smiling

00:32:55.202 --> 00:32:58.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not shouting, not even retaliating.

00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was surprised.

00:33:00.123 --> 00:33:02.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
It touched my heart.

00:33:03.669 --> 00:33:06.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
They invited me to the Kingdom Hall.

00:33:07.464 --> 00:33:09.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
What really got my attention

00:33:09.758 --> 00:33:12.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that everywhere I looked,

00:33:12.177 --> 00:33:14.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone in the hall was participating.

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:18.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little children were raising their hands

00:33:18.267 --> 00:33:20.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
and giving their answers freely.

00:33:21.937 --> 00:33:26.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could see they were well-prepared
and stayed on the topic.

00:33:26.984 --> 00:33:29.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each and every one of them
found scriptures quickly.

00:33:31.113 --> 00:33:35.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a university student,
but I was unable to find the scriptures.

00:33:35.033 --> 00:33:38.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
That made me think,
‘Hey, I want to be the same as them.’

00:33:39.872 --> 00:33:41.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that the kind of education

00:33:41.957 --> 00:33:45.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they were receiving
in Jehovah’s organization

00:33:45.335 --> 00:33:48.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
was of a high standard

00:33:48.213 --> 00:33:50.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
compared to what we received
under apartheid,

00:33:50.757 --> 00:33:53.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was of a very low standard.

00:33:54.761 --> 00:33:56.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
From my experience,

00:33:56.388 --> 00:33:59.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is clear that trusting in people

00:33:59.725 --> 00:34:01.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
is ‘chasing the wind,’

00:34:01.768 --> 00:34:06.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
but putting trust in Jehovah God
brings people happiness.

00:34:09.818 --> 00:34:13.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I was young,
I just wanted to find freedom,

00:34:13.155 --> 00:34:15.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
find peace,

00:34:15.157 --> 00:34:17.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
and become a happy person.

00:34:17.367 --> 00:34:21.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I could not find it
until I came into the Kingdom Hall.

00:34:22.998 --> 00:34:25.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is where I found real freedom,

00:34:26.627 --> 00:34:29.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found real justice, I had real happiness,

00:34:30.631 --> 00:34:33.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was shown what real love is.

00:34:35.135 --> 00:34:37.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life has changed tremendously.

00:34:38.555 --> 00:34:40.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a close relationship with Jehovah.

00:34:43.477 --> 00:34:46.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
That relationship
caused me to become a loving person

00:34:48.106 --> 00:34:50.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a person who is empathetic,

00:34:50.859 --> 00:34:52.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who strives hard to be humble,

00:34:54.947 --> 00:34:57.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who lives with people in peace.

00:35:00.243 --> 00:35:04.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
I ‘clothed myself completely
with the new personality.’

00:35:11.004 --> 00:35:15.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses yearned for two things
—justice and unity—

00:35:15.884 --> 00:35:19.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learned that God’s Kingdom
offers the true solution.

00:35:21.974 --> 00:35:24.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word also contains principles

00:35:24.101 --> 00:35:26.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
that foster peace
in our personal relationships,

00:35:26.979 --> 00:35:28.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting at home.

00:35:28.981 --> 00:35:31.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:35:31.358 --> 00:35:35.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
note how regular Bible reading
promotes peace within marriage.

00:36:01.513 --> 00:36:06.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a marriage, not applying Bible principles
can lead to a lack of peace.

00:36:37.758 --> 00:36:39.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
As time passes,

00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:43.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the differences in opinion
and personality that arise

00:36:45.932 --> 00:36:48.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
can undermine the peace you once had.

00:36:51.938 --> 00:36:55.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can that peace so longed for be regained?

00:36:59.488 --> 00:37:03.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 26:3 says:

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:07.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will safeguard
those who fully lean on you;

00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:09.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will give them continuous peace,

00:37:09.623 --> 00:37:12.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it is in you that they trust.”

00:37:14.252 --> 00:37:19.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only Jehovah can give continuous peace
to those who fully lean on him.

00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham and Sarah, for example,
had that peace

00:37:23.512 --> 00:37:27.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
because, even during big life changes
and difficult situations,

00:37:27.557 --> 00:37:31.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
they faithfully followed Jehovah’s direction.

00:37:43.156 --> 00:37:46.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can demonstrate our trust in Jehovah

00:37:46.743 --> 00:37:49.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
by searching out his advice in his Word,

00:37:50.789 --> 00:37:52.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turning Bible reading
into a habit can seem daunting,

00:38:01.174 --> 00:38:03.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s worth the effort.

00:38:03.468 --> 00:38:07.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take advantage of every opportunity.

00:38:07.013 --> 00:38:10.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
See where you can make adjustments
in your routine.

00:38:11.852 --> 00:38:14.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
The advice found in the Bible

00:38:14.062 --> 00:38:16.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to peace in your marriage.

00:38:16.606 --> 00:38:20.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Matthew 7:12 says:

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:22.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All things, therefore,

00:38:22.654 --> 00:38:24.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you want men to do to you,

00:38:24.948 --> 00:38:27.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
you also must do to them.”

00:38:41.173 --> 00:38:43.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after reading,

00:38:43.175 --> 00:38:46.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t forget the most important step;

00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:48.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
apply what you learn.

00:38:49.389 --> 00:38:52.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a husband puts his wife’s interests
ahead of his own,

00:38:52.934 --> 00:38:55.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
she feels loved and valued

00:38:55.437 --> 00:38:57.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and vice versa.

00:39:10.619 --> 00:39:12.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another Bible principle

00:39:12.245 --> 00:39:16.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Matthew 5:5 says:

00:39:16.082 --> 00:39:18.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are the mild-tempered.”

00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:32.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
By controlling our temper,

00:39:32.432 --> 00:39:36.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
we create an environment
that is relaxed and peaceful.

00:39:40.732 --> 00:39:45.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while all are encouraged
to read the Bible as individuals,

00:39:45.195 --> 00:39:47.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
if circumstances allow,

00:39:47.405 --> 00:39:50.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider doing so as a couple.

00:39:50.492 --> 00:39:52.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about what you learned.

00:39:53.912 --> 00:39:57.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take advantage of the available study tools
to learn all you can

00:39:57.666 --> 00:39:59.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s marvelous qualities.

00:40:03.129 --> 00:40:04.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without a doubt,

00:40:04.547 --> 00:40:08.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
this will draw you closer to Jehovah

00:40:08.176 --> 00:40:12.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will strengthen
the “threefold cord” in your marriage.

00:40:45.255 --> 00:40:48.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even when life takes a turn

00:40:48.258 --> 00:40:49.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and things get hard,

00:40:55.557 --> 00:40:59.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will still be able to feel
the continuous peace

00:40:59.477 --> 00:41:01.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
that only Jehovah,

00:41:01.521 --> 00:41:04.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Originator of marriage, can provide.

00:41:09.487 --> 00:41:12.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it’s convenient to talk privately
with your spouse,

00:41:12.907 --> 00:41:14.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
why not pause this video

00:41:14.909 --> 00:41:17.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
and discuss these three questions?

00:41:24.294 --> 00:41:27.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
The dramatization
was both realistic and encouraging.

00:41:28.465 --> 00:41:31.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
When husbands and wives
read the Bible regularly,

00:41:31.634 --> 00:41:35.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
together and on their own,
and apply what they learn,

00:41:35.513 --> 00:41:38.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
they bring continuous peace
into the home.

00:41:41.061 --> 00:41:44.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible not only provides
timeless principles

00:41:44.105 --> 00:41:48.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also examples of real people
whose lives we can learn from.

00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:51.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of these is Job,

00:41:51.071 --> 00:41:55.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
who teaches us
timeless lessons about integrity.

00:41:55.033 --> 00:41:57.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the focus of this morning worship,

00:41:57.452 --> 00:41:59.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
presented by Brother Robert Ciranko.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know that in the Bible

00:42:02.415 --> 00:42:05.794 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah accredits just two of his worshippers

00:42:05.794 --> 00:42:07.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
as having integrity

00:42:07.837 --> 00:42:10.048 line:10% position:50% align:center
—David and Job?

00:42:10.048 --> 00:42:12.467 line:10% position:50% align:center
Regarding David, at 1 Kings 9:4,

00:42:12.467 --> 00:42:14.344 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told Solomon:

00:42:14.344 --> 00:42:17.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Walk before me as your father David walked,

00:42:17.597 --> 00:42:19.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
with integrity of heart.”

00:42:20.392 --> 00:42:22.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
And twice when speaking to Satan,

00:42:22.394 --> 00:42:25.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said of Job:
“There is no one like him on the earth.

00:42:25.939 --> 00:42:28.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is an upright man of integrity.”

00:42:29.567 --> 00:42:32.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
the Bible is filled with other examples

00:42:32.237 --> 00:42:35.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
of men and women who had similar reputations.

00:42:35.323 --> 00:42:37.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can think of Abraham,

00:42:37.325 --> 00:42:39.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel and his three companions,

00:42:39.327 --> 00:42:42.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the ones that Paul listed
in Hebrews chapter 11.

00:42:42.747 --> 00:42:44.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are just a few.

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:48.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
the finest example of all is Jesus Christ.

00:42:49.170 --> 00:42:52.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Jehovah takes note of, values,

00:42:52.382 --> 00:42:55.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
and loves people with integrity,

00:42:55.802 --> 00:43:00.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is a quality
that every faithful servant of God needs.

00:43:00.723 --> 00:43:03.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
But exactly what is that quality?

00:43:03.977 --> 00:43:07.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, integrity is moral soundness,

00:43:07.188 --> 00:43:10.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
an unswerving devotion to righteousness.

00:43:10.316 --> 00:43:15.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having integrity means
having strong ethical and moral principles

00:43:15.196 --> 00:43:18.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and following those principles at all times.

00:43:18.491 --> 00:43:21.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can say
that such people do the right thing,

00:43:21.286 --> 00:43:25.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when that is not easy
and no one is watching.

00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:28.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, integrity is most evident

00:43:28.376 --> 00:43:31.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a person’s devotion is under test

00:43:31.171 --> 00:43:34.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is pressured to abandon
the right course.

00:43:35.216 --> 00:43:39.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how does a person develop integrity?

00:43:39.137 --> 00:43:43.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it all starts
with defining one’s core values,

00:43:43.892 --> 00:43:47.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, the values
that no matter what the consequences,

00:43:47.312 --> 00:43:50.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are not going to compromise them.

00:43:50.607 --> 00:43:54.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this, Job is an excellent example.

00:43:54.402 --> 00:43:56.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were his core values?

00:43:56.988 --> 00:43:58.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t have to wonder.

00:43:58.615 --> 00:44:01.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn to Job 1:1.

00:44:02.619 --> 00:44:06.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “There was a man in the land of Uz
whose name was Job.

00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:09.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was an upright man of integrity;

00:44:09.292 --> 00:44:13.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
he feared God and shunned what was bad.”

00:44:13.838 --> 00:44:16.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were Job’s core values.

00:44:16.883 --> 00:44:20.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a reverent, deep respect for Jehovah

00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:24.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a wholesome dread of disobeying him.

00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:27.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was right in line
with what Solomon wrote

00:44:27.352 --> 00:44:29.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
hundreds of years later

00:44:29.354 --> 00:44:32.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ecclesiastes 12:13.

00:44:32.524 --> 00:44:33.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d like to look at that.

00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:36.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 12:13:

00:44:37.237 --> 00:44:40.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The conclusion of the matter,
everything having been heard, is:

00:44:40.657 --> 00:44:43.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fear the true God
and keep his commandments,

00:44:43.993 --> 00:44:47.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this is the whole obligation of man,”

00:44:47.747 --> 00:44:50.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
or as the modern paraphrase puts it:

00:44:50.416 --> 00:44:53.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fear God.
Do what he tells you.”

00:44:54.212 --> 00:44:57.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the text comments for today,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  states:

00:44:57.298 --> 00:44:59.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For servants of Jehovah,

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
the key to integrity is love” for God.

00:45:02.679 --> 00:45:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it adds that along with that

00:45:04.681 --> 00:45:08.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be “our loyal devotion to him
as our heavenly Father.”

00:45:09.894 --> 00:45:13.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans show integrity when they
are so completely devoted to God

00:45:13.898 --> 00:45:18.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they continue to do his will
when facing hardship.

00:45:18.486 --> 00:45:20.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, even in his worst moment,

00:45:20.822 --> 00:45:23.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job refused to turn against God.

00:45:23.199 --> 00:45:25.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is why he said:

00:45:25.201 --> 00:45:29.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Until I die,
I will not renounce my integrity!”

00:45:30.206 --> 00:45:34.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each of us has the responsibility
and the privilege, just like Job,

00:45:34.502 --> 00:45:37.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
to demonstrate
that we serve and obey Jehovah

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:39.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we love him.

00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:43.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, in Job chapter 31,

00:45:43.845 --> 00:45:47.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job lists about a dozen real-life examples

00:45:47.682 --> 00:45:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if they had been true of him

00:45:50.059 --> 00:45:53.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
would have exposed
a lack of integrity on his part.

00:45:53.646 --> 00:45:55.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at just a few of these,

00:45:55.773 --> 00:45:58.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in doing so,
it can help us to see

00:45:58.484 --> 00:46:01.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we can do to keep our integrity.

00:46:01.696 --> 00:46:04.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting with verse 9 of Job chapter 31,

00:46:04.532 --> 00:46:09.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said,
“if my heart has been enticed by a woman.”

00:46:09.454 --> 00:46:10.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 11, he said:

00:46:10.913 --> 00:46:15.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That would be shameful conduct,
an error deserving judgment by the judges.”

00:46:16.586 --> 00:46:19.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know Job kept himself clean
from immorality,

00:46:19.881 --> 00:46:21.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
because in verse 1 of that same chapter,

00:46:21.883 --> 00:46:24.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said he
had “made a covenant with his eyes”

00:46:24.135 --> 00:46:27.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to “show improper attention”
to another woman.

00:46:27.847 --> 00:46:30.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he not only avoided committing adultery,

00:46:30.975 --> 00:46:34.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he had not even taken
the first step toward that sin

00:46:34.228 --> 00:46:37.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
by looking lustfully at other women.

00:46:37.398 --> 00:46:40.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
So people of integrity

00:46:40.151 --> 00:46:42.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
uphold Jehovah’s standard of morality

00:46:42.737 --> 00:46:44.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sanctity of marriage.

00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example is in verse 16, he said,

00:46:48.284 --> 00:46:52.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if I refused to give the poor
what they desired.”

00:46:52.121 --> 00:46:56.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in verse 17, he included the need
to share his food “with the orphans.”

00:46:57.585 --> 00:47:00.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know Job was generous
to the poor and needy,

00:47:00.672 --> 00:47:04.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at Job 29:12,
he said he “would rescue the poor . . . ,

00:47:04.634 --> 00:47:07.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fatherless child
and anyone who had no helper.”

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:13.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
So people of integrity value others
and help those who are in need,

00:47:13.059 --> 00:47:15.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they look after orphans and widows.

00:47:16.646 --> 00:47:18.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example is in verse 24.

00:47:18.648 --> 00:47:22.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, “if I put my confidence in gold.”

00:47:22.402 --> 00:47:25.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job was wealthy at the start,

00:47:25.321 --> 00:47:28.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was not greedily materialistic.

00:47:28.574 --> 00:47:31.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when he lost all his wealth,

00:47:31.077 --> 00:47:33.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
he accepted the fact that, as he said:

00:47:33.830 --> 00:47:38.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Naked he came out of his mother’s womb
and naked he would return.’

00:47:38.292 --> 00:47:42.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
So people of integrity
do not put their trust in material things;

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
they put the Kingdom first in their life.

00:47:45.258 --> 00:47:47.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
One more example is in verse 33.

00:47:47.885 --> 00:47:52.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Have I ever tried
to cover over my transgressions?”

00:47:53.266 --> 00:47:55.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Job 13:23,

00:47:55.476 --> 00:48:00.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Job asked for his sins and transgressions
to be revealed.

00:48:00.732 --> 00:48:03.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the end, he accepted reproof

00:48:03.484 --> 00:48:07.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his being too quick
to declare himself righteous.

00:48:07.739 --> 00:48:11.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after Elihu and Jehovah
both chastened Job,

00:48:11.826 --> 00:48:14.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
he repented in dust and ashes.

00:48:14.912 --> 00:48:18.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
So people of integrity
are quick to own up to their own mistakes

00:48:18.708 --> 00:48:20.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and accept correction.

00:48:21.377 --> 00:48:25.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Surely Job was a model of integrity.

00:48:25.047 --> 00:48:28.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know that he requested
that a written record be made

00:48:28.509 --> 00:48:31.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his suffering and endurance?

00:48:31.137 --> 00:48:32.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did.

00:48:32.138 --> 00:48:35.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you turn to Job chapter 19

00:48:35.308 --> 00:48:37.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Job 19—

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting with verse 23,

00:48:41.355 --> 00:48:42.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said:

00:48:42.356 --> 00:48:45.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If only my words were written down,

00:48:45.026 --> 00:48:47.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if only they could be inscribed in a book!

00:48:47.987 --> 00:48:50.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O that they were carved forever in the rock,

00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:54.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
with an iron stylus and lead!”

00:48:55.244 --> 00:48:57.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
How thankful we are that Jehovah agreed

00:48:57.371 --> 00:49:01.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a permanent record
of Job’s integrity-keeping course

00:49:01.167 --> 00:49:03.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he put it in the Bible

00:49:03.169 --> 00:49:07.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
and did not have it chiseled on some rock

00:49:07.215 --> 00:49:10.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the middle of Arabia where Job lived!

00:49:11.511 --> 00:49:15.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you sum up the story
of Job in one sentence?

00:49:15.348 --> 00:49:19.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one Bible commentary
does quite well by stating:

00:49:19.602 --> 00:49:21.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The beauty of the book of Job

00:49:21.604 --> 00:49:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is of a living, breathing soul

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:26.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“encompassed by sorrows,

00:49:26.692 --> 00:49:29.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“surrounded by misunderstanding

00:49:29.278 --> 00:49:32.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but unconquered, humbled,

00:49:32.323 --> 00:49:34.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finally satisfied in God.”

00:49:36.202 --> 00:49:40.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through Job’s life, we learned
that no matter what trials we may encounter,

00:49:40.540 --> 00:49:42.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
having a close relationship with Jehovah

00:49:42.834 --> 00:49:46.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and staying true to our core values

00:49:46.629 --> 00:49:49.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
will enable us to maintain our integrity

00:49:49.757 --> 00:49:51.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that when we are tested,

00:49:51.759 --> 00:49:55.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
God will support us just as he did Job.

00:49:55.847 --> 00:49:57.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 84:11 says:

00:49:57.849 --> 00:50:01.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will not hold back anything good

00:50:01.018 --> 00:50:03.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
from those walking in integrity.”

00:50:04.313 --> 00:50:07.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we show
our complete, wholehearted devotion to God

00:50:07.817 --> 00:50:10.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
by obeying him
and doing what is right in his eyes

00:50:10.945 --> 00:50:14.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our everyday lives,
even when facing hardships,

00:50:14.323 --> 00:50:16.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will surely make Jehovah happy

00:50:16.951 --> 00:50:19.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
and frustrate his enemy, Satan,

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:22.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Job did so long ago.

00:50:23.916 --> 00:50:25.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Job, you young ones

00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:29.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
have many opportunities
to show your devotion to God

00:50:29.005 --> 00:50:31.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the choices you make.

00:50:31.883 --> 00:50:35.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our new music video,
<i>The Road to Life,</i>

00:50:35.011 --> 00:50:38.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
will strengthen your conviction
to stay close to Jehovah.

00:50:47.565 --> 00:50:51.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re young,
it’s hard to find your way—

00:50:51.944 --> 00:50:56.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Decisions every day:

00:50:56.032 --> 00:51:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who to be, what to love,
where to put your trust.

00:51:01.037 --> 00:51:04.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not easy to find your place.

00:51:04.415 --> 00:51:13.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know how I feel,
That Jehovah is real.

00:51:13.090 --> 00:51:21.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows what I need.
I will succeed if I follow his lead.

00:51:21.766 --> 00:51:30.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
With his Word, I know the way to go.
Jehovah’s with me all the way, I know.

00:51:30.191 --> 00:51:35.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I will keep myself on this road to life.

00:51:42.411 --> 00:51:50.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are paths my heart wants me to choose;
Jehovah sees that too.

00:51:50.711 --> 00:51:59.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I pray ev’ry day to keep on the way,
And he helps me to see what is true.

00:51:59.178 --> 00:52:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the brotherhood,
I always feel so good.

00:52:07.770 --> 00:52:16.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
’Cause with the love I’m shown,
I can be sure that I’m never alone.

00:52:16.696 --> 00:52:24.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
With his Word, I know the way to go.
Jehovah’s with me all the way, I know.

00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:30.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I will keep myself on this road to life.

00:53:00.823 --> 00:53:05.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t look back
on where I could have been.

00:53:05.077 --> 00:53:10.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll keep looking forward
to a life that never ends.

00:53:10.207 --> 00:53:17.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
With his Word, I know the way to go.
Jehovah’s with me all the way, I know.

00:53:17.631 --> 00:53:22.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I will keep myself on this road to life,

00:53:28.059 --> 00:53:34.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the road to life.

00:53:53.125 --> 00:53:56.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve enjoyed
a faith-strengthening program.

00:53:56.796 --> 00:53:59.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned how to find comfort
despite severe tests of faith,

00:54:01.342 --> 00:54:03.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
how husbands and wives
gain continuous peace

00:54:03.719 --> 00:54:06.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
by faithfully reading God’s Word,

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:10.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
how everyday conversations
may lead to Bible studies,

00:54:13.145 --> 00:54:16.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how studying the Bible
can be life-changing, giving people hope.

00:54:18.776 --> 00:54:21.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we say goodbye,
it’s time for our postcard.

00:54:22.696 --> 00:54:27.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you envision a paradise,
you may think of pristine beaches,

00:54:27.243 --> 00:54:30.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
swaying palm trees, rain forests,

00:54:30.538 --> 00:54:33.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
and coral reefs teeming with life.

00:54:33.290 --> 00:54:36.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may picture Samoa.

00:54:37.128 --> 00:54:41.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Samoan islands sparkle like gems
in the South Pacific Ocean.

00:54:42.174 --> 00:54:44.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
The islands are divided into two parts:

00:54:44.718 --> 00:54:47.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samoa and American Samoa.

00:54:47.721 --> 00:54:50.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although separated
by only about 65 kilometers,

00:54:50.891 --> 00:54:52.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
or about 40 miles,

00:54:52.893 --> 00:54:55.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
they lie on either side
of the international date line,

00:54:55.771 --> 00:54:58.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
creating a time difference of a full day.

00:55:00.317 --> 00:55:04.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that each year, one of the first
Memorial talks is given in Samoa

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:08.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
while one of the last
is held in American Samoa.

00:55:09.952 --> 00:55:12.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
The coconut tree is abundant here.

00:55:13.330 --> 00:55:17.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Samoans call it “the tree of life”
because it can be used

00:55:17.376 --> 00:55:22.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
for food, drink,
medicine, fuel, and shelter.

00:55:22.381 --> 00:55:27.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1940, Harold Gill
visited the Samoan islands to preach

00:55:27.219 --> 00:55:29.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
but was promptly asked to leave.

00:55:30.389 --> 00:55:33.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the five days
before the next boat sailed,

00:55:33.225 --> 00:55:37.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
he distributed literature
far and wide by bicycle.

00:55:37.313 --> 00:55:40.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
One booklet found its way
to Pele Fuaiupolu.

00:55:40.649 --> 00:55:43.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twelve years later, in 1952,

00:55:43.527 --> 00:55:46.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Pele met a brother
from England at work,

00:55:46.655 --> 00:55:51.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
he and his wife, Ailua,
became the first Samoans to be baptized.

00:55:52.411 --> 00:55:55.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today there are 12 congregations

00:55:55.497 --> 00:55:57.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 606 publishers in Samoa.

00:55:59.543 --> 00:56:02.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers at the remote translation office
on the island of Upolu

00:56:02.838 --> 00:56:05.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
translate publications into Samoan.

00:56:05.591 --> 00:56:07.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Witnesses can be found preaching

00:56:07.468 --> 00:56:10.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Apia, Samoa’s main port.

00:56:10.638 --> 00:56:14.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
But most Samoans
live in rural coastal areas,

00:56:14.141 --> 00:56:16.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
so our brothers witness in villages,

00:56:16.727 --> 00:56:18.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
taro plantations,

00:56:18.604 --> 00:56:20.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the remote island of Manono

00:56:20.397 --> 00:56:22.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
reachable only by boat.

00:56:23.609 --> 00:56:26.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
With no cars on Manono,

00:56:26.237 --> 00:56:29.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
publishers walk the island
in search of interested ones.

00:56:30.282 --> 00:56:33.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our brothers
get together for association,

00:56:34.078 --> 00:56:36.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
they enjoy delicious foods,
including taro,

00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
breadfruit, coconut milk, <i>oka </i>

00:56:39.875 --> 00:56:42.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
—which is raw fish in coconut cream—

00:56:42.336 --> 00:56:46.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their famous hot chocolate,
<i>Koko Samoa.</i>

00:56:47.675 --> 00:56:51.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
On Sundays, families spend hours together
enjoying a feast of foods

00:56:51.762 --> 00:56:54.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
cooked in a traditional <i>umu,</i>

00:56:54.473 --> 00:56:56.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
an above-ground oven

00:56:56.517 --> 00:56:58.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
made of volcanic rock.

00:56:58.519 --> 00:57:02.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
They enjoy music, singing,
and traditional dancing

00:57:02.898 --> 00:57:06.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the <i>siva</i> and <i>fa’ataupati,</i> or “slap dance.”

00:57:08.279 --> 00:57:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Saleapaga Congregation
is on the island of Upolu.

00:57:12.825 --> 00:57:16.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its territory includes beaches
and the To-Sua Ocean Trench,

00:57:16.787 --> 00:57:19.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
a volcanic swimming hole
popular with tourists.

00:57:20.624 --> 00:57:24.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 21 publishers
of the Saleapaga Congregation

00:57:24.586 --> 00:57:27.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their warm love and greetings.

00:57:28.507 --> 00:57:31.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:57:31.468 --> 00:57:34.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
