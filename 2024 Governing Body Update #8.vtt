00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:03.566 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome to our program!

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.610 line:10% position:50% align:center
To begin, we have a few updates

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.196 line:10% position:50% align:center
about our brothers and sisters in Eritrea.

00:00:09.822 --> 00:00:11.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you’ll recall,

00:00:11.824 --> 00:00:13.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
in September 2024,

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:17.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
the authorities imprisoned
23 brothers and sisters

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:19.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were peacefully meeting together.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very pleased to inform you

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:26.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
that on December 7, 2024,

00:00:26.046 --> 00:00:28.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Saron Ghebru,

00:00:28.048 --> 00:00:30.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was eight months pregnant at the time,

00:00:30.926 --> 00:00:33.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
was released from prison.

00:00:33.262 --> 00:00:36.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice over this positive development.

00:00:37.141 --> 00:00:41.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, her husband,
Brother Fitsum Goitom,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
remains in prison for his faith.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, Eritrean authorities

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
have recently imprisoned five more
of our brothers and sisters.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
On November 1, 2024,

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:58.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
national security officials
arrested four Witnesses,

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
aged 16 to 18:

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:04.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Zesani Biniam

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:06.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Ebenezer Yonas

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:09.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sisters Sidon Tekeste

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:11.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Horeb Tekeste.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young brothers and sisters
were interrogated

00:01:14.845 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
and immediately taken
to the Mai Serwa Prison.

00:01:19.892 --> 00:01:23.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
On November 22, 2024,

00:01:23.187 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Almaz Gebrehiwot

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
received a telephone call stating

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
that officials had taken
her daughter to the police station.

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Sister Almaz went to the station,

00:01:35.824 --> 00:01:39.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
the officials detained her
but released her daughter.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
As of December 23, 2024,

00:01:44.541 --> 00:01:49.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are now 68 brothers
and sisters in Eritrea

00:01:49.338 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:01:52.883 --> 00:01:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please continue to pray
for these dear brothers and sisters

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:02.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as for all of those
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:06.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
As reported on jw.org,

00:02:06.772 --> 00:02:09.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
on November 6, 2024,

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:12.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Town of Ramapo Planning Board

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave approval for the Ramapo site plan.

00:02:16.115 --> 00:02:19.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that major construction activities

00:02:19.076 --> 00:02:21.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
may now begin.

00:02:21.078 --> 00:02:24.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re grateful to the town board
for this approval.

00:02:24.498 --> 00:02:27.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
But above all, we thank Jehovah!

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:32.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
What work has been accomplished
on the Ramapo project?

00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:35.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s on the horizon?

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:38.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re sure you’ll enjoy the following report.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are thrilled that final permission
for the Ramapo project

00:02:48.981 --> 00:02:51.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been approved
by the town planning board.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what the site looks like now.

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:12.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
A tremendous amount of preparation work

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
has already been done,
including much of the design work.

00:03:16.031 --> 00:03:17.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
The site has been cleared

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
and temporary construction-support facilities
have been installed.

00:03:20.744 --> 00:03:21.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with this approval,

00:03:21.953 --> 00:03:25.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can now start
the construction work itself.

00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:40.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the next weeks and months,

00:03:40.347 --> 00:03:42.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
contractors will begin rock blasting

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
to level the land
where the buildings will be.

00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:47.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the size of the area
that will be developed

00:03:47.646 --> 00:03:49.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the landscape,

00:03:49.022 --> 00:03:52.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
this activity will take
approximately 18 months to complete.

00:03:52.442 --> 00:03:54.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a comparison,

00:03:54.486 --> 00:03:56.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rock blasting on the Warwick project

00:03:56.321 --> 00:03:58.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
took less than six months.

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:02.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rock will then be crushed

00:04:02.118 --> 00:04:04.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
and used to level out other parts of the site

00:04:04.538 --> 00:04:08.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for large retaining walls
—all of which will result in cost savings.

00:04:12.128 --> 00:04:13.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the next 12 to 18 months,

00:04:14.673 --> 00:04:16.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
volunteers will start installing

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:18.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
the underground utilities,

00:04:18.176 --> 00:04:19.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two entrances

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:21.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the property will be complete,

00:04:21.137 --> 00:04:24.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the first building foundations
will also be laid.

00:04:25.267 --> 00:04:28.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will quickly lead
to structures coming out of the ground,

00:04:28.562 --> 00:04:32.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the parking garage
and the residence buildings.

00:05:08.018 --> 00:05:11.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are greatly enjoying
Jehovah’s rich blessing

00:05:11.271 --> 00:05:13.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this exciting
world headquarters project.

00:05:17.736 --> 00:05:20.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for Jehovah’s continued guidance

00:05:20.822 --> 00:05:23.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and blessing on the Ramapo project.

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re grateful to all of you
dear brothers and sisters

00:05:27.954 --> 00:05:31.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
who support the Kingdom work worldwide.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:36.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
You show the spirit
of those mentioned at Psalm 110:3:

00:05:37.547 --> 00:05:40.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your people will offer themselves willingly

00:05:40.717 --> 00:05:43.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the day of your military force.

00:05:43.553 --> 00:05:45.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In splendid holiness,

00:05:45.764 --> 00:05:47.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the womb of the dawn,

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:52.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have your company
of young men just like dewdrops.”

00:05:53.188 --> 00:05:56.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
While many assignments
are in the background,

00:05:56.441 --> 00:05:59.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
some assignments are more visible to others

00:05:59.945 --> 00:06:04.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, various brothers and sisters

00:06:04.366 --> 00:06:07.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
who appear in photos in our publications

00:06:07.452 --> 00:06:10.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
or who are used in our videos.

00:06:11.706 --> 00:06:14.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent years, our organization

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:17.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
has produced hundreds of videos,

00:06:17.253 --> 00:06:19.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
including full-length dramas.

00:06:20.632 --> 00:06:22.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
At our conventions this year,

00:06:22.926 --> 00:06:26.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
no doubt you appreciated
viewing the first episode

00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:30.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to all 18 episodes.

00:06:34.854 --> 00:06:38.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
We deeply appreciate the time and hard work

00:06:38.525 --> 00:06:41.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
that various brothers and sisters contribute

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make these projects come to life.

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:48.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many from around the world
have appeared in our videos.

00:06:49.786 --> 00:06:54.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases,
a brother or sister has been interviewed

00:06:54.416 --> 00:06:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
or has told an experience
from their own life.

00:06:58.586 --> 00:07:02.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other cases, they may have portrayed
a Bible character

00:07:02.465 --> 00:07:05.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even a modern-day character.

00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:10.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be that you know someone
in your local area who’s had this privilege.

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s an important question:

00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:18.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should we view
those who appear in our videos?

00:07:19.441 --> 00:07:22.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who appear in theocratic videos

00:07:22.444 --> 00:07:25.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
are dedicated, humble servants of Jehovah.

00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:29.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t seek fame or glory for themselves.

00:07:29.784 --> 00:07:31.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Quite the opposite.

00:07:31.703 --> 00:07:34.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want the glory to go to Jehovah!

00:07:35.623 --> 00:07:38.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, the majority of our brotherhood

00:07:38.585 --> 00:07:40.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
maintains this proper perspective.

00:07:41.463 --> 00:07:45.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, there’s a caution
for us as viewers:

00:07:45.717 --> 00:07:49.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must avoid transferring our admiration

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:51.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Biblical characters

00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:54.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the brothers and sisters
who portray them on-screen.

00:07:55.518 --> 00:07:59.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we imitate the faith
of the men and women

00:07:59.689 --> 00:08:01.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded in God’s Word.

00:08:02.525 --> 00:08:05.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could it affect a video participant

00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:10.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we gave him undue attention,
treating him like a celebrity?

00:08:10.909 --> 00:08:13.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could feel embarrassed or self-conscious.

00:08:14.788 --> 00:08:18.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
This could happen if we ask these ones

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:20.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we could take a photo with them.

00:08:21.086 --> 00:08:25.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be even worse
if we posted it on social media,

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:27.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even adding comments.

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:32.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Jude 16, the Bible condemns

00:08:32.013 --> 00:08:35.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who were “flattering others
for their own benefit.”

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote on that verse

00:08:38.061 --> 00:08:41.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes this as “admiring personalities.”

00:08:43.191 --> 00:08:45.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our video participants

00:08:45.527 --> 00:08:49.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
have become overwhelmed
by the inordinate attention.

00:08:50.365 --> 00:08:54.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some no longer feel comfortable attending
large gatherings of Jehovah’s people.

00:08:55.912 --> 00:08:59.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s vital to have the right perspective

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:02.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who appear in our videos.

00:09:03.795 --> 00:09:05.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of a Bible example

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:08.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
of someone who was given
inappropriate attention

00:09:08.758 --> 00:09:10.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he carried out his assignment?

00:09:11.553 --> 00:09:14.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you think of Paul and Barnabas.

00:09:15.223 --> 00:09:17.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts chapter 14 reports

00:09:17.517 --> 00:09:20.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they became the center of attention

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:23.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
after Paul cured a man
who had been lame from birth.

00:09:24.816 --> 00:09:28.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a faith-strengthening miracle

00:09:28.278 --> 00:09:33.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
intended to move people
to praise and glorify Jehovah and his Son.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:35.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happened?

00:09:35.201 --> 00:09:37.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Onlookers missed the point.

00:09:37.871 --> 00:09:39.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
They became enthralled

00:09:39.914 --> 00:09:42.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Paul and Barnabas instead.

00:09:43.126 --> 00:09:45.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 14:11, 12 says:

00:09:45.753 --> 00:09:49.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the crowds saw what Paul had done,

00:09:49.716 --> 00:09:53.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they cried out in the Lycaonian language:

00:09:53.011 --> 00:09:57.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The gods have become like humans
and have come down to us!’

00:09:57.348 --> 00:10:00.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And they started calling Barnabas Zeus,

00:10:00.018 --> 00:10:04.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Paul Hermes, since he was
taking the lead in speaking.”

00:10:05.190 --> 00:10:06.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the issue?

00:10:06.983 --> 00:10:10.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of appreciating Jehovah’s miracle,

00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:13.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
they became enamored
by the visible participants.

00:10:14.324 --> 00:10:17.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Paul and Barnabas
appreciate the attention?

00:10:17.994 --> 00:10:21.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verses 14 and 15:

00:10:21.122 --> 00:10:24.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, when the apostles
Barnabas and Paul heard of it,

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:29.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they ripped their garments
and leaped out into the crowd and cried out:

00:10:29.339 --> 00:10:32.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Men, why are you doing these things?

00:10:32.967 --> 00:10:37.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘We too are humans
having the same infirmities as you have.

00:10:37.472 --> 00:10:40.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And we are declaring the good news to you,

00:10:40.225 --> 00:10:44.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for you to turn from these vain things
to the living God,

00:10:44.979 --> 00:10:47.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘who made the heaven and the earth

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sea and all the things in them.’”

00:10:50.526 --> 00:10:54.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul and Barnabas
were quick to set the record straight.

00:10:54.656 --> 00:10:58.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
They readily admitted they were just humans.

00:10:58.993 --> 00:11:02.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
They explained that their purpose
was to declare the good news

00:11:02.038 --> 00:11:04.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
about “the living God.”

00:11:04.123 --> 00:11:07.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same was true of Jesus.

00:11:07.001 --> 00:11:10.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted people to glorify God.

00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:12.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, on one occasion,

00:11:12.924 --> 00:11:16.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
the crowd became so impressed
by Jesus himself

00:11:16.678 --> 00:11:19.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they failed to grasp
the meaning of his teaching.

00:11:20.556 --> 00:11:23.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 6:14, 15 reports:

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:26.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the people saw the sign he performed,

00:11:26.521 --> 00:11:28.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they began to say:

00:11:28.564 --> 00:11:32.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This really is
the Prophet who was to come into the world.’

00:11:32.485 --> 00:11:35.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jesus, knowing
that they were about to come

00:11:35.989 --> 00:11:38.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and seize him to make him king,

00:11:38.241 --> 00:11:42.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
withdrew again to the mountain all alone.”

00:11:43.162 --> 00:11:46.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not want the prominence.

00:11:46.207 --> 00:11:48.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
He literally walked away from them

00:11:48.459 --> 00:11:51.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “withdrew . . .
to the mountain all alone.”

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:54.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do these Bible examples

00:11:54.424 --> 00:11:58.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to have the right view
of those who appear in our videos?

00:11:59.637 --> 00:12:03.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters
who appear in our videos

00:12:03.099 --> 00:12:07.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
are humbly carrying out an assignment
from the organization.

00:12:07.186 --> 00:12:10.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Paul, Barnabas, and Jesus,

00:12:10.148 --> 00:12:13.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
they want the attention and glory
to go to Jehovah.

00:12:14.444 --> 00:12:17.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, some brothers and sisters

00:12:17.196 --> 00:12:20.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
are assigned to portray servants of Jehovah.

00:12:20.825 --> 00:12:25.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
But others are assigned
to portray enemies of Jehovah.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine how difficult it would be

00:12:28.541 --> 00:12:33.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a faithful brother or sister
to portray an enemy of Jehovah?

00:12:34.213 --> 00:12:37.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would not want to make that assignment
even more difficult

00:12:37.925 --> 00:12:42.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
by developing negative feelings
toward the individuals who play such roles.

00:12:43.556 --> 00:12:45.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, balance is needed

00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:49.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
in how we treat those
who play roles in our videos.

00:12:50.855 --> 00:12:54.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we continue to preserve
the peace and unity

00:12:54.776 --> 00:12:58.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our worldwide brotherhood
by giving Jehovah the glory

00:12:58.946 --> 00:13:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not the brothers and sisters
who appear in our videos.

00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:06.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we discussed
in our update?

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:10.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice that Sister Saron Ghebru

00:13:10.249 --> 00:13:12.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
was released from prison in Eritrea.

00:13:13.294 --> 00:13:15.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we continue to pray

00:13:15.671 --> 00:13:20.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the over 235 brothers and sisters
around the world

00:13:20.176 --> 00:13:22.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:26.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re excited about the recent approval

00:13:26.432 --> 00:13:28.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Ramapo Town Board,

00:13:28.434 --> 00:13:33.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will allow major construction
to begin on the Ramapo project.

00:13:34.023 --> 00:13:36.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also considered the importance

00:13:36.442 --> 00:13:41.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
of maintaining a balanced view
of those who appear in our videos.

00:13:42.615 --> 00:13:46.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please know
that we love you all very much.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:50.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:13:50.957 --> 00:13:54.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.
