00:00.950 --> 00:03.753
In the book 
Insight on the Scriptures, 


00:03.753 --> 00:05.788
under the heading “Christian,” 


00:05.788 --> 00:08.056
it makes clear that claiming to be Christian 


00:08.057 --> 00:10.127
requires more than simply 


00:10.127 --> 00:12.129
a mere confession of faith. 


00:12.128 --> 00:14.996
It is more than 
being a nominal Christian


00:14.997 --> 00:17.167
—a Christian in name only.


00:17.167 --> 00:19.669
For example, 
according to the Bible, 


00:19.668 --> 00:21.838
it is necessary that belief 


00:21.838 --> 00:25.408
be demonstrated by works, 
not just words. 


00:25.408 --> 00:28.010
And since we were born 
as sinners, 


00:28.010 --> 00:31.247
those who become Christians 
need to repent, 


00:31.247 --> 00:35.119
to turn around, 
to dedicate their lives to Jehovah, 


00:35.118 --> 00:37.153
to worship and serve him, 


00:37.153 --> 00:40.490
and then to submit 
to water baptism. 


00:40.490 --> 00:43.660
They must keep themselves 
clean from fornication, 


00:43.660 --> 00:47.163
from idolatry, 
and from consuming blood. 


00:47.163 --> 00:50.366
They are to strip off 
the old personality, 


00:50.367 --> 00:54.470
including such things 
as fits of anger, obscene talk, 


00:54.470 --> 00:57.807
lying, stealing, drunkenness, 


00:57.807 --> 01:02.712
and as Galatians chapter 5 says: 
“things like these.” 


01:02.712 --> 01:07.384
Yes, they are to bring their lives 
into accord with Bible principles. 


01:07.383 --> 01:10.153
Christians are to be 
kind and considerate, 


01:10.153 --> 01:12.155
mild-tempered and patient, 


01:12.155 --> 01:15.158
and are to exercise self-control. 


01:15.158 --> 01:17.526
They provide 
and care for their own 


01:17.527 --> 01:20.664
and love 
their neighbor as themselves. 


01:20.663 --> 01:23.466
That’s a lot, isn’t it? 


01:23.467 --> 01:27.404
It’s not a matter 
of just glibly saying, 


01:27.403 --> 01:29.405
“I am a Christian.”


01:29.405 --> 01:32.742
But despite all of those 
impressive characteristics 


01:32.742 --> 01:34.910
that we just enumerated, 


01:34.910 --> 01:37.013
what did Jesus say 


01:37.013 --> 01:39.915
the main identifying quality 


01:39.915 --> 01:42.318
of a true Christian would be? 


01:42.318 --> 01:46.555
Most of you know the answer to that, 
but let’s read it again 


01:46.555 --> 01:51.593
from John 13:34, 35. 


01:51.593 --> 01:55.365
It says: “I am giving you 
a new commandment, 


01:55.365 --> 01:59.135
“that you love one another; 
just as I have loved you, 


01:59.135 --> 02:02.005
“you also love one another. 


02:02.005 --> 02:05.542
“By this all will know 
that you are my disciples


02:05.542 --> 02:10.547
—if you have love among yourselves.”


02:10.547 --> 02:13.015
Those are the theme verses 


02:13.015 --> 02:15.385
for my discussion 
with you this month. 


02:15.385 --> 02:17.387
The topic is: 


02:17.387 --> 02:21.925
“Love—The Identifying Mark 
of a Disciple of Jesus.”


02:21.925 --> 02:25.462
Did you notice 
in verse 34 that Jesus said 


02:25.462 --> 02:30.400
that he was giving them 
at that time a “new commandment”? 


02:30.400 --> 02:34.137
But it sounds like 
a very old commandment, doesn’t it? 


02:34.137 --> 02:36.439
Why, over 1,500 years 


02:36.438 --> 02:39.641
before Jesus said 
the words we just read, 


02:39.642 --> 02:41.912
the Law given to Moses said: 


02:41.912 --> 02:46.182
“You must love 
your fellow man as yourself.”


02:46.182 --> 02:48.384
—Leviticus 19:18.


02:48.383 --> 02:52.121
So, what was “new” 
about Jesus’ command 


02:52.122 --> 02:54.424
in John chapter 13? 


02:54.423 --> 02:58.961
He said that true Christians 
were to love each other 


02:58.962 --> 03:02.365
“just as I have loved you.” 


03:02.365 --> 03:04.967
That is what was different. 


03:04.967 --> 03:07.037
That was new, 


03:07.037 --> 03:10.707
not just love the other person 
as you love yourself, 


03:10.707 --> 03:13.375
but love him just like 


03:13.375 --> 03:16.212
Jesus loved His followers.


03:16.212 --> 03:19.382
Well, what kind of love 
would that be? 


03:19.382 --> 03:23.452
Self-sacrificing love
—and usually we think 


03:23.452 --> 03:25.622
of Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice, 


03:25.622 --> 03:28.024
his willingly giving his life 


03:28.023 --> 03:32.628
so that we might have the hope 
of everlasting life. 


03:32.628 --> 03:36.465
But when you think about it, 
that aspect of Jesus’ love 


03:36.465 --> 03:40.337
was exemplified 
in a self-sacrificing death! 


03:40.337 --> 03:43.005
Now, it is true, 
that as a Christian, 


03:43.005 --> 03:47.677
we might at some time have to give 
our life for a fellow Christian. 


03:47.677 --> 03:49.845
But we hope 
it doesn’t come to that.


03:49.845 --> 03:54.517
So instead of talking 
about a self-sacrificing death, 


03:54.517 --> 03:58.722
we want to discuss 
showing this new kind of love 


03:58.722 --> 04:02.792
as evidenced 
in a self-sacrificing life, 


04:02.792 --> 04:05.929
not necessarily our death. 


04:05.928 --> 04:10.800
You see, Jesus’ life
—his three-and-a-half-year ministry—


04:10.800 --> 04:15.338
was a self-sacrificing life 
of loving others.


04:15.338 --> 04:19.175
In addition to doing good 


04:19.175 --> 04:21.477
when something requires it, 


04:21.477 --> 04:23.479
a true follower of Jesus 


04:23.478 --> 04:26.448
is to take 
the initiative to help others 


04:26.448 --> 04:28.818
spiritually and otherwise. 


04:28.818 --> 04:32.021
He is to work actively 
for their good. 


04:32.022 --> 04:35.224
The preaching and teaching 
of the good news to others


04:35.223 --> 04:38.761
—some of whom may even be hostile—


04:38.762 --> 04:43.332
is one of the greatest expressions 
of love, for it can result 


04:43.332 --> 04:46.235
in everlasting life 
to the recipients. 


04:46.235 --> 04:48.705
However, 
according to Paul’s words 


04:48.705 --> 04:52.342
at 1 Thessalonians 2:8, 


04:52.342 --> 04:57.080
a true Christian must 
‘impart not only the good news of God 


04:57.080 --> 05:00.883
but also his very self’ 


05:00.883 --> 05:03.986
in helping those who 
accept the good news. 


05:03.987 --> 05:06.990
It’s that kind of love 


05:06.990 --> 05:11.093
that Jesus said would be 
an identifying mark of his disciples, 


05:11.093 --> 05:14.196
not specifically that his followers 


05:14.197 --> 05:17.767
would all be dying for each other, 


05:17.767 --> 05:22.772
but more so that they 
would all be living for each other. 


05:22.772 --> 05:25.307
Yes, displaying self-sacrificing love 


05:25.307 --> 05:28.679
for one another 
every day of their lives.


05:28.678 --> 05:31.713
The four Gospels 
are a treasure trove 


05:31.713 --> 05:34.616
of Jesus’ self-sacrificing love. 


05:34.617 --> 05:37.754
And yet, 
they do not cover his actions 


05:37.753 --> 05:40.723
every day of his life 
as the Christ. 


05:40.723 --> 05:43.425
His three-and-a-half-year ministry 


05:43.425 --> 05:48.063
amounts to nearly 
1,300 days of life and love. 


05:48.063 --> 05:52.035
The written record 
of Jesus’ life is admittedly brief, 


05:52.035 --> 05:55.705
but it is grand indeed! 


05:55.705 --> 05:59.475
However, the reality 
of observing Jesus every day 


05:59.475 --> 06:03.545
must have been far grander 
than what we have in print. 


06:03.545 --> 06:05.815
What we have in print 
might be likened 


06:05.815 --> 06:09.018
to a photo album of Jesus’ life, 


06:09.018 --> 06:11.253
some snapshots. 


06:11.253 --> 06:15.858
By comparison, 
what his apostles experienced 


06:15.858 --> 06:18.961
with Jesus day after day 


06:18.962 --> 06:23.665
was like a continuous video 
of his example of love. 


06:23.665 --> 06:28.203
No wonder that, 
at John 21:25, 


06:28.203 --> 06:30.205
the apostle said: 


06:30.205 --> 06:32.475
“There are also . . . 


06:32.475 --> 06:35.210
“many other things that Jesus did, 


06:35.210 --> 06:39.048
“which if ever they were written 
in full detail, 


06:39.048 --> 06:41.450
“I suppose the world itself 


06:41.450 --> 06:44.000
could not contain the scrolls written.”


06:45.353 --> 06:50.358
It said there were 
‘many other things Jesus did,’ 


06:50.358 --> 06:53.695
not many other things 
that he said, 


06:53.695 --> 06:58.100
but that he did, 
yes, deeds or acts 


06:58.100 --> 07:01.770
demonstrating 
his self-sacrificing life of love! 


07:01.770 --> 07:05.340
We already mentioned 
the all-important preaching work 


07:05.340 --> 07:08.077
as being an act 
of love on our part. 


07:08.077 --> 07:10.514
But how else 
do we manifest 


07:10.513 --> 07:14.350
the most obvious trait 
of a genuine Christian


07:14.350 --> 07:18.553
—love like Jesus had?


07:18.553 --> 07:22.125
Let’s start by thinking 
of the elders in the congregation. 


07:22.125 --> 07:25.595
At Philippians 2:17, 


07:25.595 --> 07:29.298
Paul said that he 
had ‘poured himself out 


07:29.298 --> 07:32.401
to the congregation 
like a drink offering.’ 


07:32.402 --> 07:34.404
What did that mean? 


07:34.403 --> 07:37.206
It meant that he 
drained himself out, 


07:37.207 --> 07:39.509
both physically and emotionally, 


07:39.508 --> 07:42.076
to support the Philippians.


07:42.077 --> 07:44.080
Many of the elders 
in our congregations 


07:44.080 --> 07:46.482
have the same self-sacrificing love 


07:46.482 --> 07:48.617
for those under their care. 


07:48.617 --> 07:51.487
They give of their time 
to shepherd 


07:51.487 --> 07:53.522
and readjust those in need. 


07:53.522 --> 07:55.825
They take the lead 
in the ministry. 


07:55.825 --> 07:57.860
They respond when there is 


07:57.860 --> 07:59.862
a serious health issue or tragedy. 


07:59.862 --> 08:04.500
They pour themselves out for the friends, 
thus identifying themselves 


08:04.500 --> 08:07.002
as disciples of Christ.


08:07.002 --> 08:10.405
But we do not have 
to be an elder 


08:10.405 --> 08:13.175
to provide a word 
of encouragement, do we? 


08:13.175 --> 08:17.247
If we all keep focused 
on others in the congregation, 


08:17.247 --> 08:19.249
not just ourselves, 


08:19.248 --> 08:22.718
we will know 
who needs to be bolstered 


08:22.718 --> 08:26.521
because of trials 
or circumstances that they face. 


08:26.522 --> 08:31.527
Giving in this way 
is evidence of Christlike love. 


08:31.527 --> 08:35.297
You may be thinking, 
‘But I’m just a little old sister 


08:35.297 --> 08:37.634
‘who finds it hard to squeeze out 


08:37.633 --> 08:40.135
a word of encouragement to others.’ 


08:40.135 --> 08:43.738
Perhaps you don’t have 
to say anything, 


08:43.738 --> 08:46.141
just be there 


08:46.142 --> 08:49.145
at the meetings 
or in the service. 


08:49.145 --> 08:52.448
When others see your face, 
they are encouraged. 


08:52.448 --> 08:57.453
Follow along 
as I read Acts 28:15. 


08:57.453 --> 09:00.956
It reads: 
“From there the brothers, 


09:00.957 --> 09:03.125
“when they heard the news about us, 


09:03.125 --> 09:06.195
“came as far 
as the Marketplace of Appius 


09:06.195 --> 09:08.530
“and Three Taverns to meet us. 


09:08.530 --> 09:12.302
“On catching sight of them, 


09:12.302 --> 09:14.370
“Paul thanked God 


09:14.370 --> 09:17.640
and took courage.”


09:17.640 --> 09:20.008
Paul “took courage” 


09:20.008 --> 09:24.413
just by seeing the brothers 
who came out to meet him. 


09:24.413 --> 09:26.715
You encourage your brothers 


09:26.715 --> 09:29.985
and sisters by your presence. 


09:29.985 --> 09:31.987
Please follow along as I read 


09:31.987 --> 09:36.125
Philippians 2:1-4. 


09:36.125 --> 09:40.395
Paul here describes it 
as “encouragement in Christ.” 


09:40.395 --> 09:42.265
He says: 


09:42.265 --> 09:46.402
“If, then, there is 
any encouragement in Christ, 


09:46.402 --> 09:49.639
“if any consolation of love, 


09:49.638 --> 09:52.073
“if any spiritual fellowship, 


09:52.073 --> 09:55.510
“if any tender affection 
and compassion, 


09:55.510 --> 09:58.013
“make my joy full by being 


09:58.013 --> 10:02.351
“of the same mind 
and having the same love, 


10:02.352 --> 10:06.789
“being completely united, 
having the one thought in mind. 


10:06.788 --> 10:10.591
“Do nothing out of contentiousness 
or out of egotism, 


10:10.592 --> 10:12.662
“but with humility 


10:12.662 --> 10:16.432
“consider others superior to you, 


10:16.432 --> 10:20.069
“as you look out not only 
for your own interests, 


10:20.068 --> 10:24.206
but also for the interests of others.”


10:24.207 --> 10:27.710
Did you notice 
the self-sacrificing aspect 


10:27.710 --> 10:29.978
of this love and encouragement? 


10:29.978 --> 10:33.748
Yes, he talked about having love, 
but then he said, 


10:33.748 --> 10:38.586
“not . . . for your own interests, 
but . . . for the interests of others.” 


10:38.587 --> 10:42.157
That type of love
—in the interests of others—


10:42.157 --> 10:46.529
is the identifying mark 
of true Christians.


10:46.528 --> 10:49.331
What about visiting 
the sick in your congregation 


10:49.332 --> 10:51.900
or those who are housebound? 


10:51.900 --> 10:56.405
Sometimes these dear ones are 
“out of sight, out of mind.” 


10:56.405 --> 11:00.743
We visit with those we see 
when at the Kingdom Hall, 


11:00.743 --> 11:05.080
but do we think about those 
who are shut-ins? 


11:05.080 --> 11:09.818
What was a major part 
of Jesus’ loving acts when on earth? 


11:09.818 --> 11:13.021
There are numerous accounts 
of Jesus and his apostles 


11:13.022 --> 11:15.024
healing the sick. 


11:15.023 --> 11:18.426
It’s true that we 
cannot heal the sick, 


11:18.427 --> 11:23.432
but it is in our power 
to visit the sick. 


11:23.432 --> 11:26.435
And what a healing 
that is to their spirit! 


11:26.435 --> 11:28.437
It means so much when 


11:28.437 --> 11:32.040
they are not just prayed for 
at a meeting, 


11:32.040 --> 11:35.978
but when those words of prayer 
are backed up 


11:35.978 --> 11:39.881
with an act of love
—a visit to them in person. 


11:39.882 --> 11:44.454
That is Christlike love in action. 


11:44.453 --> 11:49.191
Why not scroll down the list
of those in your service group 


11:49.192 --> 11:51.694
with the thought in mind 
of checking on those 


11:51.693 --> 11:54.630
who have been missing 
from the meetings? 


11:54.630 --> 11:56.832
Do they need a meal? 


11:56.832 --> 11:59.269
Do they need some help 


11:59.268 --> 12:01.270
perhaps around the house? 


12:01.270 --> 12:04.607
Do they need transportation 
to the doctor? 


12:04.607 --> 12:09.612
Can we allow our love 
to expand to fill their needs?


12:09.612 --> 12:11.714
Contributing to the worldwide work, 


12:11.713 --> 12:14.616
which cares for the needs 
of our brothers around the world, 


12:14.617 --> 12:16.885
is another act of love. 


12:16.885 --> 12:21.890
It demonstrates that we are 
a true disciple of Christ. 


12:21.890 --> 12:25.593
Related to that, many of you have, 
at your own expense, 


12:25.593 --> 12:28.430
traveled to far-flung places 


12:28.430 --> 12:32.267
to help rebuild 
after a natural disaster has struck. 


12:32.267 --> 12:36.739
The overwhelming response 
from the victims is evidence 


12:36.738 --> 12:41.076
of your self-sacrificing life 
and love for your brothers.


12:41.077 --> 12:44.045
It is hoped 
that the reminder of Jesus 


12:44.045 --> 12:48.783
at John 13:34, 35 
will be good for all of us, 


12:48.783 --> 12:51.020
not just for this month, 


12:51.020 --> 12:54.657
but for our whole course of life. 


12:54.657 --> 12:58.527
You know, about one third 
of the world’s population 


12:58.527 --> 13:00.529
claims to be Christian. 


13:00.528 --> 13:04.533
But how many of them 
show self-sacrificing love 


13:04.533 --> 13:07.301
outside of their immediate family? 


13:07.302 --> 13:10.940
Most are like a baseball team 
in a uniform. 


13:10.940 --> 13:13.308
They think having the word “Christian” 


13:13.308 --> 13:16.411
emblazoned across the front 
of their uniform 


13:16.412 --> 13:18.847
is all that is required. 


13:18.847 --> 13:22.585
However, most of them 
simply “sit on the bench,” 


13:22.585 --> 13:25.253
or on a pew in church, 


13:25.253 --> 13:28.990
and many do not even attend 
“the game.” 


13:28.990 --> 13:32.393
They do not live 
the life of a Christian. 


13:32.393 --> 13:36.498
Jesus made clear 
that being a true disciple of his 


13:36.498 --> 13:39.601
is not merely 
“wearing a uniform,” 


13:39.602 --> 13:42.370
simply claiming to be 
his follower. 


13:42.370 --> 13:44.573
No, it involves 


13:44.573 --> 13:48.343
actively demonstrating 
works of love, 


13:48.343 --> 13:50.946
“swinging hard for the team,” 


13:50.947 --> 13:55.184
imitating the all-time greatest examples 
of love, 


13:55.183 --> 13:58.586
Jehovah God and his Son, 
Jesus Christ. 


13:58.587 --> 14:02.925
As Paul said 
at 2 Corinthians 8:8, 


14:02.925 --> 14:07.930
we need “to test 
the genuineness of [our] love.” 


14:07.930 --> 14:10.867
Yes, we need to daily prove 


14:10.867 --> 14:24.530
that we are 
a genuine disciple of Jesus.
