00:00.550 --> 00:04.287
Welcome to our program! 


00:04.287 --> 00:06.655
What are the benefits 
of making the effort 


00:06.655 --> 00:08.658
to serve 
in an unassigned territory? 


00:08.658 --> 00:11.961
Join this family as they travel 


00:11.962 --> 00:16.499
to a distant area to support 
the Kingdom preaching work. 


00:16.498 --> 00:20.236
We will see how such a decision 
builds their faith.


00:20.237 --> 00:25.175
And our young ones, 
have you started noticing the opposite sex?


00:25.175 --> 00:29.278
And yet, you know 
you’re not old enough to get married. 


00:29.278 --> 00:32.548
What can help you to take control 
of such natural feelings? 


00:32.548 --> 00:36.953
We will find out 
later in the program.


00:36.953 --> 00:41.490
We’ll also hear the fascinating story 
of Erich Frost—a brother 


00:41.490 --> 00:46.000
who was sent to a Nazi concentration camp
during World War II because of his faith. 


00:47.763 --> 00:51.000
How did he and his fellow brothers 
help each other to remain faithful? 


00:52.202 --> 00:56.139
You will find this story 
very encouraging.


00:56.138 --> 00:58.475
That, and much more, 
is coming your way 


00:58.475 --> 01:03.000
on this May program 
of JW Broadcasting!


01:21.798 --> 01:26.803
I would first like to read to you 
some passages from the Bible 


01:26.803 --> 01:29.871
found at Ephesians chapter 3, 


01:29.872 --> 01:32.942
verses 14 through 19. 


01:32.942 --> 01:37.747
This will also establish the theme 
for my comments this month. 


01:37.747 --> 01:42.719
Ephesians 3, 
starting with verse 14, Paul said: 


01:42.718 --> 01:46.655
“For this reason 
I bend my knees to the Father, 


01:46.655 --> 01:51.660
“to whom every family in heaven 
and on earth owes its name. 


01:51.660 --> 01:55.498
“I pray that he may grant you 
through the abundance of his glory 


01:55.498 --> 01:58.801
“to be made mighty 
in the man you are inside, 


01:58.802 --> 02:01.070
“with power through his spirit, 


02:01.070 --> 02:05.775
“and that through your faith you may have 
the Christ dwell in your hearts with love. 


02:05.775 --> 02:09.778
“May you be rooted 
and established on the foundation, 


02:09.778 --> 02:13.816
“in order that with all the holy ones 
you may be thoroughly able 


02:13.817 --> 02:16.585
“to comprehend fully 
what is the breadth 


02:16.585 --> 02:19.388
“and length 
and height and depth, 


02:19.388 --> 02:23.993
“and to know the love of the Christ, 
which surpasses knowledge, 


02:23.993 --> 02:27.296
“so that you may be filled 
with all the fullness 


02:27.297 --> 02:29.565
that God gives.”


02:29.565 --> 02:31.567
Now, verse 15 


02:31.567 --> 02:34.904
is the inspiration 
for my theme, namely, 


02:34.903 --> 02:40.000
“Glorify Jehovah—The One 
to Whom Every Family Owes Its Name.” 


02:41.243 --> 02:46.248
The family unit is under a vicious attack 
in these last days. 


02:46.248 --> 02:49.385
The Insight book 
lived up to its name 


02:49.385 --> 02:51.988
under the heading “Family.” 


02:51.988 --> 02:56.391
The very insightful comment 
reads this way: 


02:56.392 --> 03:00.797
“The inspired Scriptures 
have foretold a vicious attack 


03:00.797 --> 03:05.802
“on the family institution 
with a consequent breaking down of morality


03:05.802 --> 03:10.807
and of human society 
outside the . . . congregation.” 


03:10.807 --> 03:15.479
The article pointed out 
that in “‘the last days’ 


03:15.478 --> 03:19.048
“a condition in which 
disobedience to parents, 


03:19.048 --> 03:24.053
“disloyalty, and absence 
of ‘natural affection’ would be rife, 


03:24.053 --> 03:28.658
even among those 
‘having a form of godly devotion.’”


03:28.658 --> 03:33.195
How can married couples, 
parents, and children 


03:33.195 --> 03:37.267
counteract 
such a diabolical attack? 


03:37.267 --> 03:42.272
Do you remember those verses 
we read in Ephesians chapter 3? 


03:42.272 --> 03:47.277
Verse 16 said that the One 
to whom every family owes its name, 


03:47.277 --> 03:50.614
Jehovah, would ‘grant us
to be made mighty


03:50.613 --> 03:52.881
in the person we are inside.’ 


03:52.882 --> 03:55.785
Yes, Jehovah can give us 


03:55.785 --> 03:59.522
the internal 
spiritual strength to fight back 


03:59.522 --> 04:03.192
against Satan’s efforts 
to destroy the family. 


04:03.192 --> 04:05.194
How? 


04:05.193 --> 04:08.865
By being immersed in God’s Word. 


04:08.865 --> 04:12.568
In particular, 
by imitating the loving way 


04:12.568 --> 04:15.271
that Jesus treated his disciples. 


04:15.272 --> 04:19.142
Did you note 
that Ephesians 3:17 said 


04:19.142 --> 04:23.345
we are to “have the Christ 
dwell in [our] hearts with love”? 


04:23.345 --> 04:28.150
Yes, if each of us cherishes 
the Christ in our hearts 


04:28.150 --> 04:32.888
to the point that he dwells, 
or resides, there constantly, 


04:32.888 --> 04:35.425
our family 
will not only survive 


04:35.425 --> 04:38.393
but it will truly thrive. 


04:38.393 --> 04:42.531
This will be so evident 
that verse 17 further states 


04:42.532 --> 04:46.669
that we will “be rooted 
and established on the foundation.” 


04:46.668 --> 04:49.205
We will be solid! 


04:49.205 --> 04:53.075
And keep in mind 
that 1 Corinthians 3:11 says 


04:53.075 --> 04:56.012
that the “foundation” 
on which we build 


04:56.012 --> 04:58.447
“is Jesus Christ.”


04:58.447 --> 05:03.019
Then verse 18 
of Ephesians chapter 3 indicates that 


05:03.018 --> 05:07.056
our spiritual peripheral vision 
will be enhanced. 


05:07.057 --> 05:09.992
We will not 
have spiritual blind spots 


05:09.992 --> 05:14.064
that could allow the spirit of the world 
to creep into the family. 


05:14.063 --> 05:17.600
That verse says 
that we will “be thoroughly able 


05:17.600 --> 05:20.870
“to comprehend fully 
what is the breadth 


05:20.870 --> 05:23.472
and length 
and height and depth.” 


05:23.472 --> 05:27.744
All aspects of Jesus’ personality 
will come into play 


05:27.743 --> 05:30.580
as we interact 
with family members. 


05:30.580 --> 05:34.917
Finally, verse 19 
sums up the result when it says 


05:34.917 --> 05:39.589
that we would then 
have come “to know the love of the Christ, 


05:39.588 --> 05:41.923
which surpasses knowledge.” 


05:41.923 --> 05:45.428
Granted, 
knowledge is important, 


05:45.428 --> 05:48.698
but it is the application 


05:48.698 --> 05:52.701
of Christlike love 
that will preserve our family, 


05:52.702 --> 05:55.772
keeping it vibrantly intact.


05:55.772 --> 05:59.175
Family life 
in these critical last days 


05:59.175 --> 06:02.478
could be likened to those 
who suffer from diabetes. 


06:02.478 --> 06:04.946
It is believed 
that diabetes is caused 


06:04.947 --> 06:08.017
by both genetic 
and environmental factors. 


06:08.017 --> 06:12.089
Similarly, all in the family 
have inherited sin 


06:12.088 --> 06:14.890
and imperfection 
from our first human parents, 


06:14.890 --> 06:17.693
Adam and Eve, 
as if genetically. 


06:17.693 --> 06:22.165
However, we are also exposed 
to the ever more toxic 


06:22.165 --> 06:26.568
environmental factors 
of Satan’s evil world. 


06:26.568 --> 06:29.871
Most who suffer 
from a serious case of diabetes 


06:29.872 --> 06:32.142
need to use two methods 


06:32.142 --> 06:36.445
to successfully relieve the symptoms 
and lead a normal life.


06:36.445 --> 06:39.848
They have to watch their diet 
and, in many cases, 


06:39.848 --> 06:44.086
take an injection 
of insulin daily.


06:44.087 --> 06:47.357
Spiritually, 
we need to avoid the sickly, 


06:47.357 --> 06:51.494
sweet junk food 
that the world promotes in movies, 


06:51.493 --> 06:56.198
talk shows, 
the Internet, and in print. 


06:56.198 --> 06:58.935
Just as with the person 
who has diabetes, 


06:58.935 --> 07:01.870
this requires 
a permanent lifestyle change 


07:01.870 --> 07:05.475
from what we might have 
exposed ourselves to in the past. 


07:05.475 --> 07:07.743
In addition to avoiding 


07:07.743 --> 07:10.480
unwholesome junk food 
from Satan’s system,


07:10.480 --> 07:12.882
we also need 
to take daily “injections” 


07:12.882 --> 07:16.685
of God’s Word 
and other wholesome provisions. 


07:16.685 --> 07:19.688
This has become more 
and more important 


07:19.688 --> 07:23.000
the deeper we get 
into these last days.


07:24.627 --> 07:29.632
How has our organization provided this 
when it comes to family life? 


07:29.632 --> 07:33.169
Well, in the early 1900’s, 


07:33.168 --> 07:35.838
the focus was on preaching 
the good news. 


07:35.838 --> 07:37.840
Little attention was given 


07:37.840 --> 07:41.577
to building strong 
Christian marriages and families. 


07:41.577 --> 07:44.247
For a time, 
marriage was even discouraged 


07:44.247 --> 07:47.784
well beyond 
the intent of the Scriptures. 


07:47.783 --> 07:50.720
I did some checking, 
and commendably 


07:50.720 --> 07:54.357
between 1919 and 1921 


07:54.357 --> 07:57.227
there was a feature 
in the Golden Age magazine


07:57.227 --> 08:01.697
once or twice a month 
called the “Juvenile Bible Study.” 


08:01.697 --> 08:04.300
In 1920, 
a brochure was released 


08:04.300 --> 08:07.503
called The Golden Age ABC. 


08:07.503 --> 08:11.706
Then it wasn’t until 1941 
that the now famous book 


08:11.707 --> 08:13.977
entitled Children was handed out 


08:13.977 --> 08:17.914
to all young ones 
at the convention that year. 


08:17.913 --> 08:21.116
But as the last days progressed, 


08:21.117 --> 08:25.254
more and more information
for families was produced. 


08:25.253 --> 08:28.323
For example, in the 1970’s, 


08:28.323 --> 08:31.860
the book Making Your Family Life Happy 
was released. 


08:31.860 --> 08:35.665
About the same time, 
the books Listening to the Great Teacher 


08:35.665 --> 08:39.468
and Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It 
were published. 


08:39.468 --> 08:43.405
In 1982, Awake! 
began a regular series 


08:43.405 --> 08:47.610
that has run for decades 
entitled “Young People Ask.” 


08:47.610 --> 08:51.947
We now have two up-to-date books 
with the same title, 


08:51.947 --> 08:56.885
and the series of articles 
continues on the jw.org website. 


08:56.885 --> 08:59.855
We have the book 
Learn From the Great Teacher 


08:59.855 --> 09:03.192
and so many features 
and activities for young ones 


09:03.192 --> 09:08.130
on the website that I would be out of time 
if I tried to enumerate them all. 


09:08.130 --> 09:11.467
There are also regular articles 
in our magazines 


09:11.467 --> 09:14.670
about marriage 
and family life. 


09:14.670 --> 09:19.675
And I will certainly never forget 
the privilege I had in 2012 


09:19.675 --> 09:24.547
to introduce the animated series 
Become Jehovah’s Friend. 


09:24.547 --> 09:26.882
That has proved 
to be a blessing 


09:26.882 --> 09:30.085
for both young ones 
and their parents. 


09:30.085 --> 09:34.890
What a teaching tool for both!


09:34.890 --> 09:39.428
In 2014, I attended 
the international convention 


09:39.428 --> 09:43.098
in Atlanta, Georgia, 
here in the United States. 


09:43.098 --> 09:46.568
After a little two-year-old girl 
saw my face 


09:46.568 --> 09:49.438
on the big jumbo screen 
giving a talk, 


09:49.438 --> 09:53.175
she eagerly started searching 
all around her for someone. 


09:53.175 --> 09:57.647
When her parents asked her 
who she was looking for, she said, “Caleb. 


09:57.647 --> 10:02.452
He must be here because I saw 
his grandfather giving a talk.” 


10:02.452 --> 10:04.720
Many children ask 


10:04.720 --> 10:08.323
to meet Caleb in person 
when they visit Bethel. 


10:08.323 --> 10:10.726
Two postings 
of an item every month 


10:10.727 --> 10:14.197
is making quite an impression 
on little hearts. 


10:14.197 --> 10:18.400
With Bible principles 
being impressed on the minds and hearts 


10:18.400 --> 10:22.605
of children so early, 
we prayerfully anticipate 


10:22.605 --> 10:27.477
many spiritually-minded teenagers 
in the years to come.


10:27.477 --> 10:31.880
We have so much 
healthy spiritual food 


10:31.880 --> 10:34.750
for counteracting 
family “diabetes.” 


10:34.750 --> 10:38.220
For this, 
we give all glory to Jehovah, 


10:38.220 --> 10:42.000
the one “to whom 
every family . . . owes its name.”


10:43.092 --> 10:47.095
One of the favorite passages 
of Scripture that anyone 


10:47.095 --> 10:52.033
professing to be Christian 
loves is the 23rd Psalm. 


10:52.033 --> 10:55.971
Family heads, can we benefit 


10:55.972 --> 10:58.840
from imitating not only 
the Fine Shepherd, Jesus, 


10:58.840 --> 11:03.045
but also the Great Shepherd, 
Jehovah God? 


11:03.045 --> 11:06.715
I am going to borrow 
the text of the 23rd Psalm 


11:06.715 --> 11:11.653
and adjust the words so that we 
can sense a family’s tranquillity 


11:11.653 --> 11:14.656
when headship 
is exercised properly. 


11:14.657 --> 11:17.794
In fact, you husbands, 


11:17.793 --> 11:22.531
as the script is read, 
imagine it is your wife’s voice 


11:22.532 --> 11:27.000
describing the effect 
your headship has on your family.


11:29.872 --> 11:33.275
‘[My husband] 
is [our] shepherd. 


11:33.275 --> 11:35.277
‘[We] will lack nothing. 


11:35.277 --> 11:39.215
‘In grassy pastures 
[refreshing recreation] 


11:39.215 --> 11:42.685
‘he makes [us] lie down; 
he leads [us] 


11:42.685 --> 11:47.490
‘to well-watered resting-places 
[meetings and conventions]. 


11:47.490 --> 11:50.158
‘He refreshes [us]. 


11:50.158 --> 11:52.695
‘He leads [us in the ministry] 


11:52.695 --> 11:57.232
‘in the paths of righteousness 
for the sake of [Jehovah’s] name. 


11:57.232 --> 12:01.870
‘Though [we] walk in the valley 
of deep [economic] shadow, 


12:01.870 --> 12:06.808
‘[we] fear no harm, 
for [Dad is] with [us]; 


12:06.808 --> 12:10.611
‘your rod and your staff 
[loving discipline] reassure [us]. 


12:10.612 --> 12:14.617
‘You prepare a table [of family worship, 
helping the children] 


12:14.617 --> 12:16.885
‘for [us] before [our] enemies. 


12:16.885 --> 12:19.855
‘You refresh 
[our] head[s] with oil; 


12:19.855 --> 12:24.260
‘[Our] cup 
[of family well-being] is well-filled. 


12:24.260 --> 12:28.597
‘Surely goodness and loyal love 
will pursue [our family] 


12:28.597 --> 12:32.334
‘all the days of [our] life, 
and [our family] 


12:32.333 --> 12:37.000
will dwell in the house 
of Jehovah for all [our] days.’ 


12:38.707 --> 12:42.244
No further application called for. 


12:42.243 --> 12:45.646
We feel the sense of security 
that envelops 


12:45.647 --> 12:50.185
the interior rooms 
of such a home, don’t we?


12:50.185 --> 12:52.922
Do you remember 
the point made 


12:52.922 --> 12:56.459
in Ephesians chapter 3, 
which we read earlier? 


12:56.458 --> 12:59.561
We are to treasure 
Jesus’ personality 


12:59.562 --> 13:02.264
and let it “dwell” 
in our hearts. 


13:02.263 --> 13:05.133
If all in the family 
make a determined effort 


13:05.133 --> 13:07.401
to treat each other 
like Jesus would, 


13:07.402 --> 13:10.339
we can conquer the world! 


13:10.338 --> 13:13.741
Yes, we—His spiritual family 
in heaven 


13:13.742 --> 13:17.279
and all humans on earth 
who dedicate their lives to Him


13:17.278 --> 13:19.481
—give glory to Jehovah! 


13:19.482 --> 13:22.485
Indeed, we thank Jehovah 


13:22.485 --> 13:26.288
for all the spiritual provisions 
he has made through his Word 


13:26.288 --> 13:31.293
and organization to protect every family 
who takes up his name. 


13:31.293 --> 13:34.430
May Jehovah bless 
all of you families 


13:34.430 --> 13:37.767
as you strive to win 
the war that Satan wages 


13:37.767 --> 13:41.000
against you 
in these last days.


13:42.638 --> 13:45.073
An important aspect 


13:45.073 --> 13:48.810
of keeping 
the family’s spiritual health intact 


13:48.810 --> 13:53.415
is by making full use 
of the Family Worship arrangement. 


13:53.415 --> 13:56.685
In this dramatization, 
pay attention 


13:56.685 --> 13:59.955
to how the family head 
is aware of the needs of the family 


13:59.955 --> 14:02.558
and how he plans accordingly.


14:02.558 --> 14:06.028
Hi, my name is Joe. 


14:06.028 --> 14:09.965
A few weeks ago, 
we all sat together for supper. 


14:09.965 --> 14:14.437
I was so tired, and my wife, 
Jenny, felt the same way. 


14:14.437 --> 14:18.774
She always does it all, 
taking care of the children so well, 


14:18.773 --> 14:21.143
but it was not easy 
for her in recent weeks. 


14:21.143 --> 14:25.546
Sarah felt that we are too restrictive 
on how she dresses. 


14:25.547 --> 14:27.684
She just does not understand. 


14:27.683 --> 14:29.818
It was hard to convince her. 


14:29.818 --> 14:32.353
And to motivate her 
to share in the field service 


14:32.353 --> 14:34.356
is becoming a challenge. 


14:34.357 --> 14:36.392
It was not always like this. 


14:36.392 --> 14:38.927
She used to enjoy 
going out in field service.


14:38.927 --> 14:41.864
And Tom, 
he is such a good boy, 


14:41.863 --> 14:45.066
but all of a sudden, 
he was raving about the games 


14:45.067 --> 14:47.937
his classmates 
have on their phones. 


14:47.937 --> 14:51.474
It’s always 
about having supernatural powers, 


14:51.473 --> 14:54.743
and it fascinated him, 
even though he is small. 


14:54.743 --> 14:57.411
But when I asked him 
to take out the garbage, 


14:57.412 --> 15:00.015
suddenly 
his superpowers left him. 


15:00.015 --> 15:02.918
And Mike, 


15:02.918 --> 15:05.586
our smallest, 


15:05.587 --> 15:07.690
it was hard 
to get him to go to bed 


15:07.690 --> 15:10.927
or clean up his room. 


15:10.927 --> 15:15.000
I realized there are a few things 
we need to speak about.


15:16.698 --> 15:21.236
Joe came to me, and we talked 
a lot about our children that same evening. 


15:21.237 --> 15:23.739
We wondered, 
‘What would be the best for them?’ 


15:23.738 --> 15:26.741
We prayed together. 


15:26.742 --> 15:29.000
Then we had an idea!


15:30.678 --> 15:33.915
The following day 
we asked our children 


15:33.915 --> 15:37.653
if we could consider Noah 
as the theme for our next family worship.


15:37.653 --> 15:39.921
All of us liked the idea. 


15:39.922 --> 15:42.000
Each one of us 
should prepare something. 


15:44.192 --> 15:47.000
Mike, Tom, and I 
wanted to build the ark.


15:54.870 --> 15:58.000
And, of course, 
we need the animals. 


16:00.542 --> 16:03.379
And Sarah 
should collect pictures 


16:03.378 --> 16:07.248
for the story 
from our publications. 


16:07.248 --> 16:11.386
I also had to take time 
to think again about the story of Noah 


16:11.387 --> 16:14.724
and how it 
can help our family. 


16:14.723 --> 16:18.060
Jenny and Sarah were responsible 
for the wardrobe and food.


16:18.060 --> 16:20.462
While preparing, 
I got the chance 


16:20.462 --> 16:24.867
to speak with Sarah about her dress 
in a more relaxed setting. 


16:24.867 --> 16:27.369
She understood that, 
like Noah, 


16:27.368 --> 16:31.000
when it comes to Jehovah’s commands, 
we need to do “just so.”


16:32.908 --> 16:36.578
Then the evening arrived. 


16:36.578 --> 16:39.848
We talked about 
how it was before the Flood 


16:39.848 --> 16:43.118
and what kind of world 
Noah and his family lived in. 


16:43.118 --> 16:46.755
Noah’s family needed 
real courage to preach. 


16:46.755 --> 16:51.093
They had to explain about the rain 
and how the ark would be needed 


16:51.093 --> 16:55.863
to survive the Flood
—something that had never happened before.


16:55.863 --> 17:00.035
All the people 
thought they were crazy! 


17:00.035 --> 17:03.305
And while we were talking 
about this, it came out 


17:03.305 --> 17:07.977
that Sarah felt embarrassed when she met 
a schoolmate in the field service recently.


17:07.977 --> 17:12.882
I realized Noah must have felt 
the same as me, 


17:12.882 --> 17:15.617
and yet, 
he was so courageous. 


17:15.617 --> 17:18.754
Dad read Genesis 6:9: 


17:18.753 --> 17:21.890
“Noah walked with the true God.” 


17:21.890 --> 17:25.160
So he could have every confidence 
in his Friend, Jehovah. 


17:25.160 --> 17:28.363
I want to be just like that!


17:28.363 --> 17:31.933
For Tom, 
I found a great picture.


17:31.933 --> 17:35.670
Dad told us that the world 
at this time was very bad. 


17:35.670 --> 17:38.340
People were fighting 
and many were afraid, 


17:38.340 --> 17:41.008
and that is why 
Jehovah brought the Flood. 


17:41.008 --> 17:44.278
It made me think 
about the games from my schoolmates. 


17:44.278 --> 17:48.350
I like to play those games, 
but I know that Jehovah does not like that. 


17:48.350 --> 17:50.652
So why do I?


17:50.652 --> 17:55.000
And the best part 
was when we got inside the ark!


17:56.725 --> 17:59.728
Then I read Genesis 6:19: 


17:59.728 --> 18:01.730
“And bring into the ark 


18:01.730 --> 18:05.233
two of every sort 
of living creature.”


18:05.233 --> 18:08.370
Dad showed us 
how the animals went into the ark. 


18:08.370 --> 18:10.972
Each one had its own place, 


18:10.972 --> 18:15.710
and they went inside 
two at a time without any chaos.


18:15.710 --> 18:20.515
I explained that we also need 
to keep our rooms clean like the ark. 


18:20.515 --> 18:24.285
I saw that Mike got the point. 


18:24.285 --> 18:28.623
We wanted 
to keep in mind Genesis 6:22:


18:28.623 --> 18:32.760
“And Noah did according to all 
that God had commanded him. 


18:32.760 --> 18:36.265
He did just so.”


18:36.265 --> 18:39.702
And then the rain came, 
but we survived! 


18:39.702 --> 18:41.704
That was great!


18:41.703 --> 18:43.971
We all realized 


18:43.972 --> 18:47.042
Noah also must have been 
tired sometimes, 


18:47.042 --> 18:49.044
but he never gave up. 


18:49.043 --> 18:53.048
This was a good lesson for us.


18:53.048 --> 18:56.050
We must take care 
of our family as Noah did, 


18:56.050 --> 18:59.387
also by having 
a regular family worship 


18:59.387 --> 19:02.000
like this.


19:03.792 --> 19:05.927
That example really showed 


19:05.927 --> 19:09.464
many of the great benefits 
of family worship. 


19:09.463 --> 19:11.733
In addition to the obvious


19:11.733 --> 19:15.203
—coming together to learn 
more about our heavenly Father


19:15.203 --> 19:18.140
—we saw how family worship 
gave the daughter 


19:18.140 --> 19:20.675
an opportunity 
to open up about matters 


19:20.675 --> 19:22.677
that had been bothering her. 


19:22.677 --> 19:24.814
And thanks to the good work 
of the parents,


19:24.813 --> 19:26.948
all of the children 
learned something 


19:26.948 --> 19:29.818
they could apply 
in their daily lives.


19:29.818 --> 19:31.953
We’ve now invited 


19:31.953 --> 19:35.323
Brother and Sister Ortiz 
from New Britain, Connecticut, 


19:35.323 --> 19:37.725
to visit our studio. 


19:37.725 --> 19:41.263
Brother Ortiz serves as an elder 
and as a regular pioneer. 


19:41.263 --> 19:44.600
He’s had many additional privileges 
of service over the years. 


19:44.600 --> 19:49.403
And Linnette has been regular pioneering 
for over six years. 


19:49.403 --> 19:54.275
However, the reason we wanted 
to talk with them is that thus far 


19:54.275 --> 19:58.880
they have successfully countered 
Satan’s attacks on their family. 


19:58.880 --> 20:01.483
We’d like to hear 
how they accomplished this. 


20:01.483 --> 20:03.485
First of all, Freddie, 


20:03.485 --> 20:05.887
tell us a little bit 
about your family.


20:05.887 --> 20:08.957
Neither Linnette nor I 
were raised in the truth. 


20:08.957 --> 20:11.894
However, we met, 
and we fell in love. 


20:11.893 --> 20:14.696
At that time, 
marriage was not for me. 


20:14.697 --> 20:17.765
So we started 
a romantic relationship for two years 


20:17.765 --> 20:21.437
before we started attending 
the first meeting at the Kingdom Hall. 


20:21.437 --> 20:23.972
Soon thereafter, 
we started studying the Bible; 


20:23.972 --> 20:27.509
and we took two studies per week; 
we knew this was the truth. 


20:27.508 --> 20:29.510
But also we learned 


20:29.510 --> 20:32.780
how Jehovah sees immorality, 
so we needed to do some changes. 


20:32.780 --> 20:36.585
Linnette’s parents 
wanted her to continue 


20:36.585 --> 20:40.922
with her education, 
so we needed to change our behavior. 


20:40.922 --> 20:43.659
So two years after, 


20:43.658 --> 20:46.328
we did the changes. 


20:46.328 --> 20:48.796
Number one 
because we did love Jehovah. 


20:48.797 --> 20:51.199
Number two because we loved 
what we were learning. 


20:51.198 --> 20:54.936
It was worth it 
to follow Bible principles. 


20:54.937 --> 20:57.272
So two years later, 
we got married 


20:57.272 --> 21:00.409
and we got baptized
—and we got married.


21:00.408 --> 21:01.543
Very good. 


21:01.543 --> 21:05.480
So, Linnette, you were raised 
without a knowledge of Jehovah God. 


21:05.480 --> 21:08.617
What changes did you both 
have to make to ensure 


21:08.617 --> 21:11.687
your own family 
would have a fine foundation 


21:11.687 --> 21:13.689
and be successful?


21:13.688 --> 21:18.160
Well, prior to our baptism, 
Freddie had a serious drinking problem. 


21:18.160 --> 21:21.863
And based on the way we were raised, 
there was a lot of jealousy going on


21:21.863 --> 21:26.000
and, I would say, a lack of confidence 
and trust in each other. 


21:27.602 --> 21:30.472
My Bible teacher, 
thankfully, suggested to us 


21:30.472 --> 21:34.009
to study the book 
Making Your Family Life Happy. 


21:34.008 --> 21:37.545
And we ended up studying 
that book twice. 


21:37.545 --> 21:41.683
That publication and the Bible principles 
in it became the foundation 


21:41.683 --> 21:46.086
of our wonderful marriage 
and the happy family we enjoy today.


21:46.087 --> 21:47.089
Very nice. 


21:47.088 --> 21:50.958
So, Freddie, maybe you 
can tell us about your children 


21:50.958 --> 21:52.960
and what they are doing 
with their lives now.


21:52.960 --> 21:54.428
We have two sons. 


21:54.428 --> 21:56.431
Gabriel, he’s the oldest one. 


21:56.432 --> 21:59.434
He started regular pioneering 
when he was 14 years old. 


21:59.433 --> 22:03.438
At 18, he was appointed 
as a ministerial servant. 


22:03.438 --> 22:07.308
At 22 years old, he has been working 
in the Plumbing Department 


22:07.308 --> 22:09.510
at the Warwick construction 
for more than two years. 


22:09.510 --> 22:12.713
Adrian is now 18 years old. 


22:12.713 --> 22:16.451
And he also started 
regular pioneering when he was 14. 


22:16.452 --> 22:19.087
Currently, he handles 
the accounts for the congregation 


22:19.087 --> 22:21.757
and other privileges as well.


22:21.757 --> 22:26.362
Well, they both have had 
an early start in their theocratic careers. 


22:26.362 --> 22:28.030
That’s commendable. 


22:28.030 --> 22:30.032
I’m sure you’re both 
proud of them. 


22:30.032 --> 22:32.434
And we’re confident 
that Jehovah, 


22:32.433 --> 22:35.236
the One “to whom 
every family . . . owes its name,” 


22:35.237 --> 22:39.174
is pleased that they are giving 
an answer to his taunter. 


22:39.173 --> 22:42.043
In addition 
to the Family Life book, 


22:42.043 --> 22:45.480
what else contributed 
to the success your family 


22:45.480 --> 22:47.482
has experienced, Linnette?


22:47.482 --> 22:51.285
The Governing Body has provided us 
with so many publications 


22:51.285 --> 22:55.890
with direction for families, 
of course, all based on Jehovah’s Word. 


22:55.890 --> 23:00.762
So we decided early on that whenever 
a question or an issue came up, 


23:00.762 --> 23:04.032
we would not make 
any decision based on impulse. 


23:04.032 --> 23:07.369
Instead, we would research it 
in the publications. 


23:07.368 --> 23:11.105
We pray to Jehovah 
for him to give us wisdom. 


23:11.105 --> 23:14.308
And we even pray 
for him to guide us 


23:14.308 --> 23:18.613
to find the right time to talk 
to each other or to counsel the boys. 


23:18.613 --> 23:22.216
I have always heard 
that there are stages 


23:22.217 --> 23:25.220
in the child’s life 
and personality development. 


23:25.220 --> 23:28.957
So I researched in advance 
as to what to expect. 


23:28.957 --> 23:31.694
In that way, 
we were not surprised 


23:31.693 --> 23:36.498
when we saw changes 
in attitudes or ideas. 


23:36.498 --> 23:39.935
And that helped us 
realize what needed 


23:39.935 --> 23:44.172
to be addressed or corrected 
as opposed to what was normal 


23:44.172 --> 23:47.175
for that stage 
in the boys’ lives.


23:47.175 --> 23:48.443
Very practical. 


23:48.443 --> 23:50.611
Freddie, 
what can you add?


23:50.612 --> 23:54.984
Over the years, I have learned 
how essential it is to become a good listener


23:54.983 --> 23:56.718
—also understanding. 


23:56.718 --> 23:58.786
I tell my family 
how much I love them every day 


23:58.787 --> 24:01.422
because we never know 
when circumstances might change. 


24:01.422 --> 24:04.960
Family worship 
is very important for us. 


24:04.960 --> 24:08.763
I know it is easy to put off, 
but the benefits are hard to beat. 


24:08.763 --> 24:11.966
Well, 
before this arrangement started, 


24:11.967 --> 24:17.039
we as a family, we valued 
the Bible study with the family. 


24:17.038 --> 24:22.110
I learned that a fetus 
that is six months, 


24:22.110 --> 24:24.712
he can recognize 
the family’s voice. 


24:24.712 --> 24:28.850
So I started a Bible study with my sons 
when they were still in the womb . . .


24:28.850 --> 24:30.118
Isn’t that nice.


24:30.118 --> 24:33.455
. . . and continued 
to do so after that. 


24:33.455 --> 24:37.392
I know that secular work 
and other activities 


24:37.392 --> 24:41.462
can block 
a regular program, 


24:41.462 --> 24:45.000
but we need to fight that tendency 
if we want to succeed in family worship.


24:45.000 --> 24:47.002
Very good. 


24:47.002 --> 24:49.337
Well, it seems your efforts 
paid off when we consider 


24:49.337 --> 24:52.740
how well your family 
has done spiritually 


24:52.740 --> 24:56.645
and the close relationship 
you have with each other. 


24:56.645 --> 25:00.348
Now Linnette, 
it sounds as if the family is perfect


25:00.348 --> 25:02.783
—no challenges. 


25:02.783 --> 25:04.785
Is that the case?


25:04.785 --> 25:06.788
No, not at all. 


25:06.788 --> 25:10.391
First Corinthians 10:13 says 
that Christians will face 


25:10.392 --> 25:12.527
challenges 
that are “common to [all] men.” 


25:12.527 --> 25:17.465
And we have faced the normal challenges 
that come with raising a family. 


25:17.465 --> 25:20.768
The same verse indicates 


25:20.768 --> 25:24.906
that if we do things 
Jehovah’s way, 


25:24.907 --> 25:29.777
we may increase the opportunity 
for him to “make the way out” for us. 


25:29.777 --> 25:31.780
One unexpected challenge 


25:31.780 --> 25:35.083
that has changed 
our family dynamics 


25:35.083 --> 25:37.685
over the years now, 
was when Freddie 


25:37.685 --> 25:40.888
was diagnosed 
with cancer in 2012. 


25:40.888 --> 25:45.560
The treatment was aggressive 
and took its toll on his health. 


25:45.560 --> 25:48.563
Our whole lifestyle changed. 


25:48.563 --> 25:50.965
We had to move out 
from our house . . .


25:50.965 --> 25:52.100
Oh, boy.


25:52.100 --> 25:54.135
. . . to an apartment, 


25:54.135 --> 25:56.303
we gave away our dog, Spike, 


25:56.303 --> 26:02.000
and we have to watch our expenses 
really closely to keep going. 


26:03.745 --> 26:07.582
This could have put a lot 
of strain in our family, 


26:07.582 --> 26:10.652
in our marriage, 
and in our spirituality. 


26:10.652 --> 26:15.390
But, again, by praying to Jehovah constantly
and applying Bible principles, 


26:15.390 --> 26:18.727
I can say my marriage 


26:18.727 --> 26:20.729
and my family 
have never been better.


26:20.728 --> 26:21.863
Wow.


26:21.863 --> 26:26.033
Spiritually, we kept our routine, 
and we all stayed 


26:26.033 --> 26:28.836
in full-time service 
throughout the ordeal. 


26:28.837 --> 26:32.107
The boys 
have cooperated very well. 


26:32.107 --> 26:35.110
They have offered 
to work to give us money. 


26:35.110 --> 26:38.913
But we prefer for them 
to keep focused on the Kingdom 


26:38.913 --> 26:42.250
because we are confident 
that Jehovah 


26:42.250 --> 26:45.320
will add on 
to the things we need. 


26:45.320 --> 26:48.390
Freddie has been 
a great example for all of us 


26:48.390 --> 26:50.458
because he pushes himself 


26:50.458 --> 26:53.528
to keep his spiritual routine. 


26:53.528 --> 26:56.865
You never see him 
complaining or in a bad mood. 


26:56.865 --> 27:00.335
And that has been very inspiring 
for the rest of the family.


27:00.335 --> 27:02.000
Boy, that is quite a story. 


27:03.738 --> 27:07.708
You folks will certainly relate 
to the convention drama video 


27:07.708 --> 27:10.378
that was advertised 
on our April program. 


27:10.378 --> 27:14.848
Freddie, we’re very sorry to hear 
about your physical condition. 


27:14.848 --> 27:18.720
Are there any 
favorite scriptures that you use 


27:18.720 --> 27:21.790
to help keep you going spiritually 
and to stay strong?


27:21.790 --> 27:24.325
There are many of them. 


27:24.325 --> 27:29.030
Just to mention a few, 
Philippians 4:6,7 


27:29.030 --> 27:32.900
has been my life since 2012, 


27:32.900 --> 27:34.968
where I have to pray 
to Jehovah constantly 


27:34.968 --> 27:37.171
so that he can give me 
the strength that I need 


27:37.172 --> 27:40.442
to overcome my health. 


27:40.442 --> 27:43.845
And also, 
Philippians says 


27:43.845 --> 27:47.182
that he will give us 
peace of mind. 


27:47.182 --> 27:50.485
In addition, 
he will safeguard our heart. 


27:50.485 --> 27:54.288
And that’s something 
I’ve been seeing from Jehovah. 


27:54.288 --> 27:58.826
Also, Isaiah 41:10 states: 


27:58.827 --> 28:03.030
“Do not be anxious, 
for I am your God.” 


28:03.030 --> 28:06.633
Those words give me comfort 
that he will keep on helping us 


28:06.633 --> 28:10.871
in these different circumstances 
in our life. 


28:10.872 --> 28:14.742
I do understand that my wife has a lot 
of responsibilities in the household,


28:14.742 --> 28:17.412
so I had to reread 
Proverbs 31 


28:17.412 --> 28:20.282
verses 10 to 31, 


28:20.282 --> 28:23.419
where it describes 
all of the responsibility a good wife 


28:23.418 --> 28:26.286
might have to shoulder 
for the family. 


28:26.287 --> 28:29.424
So Brother Morris, 
she is my Proverbs 31 wife!


28:29.423 --> 28:32.426
A good wife for sure. 


28:32.427 --> 28:36.297
You’ve obviously shown how much 
you love and respect each other. 


28:36.297 --> 28:38.299
That’s commendable. 


28:38.298 --> 28:41.701
And your focus on being the best parents 
you could be is a good example 


28:41.702 --> 28:45.005
for parents viewing 
the program at this time. 


28:45.005 --> 28:48.142
This will come 
as a surprise to you, 


28:48.142 --> 28:51.980
but we would like to invite your two sons 
out to see what they remember 


28:51.980 --> 28:55.083
from growing up 
in the family.


28:55.083 --> 28:59.000
We have Gabriel 
and Adrian with us. 


29:04.792 --> 29:07.262
Mom’s getting a little teary-eyed. 


29:07.262 --> 29:10.399
That’s understandable. 
It was a surprise, see. 


29:10.398 --> 29:14.768
So Gabriel, 
since you’re the oldest, 


29:14.768 --> 29:17.238
we will start with you. 


29:17.238 --> 29:19.773
What do you remember 
about your family life, 


29:19.773 --> 29:23.511
first in Puerto Rico 
and later here in the United States?


29:23.512 --> 29:28.015
I remember faithfully going 
to all the meetings and going out in service


29:28.015 --> 29:31.218
every Saturday
—that was just the routine. 


29:31.218 --> 29:34.221
In Puerto Rico, 
my dad had to work a lot though, 


29:34.222 --> 29:37.259
and like he said before, 
that’s easy to get in the way 


29:37.258 --> 29:40.861
of a good family worship routine. 


29:40.862 --> 29:45.065
But I can honestly say that once we made 
that transition of moving over here, 


29:45.065 --> 29:48.268
that helped us to have 
a good family worship routine, 


29:48.268 --> 29:51.705
and it has helped us 
to get closer and closer each day.


29:51.705 --> 29:53.007
Now, isn’t that nice?


29:53.007 --> 29:56.044
Now, Adrian, anything you can add 
about the homelife?


29:56.043 --> 29:58.345
Yeah, my mom 
and dad have always 


29:58.345 --> 30:02.217
shown a great love for Jehovah 
but also for each other. 


30:02.217 --> 30:05.954
So as kids, 
you could just sense that. 


30:05.953 --> 30:08.155
So love and respect 
is what we’ve always known. 


30:08.155 --> 30:12.760
Even now that my brother and I are older, 
we have a great bond with each other. 


30:12.760 --> 30:16.097
We love each other and we can tell 
each other everything about our lives. 


30:16.097 --> 30:19.567
And it’s due to that love 
and respect that they have shown. 


30:19.567 --> 30:21.635
And even if there are disagreements, 


30:21.635 --> 30:23.638
which there are always going 
to be disagreements 


30:23.638 --> 30:25.640
because it’s an imperfect family, 


30:25.640 --> 30:29.510
but that love is always there 
to bridge those differences. 


30:29.510 --> 30:32.647
I also would like to add, 
something that helped me a lot 


30:32.647 --> 30:35.717
was a routine 
that my dad and I had 


30:35.717 --> 30:39.920
right before going to school; 
we would always read the daily text. 


30:39.920 --> 30:44.158
And he would always say, “Behave, 
and remember that Jehovah loves you.” 


30:44.158 --> 30:48.730
I don’t think he knows 
how much that really helped me 


30:48.730 --> 30:50.932
go through 
everyday challenges at school.


30:50.932 --> 30:52.934
That’s priceless. 


30:52.933 --> 30:55.836
Now, very nice observations. 


30:55.837 --> 31:00.375
Gabriel, I’m interested 
in understanding what prompted you 


31:00.375 --> 31:04.245
to regular pioneer 
when you were only 14 years old?


31:04.245 --> 31:06.915
It was at a point 
where my dad lost his job. 


31:06.915 --> 31:09.417
Rather than stressing about it
—worrying about it


31:09.417 --> 31:13.087
—he looked at things 
with a spiritual perspective. 


31:13.087 --> 31:15.089
So he started to pioneer. 


31:15.088 --> 31:18.158
And since our schedules 
matched perfectly, 


31:18.158 --> 31:20.160
I was his little pioneer buddy. 


31:20.160 --> 31:22.897
I would go out in service 
with him whenever he needed it. 


31:22.897 --> 31:26.767
And I feel like if spiritual families, 
you know, focus on spiritual matters, 


31:26.767 --> 31:29.904
it helps them 
to become closer. 


31:29.903 --> 31:32.773
And I can’t imagine 
how our relationship 


31:32.773 --> 31:35.776
and respect for one another 
can be any better than what it is now.


31:35.777 --> 31:37.645
Very nice. 


31:37.645 --> 31:40.415
Now, Adrian, 
you began pioneering 


31:40.415 --> 31:42.417
when you were 14 as well. 


31:42.417 --> 31:45.354
How do you think 
that affected you as a person?


31:45.353 --> 31:48.355
Well, first of all, 
the reason why I started pioneering 


31:48.355 --> 31:51.558
was because I was going out in service 
with the rest of my family, 


31:51.558 --> 31:55.330
and since they were already pioneering, 
I was getting the time in. 


31:55.330 --> 31:58.633
But I do think 
that taking on the responsibility 


31:58.633 --> 32:00.968
of getting 
at least 70 hours a month 


32:00.968 --> 32:05.506
in the service 
does make you think differently 


32:05.507 --> 32:07.575
at 14 than it would have otherwise. 


32:07.575 --> 32:10.778
I think it has helped me 
mature spiritually, 


32:10.778 --> 32:14.548
and it has contributed to me being used 
to my full potential in the congregation. 


32:14.548 --> 32:19.553
And honestly, I wouldn’t trade it 
for anything, well, maybe going to Bethel.


32:19.553 --> 32:22.956
Gabriel, back to you. 


32:22.957 --> 32:25.360
Tell us what was it like 
when you learned 


32:25.360 --> 32:28.095
that your dad 
had a serious health problem 


32:28.095 --> 32:32.233
and would not be able to provide 
for the family like he used to?


32:32.233 --> 32:36.036
That was probably one 
of the biggest challenges I have ever faced.


32:36.037 --> 32:39.974
When my dad got diagnosed with cancer, 
it was about the same time 


32:39.973 --> 32:43.043
that I got my call to Bethel. 


32:43.043 --> 32:45.580
And I was torn; I was divided. 


32:45.580 --> 32:48.182
I felt like if I was to go 
to Bethel now, 


32:48.182 --> 32:52.387
it would be selfish of me 
to leave my family at a time like that. 


32:52.387 --> 32:55.255
But my family 
always had a spiritual view 


32:55.255 --> 32:59.960
on things and cited scriptures 
like Matthew 6:33 constantly. 


32:59.960 --> 33:04.032
It helped me to see as a whole—as a family
—we put Kingdom interests first; 


33:04.032 --> 33:06.034
that Jehovah 
was going to provide 


33:06.033 --> 33:08.635
because he’s a loving father 
and friend. 


33:08.635 --> 33:12.973
And then my dad lost his job, 
and again all these feelings came up. 


33:12.973 --> 33:16.176
But my family was adamant. 


33:16.177 --> 33:20.080
They let me know that the congregation 
had been taking care of them 


33:20.080 --> 33:23.317
for months now, 
and then doing some simplifying 


33:23.317 --> 33:25.454
on their own 
helped them as well. 


33:25.453 --> 33:27.521
And I didn’t have to worry 
about anything. 


33:27.522 --> 33:31.592
I do know that there’s a scripture that says
that we’ve got to take care of our own. 


33:31.592 --> 33:35.530
So I do anything I can 
to help my family back home. 


33:35.530 --> 33:40.402
The only thing I hope 
is that I can have a good faith 


33:40.402 --> 33:44.772
like they’ve shown 
through these difficult times.


33:44.772 --> 33:48.242
Well, thank all of you 
for joining us. 


33:48.242 --> 33:51.112
I think all of us 
are feeling that emotion 


33:51.112 --> 33:53.647
and feel very close 
to you for sharing that. 


33:53.647 --> 33:57.719
Now, as a father, I can appreciate 
all that Freddie is trying to do 


33:57.718 --> 34:00.253
as head of the family. 


34:00.253 --> 34:03.156
And, Linnette, your support 
beyond normal 


34:03.157 --> 34:05.760
is very much 
to be commended. 


34:05.760 --> 34:09.030
We can tell your family 
is thriving spiritually, 


34:09.030 --> 34:12.500
and we pray Jehovah 
will continue to bless your efforts, 


34:12.500 --> 34:14.502
come what may. 


34:14.502 --> 34:16.770
And we thank you, 
Gabriel and Adrian, 


34:16.770 --> 34:20.642
for your surprise 
to the studio. 


34:20.642 --> 34:24.312
Thank you very much 
for taking the time to be interviewed.


34:24.312 --> 34:25.012
Thank you for the privilege.


34:25.012 --> 34:25.647
Thank you for the privilege.


34:25.647 --> 34:26.280
Thank you.


34:26.280 --> 34:28.783
As we just learned, 


34:28.783 --> 34:33.420
an excellent way of maintaining 
the spirituality of the family 


34:33.420 --> 34:37.558
is by spending quality time 
together in the ministry. 


34:37.558 --> 34:42.028
We would now like to introduce you 
to a family from Russia. 


34:42.028 --> 34:45.098
They traveled far away 
to work together 


34:45.098 --> 34:48.435
in unassigned territory 
in Siberia. 


34:48.435 --> 34:52.407
Their experience confirms 
how spiritual activities 


34:52.407 --> 34:57.010
not only build up our faith 
but can also bring our family 


34:57.010 --> 35:01.000
closer to each other.


35:05.453 --> 35:08.923
We are traveling 
to a very interesting territory. 


35:08.923 --> 35:12.393
It is on the shores 
of Lake Baikal. 


35:12.393 --> 35:16.596
From where we live, 
it is 600 kilometers.


35:16.597 --> 35:20.000
We have so many memories 
to take home. 


35:20.000 --> 35:24.305
The scenery is always stunning 
in all types of weather.


35:24.305 --> 35:28.000
Here there are beautiful cliffs 
and valleys.


35:29.577 --> 35:31.745
We cross 
several mountain passes. 


35:31.745 --> 35:35.115
Then we go by ferry.


35:35.115 --> 35:39.787
It felt very strange 
being in the car while crossing the river.


35:39.787 --> 35:43.190
When we have the opportunity, 
we witness 


35:43.190 --> 35:44.992
to people 
we meet on the way.


35:44.992 --> 35:48.295
Why do sincere people 
trust the Holy Scriptures? 


35:48.295 --> 35:51.765
Please have a look 
at what it says here: 


35:51.765 --> 35:54.000
“All scripture is inspired of God.”


35:56.470 --> 36:00.842
We usually serve 
in isolated territory for a week or more. 


36:00.842 --> 36:04.479
We have come to the same place 
where we were last year, 


36:04.478 --> 36:06.680
so we already know 
a lot about it.


36:06.680 --> 36:08.715
Living in a tent 


36:08.715 --> 36:11.452
is very different 
from living in the city. 


36:11.452 --> 36:13.454
Here we don’t have 


36:13.453 --> 36:16.023
any conveniences, 
like a toilet or a shower. 


36:16.023 --> 36:20.761
The only place to wash 
is in Lake Baikal, which is freezing. 


36:20.762 --> 36:25.465
This simple life 
is like an adventure.


36:25.465 --> 36:28.235
As we have quite a big group


36:28.235 --> 36:32.407
—there are 12 of us
—we have also organized 


36:32.407 --> 36:34.442
our spiritual routine. 


36:34.442 --> 36:37.745
We consider 
the daily text together and take part 


36:37.745 --> 36:41.482
in discussing our publications 
using the questions.


36:41.482 --> 36:44.585
We have a friendly, 
relaxed atmosphere. 


36:44.585 --> 36:47.588
Everybody enjoys it.


36:47.588 --> 36:51.025
Our isolated territory, 
where we are preaching, 


36:51.025 --> 36:53.127
is a rural area. 


36:53.127 --> 36:55.395
Here we don’t have 
any prepared maps. 


36:55.395 --> 36:58.065
So when we have our meetings 
for field service, 


36:58.065 --> 37:02.000
we divide up, 
all taking different streets. 


37:03.972 --> 37:06.974
We also think 
about what clothes to wear. 


37:06.973 --> 37:09.310
Experience has shown 
that our clothes 


37:09.310 --> 37:12.413
can help us 
to win over these people. 


37:12.413 --> 37:17.000
So we try to dress simply. 
We don’t wear ties.


37:18.785 --> 37:21.755
The people there are kind. 


37:21.755 --> 37:24.492
Sometimes they even invite us in.


37:24.492 --> 37:29.297
We can have discussions 
with some of them—sometimes long ones.


37:29.297 --> 37:31.665
There you meet 
more receptive people 


37:31.665 --> 37:34.502
than unresponsive ones, 


37:34.502 --> 37:36.804
and that really is encouraging. 


37:36.803 --> 37:40.073
It makes you just want 
to keep on preaching 


37:40.073 --> 37:42.710
without stopping.


37:42.710 --> 37:45.312
The trips have helped 
our son make spiritual progress. 


37:45.312 --> 37:49.317
For us as his parents, 
that is the greatest blessing. 


37:49.317 --> 37:51.319
For example, 


37:51.318 --> 37:55.956
after one of these trips, 
he became an unbaptized publisher.


37:55.957 --> 37:58.392
This territory is different 


37:58.392 --> 38:00.594
from what I am used to, 
so I was worried. 


38:00.593 --> 38:03.796
I didn’t know 
what sort of people lived there 


38:03.797 --> 38:06.867
or what their attitude 
was toward Witnesses. 


38:06.867 --> 38:11.805
But after praying when knocking 
on the first door, my fear disappeared. 


38:11.805 --> 38:15.142
I was able to place 270 tracts.


38:15.142 --> 38:18.012
While we were witnessing, 


38:18.012 --> 38:20.547
we showed the people 
the addresses in our publications 


38:20.547 --> 38:22.817
so that they could write 


38:22.817 --> 38:26.154
if they found
what they had read interesting. 


38:26.153 --> 38:30.090
We usually start witnessing 
about 12 noon, and we finish 


38:30.090 --> 38:31.925
around 5:00 p.m. 


38:31.925 --> 38:36.000
Then the relaxation part 
of our day begins.


38:39.600 --> 38:41.602
We have a campfire, 


38:41.602 --> 38:45.605
some games, 
some music, and fun.


38:45.605 --> 38:49.210
Early in the day, 
we used our energy in the ministry, 


38:49.210 --> 38:53.280
and afterward we were able 
to relax and enjoy each other’s company.


38:53.280 --> 38:57.017
So we combine 
both our ministry and relaxation. 


38:57.017 --> 39:01.189
One of the delights 
of these trips is the fish


39:01.188 --> 39:04.000
—the famous Baikal omul.


39:05.760 --> 39:10.597
These trips really strengthen 
the unity in our family.


39:10.597 --> 39:14.202
We really have 
drawn closer together.


39:14.202 --> 39:17.705
It is invigorating 
and enriches us spiritually. 


39:17.705 --> 39:20.808
We experience 
pure joy from knowing 


39:20.808 --> 39:23.910
that Jehovah 
has blessed our efforts. 


39:23.910 --> 39:28.000
We feel like we have our batteries 
charged for the entire year.


39:34.522 --> 39:37.725
It is very encouraging to see 


39:37.725 --> 39:40.693
such a spiritually focused family. 


39:40.693 --> 39:43.830
And did you notice 
that it was after one such trip 


39:43.830 --> 39:47.367
that their son 
became an unbaptized publisher? 


39:47.367 --> 39:51.639
I’m sure that brought 
much joy to his parents.


39:51.638 --> 39:54.641
Are you interested 
in a preaching assignment


39:54.642 --> 39:56.844
in territory seldom worked? 


39:56.843 --> 40:01.181
If so, form a group 
of no more than 20 publishers 


40:01.182 --> 40:04.919
and ask the elders 
in your congregation for further instructions


40:04.918 --> 40:08.521
and an Application 
for Territory Seldom Worked. 


40:08.522 --> 40:12.927
Once you have filled out the form, 
the Congregation Service Committee 


40:12.927 --> 40:17.064
will review it and submit it 
to your local branch.


40:17.063 --> 40:20.935
Theocratic activities, 
such as family worship, 


40:20.935 --> 40:25.940
spending time in the ministry together, 
along with balanced amounts of recreation,


40:25.940 --> 40:29.277
can truly fortify our family. 


40:29.277 --> 40:32.680
As we saw in the interview 
with the Ortiz family, 


40:32.680 --> 40:37.552
such spiritual preparation 
helps us when we face challenges. 


40:37.552 --> 40:42.490
In this dramatization, 
a family followed Scriptural counsel 


40:42.490 --> 40:46.227
when they faced the challenge 
of having to relocate 


40:46.227 --> 40:49.000
to another city.


40:51.398 --> 40:55.535
For 23 years, 
we’ve called this place home. 


40:55.535 --> 40:57.872
We’ve raised a family here


40:57.872 --> 41:01.109
—two beautiful girls.


41:01.108 --> 41:06.046
Six months ago, 
my boss called me into his office. 


41:06.047 --> 41:08.582
The company was restructuring. 


41:08.582 --> 41:12.419
They valued my work, 
but if I wanted to keep my job, 


41:12.418 --> 41:13.953
I would need to move. 


41:13.953 --> 41:15.788
It was a difficult decision. 


41:15.788 --> 41:20.126
My job allowed me to support my family well,
and it had never interfered 


41:20.127 --> 41:22.395
with our spiritual routine.


41:22.395 --> 41:24.632
We said many prayers about it. 


41:24.632 --> 41:29.237
We discussed it as a family, 
and we decided to move. 


41:29.237 --> 41:32.540
But we were anxious. 


41:32.540 --> 41:37.210
My family has only ever known 
one home, one congregation. 


41:37.210 --> 41:39.313
My girls have many friends 
in the congregation, 


41:39.313 --> 41:42.950
good examples who are helping them 
to serve Jehovah. 


41:42.950 --> 41:46.753
This is going 
to be hard on all of us.


41:46.753 --> 41:50.756
A brother in our hall had moved 
into the congregation a few years ago. 


41:50.757 --> 41:55.362
I asked him how his family 
coped with the challenge. 


41:55.362 --> 42:00.034
He said that the key to staying grounded 
is maintaining the one thing 


42:00.033 --> 42:03.936
that should never change 
—our spiritual routine.


42:03.937 --> 42:06.940
But that requires 
work and planning 


42:06.940 --> 42:10.677
to make sure our move doesn’t stop us 
from getting to the meetings, 


42:10.677 --> 42:13.047
sharing in the ministry, 
spending time


42:13.047 --> 42:17.484
with our brothers and sisters, 
and looking after our family.


42:17.483 --> 42:19.886
His advice was spot-on. 


42:19.887 --> 42:24.792
After some research, I found a scripture 
that illustrated our situation. 


42:24.792 --> 42:28.929
“And the rain poured down 
and the floods came 


42:28.928 --> 42:33.733
“and the winds blew and lashed 
against that house, but it did not cave in, 


42:33.733 --> 42:37.638
for it had been founded on the rock.”


42:37.638 --> 42:41.575
The discreet man 
built his house on good foundations. 


42:41.575 --> 42:44.478
It took a plan, 
and he worked hard. 


42:44.478 --> 42:47.681
When the storm came, 
his house survived.


42:47.682 --> 42:50.050
As a family, 


42:50.050 --> 42:54.588
we needed a plan that would help us 
stay spiritually grounded through our move. 


42:54.588 --> 42:57.691
So we wrote our own plan. 


42:57.692 --> 43:00.860
Just like the discreet man, 


43:00.860 --> 43:05.332
we wanted to build our move 
on a strong spiritual foundation.


43:05.332 --> 43:09.804
So we made a visit 
to our new congregation ahead of our move.


43:09.803 --> 43:12.371
Over the years, 
it becomes a comfort 


43:12.372 --> 43:15.575
to walk into a Kingdom Hall 
and see familiar faces. 


43:15.575 --> 43:20.847
Walking into our new congregation 
reminded me 


43:20.847 --> 43:23.517
how much we are going 
to miss everyone.


43:23.517 --> 43:28.289
But the Bible tells us 
that ‘with the measure we measure out, 


43:28.288 --> 43:31.058
others will measure 
to us in return.’ 


43:31.058 --> 43:36.000
So we resolved 
to show love first.


43:37.130 --> 43:38.765
Hello, I’m Jessica.


43:38.765 --> 43:40.600
Hi, I’m Samantha. 
Nice to meet you.


43:40.600 --> 43:44.905
The best way to get to know 
our new congregation is to work 


43:44.905 --> 43:47.507
with the brothers 
and sisters in the ministry. 


43:47.507 --> 43:50.244
No matter where we go, 
we’ll find people 


43:50.243 --> 43:53.946
that love Jehovah 
and each other.


43:53.947 --> 43:57.284
Moving day finally arrived. 


43:57.283 --> 43:59.285
The last boxes were packed. 


43:59.285 --> 44:04.000
We locked the door one final time 
and began our journey to our new home.


44:13.433 --> 44:16.070
It took effort, 


44:16.070 --> 44:20.507
but visiting the congregation 
ahead of time 


44:20.507 --> 44:22.509
was well worth it. 


44:22.508 --> 44:25.945
Look! 
We already have friends here. 


44:25.945 --> 44:28.515
Unpacking seemed to never end, 


44:28.515 --> 44:33.020
but the one thing 
that we all promised ourselves 


44:33.020 --> 44:35.688
at family worship 
was that we would not let 


44:35.688 --> 44:40.000
our move affect 
our spiritual routine.


44:41.628 --> 44:45.000
Has anyone seen my ties? 


44:46.200 --> 44:48.468
Found them!


44:48.468 --> 44:52.005
We planned that we 
wouldn’t let anything stop us 


44:52.005 --> 44:54.007
from going to the meetings. 


44:54.007 --> 44:57.477
The ministry is very different. 


44:57.477 --> 45:02.382
We’ve had to adapt 
and learn new techniques. 


45:02.382 --> 45:04.719
The brothers and sisters 
are different too. 


45:04.718 --> 45:07.586
It’s important not to focus 


45:07.587 --> 45:10.557
on negative comparisons. 


45:10.557 --> 45:15.495
Instead, be positive.


45:15.495 --> 45:19.633
During this transition, 
it is especially important to be sensitive 


45:19.633 --> 45:21.635
to our spiritual needs. 


45:21.635 --> 45:26.307
Family worship is vital. 


45:26.307 --> 45:30.377
Keeping spiritually grounded 
through such a big transition isn’t easy, 


45:30.377 --> 45:33.414
especially with a family. 


45:33.413 --> 45:37.416
It took a lot of time 
and energy to care for our needs, 


45:37.417 --> 45:41.622
not just spiritually, 
but emotionally too.


45:41.622 --> 45:44.692
Planning ahead, 
like the discreet man, 


45:44.692 --> 45:49.000
helped our family 
to stay spiritually grounded.


45:50.963 --> 45:54.100
Having a spiritually strong family 


45:54.100 --> 45:57.838
prepares us also 
for other changes in life. 


45:57.838 --> 46:01.541
Perhaps you are in your teens 
and you’re starting to notice 


46:01.542 --> 46:03.877
those of the opposite sex. 


46:03.877 --> 46:07.882
Such emotions are natural 
and are part of growing up. 


46:07.882 --> 46:10.484
But if you’re not old enough 
to get married, 


46:10.483 --> 46:12.751
what do you need 
to keep in mind? 


46:12.752 --> 46:16.055
This young sister 
made wise decisions 


46:16.055 --> 46:20.000
with the loving help 
of her parents.


46:30.837 --> 46:32.840
Uhh, yours?


46:32.840 --> 46:34.273
Yeah. 
Thanks. 


46:34.273 --> 46:35.941
You’re Lily, right?


46:35.942 --> 46:37.945
Yeah. 
And you’re Sean.


46:37.945 --> 46:39.412
Yeah. 
I’ve seen you around. 


46:39.412 --> 46:41.482
You play good basketball.


46:41.482 --> 46:43.784
Thanks. 
So do you.


46:43.783 --> 46:45.785
So you want 
to hang out sometime?


46:45.785 --> 46:48.000
Sure.


46:50.590 --> 46:55.000
My name is Lily, 
and I sorta had this problem. 


46:57.263 --> 47:01.235
There’s a boy named Sean 
that recently moved to our school. 


47:01.235 --> 47:05.505
I know I’m not supposed 
to like anyone who is not a Witness. 


47:05.505 --> 47:07.975
The trouble was, 


47:07.975 --> 47:10.577
he is a Witness. 


47:10.577 --> 47:13.680
Sean and his family 
moved into our congregation. 


47:13.680 --> 47:16.617
And the more I saw of him, 


47:16.617 --> 47:18.619
the more I liked him.


47:18.618 --> 47:21.455
“My strength is exhausted 
because of my sighing. 


47:21.455 --> 47:23.290
“If only I knew 
where to find God! 


47:23.290 --> 47:25.292
“I would go 
to his place of dwelling. 


47:25.292 --> 47:26.000
I would present my . . .”


47:46.980 --> 47:48.982
Like I said, 


47:48.982 --> 47:51.000
“I had a problem.”


47:55.588 --> 47:58.000
Every day I see 
couples my age at school. 


48:00.560 --> 48:03.000
To me, they look happy. 


48:05.998 --> 48:10.000
Honestly, I wanted 
that happiness too.


48:13.207 --> 48:18.000
My parents noticed my problem too 
and talked about it that night.


48:23.817 --> 48:28.222
And pretty soon 
I didn’t feel alone anymore. 


48:28.222 --> 48:33.160
The next day, my mom invited me 
to go with her to run an errand.


48:33.160 --> 48:36.563
Afterward, 
we went to a little café. 


48:36.563 --> 48:38.598
She asked me 
how things were going. 


48:38.598 --> 48:42.135
At first, 
I didn’t want to tell her, 


48:42.135 --> 48:45.072
but she made me 
feel really comfortable. 


48:45.072 --> 48:47.440
So I told her 
my feelings for Sean, 


48:47.440 --> 48:50.943
expecting her 
to think bad of me. 


48:50.943 --> 48:52.946
But she didn’t.


48:52.947 --> 48:55.949
Everything you’re feeling 
is natural, Lily. 


48:55.948 --> 48:59.953
I remember having these same feelings 
when I was your age too.


48:59.953 --> 49:01.220
Really?


49:01.220 --> 49:02.555
It’s true. 


49:02.555 --> 49:05.392
That’s just how Jehovah 
created us, Honey. 


49:05.392 --> 49:08.829
And because he created us, 
he knows 


49:08.828 --> 49:11.298
the best way 
for us to be happy. 


49:11.298 --> 49:14.033
And that’s all he wants for us. 


49:14.033 --> 49:17.503
And that’s all Daddy 
and I want for you too.


49:17.503 --> 49:19.505
She didn’t scold me; 


49:19.505 --> 49:22.508
she didn’t make me 
feel embarrassed. 


49:22.508 --> 49:24.510
And most importantly, 


49:24.510 --> 49:27.613
she didn’t seem to be in a rush.


49:27.613 --> 49:30.950
My mom wasn’t the only one 
helping me. 


49:30.950 --> 49:34.822
My dad was preparing 
to help me with my problem too.


49:34.822 --> 49:37.757
That evening, 
we had family worship. 


49:37.757 --> 49:42.095
And once again,
they just let me talk. 


49:42.095 --> 49:45.632
They told me I didn’t have 
to hold back, so I didn’t.


49:45.632 --> 49:47.367
I just don’t know what to do.


49:47.367 --> 49:50.970
Lily, thank you 
for telling us how you feel. 


49:50.970 --> 49:55.942
Let me ask you something: 
Why do you think Jehovah created us 


49:55.942 --> 49:59.345
with these natural feelings 
toward the opposite sex?


49:59.345 --> 50:02.748
So that one day a man 
and woman could marry.


50:02.748 --> 50:03.883
That’s right! 


50:03.883 --> 50:08.488
In fact, a good marriage 
is like two skaters on the ice. 


50:08.488 --> 50:10.756
A beautiful performance 


50:10.757 --> 50:13.694
can seem effortless, 
but is it really?


50:13.693 --> 50:14.828
No.


50:14.828 --> 50:18.098
No one would even 
attempt that without practice, 


50:18.098 --> 50:21.968
a capable partner, 
or the right kind of guidance, right?


50:21.968 --> 50:23.236
Yeah.


50:23.237 --> 50:26.707
Well, it’s the same 
with a good marriage, Sweetie. 


50:26.707 --> 50:28.709
It doesn’t just happen. 


50:28.708 --> 50:32.745
It too depends 
on a good partner, 


50:32.745 --> 50:36.817
coordinated effort, 
but most importantly, 


50:36.817 --> 50:39.452
wise counsel from Jehovah. 


50:39.452 --> 50:41.489
In fact, 


50:41.488 --> 50:43.490
could you please turn with me 


50:43.490 --> 50:48.328
to Psalm 32:8 
and read that for us.


50:48.328 --> 50:50.330
Sure. 


50:50.330 --> 50:53.733
It says: 
“I will give you insight 


50:53.733 --> 50:56.068
“and instruct you 
in the way you should go. 


50:56.068 --> 50:59.105
I will give you advice 
with my eye upon you.”


50:59.105 --> 51:02.175
Lily, Jehovah loves us very much. 


51:02.175 --> 51:04.210
And if we listen to him, 


51:04.210 --> 51:06.880
we’ll make good decisions in our life 


51:06.880 --> 51:10.117
with absolutely no regrets.


51:10.117 --> 51:14.320
We talked some more, 
and then I got some homework. 


51:14.320 --> 51:18.558
My dad gave me some articles 
he printed out for me to read, 


51:18.558 --> 51:21.226
so I did. 


51:21.227 --> 51:23.730
And as I read the words 


51:23.730 --> 51:25.732
and started meditating on them, 


51:25.732 --> 51:28.602
I realized something.


51:28.602 --> 51:31.672
By holding off dating a little longer, 


51:31.672 --> 51:34.000
I wasn’t missing out. 


51:35.975 --> 51:39.913
Rather, I was preparing myself. 


51:39.913 --> 51:42.215
I could use the time now 


51:42.215 --> 51:44.650
to focus on something 
much more important


51:44.650 --> 51:48.655
—my relationship with Jehovah. 


51:48.655 --> 51:52.892
I could also gain Christian qualities 
and experience that will help me later 


51:52.892 --> 51:57.000
if I ever do get married.


52:01.902 --> 52:06.907
A strong spiritual upbringing 
can truly be a protection for us 


52:06.907 --> 52:12.000
when young 
but also strengthens us as adults.


52:13.280 --> 52:16.148
Brother Erich Frost 
was a young man in Germany 


52:16.148 --> 52:21.086
who set a good example 
in making wise decisions early in life. 


52:21.087 --> 52:26.025
He was born in 1900, 
baptized 23 years later, 


52:26.025 --> 52:29.762
and entered 
the full-time ministry in 1928. 


52:29.762 --> 52:33.600
Not long after, he was put in charge 
of the underground work 


52:33.600 --> 52:37.337
of the persecuted 
Witnesses of Jehovah in Germany, 


52:37.337 --> 52:40.874
caring well for that assignment 
for eight months 


52:40.873 --> 52:43.210
until he was incarcerated. 


52:43.210 --> 52:46.045
In this archived audio recording, 


52:46.045 --> 52:50.250
you will hear the fascinating experience 
of how Brother Frost 


52:50.250 --> 52:54.120
composed a Kingdom melody 
in the middle of Sachsenhausen


52:54.120 --> 52:57.000
—a Nazi concentration camp.


53:01.127 --> 53:05.000
I always had the desire 
to compose music.


53:08.768 --> 53:10.803
As everybody knows, 
we had the hardest work 


53:10.803 --> 53:14.673
and suffered the hardest 
in the concentration camps. 


53:14.673 --> 53:17.143
We were starved, 
the labor 


53:17.143 --> 53:22.000
exceeded our strength, 
and the harassment was often unbearable.


53:30.190 --> 53:35.062
So, as usual, I wanted to find 
a way to build up the brothers. 


53:35.062 --> 53:39.000
We had such a fine unity 
there in the Sachsenhausen camp. 


53:41.067 --> 53:43.404
I felt moved 
to compose a song 


53:43.403 --> 53:46.000
that we could sing together 
for our mutual encouragement.


53:52.812 --> 53:55.549
Every morning we marched 
to the construction site 


53:55.548 --> 53:58.000
of a sewage plant 
in Oranienburg. 


54:00.987 --> 54:04.090
Our labor group 
consisted of about 40 brothers


54:04.090 --> 54:07.000
under the strict watch of the SS.


54:14.200 --> 54:18.838
While marching, 
my mind went back and forth 


54:18.838 --> 54:23.000
and “Bum Bam Badam 
Bam Tarambambamba.” 


54:24.677 --> 54:28.682
And gradually, 
a melody formed. 


54:28.682 --> 54:31.217
That’s how the music 
was developed.


54:31.217 --> 54:34.554
But how could the verses 
enter the camp 


54:34.553 --> 54:36.555
without being able 
to write them down? 


54:36.555 --> 54:39.758
I found a few brothers 
who helped me. 


54:39.758 --> 54:43.863
I repeated the first verse 
to one of them until he knew it by heart, 


54:43.863 --> 54:47.333
either while marching or while driving 
the wheelbarrow at work. 


54:47.333 --> 54:50.603
I told the second verse 
to another brother, 


54:50.603 --> 54:54.673
still to others the third 
and the fourth. 


54:54.673 --> 54:59.545
In the evening, I asked 
each of the brothers to recite his verse. 


54:59.545 --> 55:02.548
That’s how the song came to life.


55:02.548 --> 55:05.751
In the mornings, 
when the 40 of us were marching 


55:05.752 --> 55:10.257
through the streets of Oranienburg, 
we already felt worn out. 


55:10.257 --> 55:13.125
When one started humming 
that melody, 


55:13.125 --> 55:16.562
the entire labor group 
trembled with excitement. 


55:16.562 --> 55:20.967
We had to control ourselves 
to not break out in loud singing. 


55:20.967 --> 55:23.269
That would have been dangerous, 
of course. 


55:23.268 --> 55:25.271
They would have brought us 
back to the camp 


55:25.272 --> 55:28.000
and severely punished us.


56:30.770 --> 56:35.475
As we sat together in the evenings 
and someone started humming that melody,


56:35.475 --> 56:40.280
quite a number of us 
sang along, and we rejoiced. 


56:40.280 --> 56:42.482
Our eyes were shining. 


56:42.482 --> 56:46.000
This gave us 
new courage and hope.


56:50.757 --> 56:53.292
We also had evenings of worship. 


56:53.292 --> 56:57.964
Talks were given, and we had copies 
of The Watchtower that we studied together.


56:57.963 --> 57:01.366
So we were able to have 
some real times of peace 


57:01.367 --> 57:06.000
and special encouragement 
and felt uplifted by that song.


58:01.560 --> 58:05.898
Brother Frost, 
who was one of the anointed, 


58:05.898 --> 58:09.701
finished 
his earthly course in 1987. 


58:09.702 --> 58:13.840
After World War II 
and nine years of imprisonment, 


58:13.840 --> 58:16.575
he served as the overseer 
of our branch office 


58:16.575 --> 58:18.578
in Germany for ten years.


58:18.578 --> 58:20.980
This was before 
the arrangement was instituted 


58:20.980 --> 58:23.000
of having a Branch Committee 
oversee the work. 


58:25.552 --> 58:29.189
The very descriptive paintings 
that you saw in this segment 


58:29.188 --> 58:31.723
were painted by a brother 
who was imprisoned 


58:31.723 --> 58:36.395
in a concentration camp 
similar to the one Brother Frost was in. 


58:36.395 --> 58:39.532
And I’m sure 
you recognized the song. 


58:39.532 --> 58:43.937
You can find it in our songbook, 
though the tune is a little different. 


58:43.937 --> 58:47.940
When Brother Frost found out 
that his song had been included in it, 


58:47.940 --> 58:51.810
he was overjoyed 
and said, “My clumsy lyrics 


58:51.810 --> 58:56.015
were transformed 
into three wonderful verses.” 


58:56.015 --> 58:59.285
If you turn to song 17 
in your songbook, 


58:59.285 --> 59:03.122
you’ll find the song 
originally composed by Brother Frost


59:03.122 --> 59:06.325
—“Forward, You Witnesses!”


59:06.325 --> 59:10.062
Like Brother Frost, 
we want to do our best 


59:10.062 --> 59:12.899
to expand our ministry 
for Jehovah. 


59:12.898 --> 59:16.568
One way of doing that 
is by learning a language. 


59:16.568 --> 59:20.005
In this music video, 
pay close attention 


59:20.005 --> 59:24.543
to the blessings that resulted 
from this couple’s heartfelt desire 


59:24.543 --> 59:28.000
to serve 
in the foreign-language field.


59:50.068 --> 59:58.443
You may be contemplating,
‘Should I make the move?’


59:58.443 --> 1:00:07.353
Prayerfully meditating,
‘Jehovah, what should I do?’


1:00:07.353 --> 1:00:16.028
So let’s just take a moment
And try to help you decide.


1:00:16.028 --> 1:00:23.435
‘Cause if you step on over,
You’ll be so happy you tried!


1:00:23.435 --> 1:00:32.545
You gotta step on over
And leave your worries behind.


1:00:32.545 --> 1:00:41.087
‘Cause when you step on over,
You will be blessed if you try, oh.


1:00:41.087 --> 1:00:57.804
Step on over.
Step on over that Macedonia line!


1:00:57.803 --> 1:01:05.611
The preaching work is amazing,
With overwhelming success.


1:01:05.612 --> 1:01:14.354
You’ll be appreciating
How strangers give you their best.


1:01:14.353 --> 1:01:22.795
And you will draw even closer
To Jehovah each day.


1:01:22.795 --> 1:01:31.437
‘Cause he will always be there
To help you learn every step of the way.


1:01:31.437 --> 1:01:39.812
You gotta step on over
And leave your worries behind.


1:01:39.812 --> 1:01:46.652
‘Cause when you step on over,
Oh, the treasures you’ll find.


1:01:46.652 --> 1:01:56.495
Maybe you’re thinking it over
And wondering if it’s right, oh.


1:01:56.495 --> 1:02:05.003
You gotta step on over.
You will be blessed if you try, oh.


1:02:05.003 --> 1:02:13.311
Step on over.
Step on over.


1:02:13.312 --> 1:02:21.000
You gotta step on over that Macedonia line!


1:02:25.825 --> 1:02:28.962
Did you notice 
some of the blessings 


1:02:28.962 --> 1:02:33.032
this couple enjoyed as the result 
of learning a new language? 


1:02:33.032 --> 1:02:35.969
Not only were they able 
to expand their ministry 


1:02:35.968 --> 1:02:40.573
and show their love for neighbor 
but they also spent a lot of time together 


1:02:40.573 --> 1:02:45.611
as a couple, reaching the goal 
of learning a language as a family. 


1:02:45.612 --> 1:02:50.484
By working hard to build up 
and protect our family spiritually, 


1:02:50.483 --> 1:02:53.685
we can all take part 
in glorifying Jehovah


1:02:53.685 --> 1:02:57.690
—the One “to whom every family 
. . . owes its name.”


1:02:57.690 --> 1:03:01.927
You’ll also enjoy a Bethel morning worship 
that is now available 


1:03:01.927 --> 1:03:03.930
on Video on Demand. 


1:03:03.930 --> 1:03:07.600
It ties very well into the theme 
of this month’s program. 


1:03:07.600 --> 1:03:09.668
The video is entitled 


1:03:09.668 --> 1:03:13.205
‘Practice Godly Devotion
in Our Own Household’ 


1:03:13.205 --> 1:03:15.875
and is presented 
by Brother David Schafer, 


1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:19.212
a helper 
to the Teaching Committee.


1:03:19.212 --> 1:03:22.615
But we have more 
in store for you.


1:03:22.615 --> 1:03:27.153
We’re also pleased to announce 
the release of a new brochure 


1:03:27.153 --> 1:03:31.890
entitled 
Answers to 10 Questions Young People Ask.


1:03:31.890 --> 1:03:36.528
The content of this 32-page, 
full-color brochure 


1:03:36.528 --> 1:03:40.533
is based on articles 
in Awake! and the two volumes 


1:03:40.533 --> 1:03:45.003
of Questions Young People Ask
—Answers That Work, as well as 


1:03:45.003 --> 1:03:49.741
the “Young People Ask” articles 
on the jw.org website. 


1:03:49.742 --> 1:03:53.412
This new brochure 
will be particularly helpful 


1:03:53.412 --> 1:03:58.017
to those who speak a language 
in which that material is not available. 


1:03:58.017 --> 1:04:02.622
However, all young people 
can benefit from this new brochure 


1:04:02.622 --> 1:04:07.627
because the original articles 
have been updated and rewritten.


1:04:07.627 --> 1:04:12.097
Each section of the brochure 
addresses one question. 


1:04:12.097 --> 1:04:16.969
After stating the question, 
the section begins with a pointed statement 


1:04:16.968 --> 1:04:19.838
under the feature 
“Why It Matters,” 


1:04:19.838 --> 1:04:23.708
letting the reader know 
why that question is relevant. 


1:04:23.708 --> 1:04:28.246
Then, a “What Would You Do?” 
scenario is presented, 


1:04:28.247 --> 1:04:31.450
putting the reader 
in a hypothetical situation 


1:04:31.450 --> 1:04:33.585
related to the topic. 


1:04:33.585 --> 1:04:36.522
After discussing various principles, 


1:04:36.522 --> 1:04:40.325
Scriptural advice 
directs the reader to the best answers 


1:04:40.325 --> 1:04:42.862
for that particular question.


1:04:42.862 --> 1:04:45.965
The 10 Questions brochure 
is interactive, 


1:04:45.965 --> 1:04:48.467
allowing the reader 
to write responses 


1:04:48.467 --> 1:04:50.870
to the various questions presented. 


1:04:50.870 --> 1:04:55.207
The final topic, 
“How Can the Bible Help Me?,” 


1:04:55.207 --> 1:04:59.345
is designed to invite readers 
who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses 


1:04:59.345 --> 1:05:01.480
to accept a Bible study. 


1:05:01.480 --> 1:05:04.483
The brochure 
makes numerous references 


1:05:04.483 --> 1:05:06.818
to the jw.org website 


1:05:06.818 --> 1:05:11.090
and directs readers to more information 
that can be found there. 


1:05:11.090 --> 1:05:14.893
Also, the brochure 
is designed in such a way 


1:05:14.893 --> 1:05:19.031
that young people can be comfortable 
sharing it with their peers 


1:05:19.032 --> 1:05:21.567
and with others in the ministry.


1:05:21.567 --> 1:05:26.505
This brochure 
is already approved for translation 


1:05:26.505 --> 1:05:30.075
into 324 languages. 


1:05:30.075 --> 1:05:35.080
Of these languages, 
223 do not produce Awake! 


1:05:35.080 --> 1:05:38.750
and 262 have not produced 


1:05:38.750 --> 1:05:40.753
the Young People Ask books. 


1:05:40.753 --> 1:05:44.890
So we expect that Answers 
to 10 Questions Young People Ask 


1:05:44.890 --> 1:05:47.627
will help 
many more youths benefit 


1:05:47.627 --> 1:05:50.697
from the Bible’s practical wisdom.


1:05:50.697 --> 1:05:54.500
Following this program, 
digital formats of the brochure 


1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:57.970
will become available 
on the jw.org website, 


1:05:57.970 --> 1:06:02.908
the JW Library app, 
and on Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY 


1:06:02.908 --> 1:06:05.543
as they are produced 
in each language. 


1:06:05.543 --> 1:06:10.048
Additionally, printed copies 
of the brochure can be requested 


1:06:10.048 --> 1:06:14.720
through your congregation 
at the conclusion of this program.


1:06:14.720 --> 1:06:17.723
Before we finish, 
we’d like to share 


1:06:17.723 --> 1:06:22.126
this postcard from the city 
of L’viv, in Ukraine. 


1:06:22.127 --> 1:06:27.065
The city has approximately 
800,000 inhabitants and is surrounded 


1:06:27.065 --> 1:06:29.068
by beautiful forests. 


1:06:29.068 --> 1:06:34.073
But L’viv is also the home of 5,000 
of our dear brothers and sisters. 


1:06:34.073 --> 1:06:36.441
One of the 49 congregations 


1:06:36.442 --> 1:06:40.645
in L’viv 
is the Topolna Tsentralnyi Congregation. 


1:06:40.645 --> 1:06:44.017
This congregation 
has 107 publishers, 


1:06:44.017 --> 1:06:47.019
including 42 regular pioneers. 


1:06:47.018 --> 1:06:52.156
Last year, during the month of August, 
70 percent of them took part 


1:06:52.157 --> 1:06:55.995
in some form of pioneer service, 
despite the fact that this congregation 


1:06:55.995 --> 1:07:00.365
has [one of] the smallest 
territories in the city. 


1:07:00.365 --> 1:07:03.368
Public witnessing using carts 
has proven very effective, 


1:07:03.368 --> 1:07:05.705
and the publishers also cover 


1:07:05.705 --> 1:07:10.375
remote territories 
in small villages outside the city. 


1:07:10.375 --> 1:07:14.113
The publishers 
of the Topolna Tsentralnyi Congregation 


1:07:14.113 --> 1:07:16.648
send their warm Christian love 


1:07:16.648 --> 1:07:20.351
to all of us worldwide. 


1:07:20.352 --> 1:07:22.689
This is JW Broadcasting 


1:07:22.688 --> 1:07:36.753
from Brooklyn, New York.
