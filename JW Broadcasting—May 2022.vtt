00:00:01.918 --> 00:00:03.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:06.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are a few highlights
of this month’s program.

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:08.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:11.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of Jehovah’s people suffered

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
heartbreaking losses.

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:17.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how
Jehovah’s love triumphed over tragedy.

00:00:18.668 --> 00:00:22.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cherish the rich diversity
of our global brotherhood.

00:00:22.605 --> 00:00:24.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
But could our local culture

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:27.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
somehow influence our thinking

00:00:27.143 --> 00:00:30.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and undermine our precious unity?

00:00:30.747 --> 00:00:34.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our new music video reminds us that unity

00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:36.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only makes us joyful

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:39.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it makes us strong.

00:00:39.155 --> 00:00:44.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting® for May 2022!

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:05.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
The theme of this year’s regional convention

00:01:05.415 --> 00:01:08.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “Pursue Peace!”

00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:10.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a preview of the program.

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:15.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace is often defined

00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:18.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the absence of conflict.

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:21.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
But peace involves much more.

00:01:21.598 --> 00:01:24.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is, we each face trials

00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can rob us of peace:

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
illness,

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
economic problems,

00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:37.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
our own weaknesses,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
damaged relationships.

00:01:43.753 --> 00:01:47.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
What threatens your peace?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the 2022 “Pursue Peace”!
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:56.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will discover how you can find

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
real, lasting peace in your life right now!

00:02:10.113 --> 00:02:13.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our convention theme is so timely.

00:02:13.883 --> 00:02:18.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world is full of conflict and anguish.

00:02:18.888 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
People long for peace,
and they long for unity,

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:26.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the focus of this month’s broadcast.

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:28.631 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our theme is

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:33.770 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Stand Together as One United People.”

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me begin with a question:

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:39.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where do you keep your wallet?

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:41.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re out in public,

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:45.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
you brothers likely keep it
in your pocket (maybe a front pocket)

00:02:45.782 --> 00:02:49.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that it doesn’t get lost or stolen.

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:53.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
You sisters might carry your wallet
in a purse, or handbag,

00:02:53.823 --> 00:02:56.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
which you keep close by your side.

00:02:56.926 --> 00:03:01.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
You guard your wallet
because you know that if you get careless,

00:03:01.898 --> 00:03:05.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
a thief might steal it
and you might never see

00:03:05.602 --> 00:03:09.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
your wallet or its contents again.

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:13.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is similar with the precious unity

00:03:13.176 --> 00:03:16.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoy as Jehovah’s people.

00:03:16.012 --> 00:03:19.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to guard it and protect it,

00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:22.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
or else someone might steal it.

00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:24.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make no mistake,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Devil is looking for an opportunity

00:03:27.557 --> 00:03:30.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
to steal our unity from us.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:34.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about how unique our unity is.

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:37.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike other religious organizations,

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:40.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not divided into subdenominations.

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:43.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t have Northern Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:45.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Orthodox Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:03:45.408 --> 00:03:48.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
or Reformed Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:51.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the apostle Paul expressed it,

00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:55.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are “united in the same mind

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:58.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the same line of thought.”

00:03:59.355 --> 00:04:02.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also united internationally.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:06.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t fight against one another
in the wars that divide nations.

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:09.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we are united racially.

00:04:09.732 --> 00:04:13.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times, Witnesses have risked their lives

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect their fellow Christians
of another race who were being threatened

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:22.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
or persecuted
because of their racial or ethnic background.

00:04:23.846 --> 00:04:26.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also united in our purpose.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:28.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, no matter where we live,

00:04:28.785 --> 00:04:33.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all preach the same good news

00:04:33.423 --> 00:04:38.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we all receive
the same weekly spiritual instruction.

00:04:38.394 --> 00:04:42.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you find this unity out in the world?

00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:44.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look around.

00:04:44.267 --> 00:04:46.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are divided.

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:48.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nations attack each other.

00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:52.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
And within nations,
political parties fight one another.

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:56.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Corporations compete with
and destroy each other,

00:04:56.913 --> 00:04:59.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and citizens commit racially

00:04:59.615 --> 00:05:02.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ethnically motivated hate crimes

00:05:02.318 --> 00:05:04.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
against each other.

00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:07.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a contrast that is

00:05:07.323 --> 00:05:09.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s worshippers!

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
We stand together

00:05:12.061 --> 00:05:15.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one united people.

00:05:16.299 --> 00:05:20.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, though, do we each need to guard

00:05:20.003 --> 00:05:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
and protect our unity?

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:26.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can’t we safely assume
that Jehovah will protect it

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:30.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he will see to it
that our unity is preserved?

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not entirely.

00:05:33.082 --> 00:05:37.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guarding the unity of God’s people
is a responsibility

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:40.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given each one of us.

00:05:40.323 --> 00:05:43.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must do our part to ensure

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:48.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we stand together as one united people.

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:51.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen if we don’t?

00:05:51.267 --> 00:05:54.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Divisions will occur among us

00:05:54.203 --> 00:05:58.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
—divisions that resemble
what we see in the world.

00:05:58.474 --> 00:06:02.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happened
in the first-century congregation in Corinth.

00:06:02.912 --> 00:06:05.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, Paul wrote

00:06:05.148 --> 00:06:09.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Corinthians 1:11:

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:14.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There are dissensions among you.”

00:06:14.724 --> 00:06:16.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of “dissensions”?

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:19.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some said, ‘I belong to Peter’;

00:06:19.762 --> 00:06:22.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
others said, ‘I belong to Paul’;

00:06:22.565 --> 00:06:26.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still others said, ‘I belong to Apollos.’

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:29.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul felt compelled to ask

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:33.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Corinthians 1:13:

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is the Christ divided?”

00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:42.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a reproach on Jehovah’s name
and on true worship!

00:06:42.652 --> 00:06:45.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
By failing to guard their unity,

00:06:45.455 --> 00:06:48.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
those early disciples
were making Christianity

00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:51.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
look like just another religion.

00:06:51.127 --> 00:06:55.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could something like that
happen in a congregation today?

00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:57.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could happen

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
if individuals cared more
about their own personal preferences,

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:05.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
conveniences, and opinions

00:07:05.108 --> 00:07:09.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
than they do about the unity
of Jehovah’s people.

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:14.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Selfishness is not
“the fruitage of [Jehovah’s] spirit.”

00:07:14.884 --> 00:07:18.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, it reflects
“the spirit of the world.”

00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:21.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world is aggressively promoting the view

00:07:21.924 --> 00:07:24.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you should put yourself first,

00:07:24.794 --> 00:07:28.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we have learned Jehovah’s view.

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:32.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 10:24 tells us

00:07:32.034 --> 00:07:33.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “keep seeking,

00:07:33.736 --> 00:07:35.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not [our] own advantage,

00:07:35.905 --> 00:07:38.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:41.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 13, verse 5,

00:07:41.911 --> 00:07:46.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote that love
“does not look for its own interests.”

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:50.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he states at Romans 15:3

00:07:50.119 --> 00:07:54.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the Christ did not please himself.”

00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:59.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we cannot afford
to care more about our privileges,

00:07:59.996 --> 00:08:02.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
our pride, or our opinions

00:08:02.865 --> 00:08:05.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
than we do about Christian unity.

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:08.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we put our own wants first,

00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
then just like a man
who leaves his wallet out in public

00:08:12.408 --> 00:08:14.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a thief to steal,

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:17.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
we place the congregation’s unity

00:08:17.446 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
in plain view for Satan to snatch.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there is no doubt
that the Devil will seize the opportunity,

00:08:25.888 --> 00:08:29.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the congregation will suffer.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:31.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to accept

00:08:31.894 --> 00:08:33.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
our personal responsibility

00:08:33.963 --> 00:08:37.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
to guard and protect our unity

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only as a congregation
but also as field service groups,

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
families, married couples, and friends.

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:50.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s now discuss four areas

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we especially need

00:08:52.715 --> 00:08:56.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
to guard and protect our Christian unity.

00:08:57.653 --> 00:09:01.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is our response to direction

00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:03.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s organization.

00:09:04.794 --> 00:09:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020,

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:11.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all received direction,

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:16.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
including new ways to attend our meetings
and carry out our ministry

00:09:16.405 --> 00:09:20.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ways to comply
with the secular authorities.

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you disagree?

00:09:23.112 --> 00:09:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or did you have a different idea?

00:09:25.648 --> 00:09:29.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, did you follow the direction anyway

00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:31.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give it your support?

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:34.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you did,

00:09:34.023 --> 00:09:37.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you contributed to our unity.

00:09:37.393 --> 00:09:39.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we stand together

00:09:39.962 --> 00:09:42.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unitedly follow direction

00:09:42.898 --> 00:09:47.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s organization,
good things happen.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:49.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:09:49.438 --> 00:09:53.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like what happened
when the first-century Christians complied

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the direction from the apostles
and older men in Jerusalem.

00:09:58.147 --> 00:10:02.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 16:4, 5 says:

00:10:03.586 --> 00:10:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they traveled on through the cities,

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they would deliver to them
for observance the decrees

00:10:10.693 --> 00:10:12.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that had been decided on

00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:16.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the apostles and the elders
who were in Jerusalem.

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:18.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then, indeed,

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:22.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the congregations continued
to be made firm in the faith

00:10:22.838 --> 00:10:27.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to increase in number day by day.”

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:32.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Individual Christians and congregations

00:10:32.081 --> 00:10:36.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
recognized and submitted to the authority

00:10:36.018 --> 00:10:38.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the governing body at that time

00:10:38.087 --> 00:10:41.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the apostles and elders
who were in Jerusalem.

00:10:41.957 --> 00:10:44.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note the beneficial results?

00:10:44.827 --> 00:10:48.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The congregations continued
to be made firm . . .

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:50.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to increase.”

00:10:50.966 --> 00:10:54.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what happened
when you brothers and sisters

00:10:54.637 --> 00:10:58.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed the direction
regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:02.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
We experienced significant increases

00:11:02.144 --> 00:11:04.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
in meeting attendance.

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:07.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
The attendance for the 2021 Memorial

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
reached an all-time peak.

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:12.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is amazing

00:11:12.621 --> 00:11:14.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah accomplishes

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:16.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we stand together

00:11:16.492 --> 00:11:18.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one united people!

00:11:20.763 --> 00:11:24.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second area in which we need
to protect our unity

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:26.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
is culture.

00:11:26.168 --> 00:11:29.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization is diverse.

00:11:29.038 --> 00:11:31.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to be introduced

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
to different kinds of food,

00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:36.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
different styles of dress,
and interesting customs.

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful!

00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:43.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if we started feeling that my race,

00:11:43.519 --> 00:11:46.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
my tribe, my ethnicity,

00:11:46.989 --> 00:11:50.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
my culture is superior?

00:11:50.259 --> 00:11:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see how
that kind of thinking would divide us?

00:11:54.764 --> 00:11:58.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
To preserve our unity, we need to focus,

00:11:58.534 --> 00:12:01.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on how we are different from one another,

00:12:01.470 --> 00:12:03.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how we are the same.

00:12:03.906 --> 00:12:05.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are

00:12:05.508 --> 00:12:07.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses first

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not African, Asian,

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:12.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
North American,
South American,

00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:14.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
or European.

00:12:14.717 --> 00:12:16.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our people

00:12:16.352 --> 00:12:18.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
are our spiritual family

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:12:21.891 --> 00:12:26.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our culture is genuine Christianity.

00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:30.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are willing
to adopt Jehovah’s thinking

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:32.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we learn from his Word,

00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:36.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
even setting aside our own
personal customs

00:12:36.105 --> 00:12:38.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
or culture if necessary,

00:12:38.507 --> 00:12:41.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
we stand together

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one united people.

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:47.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
We experience what the Bible describes

00:12:47.316 --> 00:12:51.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Zephaniah 3:9:

00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:55.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For then I will change the language

00:12:55.191 --> 00:12:57.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the peoples to a pure language,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:02.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that all of them
may call on the name of Jehovah,

00:13:02.097 --> 00:13:05.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve him shoulder to shoulder.”

00:13:06.101 --> 00:13:08.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful!

00:13:08.871 --> 00:13:10.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
A third area

00:13:10.306 --> 00:13:13.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
is personality differences.

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up in this divided world,

00:13:15.411 --> 00:13:19.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may have absorbed
some of its sensitivities.

00:13:19.448 --> 00:13:24.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Ecclesiastes 7:9 says:

00:13:24.353 --> 00:13:28.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be quick to take offense.”

00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:31.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a fellow Christian hurts our feelings,

00:13:31.293 --> 00:13:34.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a special opportunity

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:37.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obligation

00:13:37.132 --> 00:13:41.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show that we stand together
as one united people.

00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:44.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we do that?

00:13:44.206 --> 00:13:48.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 3:13 says:

00:13:49.612 --> 00:13:52.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue putting up with one another

00:13:52.581 --> 00:13:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and forgiving one another freely

00:13:54.984 --> 00:13:59.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even if anyone has a cause
for complaint against another.

00:13:59.054 --> 00:14:03.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,

00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:06.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must also do the same.”

00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:09.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note both phrases:

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:14.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
“putting up with one another
and forgiving one another.”

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:18.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some imperfections and slights are so small.

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:22.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do they really require formal forgiveness?

00:14:22.344 --> 00:14:25.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of our human imperfection,

00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:27.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to do what Paul says.

00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:31.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to learn to just put up with them.

00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:34.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, maybe a certain family

00:14:34.657 --> 00:14:37.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not include us
in a gathering at their home

00:14:37.626 --> 00:14:39.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a brother failed to greet us

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:40.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Kingdom Hall

00:14:40.996 --> 00:14:44.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
or call on us to give a comment
at the meeting.

00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:48.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
These things may irritate us
or even hurt our feelings,

00:14:49.705 --> 00:14:52.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they are not sins 
that we need to forgive.

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:55.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are mere slights,

00:14:55.511 --> 00:15:00.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
or imperfections,
that we need to learn to put up with.

00:15:00.516 --> 00:15:03.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand, if a fellow Christian

00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
has actually sinned against us in some way,

00:15:06.689 --> 00:15:09.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving us a genuine “cause for complaint,”

00:15:09.725 --> 00:15:13.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does the scripture encourage us to do?

00:15:13.329 --> 00:15:16.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Forgive one another freely.’

00:15:16.932 --> 00:15:21.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is what Jehovah does for you and for me.

00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:26.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Putting up with and forgiving
one another is vital

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:31.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we are to stand together
as one united people.

00:15:32.314 --> 00:15:35.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our fourth area is how we respond

00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:37.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
when our brothers are in distress.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
While coping with the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:15:41.323 --> 00:15:44.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
numerous lands were hit by other disasters

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hurricanes, volcanoes, fires.

00:15:48.297 --> 00:15:52.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our brothers also experience
other forms of distress,

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:56.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the effects of old age,
the loss of a loved one in death,

00:15:56.772 --> 00:16:01.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
chronic health problems,
and the list goes on and on.

00:16:01.744 --> 00:16:04.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do Jehovah’s Witnesses do

00:16:04.713 --> 00:16:08.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we see our brothers in distress?

00:16:08.017 --> 00:16:10.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
We immediately

00:16:10.552 --> 00:16:11.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
come to their aid.

00:16:11.587 --> 00:16:13.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
We stand together.

00:16:13.656 --> 00:16:15.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this very selfish

00:16:15.724 --> 00:16:18.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and divided world,

00:16:18.527 --> 00:16:23.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is not a small thing.

00:16:23.098 --> 00:16:27.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not something to take for granted.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:29.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said

00:16:29.104 --> 00:16:33.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
at John 13:34, 35

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:35.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this deep,

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:39.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
unselfish love in action

00:16:39.048 --> 00:16:42.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
would identify his true disciples.

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:45.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, brothers and sisters,

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we work hard to stand together

00:16:48.724 --> 00:16:52.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the four areas that we have discussed,

00:16:52.127 --> 00:16:55.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
we give powerful evidence

00:16:55.230 --> 00:16:59.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are true disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:16:59.802 --> 00:17:03.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew that unity was vital.

00:17:03.439 --> 00:17:07.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the night before he was put to death,
he was concerned

00:17:07.976 --> 00:17:11.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his disciples would remain united.

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:15.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
He prayed at John chapter 17

00:17:15.584 --> 00:17:18.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 20-22:

00:17:19.154 --> 00:17:23.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I make request, not concerning these only,

00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:28.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but also concerning those
putting faith in me through their word,

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:31.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they may all be one,

00:17:31.266 --> 00:17:34.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you, Father, are in union with me

00:17:34.269 --> 00:17:36.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I am in union with you,

00:17:36.472 --> 00:17:40.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that they also may be in union with us,

00:17:40.709 --> 00:17:44.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the world
may believe that you sent me.

00:17:44.646 --> 00:17:48.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have given them the glory
that you have given me,

00:17:48.517 --> 00:17:51.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order that they may be one

00:17:51.587 --> 00:17:54.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as we are one.”

00:17:55.724 --> 00:17:59.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, Jehovah answered that prayer.

00:17:59.828 --> 00:18:01.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is teaching us

00:18:01.864 --> 00:18:05.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stand together as one united people.

00:18:05.901 --> 00:18:09.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, dear brothers and sisters,

00:18:09.204 --> 00:18:12.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us renew our determination

00:18:12.374 --> 00:18:15.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect our Christian unity

00:18:15.611 --> 00:18:17.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
by following direction

00:18:17.713 --> 00:18:19.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s organization,

00:18:19.782 --> 00:18:22.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
by valuing Jehovah’s thinking

00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:24.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than our own culture,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
by putting up with

00:18:26.722 --> 00:18:29.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
and forgiving one another freely,

00:18:29.892 --> 00:18:31.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by helping one another

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
in times of distress.

00:18:33.762 --> 00:18:35.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so,

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:37.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not allow Satan

00:18:37.332 --> 00:18:40.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
to steal our precious unity.

00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:44.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we will stand together

00:18:44.473 --> 00:18:48.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one united people.

00:18:49.111 --> 00:18:51.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without question, the COVID pandemic

00:18:51.780 --> 00:18:54.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been a time of distress for everyone.

00:18:54.983 --> 00:18:57.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, some of our brothers and sisters

00:18:57.619 --> 00:19:00.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
lost family members to the virus.

00:19:00.422 --> 00:19:03.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could love be shown to these dear ones

00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the midst of the pandemic?

00:19:05.561 --> 00:19:09.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how this was accomplished
in our next video.

00:19:11.133 --> 00:19:13.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
My husband contracted COVID-19.

00:19:13.502 --> 00:19:15.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was brought to the ICU,

00:19:15.037 --> 00:19:18.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two days later, he passed away.

00:19:18.941 --> 00:19:21.076 line:10% position:50% align:center
We weren’t able to say goodbye.

00:19:21.076 --> 00:19:22.811 line:10% position:50% align:center
We weren’t able to see each other.

00:19:22.811 --> 00:19:24.112 line:10% position:50% align:center
We weren’t able to have

00:19:24.112 --> 00:19:25.714 line:10% position:50% align:center
our last conversation.

00:19:29.218 --> 00:19:31.353 line:10% position:50% align:center
My husband and I got sick

00:19:31.353 --> 00:19:33.555 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the month of March 2020,

00:19:33.555 --> 00:19:37.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then my husband fell asleep in death.

00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:42.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isolation can make you depressed.

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:48.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say that was
the worst time of my life.

00:19:49.004 --> 00:19:51.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
My husband contracted COVID,

00:19:51.974 --> 00:19:54.743 line:10% position:50% align:center
and he was breathing heavily.

00:19:55.344 --> 00:19:57.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I called 911.

00:19:57.913 --> 00:20:00.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ambulance took him,

00:20:02.751 --> 00:20:07.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on the way to the hospital,
his heart stopped.

00:20:09.524 --> 00:20:11.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
My bank account was blocked,

00:20:11.994 --> 00:20:13.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had debts,

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had COVID,

00:20:16.765 --> 00:20:19.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the landlord gave me
a week to leave the house.

00:20:21.236 --> 00:20:25.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
My husband used to do everything,
and now it’s

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
my responsibility to be
the spiritual head of the family.

00:20:29.211 --> 00:20:30.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed help.

00:20:31.546 --> 00:20:35.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders helped me prepare
for our family worship.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s exactly what we needed at that moment.

00:20:39.388 --> 00:20:43.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were times I felt dejected

00:20:43.292 --> 00:20:45.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
and weak.

00:20:45.394 --> 00:20:48.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sisters really helped me

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
by showing personal interest.

00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:55.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, not a day went by
without them calling me.

00:20:55.771 --> 00:20:59.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was feeling tired, without strength.

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:01.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt helpless.

00:21:01.576 --> 00:21:04.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the friends took care

00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:06.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the entire move,
helped to clean the house,

00:21:06.481 --> 00:21:08.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped me out financially.

00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:11.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were like my arms and legs.

00:21:11.453 --> 00:21:13.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
They supported me.

00:21:13.822 --> 00:21:17.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like my spiritual family
was carrying me in their arms.

00:21:18.827 --> 00:21:20.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything that my brothers and sisters

00:21:20.996 --> 00:21:23.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
did for me during that difficult time

00:21:23.966 --> 00:21:28.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the messages, the postcards, the flowers—

00:21:28.236 --> 00:21:30.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
that shows me the kind of family that I have.

00:21:30.939 --> 00:21:34.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the kids really needed to see

00:21:34.643 --> 00:21:39.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that we were not alone,
that our friends were there, even though 

00:21:39.147 --> 00:21:41.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
they couldn’t be here physically with us.

00:21:41.616 --> 00:21:45.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers have encouraged me

00:21:45.153 --> 00:21:47.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
in so many ways,

00:21:50.158 --> 00:21:52.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
from letters from pioneers

00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:55.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
spread all over Italy

00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:59.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
to video calls, phone calls, and messages.

00:22:01.069 --> 00:22:03.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized

00:22:03.238 --> 00:22:06.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there will always be someone

00:22:06.041 --> 00:22:09.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
who Jehovah uses to comfort me.

00:22:09.945 --> 00:22:12.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before, I felt weak and powerless.

00:22:12.848 --> 00:22:14.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave me strength;

00:22:14.616 --> 00:22:18.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
he helped me by means of the brothers.

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:22.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day after my husband died, I was

00:22:22.057 --> 00:22:26.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
so surprised when I opened the door
and our friends started singing for us.

00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment, I realized,

00:22:47.416 --> 00:22:49.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We’re not going to be alone.

00:22:49.384 --> 00:22:51.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have our spiritual family.’

00:22:51.386 --> 00:22:55.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began to speak to Jehovah more intensely.

00:22:55.924 --> 00:22:59.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before, I would talk to my husband

00:22:59.261 --> 00:23:01.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
about everything.

00:23:01.329 --> 00:23:03.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I share my problems

00:23:03.698 --> 00:23:06.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and anxieties with Jehovah.

00:23:06.668 --> 00:23:08.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been keeping a little journal

00:23:08.403 --> 00:23:12.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
of everything that Jehovah has done for us,
and I write it down

00:23:12.908 --> 00:23:16.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I want to be able to tell my husband
when I see him again.

00:23:16.611 --> 00:23:18.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t feel alone at any time.

00:23:18.947 --> 00:23:20.615 line:10% position:50% align:center
I felt that I belonged to a family

00:23:20.615 --> 00:23:23.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
that was caring for me and supporting me.

00:23:24.686 --> 00:23:28.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really saw Jehovah’s love

00:23:28.223 --> 00:23:30.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the help he gives.

00:23:31.593 --> 00:23:35.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can do anything
to help you feel better

00:23:35.397 --> 00:23:37.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you are going through trials.

00:23:37.432 --> 00:23:40.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing Jehovah’s support for me
by means of the brothers

00:23:40.268 --> 00:23:42.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes me feel secure when thinking about how

00:23:42.838 --> 00:23:44.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will support me in the future.

00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say that in the future,

00:23:47.776 --> 00:23:50.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am absolutely certain

00:23:50.445 --> 00:23:53.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will be with me.

00:23:53.548 --> 00:23:55.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no pandemic

00:23:55.684 --> 00:23:58.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s no bad situation

00:23:58.286 --> 00:24:02.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will prevent Jehovah
from reaching anyone

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they’re going through trials.

00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:09.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hearts go out to all

00:24:09.731 --> 00:24:12.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have lost loved ones during the pandemic.

00:24:12.567 --> 00:24:16.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are not shielded
from “time and unexpected events.”

00:24:16.905 --> 00:24:21.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah always helps us
to endure hardship,

00:24:21.209 --> 00:24:23.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
often through the love shown

00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:26.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
by our brothers and sisters.

00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:29.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
We help each other during crises.

00:24:29.584 --> 00:24:32.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also show love in everyday matters,

00:24:32.254 --> 00:24:35.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ll see in the following video.

00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:17.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything I know
about Kingdom Hall maintenance,

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned from Brother Ho-jin Kang.

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:23.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
He encouraged me when I needed a little push,

00:25:27.475 --> 00:25:30.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
taught me the right way to do things,

00:25:32.214 --> 00:25:34.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continued to teach me

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
with kindness and love.

00:25:42.724 --> 00:25:45.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when he asked to borrow a ladder,

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:47.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was happy to lend him mine.

00:25:53.969 --> 00:25:55.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honey,

00:25:56.404 --> 00:25:58.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
here are some things I need

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:01.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our lunch today with the Youngs.

00:26:01.509 --> 00:26:02.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mhm.

00:26:02.777 --> 00:26:04.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the ladder for?

00:26:04.479 --> 00:26:06.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, Ho-jin needs it.

00:26:06.581 --> 00:26:07.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ho-jin?

00:26:07.849 --> 00:26:09.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
How’s he doing?

00:26:09.284 --> 00:26:11.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
I heard something about a cane.

00:26:11.853 --> 00:26:12.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ho-jin?

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:14.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
A cane?

00:26:14.356 --> 00:26:15.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
No way!

00:26:15.523 --> 00:26:17.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s still as strong as an ox.

00:26:17.292 --> 00:26:21.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe, but it seems like—

00:26:21.963 --> 00:26:24.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you’ll see how he’s doing.

00:26:24.866 --> 00:26:26.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t forget to stop at the store.

00:26:28.236 --> 00:26:29.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ho-jin?

00:26:29.504 --> 00:26:31.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
A cane?

00:26:31.339 --> 00:26:32.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
No way.

00:26:46.054 --> 00:26:47.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m coming!

00:26:47.622 --> 00:26:49.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here I come!

00:26:50.191 --> 00:26:51.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:53.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK.

00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:54.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is everything OK?

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:57.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just can’t dash down the stairs.

00:26:58.867 --> 00:27:02.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was on my way to the store
and thought I’d drop off the ladder.

00:27:02.170 --> 00:27:03.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:06.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just leave it by the garage.

00:27:06.207 --> 00:27:08.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s almost time for lunch.

00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:09.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
The gutters can wait.

00:27:09.878 --> 00:27:12.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve waited this long.

00:27:12.414 --> 00:27:14.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Will do.

00:27:14.082 --> 00:27:15.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye.

00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Drive safe!

00:27:33.168 --> 00:27:34.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gutters?

00:27:53.788 --> 00:27:55.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Honey.

00:27:55.557 --> 00:27:59.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
But what about lunch?

00:27:59.761 --> 00:28:01.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Youngs will be here in an hour.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:02.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know.

00:28:02.931 --> 00:28:07.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
I picked up the items you asked for,
but I can’t just leave.

00:28:07.068 --> 00:28:09.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
It got me thinking
about the neighborly Samaritan.

00:28:13.074 --> 00:28:15.076 line:10% position:50% align:center
When we see a need,

00:28:15.076 --> 00:28:17.645 line:10% position:50% align:center
we can’t be like the priest and Levite

00:28:17.645 --> 00:28:19.714 line:10% position:50% align:center
who just walked away.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:28.790 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Samaritan cared enough to stop,

00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.626 line:10% position:50% align:center
examine the need,

00:28:38.933 --> 00:28:42.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took the time to help the poor man

00:28:44.406 --> 00:28:46.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a man he didn’t even know.

00:28:46.808 --> 00:28:49.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . a man he didn’t even know.
Of course!

00:28:49.878 --> 00:28:51.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Work what is good toward all,

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially toward those
related to us in the faith.”

00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:56.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:28:56.351 --> 00:28:58.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have an idea.

00:28:58.486 --> 00:29:00.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s not cancel with the Youngs.

00:29:00.955 --> 00:29:04.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll go back and pick up my ladder
and tell Ho-jin

00:29:04.859 --> 00:29:08.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I’ll come back Saturday afternoon
to help him clean out the gutters.

00:29:17.372 --> 00:29:19.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s such a blessing

00:29:19.507 --> 00:29:22.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to care
for the needs of our brothers

00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel their loving care for us.

00:29:35.824 --> 00:29:39.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we learn from this dramatization?

00:29:39.394 --> 00:29:43.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think deeply
about the needs of our brothers,

00:29:43.131 --> 00:29:45.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll find many opportunities

00:29:45.934 --> 00:29:48.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show unselfish love.

00:29:49.804 --> 00:29:52.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this world, people feel unloved

00:29:52.907 --> 00:29:56.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
and isolated for many reasons.

00:29:56.044 --> 00:30:00.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see this in the experience
of Jeson Senajonon.

00:30:01.649 --> 00:30:04.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life was simple—I remember.

00:30:04.919 --> 00:30:07.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am Jeson, and I am deaf.

00:30:09.023 --> 00:30:11.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up with this disability was hard.

00:30:12.393 --> 00:30:14.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was younger,
I saw people laughing

00:30:14.429 --> 00:30:16.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and families showing affection.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:20.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just walked around the neighborhood

00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:22.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and observed what was going on around me.

00:30:24.372 --> 00:30:26.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw them walking and talking

00:30:26.374 --> 00:30:29.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wondered what that was all about.

00:30:29.377 --> 00:30:31.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything was a mystery to me.

00:30:33.748 --> 00:30:35.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
But one day was a little different.

00:30:36.784 --> 00:30:39.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw children my age having fun,

00:30:39.721 --> 00:30:43.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they wanted me to play with them.

00:30:43.758 --> 00:30:46.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said to myself: ‘Me?

00:30:47.428 --> 00:30:51.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t believe
they actually want me to be with them.’

00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
For once I felt welcomed,
and that was how we became

00:30:56.337 --> 00:30:58.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best of friends.

00:31:01.409 --> 00:31:03.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time went by so fast.

00:31:03.578 --> 00:31:05.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
We grew up spending time

00:31:05.813 --> 00:31:08.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
and discovering new things together.

00:31:08.316 --> 00:31:10.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was having so much fun with their company

00:31:10.318 --> 00:31:13.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even questionable acts
seemed right to me.

00:31:13.054 --> 00:31:14.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned how to smoke.

00:31:14.689 --> 00:31:16.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
They taught me how to drink alcohol

00:31:16.925 --> 00:31:18.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
to my heart’s content.

00:31:21.329 --> 00:31:23.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
It felt like it was
the best time of our lives.

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:26.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought everything we did

00:31:26.267 --> 00:31:29.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
was how things were actually supposed to be.

00:31:44.852 --> 00:31:48.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day in a deaf search in our area,

00:31:48.523 --> 00:31:50.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Witnesses found me.

00:31:52.226 --> 00:31:56.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was hesitant at first,
but they were very kind and friendly.

00:31:59.667 --> 00:32:02.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
They educated me;

00:32:02.136 --> 00:32:05.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
they even taught me how to sign my name.

00:32:08.443 --> 00:32:11.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, I studied the Bible with them.

00:32:13.881 --> 00:32:17.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned different truths from the Bible

00:32:17.285 --> 00:32:21.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finally came to know Jehovah,
“the only true God.”

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:26.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned the things Jehovah liked
and disapproved of.

00:32:26.894 --> 00:32:31.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Bible study moved me
to reexamine the life I lived.

00:32:31.265 --> 00:32:33.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that what I did before

00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:36.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
wasn’t pleasing to Jehovah.

00:32:37.071 --> 00:32:39.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
My love for Jehovah grew deeper,

00:32:39.707 --> 00:32:42.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I knew exactly what I wanted to do.

00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:47.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to attend Christian meetings,

00:32:47.181 --> 00:32:50.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I met new friends in the congregation.

00:32:53.721 --> 00:32:57.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible changed my life.

00:32:57.258 --> 00:32:59.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
I gave my all to Jehovah and decided

00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:01.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dedicate myself to him.

00:33:02.263 --> 00:33:05.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
It brought me nothing but real happiness.

00:33:12.073 --> 00:33:15.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I’m in full-time service

00:33:15.109 --> 00:33:17.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eagerly declaring the good news.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:21.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was appointed

00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:23.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve as a ministerial servant
in our congregation,

00:33:26.954 --> 00:33:30.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was called to volunteer at Bethel too.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wouldn’t have felt
genuine happiness in accomplishing

00:33:42.904 --> 00:33:47.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
these spiritual assignments
if I wasn’t in Jehovah’s organization.

00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:53.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
To all the deaf ones out there

00:33:53.614 --> 00:33:56.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
that haven’t had the chance
to know Jehovah yet,

00:33:56.651 --> 00:33:58.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope and encourage you

00:33:58.653 --> 00:34:01.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study the Bible with the Witnesses too.

00:34:01.622 --> 00:34:02.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at me.

00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:06.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before, I wasn’t able to read and write.

00:34:06.761 --> 00:34:10.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realize that even if we can’t hear,

00:34:10.064 --> 00:34:14.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can still have a relationship
with the only true God.

00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:17.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you find
the same love and joy as I did

00:34:17.105 --> 00:34:20.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
under Jehovah’s loving hands.

00:34:20.108 --> 00:34:22.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has helped me,

00:34:22.343 --> 00:34:25.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for that I will always thank and love him

00:34:25.747 --> 00:34:27.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all my heart.

00:34:30.818 --> 00:34:34.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are deaf and you would like
to learn more about the Bible,

00:34:34.622 --> 00:34:36.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
we hope you are watching

00:34:36.624 --> 00:34:40.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sign-language interpretation
of this program

00:34:40.094 --> 00:34:44.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that you’ll accept
Jeson’s invitation to study the Bible

00:34:44.432 --> 00:34:46.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:51.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too can develop
an intimate relationship with God

00:34:51.205 --> 00:34:55.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and become part
of a loving, united family.

00:34:56.711 --> 00:34:58.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we discussed earlier,

00:34:58.813 --> 00:35:00.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
our unity can suffer

00:35:00.815 --> 00:35:03.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we allow minor matters to affect us.

00:35:03.985 --> 00:35:06.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next video,

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what we can do
to set aside such feelings

00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:12.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and preserve unity.

00:35:13.261 --> 00:35:16.497 line:10% position:50% align:center
Many years ago, I started working at a firm,

00:35:16.497 --> 00:35:19.033 line:10% position:50% align:center
and I helped a sister to get a position

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:20.468 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the same firm.

00:35:21.302 --> 00:35:24.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
As time went on, I may have come

00:35:24.338 --> 00:35:27.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the wrong conclusion, but I felt

00:35:27.175 --> 00:35:29.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this sister wanted to be in charge.

00:35:29.877 --> 00:35:32.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t feel very happy about it.

00:35:33.714 --> 00:35:38.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few months later,
I was retrenched from work.

00:35:38.319 --> 00:35:41.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt very hurt.

00:35:41.155 --> 00:35:43.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother always told me

00:35:43.691 --> 00:35:47.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be the “lesser one”
and just to let things go.

00:35:47.495 --> 00:35:51.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I kept quiet, and I left the firm.

00:35:51.732 --> 00:35:54.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of certain circumstances,

00:35:54.402 --> 00:35:59.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
we changed congregations,
so we didn’t see each other anymore.

00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
During those years, at the meetings

00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:04.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
or reading the Bible,

00:36:04.545 --> 00:36:07.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were regularly reminded to be forgiving.

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:13.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
It felt to me like a stab in my heart

00:36:13.387 --> 00:36:17.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I knew we had to apply this counsel.

00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:23.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being at the convention, every time,

00:36:23.197 --> 00:36:27.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
made me a bit nervous

00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:30.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I basically had to prepare myself.

00:36:30.671 --> 00:36:33.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should I bump into her,

00:36:33.007 --> 00:36:35.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
how was I going to handle it?

00:36:35.343 --> 00:36:40.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
It did ruin the spiritual atmosphere
of the convention.

00:36:42.516 --> 00:36:45.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon after my mother passed away,

00:36:45.586 --> 00:36:48.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had our regional convention.

00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:50.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was very emotional.

00:36:50.091 --> 00:36:53.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw this sister standing there,
and I wondered to myself,

00:36:53.861 --> 00:36:56.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What is going to happen now?’

00:36:56.797 --> 00:36:58.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
She came up to me;

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:02.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
she gave me a hug and a small present.

00:37:02.637 --> 00:37:05.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
That particular day,

00:37:05.439 --> 00:37:09.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
I definitely felt relieved and I felt

00:37:09.610 --> 00:37:11.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I could now make peace.

00:37:12.713 --> 00:37:16.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
If both of us had applied earlier

00:37:16.384 --> 00:37:20.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
the advice given at Colossians 3:13

00:37:20.254 --> 00:37:22.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being forgiving,

00:37:22.556 --> 00:37:25.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
neither of us
would have had to carry

00:37:25.459 --> 00:37:28.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
this emotional burden for so many years.

00:37:29.964 --> 00:37:32.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I am very happy to say,

00:37:32.433 --> 00:37:35.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mona and I are good friends today.

00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:40.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
We serve together in the same congregation

00:37:40.942 --> 00:37:42.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
as elders, and the relationship

00:37:42.977 --> 00:37:46.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I have today
with Luis is that we’re friends.

00:37:46.113 --> 00:37:48.849 line:10% position:50% align:center
But when we transferred it to the workplace,

00:37:48.849 --> 00:37:52.086 line:10% position:50% align:center
that beautiful friendship began to fade.

00:37:53.254 --> 00:37:55.256 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, as a builder,

00:37:55.256 --> 00:37:58.659 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’m old-school and used to being in charge.

00:37:58.659 --> 00:38:00.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps I was too proud.

00:38:00.795 --> 00:38:04.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
But somebody couldn’t come and tell me
how to do certain things.

00:38:04.165 --> 00:38:07.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I was the crew leader,
I said right from the start:

00:38:07.301 --> 00:38:09.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, what is he doing here?

00:38:10.338 --> 00:38:13.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he have any right
to an opinion about this?”

00:38:14.742 --> 00:38:16.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I made sure to push
the brother aside completely.

00:38:17.878 --> 00:38:21.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can remember that when I entered
the Kingdom Hall through one door

00:38:21.515 --> 00:38:23.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I saw Brother Luis,

00:38:23.517 --> 00:38:27.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would look
for any possible excuse to avoid him.

00:38:27.188 --> 00:38:29.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wouldn’t even say hello.

00:38:29.690 --> 00:38:32.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neither of us said hello.

00:38:32.593 --> 00:38:36.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me, the internal battle
between the fleshly-minded person

00:38:36.297 --> 00:38:38.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the spiritual person
was a very tough battle.

00:38:40.034 --> 00:38:42.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like that for several years.

00:38:42.303 --> 00:38:45.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now I think, ‘I wasted time.’

00:38:47.074 --> 00:38:50.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that would have helped me
to maintain peace and unity

00:38:50.011 --> 00:38:53.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my brother would have been
to be obedient to what Jehovah says,

00:38:54.949 --> 00:38:59.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what the Bible says,
and to what we hear at the meetings.

00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:02.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, I wasn’t obedient.

00:39:03.491 --> 00:39:07.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson that I have learned from this
is that Jehovah is always right.

00:39:09.096 --> 00:39:11.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the exact moment when something happens,

00:39:11.198 --> 00:39:14.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should immediately act.

00:39:14.068 --> 00:39:18.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Carlos Henry himself was the one
that then stopped me and told me,

00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We can’t keep going on like this.”

00:39:21.542 --> 00:39:24.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took a very important step

00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:26.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could sort things out.

00:39:27.381 --> 00:39:31.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be happy, you have to apply
the principles you find in God’s Word.

00:39:32.653 --> 00:39:35.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
The words at Romans 14:19

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
encourage us
to “pursue the things making for peace.”

00:39:40.928 --> 00:39:44.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I would’ve done differently
is that I wouldn’t have let time go by.

00:39:45.966 --> 00:39:48.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, I should have sought out the brother

00:39:48.702 --> 00:39:52.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
more promptly
and restored that friendship again.

00:39:52.406 --> 00:39:55.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although it’s true
that you can’t recover time,

00:39:55.409 --> 00:39:57.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can recover a brother.

00:39:57.611 --> 00:40:01.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
My relationship, once again,
with Luis is that we are friends,

00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:04.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s a true friend.

00:40:05.753 --> 00:40:08.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Cecilia was “retrenched”

00:40:08.756 --> 00:40:11.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that is, she lost her job—

00:40:11.225 --> 00:40:14.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
she resented her spiritual sister for a time.

00:40:14.929 --> 00:40:18.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
This robbed her of her peace.

00:40:18.165 --> 00:40:20.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Carlos and Luis also allowed

00:40:20.634 --> 00:40:23.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
petty differences to divide them.

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:26.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson is clear:

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:29.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Put] up with” and “[forgive] one another.”

00:40:31.345 --> 00:40:34.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
We delight in the variety of cultures

00:40:34.148 --> 00:40:36.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
represented in our brotherhood.

00:40:36.984 --> 00:40:39.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we’ll see in our next segment,

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:43.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to be vigilant
not to put our local culture

00:40:43.757 --> 00:40:46.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of Bible principles.

00:40:46.627 --> 00:40:48.162 line:10% position:50% align:center
Growing up in Canada,

00:40:48.162 --> 00:40:50.631 line:10% position:50% align:center
I had a view of what hospitality was.

00:40:50.631 --> 00:40:52.399 line:10% position:50% align:center
Hospitality was

00:40:52.399 --> 00:40:53.901 line:10% position:50% align:center
to have the brothers and sisters over,

00:40:53.901 --> 00:40:56.203 line:10% position:50% align:center
get to know them, and share a meal together

00:40:56.203 --> 00:40:59.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
—something that I planned to offer to them.

00:40:59.406 --> 00:41:00.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think I ever realized

00:41:00.908 --> 00:41:03.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much I had been influenced

00:41:03.144 --> 00:41:05.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
by my own culture

00:41:05.346 --> 00:41:09.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
in defining what I thought
hospitality was.

00:41:10.751 --> 00:41:14.321 line:10% position:50% align:center
Culture has a very big effect on us.

00:41:14.321 --> 00:41:15.689 line:10% position:50% align:center
In our culture

00:41:15.689 --> 00:41:17.892 line:10% position:50% align:center
young ones are not trusted very much.

00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:20.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are not given responsibility.

00:41:20.227 --> 00:41:23.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have seen the effect of the culture

00:41:23.831 --> 00:41:26.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
inside the congregation,
especially when the question

00:41:26.834 --> 00:41:29.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
of giving younger ones
more privileges of service,

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:31.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
or assignments, came up.

00:41:31.272 --> 00:41:33.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it was discussed among the elders,

00:41:33.340 --> 00:41:36.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would not really be considered.

00:41:36.443 --> 00:41:39.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the desire would be
for him to wait a little bit longer

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:43.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
—mature a little more
and gain more life experience.

00:41:43.484 --> 00:41:45.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also thought the same way.

00:41:45.553 --> 00:41:49.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I look back now,
I realize that it really wasn’t right

00:41:49.857 --> 00:41:52.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah’s thinking isn’t like that.

00:41:52.459 --> 00:41:55.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I attended
the special convention in Ukraine,

00:41:55.930 --> 00:42:00.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
my view of what hospitality was
changed completely.

00:42:00.968 --> 00:42:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get off the plane;
all the brothers are there;

00:42:05.005 --> 00:42:06.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see the love.

00:42:06.073 --> 00:42:09.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re overwhelmed by just the quantity
of brothers that are there

00:42:09.810 --> 00:42:12.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
—their smiles, their expressions.

00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:16.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the days went on,

00:42:16.784 --> 00:42:19.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was clear
that they were just looking

00:42:19.086 --> 00:42:21.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what we needed.

00:42:21.121 --> 00:42:23.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was more than, you know,
just giving us some food

00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:25.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spending some time with us.

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:29.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were so many
other things that they did

00:42:29.997 --> 00:42:31.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
that covered every one
of our needs

00:42:31.732 --> 00:42:35.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was not sure that their own needs
were being covered at times.

00:42:35.603 --> 00:42:37.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew they just wanted

00:42:37.338 --> 00:42:40.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be there, and they’d figure out
the rest when they got there.

00:42:40.708 --> 00:42:44.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really impressed me and my wife.

00:42:44.645 --> 00:42:48.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do remember one night
getting back to the hotel,

00:42:48.582 --> 00:42:53.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we had a moment

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:57.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just really think
about what we’d seen that day

00:42:57.324 --> 00:43:01.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started to ask ourselves
if we’d ever gone to the same extent.

00:43:01.762 --> 00:43:04.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where I’m from,

00:43:04.765 --> 00:43:07.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
we tend to stick
with what we’re very comfortable with.

00:43:07.334 --> 00:43:12.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I really
had unknowingly been putting limits

00:43:12.539 --> 00:43:15.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
on hospitality
because of what I was comfortable with

00:43:15.909 --> 00:43:19.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
—because of the culture where I grew up—

00:43:19.046 --> 00:43:22.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas the experience in Ukraine
helped me to see

00:43:22.716 --> 00:43:26.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can break
that barrier down so much faster.

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:31.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could definitely feel that this was
what Jehovah’s view of hospitality was.

00:43:31.358 --> 00:43:36.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about looking
for what others need and filling those needs.

00:43:37.665 --> 00:43:39.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, my thinking changed

00:43:39.967 --> 00:43:42.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I realized Jehovah’s way of thinking.

00:43:43.971 --> 00:43:48.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
The videos produced by Jehovah’s organization
and what I watched in them

00:43:48.008 --> 00:43:50.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped my view to change.

00:43:51.412 --> 00:43:55.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could actually see what a young brother
or a young elder could do.

00:43:57.384 --> 00:44:00.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past, we used to focus on experience.

00:44:00.187 --> 00:44:01.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would too.

00:44:01.989 --> 00:44:06.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now Jehovah’s viewpoint
is more important than just experience.

00:44:06.093 --> 00:44:09.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah doesn’t only focus on experience

00:44:09.263 --> 00:44:12.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also on spiritual qualities.

00:44:12.166 --> 00:44:14.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
I came to realize that.

00:44:14.401 --> 00:44:17.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after we experienced

00:44:17.671 --> 00:44:20.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
the special convention in Ukraine
and returned home,

00:44:20.374 --> 00:44:24.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
we decided that we needed to consider
this more as a Family Worship project.

00:44:24.578 --> 00:44:27.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
We realized we did have to make
some adjustments.

00:44:27.514 --> 00:44:30.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
We realized we did want to do more.

00:44:30.317 --> 00:44:33.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we had to set specific goals

00:44:33.187 --> 00:44:35.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to strip away

00:44:35.422 --> 00:44:38.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
our previous definition of hospitality

00:44:38.792 --> 00:44:42.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start extending it
beyond what we were comfortable with.

00:44:42.363 --> 00:44:45.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes work

00:44:45.065 --> 00:44:49.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continually break free from the limits

00:44:49.636 --> 00:44:51.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we might set for ourselves.

00:44:51.672 --> 00:44:55.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was something that we realized

00:44:55.876 --> 00:44:59.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we needed to make some changes
if we were going to maintain

00:44:59.213 --> 00:45:01.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s view of hospitality moving forward.

00:45:02.216 --> 00:45:06.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the influence
of the culture doesn’t go away overnight.

00:45:06.553 --> 00:45:09.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still need to work hard on it.

00:45:09.123 --> 00:45:11.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still have to change

00:45:11.425 --> 00:45:14.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
because traces of the culture
can still be left over.

00:45:14.795 --> 00:45:18.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I realized
we definitely need to get rid of it.

00:45:20.734 --> 00:45:23.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I’m really pleased
to serve with those young brothers,

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk with them,

00:45:25.239 --> 00:45:27.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see their potential
as Jehovah sees it.

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:34.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also see
that Jehovah is very pleased too.

00:45:34.748 --> 00:45:37.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is overjoyed.

00:45:37.451 --> 00:45:41.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s proud to see
what those young brothers do.

00:45:43.857 --> 00:45:46.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like our brothers in the video,

00:45:46.193 --> 00:45:48.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s good for each of us to do

00:45:48.295 --> 00:45:51.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
a prayerful self-examination.

00:45:51.131 --> 00:45:54.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we always put Bible principles

00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:57.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of our local culture,

00:45:57.304 --> 00:46:01.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
we strengthen our precious Christian unity.

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:05.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Internet and other technologies

00:46:05.479 --> 00:46:08.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
allow the Governing Body
to serve the brotherhood

00:46:08.549 --> 00:46:12.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways not possible just a few years ago.

00:46:12.886 --> 00:46:14.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tools may be new,

00:46:14.888 --> 00:46:17.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the work is not.

00:46:17.090 --> 00:46:19.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next segment,

00:46:19.092 --> 00:46:22.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll learn what past members
of the Governing Body did

00:46:22.830 --> 00:46:24.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay connected with

00:46:24.932 --> 00:46:28.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to serve Jehovah’s people everywhere.

00:46:29.002 --> 00:46:33.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
has always felt a keen responsibility

00:46:33.006 --> 00:46:35.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live up to Jesus’ command:

00:46:35.008 --> 00:46:37.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Feed my lambs. . . .
Shepherd my little sheep.”

00:46:37.911 --> 00:46:39.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today’s technology

00:46:39.913 --> 00:46:42.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes the Governing Body feel like family.

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:45.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did the worldwide brotherhood
in times past

00:46:45.519 --> 00:46:48.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoy such a strong bond
with the Governing Body?

00:46:54.928 --> 00:46:59.066 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to January of 1945.

00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:00.467 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brothers Knorr and Franz

00:47:00.467 --> 00:47:02.636 line:10% position:50% align:center
set out on a tour of Latin America

00:47:02.636 --> 00:47:06.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ended up
with conventions in North America.

00:47:06.440 --> 00:47:08.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took four months.

00:47:08.475 --> 00:47:10.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
The purpose was to visit

00:47:10.777 --> 00:47:13.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
branches already established,

00:47:13.113 --> 00:47:15.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
to organize new branches,

00:47:15.315 --> 00:47:17.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to forward the movement

00:47:17.317 --> 00:47:19.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Kingdom preaching work.

00:47:19.686 --> 00:47:21.388 line:10% position:50% align:center
Service tours often combined

00:47:21.388 --> 00:47:23.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
supervising operations at a branch,

00:47:23.624 --> 00:47:25.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving talks at conventions,

00:47:25.792 --> 00:47:28.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
dedicating new facilities,

00:47:28.061 --> 00:47:30.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
overnight visits to remote missionary homes,

00:47:30.831 --> 00:47:33.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed by evening meetings
with a local congregation.

00:47:34.401 --> 00:47:37.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
All this was packed into a few days.

00:47:37.938 --> 00:47:39.640 line:10% position:50% align:center
They provided instruction

00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.841 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the field ministry,

00:47:40.841 --> 00:47:42.009 line:10% position:50% align:center
how to conduct meetings,

00:47:42.009 --> 00:47:45.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also on what was taking place
in the worldwide field.

00:47:45.612 --> 00:47:47.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they would take time

00:47:47.614 --> 00:47:49.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go out into the field ministry with them.

00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:53.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
One such visit included
a stopover in Guatemala,

00:47:53.921 --> 00:47:56.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they visited a very small congregation

00:47:56.490 --> 00:47:58.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
of just eight people.

00:47:58.892 --> 00:48:00.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their heart was in the preaching work.

00:48:00.894 --> 00:48:02.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can speak from my own experience

00:48:02.863 --> 00:48:06.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the missionaries
were very close to Brother Knorr’s heart.

00:48:06.867 --> 00:48:10.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after sending them first to Latin America,

00:48:10.637 --> 00:48:12.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was eager to see their progress.

00:48:12.673 --> 00:48:15.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so he visited them.

00:48:15.108 --> 00:48:17.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, over the years,
he traveled the world

00:48:17.277 --> 00:48:19.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he visited as many missionary homes

00:48:19.279 --> 00:48:21.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he possibly could.

00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:24.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
He privately met each missionary personally

00:48:24.518 --> 00:48:26.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
to talk over their challenges,

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
to arrange
for better accommodations if needed,

00:48:29.356 --> 00:48:31.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
to assess the potential for growth,

00:48:31.959 --> 00:48:34.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even to establish a new branch

00:48:34.127 --> 00:48:36.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
or arrange to purchase new property

00:48:36.163 --> 00:48:38.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
if needed.

00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:40.701 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr loved the brotherhood,

00:48:40.701 --> 00:48:42.302 line:10% position:50% align:center
especially missionaries

00:48:42.302 --> 00:48:43.570 line:10% position:50% align:center
and branch personnel.

00:48:43.570 --> 00:48:45.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he would take the opportunity

00:48:45.973 --> 00:48:48.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a 15- or 20-minute stopover

00:48:48.909 --> 00:48:50.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a train station or an airport

00:48:50.911 --> 00:48:52.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give encouragement

00:48:52.913 --> 00:48:55.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to help them
to advance the preaching work.

00:48:58.318 --> 00:49:01.688 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr had deep concern

00:49:01.688 --> 00:49:03.690 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the welfare of the brothers

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:06.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the war-torn countries of Europe.

00:49:06.259 --> 00:49:08.595 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brothers Knorr and Henschel

00:49:08.595 --> 00:49:11.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveled to Britain, France,

00:49:11.565 --> 00:49:13.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Switzerland, Belgium,

00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:15.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Netherlands, and Scandinavia

00:49:15.869 --> 00:49:18.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
in November 1945.

00:49:18.238 --> 00:49:20.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine, just a few months

00:49:20.507 --> 00:49:23.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
after World War II ended,

00:49:23.010 --> 00:49:26.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
the railroad track was destroyed
and bridges were destroyed.

00:49:26.246 --> 00:49:28.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there were no good connections

00:49:28.348 --> 00:49:30.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the cities.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not tourist travel;

00:49:32.419 --> 00:49:35.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was really hard work.

00:49:35.622 --> 00:49:39.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even this they did

00:49:39.693 --> 00:49:41.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of loving the brothers

00:49:41.695 --> 00:49:44.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helping and encouraging

00:49:44.231 --> 00:49:46.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers in these countries.

00:49:52.039 --> 00:49:54.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
After visiting the friends
in war-torn Europe,

00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:56.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Brothers Knorr and Henschel embarked

00:49:56.910 --> 00:49:59.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a very ambitious and extensive

00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:01.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
47,000-mile (76,000 km) tour.

00:50:01.481 --> 00:50:03.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
They visited some lands

00:50:03.617 --> 00:50:06.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there were few or even no Witnesses.

00:50:06.153 --> 00:50:08.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
If no branch operated
in a country they visited,

00:50:08.889 --> 00:50:10.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
they connected with the local congregations

00:50:10.924 --> 00:50:12.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
in private homes,

00:50:12.926 --> 00:50:14.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
they attended their meetings,

00:50:14.928 --> 00:50:16.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they accompanied the local publishers

00:50:16.997 --> 00:50:20.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the homes of interested ones
for group meetings.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they often rented venues
for public meetings.

00:50:23.737 --> 00:50:27.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Knorr and Henschel
went on the streets to advertise the talk

00:50:27.074 --> 00:50:29.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
that evening.

00:50:29.076 --> 00:50:32.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then Brother Knorr himself
even rode with bicycle parades

00:50:32.746 --> 00:50:34.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
to advertise his talks.

00:50:34.848 --> 00:50:37.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these meetings attracted
hundreds of interested ones,

00:50:37.284 --> 00:50:39.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though in one city,

00:50:39.286 --> 00:50:42.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a threatening note
that was received.

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, things don’t always turn out
as planned.

00:50:46.827 --> 00:50:48.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr and Brother Henschel

00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:51.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a service tour of countries in Africa.

00:50:51.164 --> 00:50:53.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those was Nigeria,

00:50:53.166 --> 00:50:55.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were to give talks
at two conventions.

00:50:55.435 --> 00:50:58.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those conventions
was 400 miles (640 km) away

00:50:58.472 --> 00:51:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
and involved a road trip.

00:51:00.474 --> 00:51:03.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they got off to an early start
at 3:30 in the morning.

00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:06.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
On into the trip,
they started to have car problems.

00:51:06.446 --> 00:51:10.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those car problems
turned into a grueling 18-hour delay,

00:51:10.450 --> 00:51:13.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they realized
they weren’t going to make the convention.

00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they decided
to go back to the branch in Lagos.

00:51:15.989 --> 00:51:19.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the return trip took 24 hours

00:51:19.025 --> 00:51:21.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
through jungle roads
and additional car problems.

00:51:21.828 --> 00:51:23.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
They got back to the branch,

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:26.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
they took a very brief rest,

00:51:26.166 --> 00:51:28.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were on to the next branch.

00:51:28.602 --> 00:51:30.737 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr loved the brothers,

00:51:30.737 --> 00:51:32.806 line:10% position:50% align:center
and he enjoyed being with them.

00:51:32.806 --> 00:51:34.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember very well

00:51:34.441 --> 00:51:36.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
how after his concluding talk,

00:51:36.409 --> 00:51:38.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
he waved to the brothers

00:51:38.578 --> 00:51:42.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we in the audience took out handkerchiefs

00:51:42.182 --> 00:51:44.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
and waved back for many minutes.

00:51:44.851 --> 00:51:46.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that was not all.

00:51:46.553 --> 00:51:49.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and Brother Henschel
then went to the railroad station

00:51:49.923 --> 00:51:53.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say farewell to the brothers
leaving in special trains.

00:51:53.827 --> 00:51:57.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
They called out
<i>“Auf Wiedersehen! Gute Reise!”</i>

00:51:57.998 --> 00:52:01.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they stayed there
till 10:30 at night doing that.

00:52:01.301 --> 00:52:03.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
They thought not of their comfort,

00:52:03.503 --> 00:52:06.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they thought of the brothers.

00:52:06.773 --> 00:52:09.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
A request to hold a large special meeting

00:52:09.409 --> 00:52:11.878 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Athens in 1952

00:52:11.878 --> 00:52:15.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not granted by the authorities
because of religious interference.

00:52:15.482 --> 00:52:19.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
But not wanting to miss an opportunity
to encourage the Greek brothers,

00:52:19.953 --> 00:52:23.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr came up with an alternate plan.

00:52:23.056 --> 00:52:25.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and Brother Henschel would take taxis

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:27.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the homes of local brothers,

00:52:27.594 --> 00:52:30.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they would give a talk
for approximately 20 minutes.

00:52:30.730 --> 00:52:33.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they would go on to another home,

00:52:33.233 --> 00:52:36.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they risked arrest
because of meeting together.

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:40.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were able to meet
with 905 of our Greek brothers.

00:52:40.807 --> 00:52:44.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
In describing that day, Brother Knorr wrote,

00:52:44.477 --> 00:52:47.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It was one of the most blessed experiences

00:52:47.547 --> 00:52:49.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our lives.”

00:52:49.549 --> 00:52:51.384 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz visited Spain many times,

00:52:51.384 --> 00:52:52.419 line:10% position:50% align:center
but during the 1950’s,

00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:54.454 line:10% position:50% align:center
our work was under ban.

00:52:54.454 --> 00:52:57.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz wanted to encourage
the local brothers,

00:52:57.224 --> 00:52:59.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was especially concerned
for their safety.

00:52:59.559 --> 00:53:00.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
On this one event,

00:53:00.994 --> 00:53:04.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz and his driver
decided to park their car

00:53:04.264 --> 00:53:06.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
near the home of their host,

00:53:06.266 --> 00:53:08.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
a certain Brother Garcia, who was a mechanic.

00:53:08.835 --> 00:53:11.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with the hood of the car open,

00:53:11.071 --> 00:53:14.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
they asked a neighbor,
“Is there a mechanic in the area?”

00:53:14.441 --> 00:53:17.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, he was referred to Brother Garcia.

00:53:17.844 --> 00:53:19.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Garcia
then looked at the car and said,

00:53:19.846 --> 00:53:21.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your car needs to come into my shop.”

00:53:21.848 --> 00:53:23.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the opportunity

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Brother Franz to meet
some local brothers and sisters.

00:53:26.253 --> 00:53:29.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it was time to walk
to the meeting later that day,

00:53:29.689 --> 00:53:31.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz decided to wear the beret

00:53:31.825 --> 00:53:34.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a sheepskin coat typical for the area

00:53:34.527 --> 00:53:37.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he would safely blend in
with his brothers.

00:53:37.998 --> 00:53:39.099 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, these brothers were

00:53:39.099 --> 00:53:41.835 line:10% position:50% align:center
very loving and courageous men.

00:53:41.835 --> 00:53:43.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
They worked very hard

00:53:43.403 --> 00:53:47.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep the brothers
in countries under ban fired up with zeal,

00:53:47.207 --> 00:53:49.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
even risking their own safety.

00:53:49.609 --> 00:53:51.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Franz actually was arrested

00:53:51.878 --> 00:53:53.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
while meeting with the brothers

00:53:53.613 --> 00:53:55.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Barcelona, Spain.

00:53:55.982 --> 00:53:58.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, these schedules that they kept

00:53:58.318 --> 00:54:00.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
must have been exhausting.

00:54:00.654 --> 00:54:03.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a country under ban was on the itinerary,

00:54:03.957 --> 00:54:06.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
they might pay a visit
to government officials

00:54:06.192 --> 00:54:09.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
to promote legalization of our work.

00:54:09.195 --> 00:54:11.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr visited all of the branches

00:54:11.898 --> 00:54:15.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage the brothers,
and he talked with the missionaries.

00:54:15.335 --> 00:54:18.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the 1950’s, there was much growth,

00:54:18.305 --> 00:54:20.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that proved to be too much for him alone.

00:54:20.774 --> 00:54:24.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he decided that it would be appropriate

00:54:24.311 --> 00:54:27.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
to train some of us brothers

00:54:27.013 --> 00:54:29.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could assist in that work

00:54:29.716 --> 00:54:32.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see that the shepherding was done

00:54:32.719 --> 00:54:35.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the work in the branches

00:54:35.221 --> 00:54:37.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
was done in unity.

00:54:38.058 --> 00:54:41.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the service tour of Africa in 1963,

00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:43.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Henschel attended the convention

00:54:43.763 --> 00:54:46.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Gbarnga, Liberia.

00:54:46.433 --> 00:54:49.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly, soldiers invaded the convention.

00:54:49.669 --> 00:54:52.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
They arrested Brother Henschel and others.

00:54:52.272 --> 00:54:54.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was mistreated

00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
—beaten with a rifle butt to the point

00:54:56.776 --> 00:54:59.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he thought he was going to die.

00:55:01.715 --> 00:55:04.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he remained on the scene to encourage

00:55:04.384 --> 00:55:07.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
and assist the brothers to be faithful,

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
to avoid compromise.

00:55:09.422 --> 00:55:11.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when finally he was released,

00:55:11.524 --> 00:55:13.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of going home,

00:55:13.526 --> 00:55:15.528 line:10% position:50% align:center
he completed his assignment

00:55:15.528 --> 00:55:17.597 line:10% position:50% align:center
to visit other branches

00:55:17.597 --> 00:55:19.299 line:10% position:50% align:center
and upon return

00:55:19.299 --> 00:55:23.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
never acted the part of a hero or martyr.

00:55:23.236 --> 00:55:26.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just the cost
of doing the Lord’s business.

00:55:28.141 --> 00:55:29.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the headquarters representatives

00:55:29.709 --> 00:55:30.877 line:10% position:50% align:center
wanted the best

00:55:30.877 --> 00:55:33.113 line:10% position:50% align:center
for delegates to a convention.

00:55:33.113 --> 00:55:35.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Knorr and Henschel were known

00:55:35.115 --> 00:55:37.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
to personally inspect venues

00:55:37.117 --> 00:55:39.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even negotiate contracts.

00:55:39.152 --> 00:55:41.388 line:10% position:50% align:center
In more recent times,

00:55:41.388 --> 00:55:44.224 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Jaracz personally visited hotels

00:55:44.224 --> 00:55:46.292 line:10% position:50% align:center
to make sure that there was a proper standard

00:55:46.292 --> 00:55:48.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
of comfort and cleanliness.

00:55:48.361 --> 00:55:50.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even tested out the beds.

00:55:51.731 --> 00:55:54.067 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr was well-aware of the situation

00:55:54.067 --> 00:55:55.268 line:10% position:50% align:center
that the brothers were facing

00:55:55.268 --> 00:55:56.770 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the Soviet Union.

00:55:57.337 --> 00:55:59.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote many letters

00:55:59.339 --> 00:56:01.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which he called on the brothers
to live in harmony

00:56:01.975 --> 00:56:04.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the direction of the organization.

00:56:05.578 --> 00:56:09.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
One such letter
fell into the hands of the KGB.

00:56:09.849 --> 00:56:11.251 line:10% position:50% align:center
They altered it.

00:56:11.251 --> 00:56:13.253 line:10% position:50% align:center
But when Brother Knorr was told about it,

00:56:13.253 --> 00:56:15.255 line:10% position:50% align:center
he drew the brothers’ attention

00:56:15.255 --> 00:56:17.357 line:10% position:50% align:center
to the spirit of the letter

00:56:17.357 --> 00:56:19.359 line:10% position:50% align:center
because from the spirit of the letter

00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:20.994 line:10% position:50% align:center
it would be evident immediately

00:56:20.994 --> 00:56:23.463 line:10% position:50% align:center
whether it was a letter from the organization

00:56:23.463 --> 00:56:25.498 line:10% position:50% align:center
or a forged letter.

00:56:25.965 --> 00:56:28.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is because the spirit
of the organization

00:56:28.368 --> 00:56:31.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
serves to unite the brothers,
not divide them.

00:56:32.472 --> 00:56:34.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
All this attention
to the international activity

00:56:34.774 --> 00:56:38.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
was taking place
while simultaneously directing

00:56:38.211 --> 00:56:40.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work and expansion at world headquarters,

00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
handling various legal issues,

00:56:42.715 --> 00:56:45.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
organizing and speaking at conventions

00:56:45.151 --> 00:56:47.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the United States,

00:56:47.187 --> 00:56:49.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead School lectures and graduations,

00:56:49.656 --> 00:56:51.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
annual meeting programs,

00:56:51.658 --> 00:56:53.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the while taking care

00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
of their own spiritual well-being

00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:57.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that of their wife if married.

00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:01.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next few decades
would see even greater growth

00:57:01.634 --> 00:57:04.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also greater challenges.

00:57:09.342 --> 00:57:11.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
What beautiful reminders

00:57:11.644 --> 00:57:16.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the efforts our brothers made
to serve our spiritual family!

00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:18.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s more to share.

00:57:18.384 --> 00:57:21.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a future broadcast, we’ll recall

00:57:21.121 --> 00:57:25.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
additional ways the Governing Body
has preserved unity.

00:57:26.392 --> 00:57:29.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now it’s time for our new music video.

00:57:29.829 --> 00:57:33.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
It highlights the many blessings of unity.

00:57:41.107 --> 00:57:53.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Calling out to all our brothers!
Calling out for all to hear!

00:58:06.366 --> 00:58:18.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
We share just one faith, one God.
We’re united wherever we’re found.

00:58:18.678 --> 00:58:31.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking the language of truth,
We join our voices with one joyful sound.

00:58:31.357 --> 00:58:38.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever we face,
We’re not on our own.

00:58:38.331 --> 00:58:45.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together
we’re never alone.

00:58:45.104 --> 00:58:51.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together, united,
together we belong.

00:58:51.110 --> 00:59:04.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together, united, together we are strong.
Together, united, as one we carry on.

00:59:04.257 --> 00:59:17.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Side by side and hand in hand,
together, together we are strong.

00:59:20.039 --> 00:59:32.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re found in all lands; it’s true.
And we know that we’re not all the same.

00:59:32.452 --> 00:59:45.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Diff’rent in things we may choose,
Maintaining peace for the sake of God’s name.

00:59:45.098 --> 00:59:51.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wherever we go,
Our brothers are there

00:59:51.938 --> 00:59:58.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
With love and the faith
we all share.

00:59:58.344 --> 01:00:04.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together, united,
together we belong.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:17.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together, united, together we are strong.
Together, united, as one we carry on.

01:00:17.864 --> 01:00:30.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Side by side and hand in hand,
together, together we are strong.

01:00:30.610 --> 01:00:37.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together,
united, together.

01:00:56.235 --> 01:01:02.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together, united,
together we belong.

01:01:02.375 --> 01:01:15.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together, united, together we are strong.
Together, united, as one we carry on.

01:01:15.388 --> 01:01:28.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Side by side and hand in hand,
together, together we are strong.

01:01:28.101 --> 01:01:42.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together we are strong.
Together we are strong.

01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:46.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s program encouraged us

01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:50.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “Stand Together as One United People.”

01:01:50.857 --> 01:01:54.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times we may be isolated,
but with Jehovah,

01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:57.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are never alone.

01:01:57.597 --> 01:02:01.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned not to allow
petty matters or cultural norms

01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:03.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
to disrupt our unity.

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
By building a close relationship
with Jehovah,

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:11.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeson became a member of a loving family.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were encouraged to seek

01:02:14.046 --> 01:02:17.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
opportunities to show unselfish love.

01:02:17.417 --> 01:02:20.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we reflected on the many ways
the Governing Body

01:02:20.887 --> 01:02:24.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
has worked to keep us as a united people.

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:28.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s video postcard,

01:02:28.661 --> 01:02:32.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
we go to the island
of Newfoundland in Canada.

01:02:32.632 --> 01:02:37.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
A large island at the far eastern coast
of North America,

01:02:37.403 --> 01:02:41.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Newfoundland is an amazing place of unique

01:02:41.107 --> 01:02:44.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
contrasts in weather, geography,

01:02:44.610 --> 01:02:46.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and natural beauty.

01:02:47.113 --> 01:02:49.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Edith Mason brought the truth here

01:02:49.549 --> 01:02:51.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than a century ago.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:56.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was a single,
full-time minister in Nova Scotia.

01:02:56.689 --> 01:03:00.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1914, she resolved to go by herself

01:03:00.827 --> 01:03:05.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach in Newfoundland
where there were no Witnesses at that time.

01:03:05.631 --> 01:03:08.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
After much prayer and planning,

01:03:08.468 --> 01:03:11.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
she arranged
for the “Photo-Drama of Creation”

01:03:11.604 --> 01:03:15.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be brought here in 1916.

01:03:15.007 --> 01:03:17.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 10,000 people

01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:21.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
viewed this ground-breaking presentation.

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:24.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the early preaching work
was done by boat.

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:28.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the years, the brothers used
four missionary boats

01:03:28.688 --> 01:03:33.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cover over 6,400 kilometers,

01:03:33.493 --> 01:03:37.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
or more than 4,000 miles,
of coastal territory.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:42.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the second world war,
spiritual activity increased.

01:03:42.034 --> 01:03:44.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1945,

01:03:44.203 --> 01:03:46.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
a branch office was established,

01:03:46.906 --> 01:03:50.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the first group
of Gilead-trained missionaries arrived.

01:03:50.543 --> 01:03:53.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch office continued to operate

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
until 1981.

01:03:55.615 --> 01:04:00.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead graduates Bernie and Elizabeth Mahler
were assigned to Newfoundland.

01:04:00.520 --> 01:04:02.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped establish a congregation

01:04:02.755 --> 01:04:06.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Bonavista in 1952.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:09.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, the Bonavista Congregation has

01:04:09.462 --> 01:04:13.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
38 publishers and 4 regular pioneers.

01:04:13.466 --> 01:04:16.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
The need remains great in Newfoundland.

01:04:16.202 --> 01:04:21.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost 30 percent of Canada’s
unassigned territory is here.

01:04:21.207 --> 01:04:23.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
When publishers come to help,

01:04:23.809 --> 01:04:25.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
they enjoy Newfoundland’s

01:04:25.645 --> 01:04:29.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
well-known, warm hospitality.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:32.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in the Bonavista Congregation

01:04:32.685 --> 01:04:35.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you their love and greetings!

01:04:36.656 --> 01:04:38.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier, we shared a preview

01:04:38.658 --> 01:04:42.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this year’s “Pursue Peace”!
Regional Convention.

01:04:42.595 --> 01:04:45.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’d like to give you a glimpse

01:04:45.097 --> 01:04:48.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the convention’s feature Bible drama:

01:04:48.234 --> 01:04:52.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Jehovah Guides Us in the Way of Peace.</i>

01:04:53.606 --> 01:04:55.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a God in the heavens

01:04:55.608 --> 01:04:58.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is a Revealer of secrets,

01:04:58.077 --> 01:04:59.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has made known

01:04:59.679 --> 01:05:01.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
to King Nebuchadnezzar

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:02.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is to happen

01:05:02.348 --> 01:05:04.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the final part of the days.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
The divine dream

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:13.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Daniel interprets
for King Nebuchadnezzar

01:05:13.726 --> 01:05:15.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
constitutes a prophecy

01:05:15.861 --> 01:05:19.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
crucial for the lasting peace of mankind.

01:05:19.765 --> 01:05:24.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows the course of history
centuries, even millenniums, in advance.

01:05:24.737 --> 01:05:26.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as the toes of the feet

01:05:26.973 --> 01:05:29.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

01:05:29.842 --> 01:05:32.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the kingdom will be partly strong

01:05:32.878 --> 01:05:35.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and partly fragile.

01:05:38.250 --> 01:05:41.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
History has shown us how every type

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:45.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
of human government imaginable has failed.

01:05:45.057 --> 01:05:47.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s only Jehovah who has the ability

01:05:47.493 --> 01:05:50.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
to guide humans to real, lasting peace.

01:05:53.566 --> 01:05:56.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has led his people in the past.

01:05:56.168 --> 01:05:58.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when he prophesies

01:05:58.437 --> 01:06:00.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’ll lead his people to real,

01:06:00.873 --> 01:06:03.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
lasting peace in the future,

01:06:03.576 --> 01:06:07.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
this isn’t a prediction; it’s a guarantee!

01:06:07.813 --> 01:06:11.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peace we seek
is certain under God’s Kingdom.

01:06:18.924 --> 01:06:21.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to share one more reason

01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:23.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be excited about the convention.

01:06:23.629 --> 01:06:26.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s my pleasure to announce

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:28.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ll conclude the convention

01:06:28.668 --> 01:06:31.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a new original song.

01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:34.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
The song and lyrics are now available

01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:36.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org.

01:06:36.375 --> 01:06:39.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body requests that all of us

01:06:39.645 --> 01:06:41.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
practice the new song.

01:06:41.681 --> 01:06:45.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if someone needs help
to download the song,

01:06:45.317 --> 01:06:48.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
please give them a hand
and practice with them.

01:06:48.387 --> 01:06:52.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then together we’ll sing out
with all of our hearts

01:06:52.558 --> 01:06:54.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s praise.

01:06:55.761 --> 01:06:58.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we conclude this month’s program,

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:02.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
please know that we sincerely love
