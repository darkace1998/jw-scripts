WEBVTT

00:01.150 --> 00:03.987
We welcome all of you 
to the December program 


00:03.987 --> 00:06.000
of JW Broadcasting!


00:23.740 --> 00:26.142
This month 
we have something different 


00:26.142 --> 00:27.444
to share with you. 


00:27.443 --> 00:29.211
The Governing Body has decided 


00:29.212 --> 00:31.314
that Gilead graduations


00:31.313 --> 00:32.815
and the spiritual portion 


00:32.815 --> 00:34.783
of the annual meeting programs 


00:34.783 --> 00:40.423
will be featured as monthly 
JW Broadcasting programs each year.


00:40.423 --> 00:43.860
At this time, you will be able 
to watch the first part 


00:43.860 --> 00:47.830
of the graduation 
of the 143rd class of Gilead. 


00:47.830 --> 00:50.933
You will enjoy listening 
to the five Scriptural talks 


00:50.933 --> 00:52.935
that will each be introduced to you 


00:52.935 --> 00:55.872
by Brother Herd of the Governing Body.


00:55.872 --> 00:59.642
Most languages 
that our monthly program is produced in 


00:59.642 --> 01:02.512
did not have 
the resources to also translate 


01:02.512 --> 01:05.349
and produce 
the Gilead graduation. 


01:05.348 --> 01:09.751
Now, by using the graduation 
as the monthly program, 


01:09.752 --> 01:12.889
many more of our brothers and sisters 
around the world 


01:12.888 --> 01:16.291
will be able to enjoy 
this rich spiritual banquet.


01:16.292 --> 01:20.330
We now invite you to enjoy 
Part One of the graduation 


01:20.330 --> 01:24.000
of the 143rd class of Gilead!


01:25.835 --> 01:28.037
It’s graduation day 


01:28.037 --> 01:32.242
for this 143rd class of Gilead. 


01:32.242 --> 01:35.379
And it’s been a long time coming 


01:35.378 --> 01:39.248
with a lot of work, worry, sweat, 


01:39.248 --> 01:41.851
and nerve-racking parts given 


01:41.852 --> 01:45.655
in front of your instructors 
and fellow classmates. 


01:45.655 --> 01:48.000
Wow! Ooh. 


01:49.392 --> 01:53.095
But none of you received 


01:53.095 --> 01:56.298
a failing grade
—not one. 


01:56.298 --> 01:58.300
You’re going to graduate today. 


01:58.300 --> 02:00.303
This is your day. 


02:00.303 --> 02:02.871
And it’s a joyful day, isn’t it? 


02:02.872 --> 02:06.442
A very joyful day for you, 


02:06.442 --> 02:10.747
and a joyful day 
for each and every one of us. 


02:10.747 --> 02:13.784
We’re glad you came to Gilead school, 


02:13.783 --> 02:18.788
and it saddens us a bit 
to know you are leaving us. 


02:18.788 --> 02:21.825
You’re not going to be here much longer. 


02:21.825 --> 02:24.560
Your fine spiritual instructors


02:24.560 --> 02:27.130
—Brothers Cauthon, Lippold, 


02:27.130 --> 02:31.532
Noumair, Samuelson, and Stovall


02:31.532 --> 02:36.339
—they would like to cry, 
but they’re good manly men, 


02:36.338 --> 02:40.000
and it’s hard for good manly men 
to cry in public. 


02:41.878 --> 02:45.548
Of course, there is a host of others


02:45.548 --> 02:47.283
—too many to name—


02:47.283 --> 02:50.786
such as Sam Herd. 


02:50.787 --> 02:54.000
Oops, it just slipped out 
beyond my control. 


02:55.592 --> 02:58.729
Your instructors have done 
a fine job of helping you 


02:58.728 --> 03:03.265
to open your eyes 
to see your “Grand Instructor” 


03:03.265 --> 03:06.102
mentioned at Isaiah 30:20. 


03:06.102 --> 03:10.105
After all, he is the one 
who has been teaching 


03:10.105 --> 03:12.675
by giving his holy spirit 


03:12.675 --> 03:16.000
to all these brothers that I’ve mentioned. 


03:17.313 --> 03:21.000
Look at what is stated at Isaiah 66:1


03:23.418 --> 03:27.456
—66:1—it says: 
“This is what Jehovah says: 


03:27.457 --> 03:31.000
‘The heavens are my throne, 
and the earth is my footstool.’” 


03:32.728 --> 03:37.066
For the last five months, 
you’ve been sitting at Jehovah’s feet 


03:37.067 --> 03:41.270
and you have been taught 
by your Grand Instructor. 


03:41.270 --> 03:45.708
What you have learned 
is much more than you knew 


03:45.708 --> 03:49.311
when you first sat down five months ago. 


03:49.312 --> 03:53.249
Without a doubt, 
the knowledge you have taken in 


03:53.248 --> 03:56.986
has brought you closer to Jehovah. 


03:56.987 --> 04:00.557
You have really drawn close to Jehovah, 


04:00.557 --> 04:03.994
and he has drawn close to you.


04:03.993 --> 04:08.000
However, you’ve only scratched the surface. 


04:09.465 --> 04:11.935
Job said: . . . 


04:11.935 --> 04:17.940
[Indiscernible whispering]


04:17.940 --> 04:20.000
Did you hear what I said? 


04:21.043 --> 04:23.045
Of course you didn’t. 


04:23.045 --> 04:26.782
Now let’s read the scripture, 


04:26.782 --> 04:29.385
Job 26:14: 


04:29.385 --> 04:32.988
“Look! 
These are just the fringes of his ways; 


04:32.988 --> 04:38.000
only a faint whisper has been heard of him!” 


04:41.697 --> 04:45.835
This is just about as much as we have learned 


04:45.835 --> 04:49.000
compared to what Jehovah knows. 


04:50.640 --> 04:53.542
Who knows all that Jehovah knows? 


04:53.542 --> 04:56.445
No one
—not even Jesus, 


04:56.445 --> 04:59.000
and he knows quite a bit more than we do. 


05:01.950 --> 05:05.153
He’s been around longer, hasn’t he? 


05:05.153 --> 05:07.156
Much longer. 


05:07.157 --> 05:10.527
In fact, Jesus was present 
when the earth was created. 


05:10.527 --> 05:12.662
When was that? 


05:12.662 --> 05:14.664
Well, if you’ve been listening 
to morning worship, 


05:14.663 --> 05:16.798
you’ll know that one member 
of the Governing Body 


05:16.798 --> 05:18.968
told us that in Proverbs chapter 8


05:18.968 --> 05:20.370
—he says take a look at that—


05:20.370 --> 05:25.007
verses 29 and 30, and he read it to us, 
he said: “This is what it says.” 


05:25.007 --> 05:27.644
“When he established 
the foundations of the earth, 


05:27.643 --> 05:31.646
then I was beside him 
as a master worker.” 


05:31.647 --> 05:33.649
Do you remember that? 


05:33.648 --> 05:37.120
You don’t if you didn’t hear 
today’s text or read it. 


05:37.120 --> 05:42.192
But we are convinced 
that you heard it and you read it. 


05:42.192 --> 05:44.260
Well, that’s a long time, isn’t it? 


05:44.260 --> 05:46.528
The earth
—foundations of the earth—


05:46.528 --> 05:48.530
how long? 


05:48.530 --> 05:52.635
Well, based on the very old zircon rock 
from Australia, 


05:52.635 --> 05:55.738
some scientists say we know that the earth 


05:55.738 --> 05:59.441
is at least four 
and one-half billion years old, 


05:59.442 --> 06:02.379
give or take a hundred million years. 


06:02.378 --> 06:05.981
Well, no one really knows down here on earth, 


06:05.982 --> 06:10.000
but we have to listen 
to some of these so-called wise men. 


06:11.053 --> 06:14.756
Jesus, in his prehuman existence, was there. 


06:14.757 --> 06:16.759
There’s no doubt about that. 


06:16.758 --> 06:19.728
Colossians chapter 1 shows that, 
that he was there. 


06:19.728 --> 06:24.033
He was at Jehovah’s side way before then


06:24.033 --> 06:25.768
—listening and learning. 


06:25.768 --> 06:27.870
And he’s at Jehovah’s side today, isn’t he? 


06:27.870 --> 06:29.438
You know that. 


06:29.438 --> 06:31.773
He’s right there seated beside Jehovah, 


06:31.773 --> 06:36.000
doing the work that Jehovah 
has outlined that should be done.


06:37.080 --> 06:42.985
When measured by Jesus, 
we’re newborn infants. 


06:42.985 --> 06:47.000
We barely have our eyes open, barely. 


06:49.192 --> 06:52.795
What we see is not what we’re going to see 


06:52.795 --> 06:55.030
in the years to come. 


06:55.030 --> 06:57.767
We’re just looking; we’re just learning; 


06:57.767 --> 07:02.004
we’re touching things
—and for the first time. 


07:02.003 --> 07:04.673
Just think, in the past ten years 


07:04.673 --> 07:07.810
how many things 
we’ve touched for the first time. 


07:07.810 --> 07:10.178
Even though we’ve read the Bible 
over and over again, 


07:10.178 --> 07:12.881
and we’ve listened to it 
being read to us over and over again, 


07:12.882 --> 07:17.620
but we’ve just touched a few things


07:17.620 --> 07:22.258
—like the generation, 
20 years ago, the generation. 


07:22.258 --> 07:25.495
And now we know 
all about that generation, right? 


07:25.495 --> 07:29.000
And so many other things
—dragnet—


07:30.700 --> 07:32.702
many other things, 


07:32.702 --> 07:35.505
like the sanctification of God’s name, 


07:35.505 --> 07:39.608
vindication of his sovereignty
—touch, touch, touch. 


07:39.608 --> 07:42.245
You Gilead students, 
you’ve touched a few things, 


07:42.245 --> 07:45.000
but not everything, 


07:47.048 --> 07:49.051
not everything. 


07:49.052 --> 07:52.000
But what you have learned, 


07:54.590 --> 07:57.660
put to good use in your assignments. 


07:57.660 --> 08:01.397
Keep in mind that you don’t know it all. 


08:01.397 --> 08:05.000
And here’s something else: You never will. 


08:06.168 --> 08:09.871
No matter how long we live, 
we’ll never know it all. 


08:09.872 --> 08:13.142
Jehovah will still be revealing things to us, 


08:13.142 --> 08:15.945
and they’re always good things. 


08:15.945 --> 08:19.715
We benefit from what Jehovah gives us. 


08:19.715 --> 08:23.000
He knows exactly what we need, 
and he gives it to us. 


08:27.323 --> 08:29.458
So always keep that in mind. 


08:29.458 --> 08:33.000
We’re students under Jehovah, 


08:34.497 --> 08:38.000
and that’s where we’ll always be. 


08:40.637 --> 08:43.974
But we’re happy. 


08:43.973 --> 08:46.175
We’re glad to be here. 


08:46.175 --> 08:50.345
We’re glad to be here with you students, 


08:50.345 --> 08:54.000
every one of you, 
and you’re good students too. 


08:55.150 --> 08:59.000
Now it’s true, not all of you 
are A-plus students. 


09:01.323 --> 09:04.626
I’m not either. 


09:04.627 --> 09:09.000
I was happy to get a good C-plus in school.


09:11.300 --> 09:16.000
Well, we’re going to get started now 
with a major part of our meeting. 


09:17.873 --> 09:21.210
“Being Happy Despite Challenges” 


09:21.210 --> 09:25.013
is the theme of Brother Gerrit Lösch’s talk. 


09:25.013 --> 09:27.816
Brother Lösch is a member 
of the Governing Body. 


09:27.817 --> 09:32.000
He is the senior member 
of the Governing Body. 


09:33.455 --> 09:36.392
Now, I mean by that, 
he’s been a member of the Governing Body 


09:36.392 --> 09:39.062
longer than the rest of us. 


09:39.062 --> 09:43.000
I’m the oldest one on the Governing Body. 


09:44.333 --> 09:46.635
We all face challenges of some sort. 


09:46.635 --> 09:51.000
So let’s listen carefully 
to what he has to say, Brother Lösch.


10:13.795 --> 10:16.000
“Oh happy day.” 


10:18.167 --> 10:21.037
These are the first words of the gospel song. 


10:21.037 --> 10:23.039
And it goes on to say, 


10:23.038 --> 10:28.043
“Oh happy day, 
when Jesus washed my sins away.” 


10:28.043 --> 10:30.780
And we can agree 


10:30.780 --> 10:33.582
with these music lyrics 


10:33.582 --> 10:36.419
from the 18th century. 


10:36.418 --> 10:41.923
We agree that forgiveness of sins 
makes us happy, doesn’t it? 


10:41.923 --> 10:44.093
But for many others, 


10:44.093 --> 10:50.431
the happy day is the payday 
at the end of the month. 


10:50.432 --> 10:53.769
Now, what is a happy day for you students? 


10:53.768 --> 10:56.238
Graduation day. 


10:56.238 --> 10:59.275
But you are not happy because it’s over, 


10:59.275 --> 11:04.547
but because you had 
the privilege to attend Gilead. 


11:04.547 --> 11:07.817
Many in the world believe 
that if they had more money, 


11:07.817 --> 11:09.819
they would be happier. 


11:09.818 --> 11:13.188
However, many who made gaining of wealth 


11:13.188 --> 11:16.758
the chief goal in life 
now suffer disappointment. 


11:16.758 --> 11:18.760
Some have lost their house, 


11:18.760 --> 11:23.000
being unable to pay the mortgage 
when they were laid off from work. 


11:24.200 --> 11:26.635
Wealth does not bring happiness. 


11:26.635 --> 11:30.000
Rather, lasting happiness 
comes from doing Jehovah’s will. 


11:31.407 --> 11:33.409
What is happiness? 


11:33.408 --> 11:36.078
Happiness is a state of well-being, 


11:36.078 --> 11:41.283
contentment, even deep and intense joy. 


11:41.283 --> 11:43.951
But in the world, many are unhappy. 


11:43.952 --> 11:48.424
In 2015, there were more than 
twice as many suicides 


11:48.423 --> 11:50.558
in the United States


11:50.558 --> 11:55.463
—namely 44,193—


11:55.463 --> 11:59.535
more than homicides, 


11:59.535 --> 12:02.605
where there were only 17,000 of those. 


12:02.605 --> 12:06.442
Up to 120 people take their life 


12:06.442 --> 12:09.712
in the United States each day. 


12:09.712 --> 12:12.000
How sad. 


12:13.448 --> 12:15.751
Though very rare, due to depression 


12:15.752 --> 12:18.420
even some true Christians 
have taken their life, 


12:18.420 --> 12:22.825
but generally we are a happy people, 
aren’t we?


12:22.825 --> 12:26.995
And here are 12 reasons for our happiness. 


12:26.995 --> 12:31.733
For one, we can be happy 
because we worship a happy God. 


12:31.733 --> 12:33.868
Psalm 33:12: 


12:33.868 --> 12:37.000
“Happy is the nation whose God is Jehovah.” 


12:38.907 --> 12:42.344
Secondly, because we have our sins forgiven, 


12:42.343 --> 12:44.346
as mentioned in the introduction. 


12:44.347 --> 12:46.349
Romans 4:7 says: 


12:46.348 --> 12:49.151
“Happy are those whose lawless deeds 


12:49.152 --> 12:54.490
have been pardoned 
and whose sins have been covered.” 


12:54.490 --> 12:56.492
Number three, we can be happy 


12:56.492 --> 13:00.000
because we’re being loved 
by Jehovah and Jesus. 


13:01.130 --> 13:04.467
Four, we’re happy because of being united 


13:04.467 --> 13:07.937
with our worldwide brotherhood. 


13:07.937 --> 13:12.642
Five, we can be happy 
because of living in a spiritual paradise, 


13:12.642 --> 13:15.610
having peace with Jehovah, 
with our brothers, 


13:15.610 --> 13:19.982
and also having plenty of spiritual food. 


13:19.982 --> 13:22.685
Six, in the Sermon on the Mount, 


13:22.685 --> 13:25.687
Jesus emphasized spirituality when he said: 


13:25.687 --> 13:30.192
“Happy are those conscious 
of their spiritual need.” 


13:30.192 --> 13:33.962
In this sermon, he mentioned nine things 
that make us happy. 


13:33.962 --> 13:35.364
What things? 


13:35.363 --> 13:39.000
Well, you’ll find out 
by rereading this sermon. 


13:40.102 --> 13:43.972
Number seven, we are happy 
because our life has meaning, 


13:43.972 --> 13:46.942
namely, according to Ephesians 1:12, 


13:46.942 --> 13:50.000
to “serve for the praise of his glory.” 


13:51.880 --> 13:54.550
Number eight, at Revelation 1:3, 


13:54.550 --> 13:58.287
Jesus showed that 
reading God’s Word makes us happy. 


13:58.287 --> 14:03.025
He says: 
“Happy is [he] who reads aloud 


14:03.025 --> 14:07.462
and those who hear 
the words of this prophecy.” 


14:07.462 --> 14:10.099
Do you want to be happy every day? 


14:10.098 --> 14:13.000
Read the Bible every day. 


14:14.168 --> 14:18.173
In the book of Revelation, 
Jesus proclaims seven happinesses. 


14:18.173 --> 14:19.908
Which ones? 


14:19.908 --> 14:22.000
Find out by rereading Revelation. 


14:24.045 --> 14:26.582
Number nine, we are also happy 


14:26.582 --> 14:29.519
because we serve in the spiritual temple. 


14:29.518 --> 14:32.253
In Revelation 7, 
not just the anointed 


14:32.253 --> 14:35.790
but also the great crowd 
are shown serving, 


14:35.790 --> 14:40.000
not near or before, 
but in the temple. 


14:41.597 --> 14:43.632
David called the Levites happy. 


14:43.632 --> 14:45.700
He said at Psalm 65:4:


14:45.700 --> 14:48.403
“Happy is the one whom you choose 


14:48.403 --> 14:52.775
[to] bring near to reside 
in your courtyards.” 


14:52.775 --> 14:54.810
David arranged the Levites 


14:54.810 --> 14:58.713
so that they could serve at the temple 
twice a year for one week. 


14:58.713 --> 15:01.950
However, in contrast, 
all of God’s people serve him 


15:01.950 --> 15:06.222
in the spiritual temple all year long, 
every day. 


15:06.222 --> 15:09.759
How happy we can be. 


15:09.758 --> 15:12.828
Number ten, Psalm 40:4 says: 


15:12.828 --> 15:16.000
“Happy is the man who trusts in Jehovah.” 


15:17.465 --> 15:21.370
Trust is a must to maintain happiness. 


15:21.370 --> 15:24.038
When you arrive in your assignment, 


15:24.038 --> 15:27.108
trust that Jehovah will support you. 


15:27.108 --> 15:29.478
Trust in Jehovah’s strength 


15:29.478 --> 15:33.348
rather than in your Gilead training 
and your abilities. 


15:33.348 --> 15:37.653
If low on funds, trust in Jehovah. 


15:37.653 --> 15:39.788
He will care for you. 


15:39.788 --> 15:44.326
If you have to learn a new language, trust. 


15:44.327 --> 15:47.864
When you are being accused wrongly, 


15:47.863 --> 15:51.733
trust that matters will be clarified in time. 


15:51.733 --> 15:56.171
When you are discouraged, 
trust in better times. 


15:56.172 --> 16:00.709
There is light at the end of each tunnel. 


16:00.708 --> 16:04.713
Number 11, we are happy 
because we practice giving, 


16:04.713 --> 16:06.481
and Jesus said: 


16:06.482 --> 16:10.987
“There is more happiness in giving 
than there is in receiving.” 


16:10.987 --> 16:14.990
Words well-known
—Acts 20:35. 


16:14.990 --> 16:19.662
And 12, we are happy 
because of the wonderful promise 


16:19.662 --> 16:22.130
of a heavenly paradise for some 


16:22.130 --> 16:25.233
and an earthly paradise for billions. 


16:25.233 --> 16:31.000
We are happy because this is tied 
to the promise of everlasting life.


16:32.107 --> 16:34.844
How does happiness show? 


16:34.843 --> 16:39.000
It shows by a spirit of appreciation 
and expressions of appreciation. 


16:40.548 --> 16:43.718
So beware of a complaining spirit. 


16:43.718 --> 16:47.255
When Jehovah liberated Israel, 
the people were happy. 


16:47.255 --> 16:49.458
However, within just a few weeks, 


16:49.458 --> 16:54.896
they complained and even wanted 
to return to slavery in Egypt. 


16:54.897 --> 16:58.234
To stay happy, have a positive outlook. 


16:58.233 --> 17:01.303
Don’t complain 
about the thorns on rosebushes, 


17:01.303 --> 17:05.000
but be glad 
that some thornbushes have roses on it. 


17:07.342 --> 17:09.812
Number two, when you go to your assignment, 


17:09.812 --> 17:11.814
radiate the happiness you feel. 


17:11.813 --> 17:14.315
Let others see it in your eyes, 


17:14.315 --> 17:16.452
in your face, in your smile; 


17:16.452 --> 17:21.000
but smile, not like a salesperson, 
but smile from the heart. 


17:22.257 --> 17:27.262
Happiness is also shown by enjoying singing. 


17:27.262 --> 17:30.232
Happy people often sing. 


17:30.232 --> 17:32.869
Do we sing from time to time? 


17:32.868 --> 17:34.870
singing in the rain? 


17:34.870 --> 17:38.000
or maybe in the shower? 
or wherever? 


17:39.842 --> 17:42.444
How can we deepen our happiness? 


17:42.443 --> 17:45.013
What others do affects our happiness, 


17:45.013 --> 17:48.316
and what we do 
affects the happiness of others. 


17:48.317 --> 17:52.454
We simply cannot escape 
the fact that our happiness 


17:52.453 --> 17:56.391
is intertwined with the lives 
of many other people


17:56.392 --> 18:00.262
—our families, our friends, and others. 


18:00.262 --> 18:04.265
Happiness is often in small things, 


18:04.265 --> 18:09.000
and unhappiness is the result 
of neglecting small things. 


18:10.072 --> 18:13.509
Happiness is not the absence of challenges, 


18:13.508 --> 18:17.045
but the ability to overcome them. 


18:17.045 --> 18:20.582
Happiness does not depend 
on outside circumstances, 


18:20.582 --> 18:22.584
but on your inner thoughts 


18:22.583 --> 18:26.221
and your relationship with our happy God. 


18:26.222 --> 18:28.524
Happiness is connected with joy, 


18:28.523 --> 18:31.025
and joy is part 
of the fruitage of the spirit. 


18:31.025 --> 18:33.862
So avail yourself of the holy spirit, 


18:33.862 --> 18:36.799
and you will be happier.


18:36.798 --> 18:39.501
You can be happy though hungry. 


18:39.502 --> 18:42.304
That was the title of a special talk. 


18:42.303 --> 18:45.640
Of course, you can be happy 
if you’re not hungry. 


18:45.640 --> 18:48.843
Perhaps you take advantage 
of the “happy hour” 


18:48.843 --> 18:51.000
in a restaurant where prices are reduced. 


18:53.882 --> 18:56.952
You can be happy though single. 


18:56.952 --> 19:00.022
You can be happy because of being married 


19:00.022 --> 19:03.192
and sometimes despite being married. 


19:03.192 --> 19:07.429
You can be happy without children, 


19:07.428 --> 19:11.533
and you can be happy despite children. 


19:11.533 --> 19:15.170
You can be happy though 
you’re only 15 years old, 


19:15.170 --> 19:20.275
and you can be happy 
although you’re 85 years of age. 


19:20.275 --> 19:23.145
You can be happy though you are sick 


19:23.145 --> 19:26.013
and even more happy, 
of course, if you’re healthy. 


19:26.013 --> 19:30.418
You can even be happy 
though you lost loved ones in death. 


19:30.418 --> 19:33.755
You will see them again. 


19:33.755 --> 19:37.893
You can be happy 
though persecuted for Christ’s sake. 


19:37.893 --> 19:40.628
Jesus said at Luke 6:22, 23: 


19:40.628 --> 19:43.731
“Happy are you whenever men hate you . . . 


19:43.732 --> 19:47.000
Rejoice in that day and leap for joy.” 


19:48.670 --> 19:52.273
You can be happy if you lost your job. 


19:52.273 --> 19:56.378
You can be happy if you lost your wallet. 


19:56.378 --> 19:59.548
You can be happy if you lost your heart 


19:59.548 --> 20:02.483
in San Francisco


20:02.483 --> 20:07.221
—according to one song—
or somewhere else. 


20:07.222 --> 20:11.192
You cannot be happy if you lost your mind, 


20:11.192 --> 20:13.695
or maybe you can be even happier then 


20:13.695 --> 20:16.063
because of not being aware 
of all the problems 


20:16.063 --> 20:19.000
around you and affecting you. 


20:24.305 --> 20:26.975
If you are happy, you make others happy. 


20:26.975 --> 20:30.000
If you are unhappy, you make others unhappy. 


20:31.212 --> 20:33.249
If you are not happy with others, 


20:33.248 --> 20:36.285
others will not be happy with you. 


20:36.285 --> 20:39.253
Humor adds to happiness. 


20:39.253 --> 20:43.091
It makes pain and problems more bearable. 


20:43.092 --> 20:46.295
Find happiness in small things


20:46.295 --> 20:50.265
—the sunset, the clouds in the sky, 
the birds chirping, 


20:50.265 --> 20:55.000
the butterfly on the flower, 
the dog chasing its tail. 


20:56.405 --> 21:01.008
Maintain happiness by meditating 
on the Paradise to come. 


21:01.008 --> 21:03.011
Keep it in expectation. 


21:03.012 --> 21:05.014
Daniel 12:12 says: 


21:05.013 --> 21:10.018
“Happy is the one who keeps in expectation.” 


21:10.018 --> 21:14.055
In Paradise, there will be no more tears,


21:14.055 --> 21:17.960
no emotional pain, no unhappiness. 


21:17.960 --> 21:22.563
Everyone will be happy every day, 
all the time. 


21:22.563 --> 21:27.568
So let us maintain and deepen 
our happiness despite challenges 


21:27.568 --> 21:30.105
by praising our happy God, Jehovah, 


21:30.105 --> 21:34.000
and making others and ourselves 
ever more happy.


21:48.723 --> 21:51.826
We certainly want to thank you, 
Brother Lösch. 


21:51.827 --> 21:55.830
You made all of us happy 
with that wonderful talk. 


21:55.830 --> 21:58.800
Our next speaker is Brother Gary Breaux, 


21:58.800 --> 22:02.070
a helper to the Service Committee 
of the Governing Body 


22:02.070 --> 22:04.205
and a Branch Committee member. 


22:04.205 --> 22:05.907
His theme is 


22:05.907 --> 22:10.000
“Continue to Give Jehovah 
Reasons Not to Forget.”


22:14.983 --> 22:18.786
Well, we usually don’t think of Jehovah 
as forgetting. 


22:18.787 --> 22:22.457
After all, he’s all-knowing, 


22:22.457 --> 22:26.060
and surely he doesn’t forget anything. 


22:26.060 --> 22:28.630
But you know, when it comes to humans, 


22:28.630 --> 22:30.665
it is possible to forget. 


22:30.665 --> 22:33.568
You remember the account in Deuteronomy. 


22:33.568 --> 22:38.106
Moses in this case 
was giving caution to the Israelites 


22:38.107 --> 22:41.610
about life once they entered 
into the Promised Land. 


22:41.610 --> 22:46.280
And we have Deuteronomy 6:12, 


22:46.280 --> 22:50.452
he says: 
“Be careful not to forget Jehovah, 


22:50.452 --> 22:54.122
who brought you out of the land of Egypt, 
[and] out of the house of slavery.” 


22:54.122 --> 22:58.660
So it’s possible for servants of God 
to forget Jehovah. 


22:58.660 --> 23:02.330
But you know, 
that street goes both ways, so to speak. 


23:02.330 --> 23:07.335
The apostle Paul introduces the idea 


23:07.335 --> 23:10.472
that Jehovah God can forget too. 


23:10.472 --> 23:16.010
It’s at Hebrews 6:10. 


23:16.010 --> 23:19.413
Hebrews 6:10, 


23:19.413 --> 23:22.750
notice Jehovah’s ability to forget here, 


23:22.750 --> 23:27.755
it says: “For God is not unrighteous 
so as to forget your work 


23:27.755 --> 23:32.260
“and the love you showed for his name 


23:32.260 --> 23:37.000
by ministering and continuing to minister 
to the holy ones.” 


23:38.300 --> 23:40.335
So he says there are two things 


23:40.335 --> 23:43.037
that Jehovah God says 
that he will never forget. 


23:43.037 --> 23:44.505
What are they? 


23:44.505 --> 23:48.377
Well, it’s work and love. 


23:48.377 --> 23:52.014
Now, remember the theme 
of this talk that I chose. 


23:52.013 --> 23:55.583
It’s not “Give Jehovah Reasons Not to Forget” 


23:55.583 --> 23:58.920
because that would imply 
that you haven’t been doing that, 


23:58.920 --> 24:01.022
and that’s not the case. 


24:01.022 --> 24:03.292
But the theme is 


24:03.292 --> 24:08.697
“Continue to Give Jehovah 
Reasons Not to Forget.” 


24:08.697 --> 24:11.232
And so it will be good for us 
to look a little deeper 


24:11.232 --> 24:14.102
into these simple words of Paul 


24:14.102 --> 24:18.974
because it’s going to help us 
not to forget about Jehovah. 


24:18.973 --> 24:22.476
And hopefully, he will not forget about us.


24:22.477 --> 24:24.880
So we’re going to talk first about work, 


24:24.880 --> 24:27.000
and then we’ll come back and talk about love. 


24:28.283 --> 24:32.520
Now, it is interesting that Paul did not say 


24:32.520 --> 24:36.423
that God would not forget your assignment. 


24:36.423 --> 24:40.095
Jehovah says: 
‘Oh, you’re a Branch Committee member. 


24:40.095 --> 24:42.430
‘Oh, I’ll never forget that. 


24:42.430 --> 24:46.267
‘Or you’re a pioneer; 
you’re a special pioneer; 


24:46.267 --> 24:48.604
‘you’re an elder. 


24:48.603 --> 24:51.873
‘Or you’re at a service desk 
in a service department. 


24:51.873 --> 24:53.575
I’ll never forget that.’ 


24:53.575 --> 24:56.512
That’s not what Paul said in this verse. 


24:56.512 --> 24:58.780
What did he say? 


24:58.780 --> 25:03.000
He said it’s the work 
that He will never forget. 


25:04.185 --> 25:06.420
Now, it’s true, 
we need Branch Committee members, 


25:06.420 --> 25:08.557
we need elders, 
we need pioneers, and so forth. 


25:08.557 --> 25:12.427
But what Jehovah is not going to forget 


25:12.427 --> 25:16.297
is the work that we do 
and the various assignments 


25:16.297 --> 25:18.934
and the various ways 
that we serve Jehovah God, 


25:18.933 --> 25:21.000
giving him whole-souled service.


25:22.703 --> 25:26.173
I’d like to tell you about a brother 
that really understands 


25:26.173 --> 25:28.610
this part of Hebrews 6:10 well. 


25:28.610 --> 25:31.245
A few years ago, we had five members 


25:31.245 --> 25:34.048
on an Assembly Hall Committee 


25:34.048 --> 25:37.151
and we were directed 
to bring it down to three, 


25:37.152 --> 25:39.922
so we had to remove two members 
of every committee. 


25:39.922 --> 25:41.757
And the Branch Committee decided 


25:41.757 --> 25:44.692
who was going to be removed 
from the committee. 


25:44.692 --> 25:46.294
So the oldest brother


25:46.293 --> 25:49.563
—one of the oldest brothers serving 
and age wise—


25:49.563 --> 25:52.000
it was decided 
that he would come off the committee. 


25:52.000 --> 25:54.035
So we had to send someone to tell him. 


25:54.035 --> 25:56.237
We were not going to write a letter to him. 


25:56.237 --> 25:59.207
So guess what? 
I was chosen to go tell him. 


25:59.207 --> 26:02.010
So I was sitting at the table
—conference table—


26:02.010 --> 26:04.245
with the Assembly Hall Committee, 
and I was nervous, 


26:04.245 --> 26:07.415
and I was using the Scriptures, 
trying to get to their heart. 


26:07.415 --> 26:09.517
Finally, it got to the point 
that I had to say, 


26:09.517 --> 26:12.754
“Now, you two brothers 
are being relieved of your assignment.” 


26:12.753 --> 26:16.256
Immediately, 
the elderly brother raised his hand and said, 


26:16.257 --> 26:18.560
“Can I read you a scripture?” 


26:18.560 --> 26:21.195
And I said, “Yeah, please do.” 


26:21.195 --> 26:24.432
And he read Hebrews 6:10. 


26:24.432 --> 26:28.904
And he said: 
“Brothers, I’m here not for a title; 


26:28.903 --> 26:30.905
“I’m here to work. 


26:30.905 --> 26:33.000
Just give me work to do.” 


26:34.142 --> 26:38.112
It affects me every time 
I tell that story because, really, 


26:38.112 --> 26:41.850
his comment captures what Paul is saying:


26:41.850 --> 26:45.000
‘Jehovah will not forget your work.’


26:46.822 --> 26:49.757
Well, let’s go back to Hebrews 6:10 


26:49.757 --> 26:52.960
because it talks about the second thing. 


26:52.960 --> 26:56.698
It says: 
‘He is not going to forget the love.’ 


26:56.698 --> 26:59.133
Well, what kind of love is he talking about? 


26:59.133 --> 27:00.735
‘Oh Jehovah, we love you.’ 


27:00.735 --> 27:02.437
Jehovah looks down: ‘Thank you very much. 


27:02.437 --> 27:04.272
I’ll never forget you love me.’ 


27:04.272 --> 27:07.909
Well, that’s true, 
but that’s not what Paul is saying. 


27:07.908 --> 27:10.145
Let’s read it again. 


27:10.145 --> 27:13.982
Verse 10, after he says 
He won’t forget the work, he says: 


27:13.982 --> 27:17.119
“And the love you showed for his name 


27:17.118 --> 27:22.656
by ministering and continuing to minister 
to the holy ones.” 


27:22.657 --> 27:25.560
So there are a couple of words here 


27:25.560 --> 27:27.562
that are important to understand. 


27:27.562 --> 27:32.667
It’s “you showed” and “ministering.” 


27:32.667 --> 27:36.739
In other words, 
‘Your love for your brother,’ 


27:36.738 --> 27:42.000
Jehovah says, 
‘ah, look at that, I’ll never forget it.’ 


27:44.178 --> 27:47.881
You see, it’s not an intellectual love. 


27:47.882 --> 27:50.552
Now, you’ve been in class for what, 
five months? 


27:50.552 --> 27:52.554
I would imagine you’ve read every scripture; 


27:52.553 --> 27:55.790
you’ve heard all kinds of examples 
about showing love; 


27:55.790 --> 27:59.827
you have every reason to show love. 


27:59.827 --> 28:03.130
And now we encourage you: Go out and do it. 


28:03.130 --> 28:06.100
Practice what you have learned. 


28:06.100 --> 28:08.503
Remember if it’s only words, 
what did Paul say? 


28:08.503 --> 28:12.840
It’s like a cymbal
—clashing cymbal. 


28:12.840 --> 28:16.243
So love means action; 


28:16.243 --> 28:19.000
it doesn’t just mean words.


28:20.582 --> 28:25.054
I’d like to tell you another little story 


28:25.053 --> 28:29.023
about a brother that had 
somewhat of a difficulty with this. 


28:29.023 --> 28:31.425
When I was a young circuit overseer, 


28:31.425 --> 28:36.230
the district overseer I had was—
I was afraid of him. 


28:36.230 --> 28:39.000
Everybody else was scared of him too. 


28:39.000 --> 28:43.805
At one circuit assembly, 
his wife wasn’t there, 


28:43.805 --> 28:48.577
so he didn’t tell anybody 
why she wasn’t there, 


28:48.577 --> 28:50.779
and we’d never ask. 


28:50.778 --> 28:53.313
And so anyway, 
the closing talk on Sunday, 


28:53.313 --> 28:55.916
I decided, 
without getting his permission, 


28:55.917 --> 28:57.985
to let everyone know what was going on. 


28:57.985 --> 29:01.488
And I said: “Now you notice 
that his wife isn’t with him. 


29:01.488 --> 29:05.726
“I just wanted you to know that tomorrow 
she’s going to have a major operation, 


29:05.727 --> 29:09.464
and so we should all keep them 
in our prayers, OK?” 


29:09.463 --> 29:12.000
Then they introduced him. 
He didn’t come out. 


29:13.333 --> 29:17.238
He was back behind the stage 
and for a long time. 


29:17.238 --> 29:19.373
I didn’t know what to do, frankly. 


29:19.373 --> 29:22.010
Soon, this man comes out 


29:22.010 --> 29:24.812
very, very slowly, 


29:24.812 --> 29:28.049
and he gets to the microphone; 
his voice is cracking. 


29:28.048 --> 29:30.083
He starts talking a little bit, 


29:30.083 --> 29:33.386
and he gives his whole talk 
in this very low tone. 


29:33.387 --> 29:35.390
At the end of the program, you know, 


29:35.390 --> 29:38.927
we always have this heartwarming song. 


29:38.927 --> 29:41.362
Then he had to pray. 
He couldn’t pray. 


29:41.362 --> 29:44.599
He started crying. 


29:44.598 --> 29:48.368
Finally, after a long time, 
he said a word or two, 


29:48.368 --> 29:49.936
“In Jesus’ name, Amen.” 


29:49.937 --> 29:52.740
You know what happened next? 


29:52.740 --> 29:54.975
The circuit surrounded him. 


29:54.975 --> 29:56.878
They were hugging him. 


29:56.878 --> 29:59.180
Everybody was crying. 


29:59.180 --> 30:01.215
He told me later, he said: 


30:01.215 --> 30:04.518
“Gary, I love the brothers. 


30:04.518 --> 30:08.000
I just don’t know how to show it.” 


30:10.525 --> 30:13.427
Now if you relate to that experience, 


30:13.427 --> 30:16.999
learn how to show love.


30:16.998 --> 30:19.000
You know, what can you do? 


30:19.000 --> 30:21.368
You know, it might be a need 
to change your face. 


30:21.368 --> 30:25.640
Well, not your face, but have a softer face. 


30:25.640 --> 30:29.000
Maybe you need to soften your voice. 


30:30.245 --> 30:35.000
Maybe you need to develop 
a more inviting personality. 


30:36.583 --> 30:39.186
Do things for people; 


30:39.187 --> 30:44.259
take care of the old brothers and sisters 
in the congregations you’re going to be with. 


30:44.258 --> 30:48.061
Even if it’s not natural for you 
and you feel awkward about it, 


30:48.062 --> 30:53.067
do it anyway because in time 
it will become part of you. 


30:53.067 --> 30:57.239
Because when you walk in that front door 
of your Kingdom Hall 


30:57.238 --> 31:00.006
or the front door of your branch, 


31:00.007 --> 31:02.910
the brothers should be drawn to you, 


31:02.910 --> 31:06.280
not because of your assignment, 


31:06.280 --> 31:11.987
but because you have worked hard 
to show love. 


31:11.987 --> 31:14.089
So as you go to your assignments, 


31:14.088 --> 31:17.991
always remember that Jehovah knows 
the work you have done 


31:17.992 --> 31:20.194
and the love you have shown, 


31:20.193 --> 31:24.000
and he will never forget it.


31:37.678 --> 31:42.183
Thank you very much, Brother Breaux, 
and we’ll keep those reasons in mind 


31:42.183 --> 31:46.000
if we don’t forget. 


31:47.055 --> 31:51.092
“Who am I, O Jehovah God?” 


31:51.092 --> 31:53.527
Do you know who asked that question? 


31:53.527 --> 31:55.530
I don’t. 


31:55.530 --> 31:58.498
So let’s give our attention 
to Brother Patrick LaFranca, 


31:58.498 --> 32:01.668
a helper to the Personnel Committee 
of the Governing Body 


32:01.668 --> 32:04.038
and a member of the Branch Committee. 


32:04.038 --> 32:07.308
He will give us the answer.


32:07.308 --> 32:09.610
Gilead students, 


32:09.610 --> 32:12.980
have you ever asked yourself, 


32:12.980 --> 32:18.887
‘Who am I to have been invited 
to Gilead school?’ 


32:18.887 --> 32:21.389
That’s a good question, isn’t it? 


32:21.388 --> 32:23.625
Because very few of God’s people, 


32:23.625 --> 32:26.860
relatively speaking, have had that privilege. 


32:26.860 --> 32:29.697
So why you? 


32:29.697 --> 32:33.234
Was it because you were 
smarter or better looking 


32:33.233 --> 32:35.536
than the average servant of Jehovah? 


32:35.537 --> 32:40.542
No, it was 
because of your spiritual qualities. 


32:40.542 --> 32:45.547
And foremost among those was humility. 


32:45.547 --> 32:48.249
You have been humble. 


32:48.248 --> 32:51.885
But maintaining humility 


32:51.885 --> 32:54.588
is a definite spiritual challenge


32:54.588 --> 32:57.791
—not just for you but for all of us, really. 


32:57.792 --> 33:01.762
We’ve all inherited the tendency 
to exalt ourselves. 


33:01.762 --> 33:04.565
You think of Adam and Eve. 


33:04.565 --> 33:09.170
In the act of profound arrogance, 


33:09.170 --> 33:12.573
they wanted to put themselves in God’s place. 


33:12.573 --> 33:15.410
They seemed to forget who they were


33:15.410 --> 33:18.000
—creatures made of dust. 


33:19.147 --> 33:24.585
So we all have to fight 
against prideful tendencies. 


33:24.585 --> 33:27.322
Humility is elusive. 


33:27.322 --> 33:31.425
As soon as we think we are humble, 
we’ve lost it.


33:31.425 --> 33:34.628
However, Jehovah gives us help. 


33:34.628 --> 33:39.266
In the Bible, there are many examples 
of those who did maintain humility, 


33:39.267 --> 33:41.535
and one of these is David. 


33:41.535 --> 33:45.807
Let’s just follow David’s life a bit


33:45.807 --> 33:50.545
—different stages of his life—
and see, did he maintain humility? 


33:50.545 --> 33:54.515
Well, was he humble as a young man? 


33:54.515 --> 33:59.287
You remember how Jehovah 
directed the prophet Samuel 


33:59.287 --> 34:03.257
to go to Jesse’s house 
and annoint one of Jesse’s sons 


34:03.257 --> 34:06.160
as the future king of Israel.


34:06.160 --> 34:10.432
Well, seven of his sons were there, 


34:10.432 --> 34:13.300
but not one of them was chosen. 


34:13.300 --> 34:17.772
And finally, Samuel said,
‘Are these all your sons?’


34:17.772 --> 34:22.000
‘No, there’s David out in the fields 
shepherding the sheep.’ 


34:23.010 --> 34:25.178
So they called David, 


34:25.178 --> 34:28.950
and Samuel anoints this young man 


34:28.950 --> 34:31.000
to be the future king of Israel. 


34:33.453 --> 34:39.000
David must have been surprised 
at this singular privilege that he had. 


34:40.027 --> 34:43.000
Now, did he become high-minded? 


34:44.165 --> 34:47.268
How would he have treated his brothers


34:47.268 --> 34:51.000
—his older brothers—
had he become prideful? 


34:52.140 --> 34:55.977
Well, he could have said to Eliab: 


34:55.977 --> 34:59.547
‘Well, I guess you got taken down 
a peg or two, didn’t you? 


34:59.547 --> 35:02.450
‘You better start respecting me. 


35:02.450 --> 35:05.085
‘And Abinadab, 


35:05.085 --> 35:08.923
‘isn’t it time for you to go out now 
and shepherd the sheep? 


35:08.923 --> 35:11.691
‘I have a more important assignment. 


35:11.692 --> 35:14.195
‘I have to learn to be king. 


35:14.195 --> 35:18.332
Hmm, how can I get into the king’s court?’ 


35:18.332 --> 35:23.000
No, nothing indicates 
that David felt that way about himself. 


35:24.038 --> 35:28.008
He was content to wait on Jehovah 
for future privileges.


35:28.008 --> 35:30.978
Is there a lesson here for us? 


35:30.978 --> 35:34.215
Yes, you may get future privileges, 


35:34.215 --> 35:36.383
but you may have to wait for them. 


35:36.383 --> 35:40.000
Go back to your pastures; 
shepherd the sheep. 


35:41.022 --> 35:44.425
So after some time, 
David is still in the pastures, 


35:44.425 --> 35:45.960
and what happens? 


35:45.960 --> 35:48.295
An attendant of King Saul 


35:48.295 --> 35:52.967
recommends that David serve 
in the king’s court. 


35:52.967 --> 35:55.069
Listen to this recommendation 


35:55.068 --> 35:59.000
at 1 Samuel 16:18: 


36:02.243 --> 36:04.245
“One of the attendants said: 


36:04.245 --> 36:09.250
“‘Look! I have seen
how a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite


36:09.250 --> 36:11.585
“‘plays skillfully, 


36:11.585 --> 36:14.155
“‘and he is a courageous, mighty warrior. 


36:14.155 --> 36:17.157
“‘He can speak well, and he is handsome, 


36:17.157 --> 36:20.127
and Jehovah is with him.’” 


36:20.127 --> 36:23.965
My, what an impressive recommendation! 


36:23.965 --> 36:27.768
So, humble David goes from the sheepfold 


36:27.768 --> 36:31.705
to the king’s court as a court musician. 


36:31.705 --> 36:33.540
But more privileges followed. 


36:33.540 --> 36:38.378
You’ll see in verse 21b 
that he became Saul’s armor bearer. 


36:38.378 --> 36:43.250
And later, David had many exploits in war. 


36:43.250 --> 36:45.252
He became famous. 


36:45.252 --> 36:47.922
Women sang about his victories. 


36:47.922 --> 36:51.659
So fame, good looks, 


36:51.658 --> 36:53.660
youth, eloquence, 


36:53.660 --> 36:57.197
musical skills, 
military prowess, divine favor


36:57.197 --> 36:59.500
—David had it all, didn’t he? 


36:59.500 --> 37:04.005
And any one of those things 
could have made him arrogant and prideful, 


37:04.005 --> 37:07.542
but it seems that they did not. 


37:07.542 --> 37:10.377
Note David’s reaction when King Saul 


37:10.377 --> 37:14.215
offered David his daughter in marriage. 


37:14.215 --> 37:18.000
That is at 1 Samuel 18:18: 


37:20.387 --> 37:23.190
“At this David said to Saul: 


37:23.190 --> 37:26.227
“‘Who am I and who are my relatives, 


37:26.227 --> 37:28.262
“‘my father’s family in Israel, 


37:28.262 --> 37:32.667
for me to become son-in-law to the king?’” 


37:32.667 --> 37:35.569
Yes, being related to the king 


37:35.568 --> 37:38.205
might have given David reason to boast, 


37:38.205 --> 37:43.143
but his words “who am I” resonate with us. 


37:43.143 --> 37:47.315
David felt unworthy 
of being related to the king.


37:47.315 --> 37:50.852
Is there any lesson, perhaps, in this for us? 


37:50.852 --> 37:53.454
Well, we may work with and come into contact 


37:53.453 --> 37:57.825
with prominent brothers 
in God’s organization. 


37:57.825 --> 38:02.430
In conversations with others, 
do we drop their names, 


38:02.430 --> 38:07.568
trying to make ourselves,
perhaps, seem more important?


38:07.568 --> 38:12.506
But now we come 
to another period in David’s life. 


38:12.507 --> 38:16.710
He is now the king of Israel 
with his capital in Jerusalem, 


38:16.710 --> 38:20.180
and he’s dwelling in a royal palace. 


38:20.180 --> 38:24.485
And he’s being—
He’s feeling very embarrassed 


38:24.485 --> 38:29.023
because here he is in a royal palace 
and the ark of Jehovah, 


38:29.023 --> 38:33.126
who is the real king of Israel, 
is in a tent. 


38:33.127 --> 38:37.565
And so he says to the prophet Nathan, 


38:37.565 --> 38:42.268
‘I want to build Jehovah a worthy house
—a temple.’ 


38:42.268 --> 38:45.071
But Jehovah says, 
‘No, not you, 


38:45.072 --> 38:47.442
but one of your sons will do that.’ 


38:47.442 --> 38:51.679
However, then Jehovah did something 


38:51.678 --> 38:56.350
that took David completely by surprise. 


38:56.350 --> 39:01.222
God tells him, 
‘Instead of you building me a house, 


39:01.222 --> 39:04.759
I am going to build a house for you.’ 


39:04.758 --> 39:07.361
And he makes a covenant with David 


39:07.362 --> 39:10.164
so that the kingship would remain 


39:10.163 --> 39:14.000
in the family line of David forever. 


39:15.135 --> 39:18.372
Well, how did David react? 


39:18.372 --> 39:24.000
Please open to 1 Chronicles 17:16-18: 


39:25.212 --> 39:30.184
“At that King David came in 
and sat down before Jehovah and said: 


39:30.183 --> 39:33.520
“‘Who am I, O Jehovah God? 


39:33.520 --> 39:37.792
“‘And what is my house 
that you have brought me this far? 


39:37.792 --> 39:40.294
“‘As if this were not enough, O God, 


39:40.293 --> 39:43.163
“‘you also speak 
about the house of your servant 


39:43.163 --> 39:45.665
“‘down to a distant future time, 


39:45.665 --> 39:49.137
“‘and you have looked on me 
as if I were a man 


39:49.137 --> 39:52.607
“‘who should be further exalted, 
O Jehovah God. 


39:52.607 --> 39:56.144
“‘What more can your servant David say to you 


39:56.143 --> 39:58.211
“‘about the honor given me 


39:58.212 --> 40:02.249
when you know your servant so well?’” 


40:02.248 --> 40:04.618
So this marvelous promise 


40:04.618 --> 40:08.121
that Jehovah made to David touches his heart, 


40:08.122 --> 40:12.794
and he sits before Jehovah in humility, 


40:12.793 --> 40:17.396
feeling so unworthy and insignificant. 


40:17.397 --> 40:21.569
And later, David made 
an enormous contribution 


40:21.568 --> 40:23.670
for the building of the temple 


40:23.670 --> 40:25.672
that by today’s standards 


40:25.672 --> 40:30.000
would amount to over 1,200,000,000 dollars. 


40:31.112 --> 40:34.080
But in prayer to Jehovah, he says, 


40:34.080 --> 40:37.383
as recorded at 1 Chronicles 29:14: 


40:37.383 --> 40:40.988
“And yet, who am I . . . 


40:40.988 --> 40:43.123
“For everything is from you, 


40:43.123 --> 40:48.161
and what we have given to you 
comes from your own hand.” 


40:48.162 --> 40:50.164
What a humble spirit. 


40:50.163 --> 40:52.165
And it’s true, isn’t it? 


40:52.165 --> 40:54.202
Whatever we give to Jehovah, 


40:54.202 --> 40:58.539
it’s something 
that he has already given to us. 


40:58.538 --> 41:03.110
It’s no wonder that Jehovah God loved David. 


41:03.110 --> 41:07.915
He was a man really agreeable 
to God’s own heart.


41:07.915 --> 41:12.920
How can we cultivate and maintain 
such a humble heart? 


41:12.920 --> 41:15.322
It’s not simply by saying, 


41:15.322 --> 41:17.725
“I am determined to be humble.” 


41:17.725 --> 41:21.228
No, but do as David did. 


41:21.228 --> 41:25.866
Once in a while, sit down, 
take a long look at your life, 


41:25.867 --> 41:30.504
and see what blessings, 
what undeserved kindnesses, 


41:30.503 --> 41:33.173
Jehovah has extended to you. 


41:33.173 --> 41:36.243
Ponder over his awesomeness. 


41:36.243 --> 41:40.580
And when we do so, 
we will be moved to say to Jehovah: 


41:40.580 --> 41:44.318
‘Who am I, Jehovah God, 
that you’ve honored me, 


41:44.318 --> 41:49.323
‘making me one of your fellow workers 
despite my many flaws? 


41:49.323 --> 41:51.325
‘Who am I, Jehovah, 


41:51.325 --> 41:54.295
‘that you’ve given me health and strength 


41:54.295 --> 41:57.130
‘to serve in my assignment? 


41:57.130 --> 42:01.068
‘Who am I, O God, 
to have this special privilege of service 


42:01.068 --> 42:05.238
when I know there are many more 
and more deserving than I?’ 


42:05.238 --> 42:09.210
Of course, there is a wholesome pride 


42:09.210 --> 42:12.278
in having the privilege 
of being one of God’s servants, 


42:12.278 --> 42:15.381
but it is an unhealthy pride 


42:15.382 --> 42:17.819
that makes one feel superior. 


42:17.818 --> 42:20.020
And if we are looking down on others, 


42:20.020 --> 42:23.090
we cannot be looking up at Jehovah. 


42:23.090 --> 42:27.695
And that really is the secret 
of maintaining humility


42:27.695 --> 42:30.463
—to know what we really are. 


42:30.463 --> 42:34.468
We always keep Jehovah before us 
as David did. 


42:34.468 --> 42:38.605
So students, we have every confidence 


42:38.605 --> 42:42.142
that you will keep your eyes 
on your awesome God, 


42:42.142 --> 42:45.545
and that he will use you
and he will bless you


42:45.545 --> 42:49.000
even more than he has
on this day of your graduation.


43:03.730 --> 43:07.868
Well, I don’t know about you, 
but I was enlightened 


43:07.868 --> 43:10.503
by “Who Am I, O Jehovah God?” 


43:10.503 --> 43:13.773
That was David that said that. 


43:13.773 --> 43:16.876
Well, live and learn. 


43:16.877 --> 43:18.879
Brother James Cauthon, 


43:18.878 --> 43:21.048
one of our Theocratic Schools instructors, 


43:21.048 --> 43:25.000
will speak on the theme 
“Sympathetic Strings.”


43:27.287 --> 43:30.157
Imagine that you had the means 


43:30.157 --> 43:33.394
to give everyone in your life 


43:33.393 --> 43:35.395
an expensive gift. 


43:35.395 --> 43:37.397
You know what would happen? 


43:37.397 --> 43:39.400
They would be happy. 


43:39.400 --> 43:42.870
You would be happier 
because you would experience 


43:42.870 --> 43:46.000
what Jesus said is a greater happiness
—giving. 


43:48.108 --> 43:50.978
Actually, you can give others 


43:50.978 --> 43:54.415
something that is very special


43:54.415 --> 43:58.885
—something they really need—
and it won’t cost you a cent. 


43:58.885 --> 44:00.887
What is it? 


44:00.887 --> 44:02.957
It’s your attention. 


44:02.957 --> 44:07.360
Romans 12:15, 


44:07.360 --> 44:11.298
the apostle Paul wrote this, he said: 


44:11.298 --> 44:15.735
“Rejoice with those who rejoice; 
weep with those who weep.” 


44:15.735 --> 44:20.307
We need to learn to understand 
and share another person’s feelings 


44:20.307 --> 44:22.375
whether it’s joy or sadness. 


44:22.375 --> 44:24.378
But why? 


44:24.378 --> 44:25.711
We need to understand it 


44:25.712 --> 44:29.282
because we’re living 
in “critical times hard to deal with.” 


44:29.282 --> 44:33.754
And so when the Bible says 
to “weep with those who weep,” 


44:33.753 --> 44:36.023
we can sum that up in two words: 


44:36.023 --> 44:38.058
Show sympathy.


44:38.058 --> 44:40.226
Why should we do that? 


44:40.227 --> 44:45.232
Well, going back to Romans 12, 
and this time in verse 5, 


44:45.232 --> 44:48.000
notice what we’re reminded of. 


44:49.370 --> 44:54.408
Paul wrote: “So we, although many, 
are one body in union with Christ, 


44:54.408 --> 44:59.211
but individually we are members 
belonging to one another.” 


44:59.212 --> 45:04.217
Now this, of course, was written 
with those of the new covenant in mind, 


45:04.217 --> 45:07.822
but in reality all of us as Jehovah’s people 


45:07.822 --> 45:09.957
belong to one another. 


45:09.957 --> 45:14.629
Now, you might find it interesting to know 
that in the Christian Greek Scriptures, 


45:14.628 --> 45:18.965
there are some 50 “one another” commands:


45:18.965 --> 45:22.602
Love one another, encourage one another, 


45:22.602 --> 45:27.474
incite one another, 
pray for one another, and other things.


45:27.473 --> 45:30.210
The Watchtower said this, it said:


45:30.210 --> 45:34.715
“We should be sensitive to the pains 
and heartaches of our brothers and sisters. 


45:34.715 --> 45:37.752
“Often, we can bring much relief 
to fellow believers 


45:37.752 --> 45:39.820
“who are suffering emotional pain 


45:39.820 --> 45:43.057
“if we take the time to listen to them 


45:43.057 --> 45:45.925
with a truly sympathetic ear.” 


45:45.925 --> 45:49.328
Sympathy is entering in 


45:49.328 --> 45:52.365
and sharing in the pain of others. 


45:52.365 --> 45:55.568
Now, sometimes in English we say “empathy.” 


45:55.568 --> 46:00.006
It’s also translated “fellow feeling” 
or even “feel pity.” 


46:00.007 --> 46:03.710
But it’s in times of crisis, grief, 
and doubt 


46:03.710 --> 46:06.380
when we need one another the most. 


46:06.380 --> 46:09.215
So how can we show that we care? 


46:09.215 --> 46:13.953
The answer is simple: Listen sympathetically.


46:13.953 --> 46:18.591
The effect can be likened 
to the sympathetic strings that are used 


46:18.592 --> 46:23.000
to enhance the sound and harmony 
of certain musical instruments. 


46:31.003 --> 46:36.008
Now, all of these have strings 
that are not played, 


46:36.008 --> 46:39.546
but they react 
to the strings that are struck 


46:39.547 --> 46:42.282
or plucked, if you would, 


46:42.282 --> 46:45.085
thus they become sympathetic.


46:45.085 --> 46:47.487
They produce a unique harmony. 


46:47.487 --> 46:49.490
It’s a oneness, really. 


46:49.490 --> 46:51.492
The effect of this 


46:51.492 --> 46:55.295
is something that is very special. 


46:55.295 --> 46:59.365
But now, how this actually works 
can be demonstrated with the use 


46:59.365 --> 47:03.037
of two tuning forks. 


47:03.037 --> 47:07.174
Notice the one reacts to being struck. 


47:07.173 --> 47:11.878
The second, although not being struck, 


47:11.878 --> 47:14.480
reacts to the feelings of the first. 


47:14.480 --> 47:17.583
So the first fork is no longer alone. 


47:17.583 --> 47:20.753
It has become joined by a second fork 


47:20.753 --> 47:23.923
that is now also picking up the vibrations 


47:23.923 --> 47:26.593
and is said to be sympathetic. 


47:26.593 --> 47:28.828
It’s a harmony, really. 


47:28.828 --> 47:33.100
After the loss of a loved one, 
one sister said: 


47:33.100 --> 47:35.835
“Tears became the language of my heart. 


47:35.835 --> 47:41.000
I so appreciated it when the friends 
came over and just cried with me.” 


47:42.442 --> 47:45.912
Sure, it’s a oneness
—a harmony. 


47:45.912 --> 47:47.915
She felt it. 


47:47.915 --> 47:51.585
We recognize, though, 
that there is a certain caution here 


47:51.585 --> 47:55.022
because sharing joy is one thing, 


47:55.022 --> 47:59.192
but sympathetically listening 
to another’s pain of heart 


47:59.192 --> 48:01.194
can be emotionally taxing


48:01.193 --> 48:04.000
and time-consuming.


48:07.667 --> 48:11.672
As our illustration demonstrates, 


48:11.672 --> 48:13.840
even after the original fork is removed, 


48:13.840 --> 48:17.543
the sympathetic one 
is still feeling the effects, 


48:17.543 --> 48:19.545
isn’t that right? 


48:19.545 --> 48:22.582
And that’s why, 
whether we like it or not, 


48:22.582 --> 48:25.752
our actions will reveal 
what’s really in our hearts 


48:25.752 --> 48:28.789
when it comes to our brothers and sisters.


48:28.788 --> 48:31.056
Going back to Romans again, 


48:31.057 --> 48:35.129
this time Romans 12:10,


48:35.128 --> 48:37.396
we’re reminded of this. 


48:37.397 --> 48:43.370
It says: “In brotherly love 
have tender affection for one another.” 


48:43.370 --> 48:47.840
Listening is a simple gesture of affection. 


48:47.840 --> 48:52.545
Often the problem, of course, 
is that we’re in such a hurry to fix things 


48:52.545 --> 48:55.248
that we feel that we can’t take the time 


48:55.248 --> 48:59.418
to listen to someone else 
or to sympathize with them. 


48:59.418 --> 49:03.723
Or sometimes we’re so preoccupied 
with our own hurts 


49:03.723 --> 49:06.960
that we’re caught up in that. 


49:06.960 --> 49:11.798
But self-pity will smother sympathy 
for others. 


49:11.798 --> 49:14.366
And we need to be careful, frankly, 


49:14.367 --> 49:16.704
because sometimes we feel 


49:16.703 --> 49:18.905
that we just have to solve 
the problem right away, 


49:18.905 --> 49:21.273
so we make statements 


49:21.273 --> 49:25.811
that are not helpful 
to the person that is suffering. 


49:25.812 --> 49:29.000
‘You know, you need to just toughen up.’ 


49:30.617 --> 49:33.987
Or here’s one of my favorites: 


49:33.987 --> 49:36.000
‘Others suffered, now it’s your turn.’ 


49:38.058 --> 49:44.000
Or comparisons: 
‘Well, at least you can walk.’ 


49:45.265 --> 49:49.703
Well, we don’t mean those things 
to be malicious, 


49:49.703 --> 49:51.871
but how do they come across? 


49:51.872 --> 49:55.542
You see, they come across as condescending. 


49:55.542 --> 49:59.279
And it’s another way of saying, 


49:59.278 --> 50:03.916
“I don’t care” or “I don’t care enough.” 


50:03.917 --> 50:07.287
Job tried ten times 


50:07.287 --> 50:10.324
to explain to his comforters his feelings. 


50:10.323 --> 50:13.093
And finally, after the tenth time, he said, 


50:13.093 --> 50:16.596
‘Oh, if someone would but listen to me.’ 


50:16.597 --> 50:19.232
His hurt, his pain, was enhanced 


50:19.232 --> 50:23.437
because of his companions’ failure to listen. 


50:23.437 --> 50:25.605
How sad that is. 


50:25.605 --> 50:28.208
They neither cared about Job, 


50:28.208 --> 50:32.000
nor did they want to understand his feelings. 


50:36.817 --> 50:39.000
They shut him down.


50:43.123 --> 50:45.191
Could we ever do 


50:45.192 --> 50:47.560
the same thing or something similar? 


50:47.560 --> 50:50.197
How sad that would be.


50:50.197 --> 50:55.102
To share in someone’s grief and pain, 
you must be willing to listen, 


50:55.102 --> 50:57.104
you must be willing to take the time, 


50:57.103 --> 51:00.140
and you must care more about them 
than you do yourself. 


51:00.140 --> 51:04.343
We need to learn to take ourself 
out of the equation. 


51:04.343 --> 51:07.080
Romans 12:10 continues: 


51:07.080 --> 51:10.950
“In showing honor to one another, 
take the lead.” 


51:10.950 --> 51:14.420
We honor others by being nonjudgmental, 


51:14.420 --> 51:16.523
by taking them seriously, 


51:16.523 --> 51:20.626
and by giving sincere heartfelt attention 
and consideration 


51:20.627 --> 51:23.697
to their words and their feelings. 


51:23.697 --> 51:27.667
We need to remember this point: 


51:27.667 --> 51:31.472
That is, that our relationship with God 


51:31.472 --> 51:36.000
and our relationship with our brothers 
is one and the same. 


51:37.177 --> 51:39.245
Let me repeat that. 


51:39.245 --> 51:41.347
Our relationship with God 


51:41.347 --> 51:45.552
and our relationship with our brothers 
is one and the same. 


51:45.552 --> 51:51.000
Jehovah cares deeply 
about how we interact with one another. 


51:52.158 --> 51:54.828
Jehovah wants his people to be known 


51:54.828 --> 51:58.665
for their love for one another 
more than anything else. 


51:58.665 --> 52:00.667
So your gift 


52:00.667 --> 52:02.669
of sympathetic concern 


52:02.668 --> 52:05.138
will be a powerful means of showing love 


52:05.138 --> 52:10.000
and restoring a measure of harmony 
into the lives of others.


52:29.195 --> 52:33.000
With talks like that, 
I can see why I’m not one of the instructors. 


52:34.600 --> 52:39.205
The illustration of the two forks 
just drove the point home, didn’t it? 


52:39.205 --> 52:41.508
Well, here’s another, 


52:41.508 --> 52:46.513
“The Glowing Coal” is the theme 
Brother Mark Noumair has chosen. 


52:46.513 --> 52:49.281
He’s also one 
of the Theocratic Schools instructors 


52:49.282 --> 52:53.152
and a helper to the Teaching Committee 
of the Governing Body. 


52:53.152 --> 52:58.000
Brother Noumair, 
we are burning with anticipation.


52:59.392 --> 53:02.429
On joyous occasions as today, 


53:02.428 --> 53:07.033
your love burns strong, and rightly so. 


53:07.033 --> 53:09.035
Remember this day. 


53:09.035 --> 53:13.373
Etch indelibly in your minds 
how you feel right now 


53:13.373 --> 53:17.143
because this love 
that is burning brightly within you 


53:17.143 --> 53:20.980
will be tested. 


53:20.980 --> 53:23.317
When we undergo trials, 


53:23.317 --> 53:27.054
reviewing Bible accounts 
of faithful men and women 


53:27.053 --> 53:29.421
can bolster our own faith. 


53:29.422 --> 53:34.427
And we can hear their words 
ringing in our minds. 


53:34.427 --> 53:38.499
But what about those 
who have never spoken a word 


53:38.498 --> 53:41.366
recorded in the Bible? 


53:41.367 --> 53:46.372
Can their silent examples of faith help us?


53:46.372 --> 53:48.375
Let’s consider one. 


53:48.375 --> 53:50.943
Her name is Rizpah. 


53:50.943 --> 53:53.145
We know very little about her. 


53:53.145 --> 53:56.950
She is first introduced to us 
as a concubine of King Saul. 


53:56.950 --> 54:01.955
No doubt, she must have been very beautiful 
to catch the attention of the king. 


54:01.955 --> 54:05.758
However, her life was not an easy one. 


54:05.758 --> 54:07.293
In time, 


54:07.293 --> 54:09.128
Saul
—the father of her children—


54:09.128 --> 54:10.663
is killed in battle. 


54:10.663 --> 54:14.166
She now becomes the property 
of Saul’s son, Ishbosheth. 


54:14.167 --> 54:16.535
He too is killed.


54:16.535 --> 54:20.940
Unfortunately, Rizpah’s most painful test 


54:20.940 --> 54:23.000
was yet to come. 


54:24.610 --> 54:28.147
Long after Saul’s death, 
Jehovah tells King David 


54:28.147 --> 54:31.150
that bloodguilt remains on Saul’s house 


54:31.150 --> 54:35.188
because of his attempt 
to annihilate the Gibeonites, 


54:35.188 --> 54:38.223
which violated an ancient covenant. 


54:38.223 --> 54:42.728
Thus, the entire nation of Israel is guilty 


54:42.728 --> 54:45.798
of shedding innocent blood. 


54:45.798 --> 54:48.401
How does David resolve this issue? 


54:48.402 --> 54:52.572
Second Samuel 21:3 


54:52.572 --> 54:54.940
shows what David did. 


54:54.940 --> 54:59.545
Second Samuel 21:3, 
David asks the Gibeonites: 


54:59.545 --> 55:02.015
“What should I do for you?” 


55:02.015 --> 55:04.583
Verse 6, they answer: 


55:04.583 --> 55:08.153
“Let seven of [Saul’s] sons be given to us. 


55:08.153 --> 55:11.390
We will hang their dead bodies 
before Jehovah.” 


55:11.390 --> 55:14.327
Verse 6 continues, David said: 


55:14.327 --> 55:16.329
“I will hand them over.” 


55:16.328 --> 55:18.331
Who does David hand over? 


55:18.332 --> 55:23.000
He hands over, in verse 8, 
Rizpah’s two sons, 


55:24.137 --> 55:26.505
“the two sons of Rizpah,” 


55:26.505 --> 55:29.808
the two people in the whole world 
that she loved most. 


55:29.808 --> 55:33.078
What a heartbreaking tragedy for Rizpah, 


55:33.078 --> 55:35.181
but she could do nothing about it. 


55:35.182 --> 55:39.452
The decision was made; 
it was out of her control. 


55:39.452 --> 55:42.789
Eventually, all seven men are hung. 


55:42.788 --> 55:46.760
Now, under the Mosaic Law, 
those executed upon a stake 


55:46.760 --> 55:50.397
should have been taken down 
before nightfall and buried. 


55:50.397 --> 55:54.767
Burial would have brought closure 
to this mother’s crushed soul. 


55:54.767 --> 55:56.837
And above all, it would conform 


55:56.837 --> 56:00.874
to Jehovah’s requirements 
for the dignity of life 


56:00.873 --> 56:03.710
and that proper disposal of the dead body 


56:03.710 --> 56:06.578
would have been according 
to Jehovah’s instructions. 


56:06.578 --> 56:10.983
Undoubtedly, Rizpah knows this, 


56:10.983 --> 56:13.886
but it didn’t happen that way. 


56:13.887 --> 56:17.690
So can you feel her anguish 
as night approaches 


56:17.690 --> 56:20.960
and no one comes to take those bodies down? 


56:20.960 --> 56:22.962
And Rizpah could have been thinking: 


56:22.962 --> 56:26.632
‘But the Mosaic Law, 
no one is following the Law. 


56:26.632 --> 56:28.902
It’s not right.’


56:28.902 --> 56:31.270
But there was a catch. 


56:31.270 --> 56:33.440
It seems that the Gibeonites 


56:33.440 --> 56:37.743
were allowed to follow 
a different procedure in this instance 


56:37.743 --> 56:42.748
because a national sin 
had been committed by King Saul. 


56:42.748 --> 56:44.750
Now did Rizpah know that? 


56:44.750 --> 56:46.753
We don’t know. 


56:46.753 --> 56:49.688
But what we do know, one day goes by; 


56:49.688 --> 56:51.490
the Law is not followed. 


56:51.490 --> 56:53.860
The bodies are not taken down. 


56:53.860 --> 56:58.665
Two days go by; three days go by. 


56:58.665 --> 57:00.667
What does she do? 


57:00.667 --> 57:03.035
Well, according to verse 10, 


57:03.035 --> 57:05.438
Rizpah continues day after day 


57:05.438 --> 57:08.273
in the blaze of that scorching summer sun. 


57:08.273 --> 57:11.543
In fact, verse 10 says what she did do. 


57:11.543 --> 57:14.946
It says that “she did not allow 
the birds of the heavens 


57:14.947 --> 57:17.450
“to land on [those bodies] by day 


57:17.450 --> 57:21.120
nor the wild beasts of the field 
to come near by night.” 


57:21.120 --> 57:26.125
There she was out there, day after day, 
shooing those birds away


57:26.125 --> 57:31.130
—not to draw attention to herself, 
not to get justice for her sons, no. 


57:31.130 --> 57:34.533
She understood, she appreciated, 


57:34.533 --> 57:38.000
and she upheld Jehovah’s view of human life. 


57:39.338 --> 57:43.776
She allowed Jehovah’s values 
to shape her behavior 


57:43.777 --> 57:46.814
even at great personal cost. 


57:46.813 --> 57:49.615
You must love this woman. 


57:49.615 --> 57:54.620
Although Rizpah probably didn’t understand 
exactly why things were happening this way


57:54.620 --> 57:56.923
—why was it turning out in this way—


57:56.923 --> 58:01.160
this different procedure 
of not burying her sons 


58:01.160 --> 58:05.165
had a major impact on her personal life. 


58:05.165 --> 58:09.768
Yet, her conduct showed her love for Jehovah 


58:09.768 --> 58:13.205
and the loyalty that she had 
for his arrangements


58:13.205 --> 58:17.343
—that this love and loyalty 
burned brightly within her.


58:17.343 --> 58:20.011
Here’s your big lesson. 


58:20.012 --> 58:26.452
Now, at times, you might feel 
that your life is outside of your control. 


58:26.452 --> 58:28.454
You may go through a trial 


58:28.453 --> 58:33.458
that allows Jehovah’s standards 
and decisions to shape you, 


58:33.458 --> 58:37.463
perhaps at great personal cost.


58:37.463 --> 58:42.235
For example, 
you’re familiar with theocratic procedure; 


58:42.235 --> 58:44.470
you’re familiar with theocratic policies. 


58:44.470 --> 58:46.472
We know that. 


58:46.472 --> 58:50.109
But there might come a time 
when an organizational direction


58:50.108 --> 58:52.111
—an organizational procedure—


58:52.112 --> 58:57.117
is modified for reasons 
that you are not fully aware of, 


58:57.117 --> 59:01.955
and that decision affects you personally. 


59:01.955 --> 59:03.957
What will you do? 


59:03.957 --> 59:08.294
Like Rizpah, keep doing what you can 
under your circumstances. 


59:08.293 --> 59:10.730
Shoo those birds away
—those negative thoughts. 


59:10.730 --> 59:12.298
Stir up that fire.


59:12.298 --> 59:17.000
Don’t allow your warmth and glow 
for Jehovah God to burn out.


59:18.237 --> 59:20.874
Now, days go by,


59:20.873 --> 59:24.543
according to verse 9 and verse 10: 


59:24.543 --> 59:29.048
‘from the start of the harvest to the rain.’ 


59:29.048 --> 59:32.618
Now this implies that this may have been 
five to six months 


59:32.618 --> 59:36.155
that she kept vigil over her sons’ bodies. 


59:36.155 --> 59:39.192
What could she have been thinking 
about during this time 


59:39.192 --> 59:42.195
that may have been close to half a year? 


59:42.195 --> 59:44.997
What would she have been thinking about? 


59:44.997 --> 59:48.802
‘How could David be so uncaring 
as not to command 


59:48.802 --> 59:51.404
‘to give my boys a proper burial. 


59:51.403 --> 59:53.505
‘And Jehovah,


59:53.505 --> 59:56.642
‘after all that I’ve been through,


59:56.642 --> 59:59.045
where are you, Jehovah?’


59:59.045 --> 1:00:02.115
Now these might have been 
natural thoughts, true. 


1:00:02.115 --> 1:00:04.650
Yet, if she did have them, 


1:00:04.650 --> 1:00:08.353
she did not allow these thoughts 
to put out the fire 


1:00:08.353 --> 1:00:13.491
of her love for God or to make her bitter. 


1:00:13.492 --> 1:00:15.895
Perhaps others even tried 
to discourage her saying: 


1:00:15.895 --> 1:00:18.030
‘Go home.
Give up.’


1:00:18.030 --> 1:00:20.032
But she didn’t. 


1:00:20.032 --> 1:00:24.237
Nor did she start a campaign 
by gathering others to her side. 


1:00:24.237 --> 1:00:26.905
There’s no record of her bad-mouthing David, 


1:00:26.905 --> 1:00:30.242
criticizing his decision as unfair. 


1:00:30.242 --> 1:00:33.145
Nor did she presume 
to take the bodies down herself. 


1:00:33.145 --> 1:00:36.048
‘Well, if nobody is going to do it, 
I’ll do it.’ 


1:00:36.048 --> 1:00:39.451
No, in spite of all of these difficulties


1:00:39.452 --> 1:00:42.422
—imagine—
that Rizpah was suffering, 


1:00:42.422 --> 1:00:45.290
she still had embers of love 


1:00:45.290 --> 1:00:48.127
for Jehovah God glowing brightly 


1:00:48.127 --> 1:00:51.264
that moved her to stay loyal, 


1:00:51.263 --> 1:00:53.331
remain in her place, 


1:00:53.332 --> 1:00:57.000
and wait on David to make the decision.


1:00:58.270 --> 1:01:03.142
Did her faithful endurance really matter? 


1:01:03.142 --> 1:01:07.214
Did anyone notice her plight? 


1:01:07.213 --> 1:01:09.881
Verse 11: 


1:01:09.882 --> 1:01:11.884
“David was told


1:01:11.883 --> 1:01:16.388
what Saul’s concubine Rizpah . . . had done.” 


1:01:16.388 --> 1:01:18.390
So imagine someone goes to David: 


1:01:18.390 --> 1:01:20.827
‘David, there’s this Rizpah; 
she’s up there near these bodies. 


1:01:20.827 --> 1:01:23.462
She’s shooing these birds away.’ 


1:01:23.462 --> 1:01:25.599
So, what did David do? 


1:01:25.598 --> 1:01:30.603
Did he now, finally, 
give Rizpah’s sons a decent burial? 


1:01:30.603 --> 1:01:34.740
Actually, he did more. 


1:01:34.740 --> 1:01:37.343
Verses 12 through 14 


1:01:37.343 --> 1:01:40.345
show how David had the bones of Saul 


1:01:40.345 --> 1:01:43.983
and the bones of Jonathan brought 
all the way from Jabesh-gilead


1:01:43.983 --> 1:01:47.653
—which might have taken a journey 
of about 100 miles (160 km)—


1:01:47.653 --> 1:01:51.690
and buried those bones 
with the bones of Rizpah’s sons 


1:01:51.690 --> 1:01:55.828
in Saul’s family plot in Benjamite territory. 


1:01:55.828 --> 1:02:00.000
So in the end, 
Rizpah got more than she expected. 


1:02:01.600 --> 1:02:04.537
She saw the bones of her sons 


1:02:04.537 --> 1:02:07.974
and their father buried together. 


1:02:07.973 --> 1:02:11.343
Rizpah didn’t see that coming, 


1:02:11.343 --> 1:02:14.046
but it was worth the wait.


1:02:14.047 --> 1:02:18.050
So, what’s the big lesson 
we want you to remember here? 


1:02:18.050 --> 1:02:21.087
Rizpah’s love and loyalty and endurance 


1:02:21.087 --> 1:02:24.857
provides an example worth imitating. 


1:02:24.857 --> 1:02:28.227
When you go through a trial, 


1:02:28.227 --> 1:02:31.597
remember that others 
are observing your conduct


1:02:31.597 --> 1:02:33.599
—they’re watching. 


1:02:33.598 --> 1:02:36.101
And out of frustration, you might feel: 


1:02:36.102 --> 1:02:40.105
‘Well, why haven’t, 
why haven’t the elders done anything? 


1:02:40.105 --> 1:02:43.575
‘Why aren’t the overseers 
taking care of this situation? 


1:02:43.575 --> 1:02:47.380
Jehovah, why don’t you do something?’ 


1:02:47.380 --> 1:02:51.550
And Jehovah is saying: 
‘I am doing something. 


1:02:51.550 --> 1:02:55.455
‘I’m using your silent example 


1:02:55.455 --> 1:02:58.958
‘to show others that 
when you endure a situation, 


1:02:58.958 --> 1:03:00.893
‘I will reward them.


1:03:00.893 --> 1:03:03.996
‘I’ll reward them more than 
they ever anticipated, 


1:03:03.997 --> 1:03:05.999
‘and it will be worth the wait. 


1:03:05.998 --> 1:03:11.003
Because I, Jehovah, 
I love being a rewarder.’ 


1:03:11.003 --> 1:03:17.876
What a noble and honorable way 
to be used by Jehovah God. 


1:03:17.877 --> 1:03:22.382
Now, Rizpah was not a victim 
of her circumstances. 


1:03:22.382 --> 1:03:27.000
Rather, she became a victor 
over her adversities. 


1:03:28.020 --> 1:03:31.857
The intense heat of her trials 
did not break her as a person 


1:03:31.857 --> 1:03:35.000
nor crush her desire 
to please Jehovah God. 


1:03:36.795 --> 1:03:40.098
So little is known about her, 


1:03:40.098 --> 1:03:43.568
and yet we learn so much from her. 


1:03:43.568 --> 1:03:47.873
She never had one spoken word 
recorded in the Bible, 


1:03:47.873 --> 1:03:52.745
yet Jehovah must have been very impressed 
with this remarkable woman. 


1:03:52.745 --> 1:03:57.048
Her name and example earned a place 
in his sacred Book 


1:03:57.048 --> 1:03:59.151
and is worthy of our examination. 


1:03:59.152 --> 1:04:01.154
She teaches you


1:04:01.153 --> 1:04:06.000
—she teaches you 
how to take life’s indignities with dignity. 


1:04:07.025 --> 1:04:11.230
So, what helped her endure successfully? 


1:04:11.230 --> 1:04:15.100
Perhaps a clue is in her name. 


1:04:15.100 --> 1:04:19.372
It literally means “Glowing Coal.” 


1:04:19.372 --> 1:04:22.709
Now, we don’t know why 
she was given that name, true. 


1:04:22.708 --> 1:04:25.745
But like a piece of coal 
glowing warm and bright, 


1:04:25.745 --> 1:04:30.148
Rizpah kept her thoughts focused 
on love for her sons’ loyalty to Jehovah, 


1:04:30.148 --> 1:04:32.150
loyalty to his arrangements, 


1:04:32.150 --> 1:04:36.255
confident that relief would eventually come. 


1:04:36.255 --> 1:04:38.257
She was industrious. 


1:04:38.257 --> 1:04:42.562
She actively guarded her sons’ bodies 
from being eaten by animals. 


1:04:42.562 --> 1:04:48.534
She didn’t allow negative feelings 
to shut her down and extinguish her love. 


1:04:48.533 --> 1:04:52.605
Rather, in the face of what 
she might have felt to be an injustice, 


1:04:52.605 --> 1:04:55.908
she did what she could.


1:04:55.908 --> 1:04:57.910
So, what do we want you to remember? 


1:04:57.910 --> 1:05:02.000
What do we want you to go away with 
to your assignments thinking about? 


1:05:03.082 --> 1:05:07.754
In the face of a perceived injustice, 
keep working; 


1:05:07.753 --> 1:05:10.723
keep carrying out 
your assigned work assignments; 


1:05:10.723 --> 1:05:12.258
keep doing what you can. 


1:05:12.258 --> 1:05:13.791
Shoo away those birds. 


1:05:13.792 --> 1:05:17.000
Stoke up the fire of your love 
for Jehovah God and the brothers. 


1:05:18.430 --> 1:05:22.802
And wait on Jehovah 
to resolve any pending issues, 


1:05:22.802 --> 1:05:27.674
confident that relief will come now 
or in the new world. 


1:05:27.673 --> 1:05:30.743
It will be worth that wait. 


1:05:30.743 --> 1:05:36.415
And yet, above all, above all, be a Rizpah. 


1:05:36.415 --> 1:05:38.517
Under all circumstances, 


1:05:38.517 --> 1:05:44.000
keep your love for God 
burning brightly like a glowing coal.


1:05:48.827 --> 1:05:53.832
Those talks were inspiring 
to the students of the 143rd class, 


1:05:53.832 --> 1:05:57.937
and I am sure that you feel much 
the same way after viewing them. 


1:05:57.937 --> 1:06:01.674
But you probably are wondering, 
‘What about the rest of the program?’


1:06:01.673 --> 1:06:03.475
Wonder no longer. 


1:06:03.475 --> 1:06:08.147
Part 2 and Part 3 will be posted 
on the Video on Demand section 


1:06:08.147 --> 1:06:11.017
of JW Broadcasting later this month. 


1:06:11.017 --> 1:06:15.989
In fact, Part 2 is a video entitled
The Inside Story.


1:06:15.988 --> 1:06:19.491
It is scheduled to be posted
next Monday, December 11.


1:06:19.492 --> 1:06:23.862
