For this update, we’re going to focus

00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:08.091 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on our all-important disciple-making work.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the pandemic,

00:00:11.361 --> 00:00:14.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body continues to look for ways

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make our ministry even more effective.

00:00:18.134 --> 00:00:19.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:00:19.903 --> 00:00:23.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By continuing to build on the direction

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided at the 2017 annual meeting.

00:00:27.577 --> 00:00:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that meeting, the Governing Body

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:32.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
announced organizational adjustments

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:37.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on 1 Corinthians 9:26.

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:39.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That verse says:

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:41.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, the way I am running

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:43.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is not aimlessly;

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:46.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the way I am aiming my blows is

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:49.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as not to be striking the air.”

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:53.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we make our “blows” count?

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We focus on what Acts 13:48 mentions

00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:02.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—searching for “those who [are]
rightly disposed

00:01:02.078 --> 00:01:04.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for everlasting life.”

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:07.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have we been helped to do that?

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:12.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider a few examples from the past year.

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:15.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reviewed <i>Watchtower</i>  study articles

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:19.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that focused on helping new ones
progress to baptism

00:01:19.529 --> 00:01:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that reminded us
to discontinue unproductive studies.

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:29.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 2020 regional convention program

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:33.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
devoted an entire day
to the disciple-making work

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to helping Bible students
progress to baptism.

00:01:38.214 --> 00:01:41.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who could forget Neeta and Jade?

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:46.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our November campaign
included a special effort

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:49.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide government officials
with information

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:51.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about God’s Kingdom,

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the goal of reaching even more

00:01:54.397 --> 00:01:57.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rightly disposed” ones.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And aren’t we excited
to use the new Bible study tool,

00:02:01.004 --> 00:02:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!,</i>

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which features
a more effective teaching style?

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:11.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But 2020 saw another significant effort

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make our blows count.

00:02:14.584 --> 00:02:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In June 2020,

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was announced
that all branches would evaluate

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their foreign-language
and indigenous-language pregroups,

00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:29.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
groups, and congregations.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:33.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the reason for this evaluation?

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what the Governing Body conveyed

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:38.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the elders at that time:

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:41.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In recent years,

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:46.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah’s people have responded
to the call to expand their ministry

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:51.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by learning another language
in order to reach honesthearted ones,

00:02:51.454 --> 00:02:54.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and publishers should be commended

00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:58.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for their self-sacrificing efforts
in this regard.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:01.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nevertheless,

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it has been noted that in some cases

00:03:04.567 --> 00:03:09.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“pregroups or groups
show little evidence of growth,

00:03:09.372 --> 00:03:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with few progressive Bible studies

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and few, if any, progressing to baptism.

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:20.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9:26,

00:03:20.116 --> 00:03:23.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Governing Body wants to be certain

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are making our blows count.”

00:03:28.958 --> 00:03:32.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How were these language groups

00:03:32.161 --> 00:03:34.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and congregations evaluated?

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:38.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what happened in the first century

00:03:38.735 --> 00:03:41.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Paul and his companions

00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:44.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to expand their ministry.

00:03:44.574 --> 00:03:47.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 16:6-10 explains

00:03:47.043 --> 00:03:49.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they traveled many miles

00:03:49.846 --> 00:03:54.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made concerted efforts
to preach in various territories.

00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:59.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, Jehovah, through his holy spirit,

00:03:59.856 --> 00:04:03.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directed them to the right area.

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:07.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read this at Acts 16:9:

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And during the night

00:04:08.631 --> 00:04:11.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a vision appeared to Paul

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—a Macedonian man was standing there

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“urging him and saying:

00:04:15.605 --> 00:04:19.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Step over into Macedonia and help us.’”

00:04:19.242 --> 00:04:21.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they respond?

00:04:21.244 --> 00:04:22.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 10 says:

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:25.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As soon as he had seen the vision,

00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we tried to go into Macedonia,

00:04:28.217 --> 00:04:29.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“drawing the conclusion

00:04:29.686 --> 00:04:31.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that God had summoned us

00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:34.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to declare the good news to them.”

00:04:35.425 --> 00:04:38.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they discerned Jehovah’s direction,

00:04:38.428 --> 00:04:41.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers immediately followed

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:44.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the leading of the holy spirit.

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:50.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, we follow the spirit’s lead.

00:04:50.273 --> 00:04:53.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, it’s not provided through visions

00:04:53.576 --> 00:04:57.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but through evidence in the field.

00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The recent evaluation showed

00:05:00.316 --> 00:05:03.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some foreign-language
and indigenous-language groups

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and congregations had existed for years

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:11.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet had few or no publishers

00:05:11.094 --> 00:05:13.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were dependent on the language.

00:05:15.064 --> 00:05:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other cases,
the territory was very scattered,

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:24.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so publishers and pioneers
had to travel long distances

00:05:24.574 --> 00:05:28.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find someone who could speak the language.

00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:31.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all of this effort,

00:05:31.547 --> 00:05:33.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were few Bible studies

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and few interested ones, if any,

00:05:37.353 --> 00:05:39.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who attended meetings.

00:05:40.523 --> 00:05:43.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Jehovah’s spirit telling us?

00:05:44.527 --> 00:05:49.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be better to use our efforts
in other fields.

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:55.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, such pregroups, groups,
and congregations

00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:57.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were dissolved.

00:05:58.174 --> 00:06:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you been personally impacted

00:06:01.577 --> 00:06:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by this evaluation?

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you’re not alone.

00:06:08.084 --> 00:06:11.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, as a result of the evaluation

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:14.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just 16 branch territories,

00:06:14.657 --> 00:06:17.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 4,700 elders,

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:21.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2,800 ministerial servants,

00:06:21.164 --> 00:06:24.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 11,000 regular pioneers

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been made available
to serve in other fields.

00:06:31.074 --> 00:06:33.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one time, we may have thought

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:36.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the largest increase was taking place

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in foreign-language
or indigenous-language fields.

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we’ve considered the matter
more carefully,

00:06:44.253 --> 00:06:49.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems that congregations
in the main languages of many countries

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:52.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are experiencing the largest numbers

00:06:52.195 --> 00:06:55.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of newly baptized disciples.

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you’re now returning

00:06:59.602 --> 00:07:03.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a congregation
in one of the main languages of your country,

00:07:03.906 --> 00:07:08.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember that you are needed there!

00:07:08.077 --> 00:07:10.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many congregations are struggling

00:07:10.746 --> 00:07:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cover their large territories.

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:15.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In major cities,

00:07:15.751 --> 00:07:19.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there may be millions of people to reach

00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:24.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but few publishers and pioneers available
to preach.

00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:28.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many pioneers and publishers are finding

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:33.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
progressive return visits
and Bible studies in these fields.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:37.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think of how the congregations
are being strengthened

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as so many mature ones join them!

00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:44.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More appointed brothers are now available

00:07:44.614 --> 00:07:47.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help with shepherding,

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver meeting parts,

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:52.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to assist in many other ways.

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:56.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What practical blessings are resulting

00:07:56.792 --> 00:07:59.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from this evaluation?

00:07:59.262 --> 00:08:02.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear the thoughts
of a few Branch Committee members.

00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:07.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to the wise direction

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.337 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the Governing Body,

00:08:08.337 --> 00:08:10.406 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the way we accomplish our ministry

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:11.307 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has improved.

00:08:11.307 --> 00:08:15.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More publishers, qualified pioneers,
and appointed brothers

00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:19.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be able to rapidly help
other congregations

00:08:19.015 --> 00:08:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and concentrate their efforts
in the most productive language fields

00:08:22.418 --> 00:08:25.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or fields with a greater potential.

00:08:25.988 --> 00:08:28.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This evaluation has allowed us

00:08:28.157 --> 00:08:30.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to assign graduates

00:08:30.693 --> 00:08:33.429 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers,

00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:35.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and special pioneers as well,

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:38.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to more productive territories.

00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:41.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we’re hearing is
that this has energized

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:44.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ministry of these pioneers.

00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:49.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, many of them are conducting
progressive Bible studies now.

00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:51.714 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
None of us find adjustments easy,

00:08:51.714 --> 00:08:53.616 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so it has been so encouraging

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.618 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to see how many have been willing

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:57.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to adapt to these changes,

00:08:57.153 --> 00:08:59.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in fact, embracing them.

00:08:59.288 --> 00:09:01.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one language field,

00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some brothers
were a little hesitant at first,

00:09:04.393 --> 00:09:06.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they were loyal.

00:09:06.128 --> 00:09:08.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, of course,
they went along with the changes.

00:09:08.764 --> 00:09:10.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the circuit overseer tells us

00:09:10.866 --> 00:09:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these ones have sent
so many expressions of appreciation

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thanking them for these loving adjustments.

00:09:16.939 --> 00:09:20.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many learners have informed us

00:09:20.176 --> 00:09:23.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it has greatly reduced
their stress level.

00:09:23.246 --> 00:09:26.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has allowed them now
to be in a congregation

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:30.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they can concentrate more
on a productive ministry

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:33.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take care
of their own spirituality as well.

00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:36.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s one brother
who is learning another language.

00:09:36.092 --> 00:09:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he was in a congregation,
and this changed

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from being a congregation to a group.

00:09:41.364 --> 00:09:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said, “It’s as if finally someone
has just released the pressure valve.”

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:51.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, our Branch Committee
saw Jehovah’s spirit act

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and is convinced he blessed this evaluation.

00:09:56.112 --> 00:09:58.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about our pioneers and publishers?

00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:02.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear from some who have experienced

00:10:02.184 --> 00:10:05.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these adjustments firsthand.

00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:08.524 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the congregation

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:10.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where I’m serving now in Portuguese,

00:10:10.593 --> 00:10:12.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the territory is very productive.

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:14.363 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
People are so receptive.

00:10:14.363 --> 00:10:18.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the goal of starting one Bible study
when I was in the foreign language group.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:23.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the adjustment came,
in just a few weeks I had five studies.

00:10:23.506 --> 00:10:25.107 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We would drive around for hours

00:10:25.107 --> 00:10:27.877 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
looking for just a few specific individuals.

00:10:27.877 --> 00:10:29.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now we just preach to people,

00:10:29.612 --> 00:10:31.614 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and if we find foreign-language speakers,

00:10:31.614 --> 00:10:33.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can still preach to them too.

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have more joy in my ministry because I feel
like I’m making good use of my time.

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:40.423 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, we loved being in foreign language,

00:10:40.423 --> 00:10:43.059 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but realistically it takes a lot of time.

00:10:43.059 --> 00:10:45.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve really enjoyed having more time

00:10:45.261 --> 00:10:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for our meeting parts
and discuss the points and our application.

00:10:50.032 --> 00:10:51.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a really nice blessing.

00:10:51.434 --> 00:10:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I personally have really benefited
from having the extra time

00:10:55.104 --> 00:10:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to spend on cultivating
my relationship with Jehovah.

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:01.711 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Something really, really interesting

00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:03.913 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is what one brother said from another group.

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.681 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He said: “OK,

00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“now I think I understand better
the way that Jehovah does math.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:13.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So instead of having 15 people
learn a language to help one person,

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“now just one person
needs to learn a language

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to be able to benefit
from an entire congregation

00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:22.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—100 brothers or more.”

00:11:22.531 --> 00:11:25.201 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The first concern that I think we all had

00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:28.537 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was for those who depended on the language.

00:11:28.537 --> 00:11:30.139 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But as it’s turned out

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:33.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as they’ve become part
of the congregation,

00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:36.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now they have an even bigger family
of brothers and sisters who care about them.

00:11:36.879 --> 00:11:38.414 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So in our small congregation,

00:11:38.414 --> 00:11:39.749 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the attendance to the Memorial

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:41.384 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was usually just the publishers.

00:11:41.384 --> 00:11:42.918 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, being in this new congregation,

00:11:42.918 --> 00:11:45.321 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it’s very exciting because this year

00:11:45.321 --> 00:11:48.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had almost double the amount
of the publishers

00:11:48.524 --> 00:11:50.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our congregation for the attendance.

00:11:50.626 --> 00:11:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s very encouraging to see.

00:11:52.428 --> 00:11:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel that now we are putting
our time and energy

00:11:55.765 --> 00:11:59.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into a territory that is actually productive,

00:11:59.034 --> 00:12:02.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and like 1 Corinthians 9:26 says,

00:12:02.671 --> 00:12:05.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel like we are making our “blows” count.

00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:12.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re in the same situation
as these publishers,

00:12:12.782 --> 00:12:15.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will you do now?

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:17.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul,

00:12:17.086 --> 00:12:20.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to be willing to redirect our efforts

00:12:20.222 --> 00:12:24.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on the leadings of God’s spirit.

00:12:24.126 --> 00:12:27.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning another language may be one way

00:12:27.129 --> 00:12:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can expand our ministry.

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:32.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not the only way.

00:12:34.103 --> 00:12:37.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where is the greatest need for preachers?

00:12:38.274 --> 00:12:41.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where is there evidence of growth?

00:12:41.877 --> 00:12:45.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It might be in the field
of your primary language.

00:12:46.482 --> 00:12:50.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For practical advice
on where your efforts and abilities

00:12:50.286 --> 00:12:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are most needed,

00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:54.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak to your circuit overseer

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or write to your local branch office.

00:12:58.794 --> 00:13:02.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization is on the move,

00:13:02.431 --> 00:13:05.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will not be stopped by the pandemic

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or anything else!

00:13:10.005 --> 00:13:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will this recent adjustment in priorities

00:13:13.342 --> 00:13:16.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lead to even greater increases?

00:13:16.645 --> 00:13:18.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps.

00:13:18.481 --> 00:13:20.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s too soon to say.

00:13:20.749 --> 00:13:24.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’re receiving positive reports.

00:13:24.653 --> 00:13:27.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One branch reported that they’ve had

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ten consecutive peaks
in the number of publishers.

00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:33.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And another branch said

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:37.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the number of new regular pioneers
and new Bible studies

00:13:37.766 --> 00:13:41.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 is growing at a pace never seen before.

00:13:43.472 --> 00:13:46.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body has every confidence

00:13:46.942 --> 00:13:50.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will strengthen each of you

00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:54.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can truly make our blows count.

00:13:55.518 --> 00:13:59.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love all of you very much!

00:14:00.723 --> 00:14:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.
