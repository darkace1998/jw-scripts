00:00.550 --> 00:04.220
Welcome to JW Broadcasting! 


00:04.220 --> 00:07.090
In this month’s program, 
we’ll meet a brother who preaches 


00:07.090 --> 00:09.892
in the Indian Sign Language field. 


00:09.892 --> 00:12.762
What can we learn from his view 
of the challenges he faces 


00:12.762 --> 00:15.432
in his assignment? 


00:15.432 --> 00:17.434
Jehovah’s sheep 
belong to him. 


00:17.433 --> 00:20.636
This dramatization 
shows a special way 


00:20.637 --> 00:23.374
that Jehovah uses shepherds 
in the congregation 


00:23.373 --> 00:26.041
to care for his flock. 


00:26.042 --> 00:28.779
And have you witnessed 


00:28.778 --> 00:30.780
the life-changing moment 
when someone 


00:30.780 --> 00:33.182
first learns God’s name? 


00:33.182 --> 00:38.187
We’ll see the results of this sister’s 
lifelong search to know the true God. 


00:38.187 --> 00:41.090
This and much more is ahead 


00:41.090 --> 00:43.627
on the June 2016 edition 


00:43.627 --> 00:46.000
of JW Broadcasting!


01:04.613 --> 01:08.216
Jehovah’s people have always considered 
the studying of his Word 


01:08.217 --> 01:10.887
to be an essential part of life. 


01:10.887 --> 01:15.092
God’s Law to Israel commanded 
that the king “must read from [the Law] 


01:15.092 --> 01:20.029
all the days of his life, so that he 
may learn to fear Jehovah his God.” 


01:20.028 --> 01:23.833
In the Mayan territories 
of Yucatán, Mexico, 


01:23.833 --> 01:28.771
our brothers are helping people 
learn to read God’s Word for themselves. 


01:28.772 --> 01:33.375
People’s lives change when they 
can finally read the Bible on their own 


01:33.375 --> 01:38.000
and more readily ‘learn 
to fear Jehovah their God.’


01:47.990 --> 01:52.395
One out of every six people on earth 
doesn’t know how to read. 


01:52.395 --> 01:54.397
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
around the world 


01:54.397 --> 01:58.000
have organized literacy classes 
to help such ones.


02:02.672 --> 02:05.375
I don’t like to read. 


02:05.375 --> 02:10.000
I used to sleep at the meetings.


02:14.883 --> 02:16.886
In our territory, 


02:16.887 --> 02:21.390
most people speak the Mayan language, 
but very few can read it. 


02:21.390 --> 02:24.560
On occasion I would give a talk, 
and when I would 


02:24.560 --> 02:27.563
cite a scripture, 
most of the audience would look it up. 


02:27.563 --> 02:30.900
But then I would see 
a blank stare on their faces 


02:30.900 --> 02:33.000
because they 
couldn’t read the text.


02:34.937 --> 02:37.740
I was moved 
to learn how to read 


02:37.740 --> 02:42.000
because I wanted to learn about Jehovah 
and study his Word, the Bible. 


02:43.580 --> 02:48.885
So a sister came 
to my house to teach me.


02:48.885 --> 02:52.888
Literacy classes are often conducted 
on an individual level. 


02:52.888 --> 02:56.425
After a person has had their Bible study, 
they can spend some time 


02:56.425 --> 02:59.462
to practice reading skills. 


02:59.462 --> 03:03.800
But when 
the local elders notice 


03:03.800 --> 03:06.402
that there are many 
that can benefit from this training, 


03:06.402 --> 03:09.005
they can schedule 
a larger class 


03:09.005 --> 03:11.007
at the Kingdom Hall. 


03:11.007 --> 03:14.610
The study material used 
for this purpose is the brochure 


03:14.610 --> 03:17.080
Apply Yourself to Reading and Writing. 


03:17.080 --> 03:22.000
It’s available in 30 languages 
in the Central America branch territory. 


03:23.887 --> 03:27.190
Other study materials can be used 
as well, as long as they help 


03:27.190 --> 03:31.000
the development of the students 
enrolled in the class.


03:32.295 --> 03:34.297
And we use a board 
on which we write, 


03:34.297 --> 03:37.434
for instance, words 
that are difficult to pronounce. 


03:37.433 --> 03:41.938
This helps in the reading 
of complicated words. 


03:41.938 --> 03:46.641
There are some who are, 
well, very quick learners. 


03:46.642 --> 03:49.779
On the other hand, 
others go word by word. 


03:49.778 --> 03:54.450
But as they practice, 
they start getting the hang of it.


03:54.450 --> 03:57.887
I’m good at masonry work, 


03:57.887 --> 04:01.357
but learning to read 


04:01.357 --> 04:03.359
is not easy.


04:03.358 --> 04:07.496
Reading at his age 
is a big challenge.


04:07.497 --> 04:11.700
You need to understand 
that each student learns differently. 


04:11.700 --> 04:14.000
With some, 
you need to be very patient.


04:16.405 --> 04:20.410
The first word 
I learned to write was Jehovah.


04:20.410 --> 04:22.912
“It’s like this,” I tell him. 


04:22.912 --> 04:26.049
He says, “It’s ‘cause 
you’re not being patient with me!”


04:26.048 --> 04:30.320
Having a sense of humor 
is a big help in the learning process, 


04:30.320 --> 04:33.000
so as not to focus 
on errors and mistakes.


04:34.423 --> 04:38.493
Since 1946, when records 
began being taken in Mexico, 


04:38.493 --> 04:42.931
more than 152,000 people 
have learned to read and write, 


04:42.932 --> 04:44.800
thanks to these training efforts. 


04:44.800 --> 04:46.735
The Secretary of Public Education 


04:46.735 --> 04:50.373
in the State of Mexico 
has recognized the work and the great help 


04:50.373 --> 04:54.510
these literacy classes 
have been to the local citizens. 


04:54.510 --> 04:57.113
The skills they learn 
help in their day-to-day life, 


04:57.113 --> 04:59.581
but also it helps them 
to learn more about Jehovah 


04:59.582 --> 05:02.000
and to be able to teach others.


05:03.285 --> 05:07.390
I used to have to memorize 
everything I was going to say, 


05:07.390 --> 05:09.392
but now I can read 


05:09.392 --> 05:13.000
short scriptures to people 
directly from the Bible.


05:15.297 --> 05:18.735
As the students progress 
in the class, they demonstrate 


05:18.735 --> 05:21.670
the words found 
at 1 Timothy 4:15, 


05:21.670 --> 05:24.607
which says in part 


05:24.607 --> 05:28.277
“so that your advancement 
may be plainly seen by all people.” 


05:28.277 --> 05:32.000
And these benefits 
are plainly seen in the students.


05:33.282 --> 05:35.284
My husband was an alcoholic, 


05:35.283 --> 05:38.688
he smoked, 
and he used bad language. 


05:38.688 --> 05:41.690
But he made big changes 
in his life, 


05:41.690 --> 05:45.327
and we see that this training 
has been a big help. 


05:45.327 --> 05:49.165
We really see 
these great blessings.


05:49.165 --> 05:53.970
Reading helped me 
to get baptized.


05:53.970 --> 05:58.340
Helping other people 
to improve their reading skills 


05:58.340 --> 06:00.543
makes me feel very happy. 


06:00.543 --> 06:04.313
I feel great because I see 
on their face the joy they get 


06:04.313 --> 06:08.316
from reading and understanding 
the information.


06:08.317 --> 06:11.720
Well, I’ve benefited so much. 


06:11.720 --> 06:13.155
For instance, 


06:13.155 --> 06:17.427
now we read the Bible 
together as a family. 


06:17.427 --> 06:19.695
It makes me very happy.


06:19.695 --> 06:22.298
We’re more united as a family. 


06:22.298 --> 06:25.468
Our children 
respect my husband more, 


06:25.468 --> 06:28.000
like the father he is.


06:30.440 --> 06:32.842
Now I’m a ministerial servant.


06:32.842 --> 06:36.779
When I go preaching 
door to door, 


06:36.778 --> 06:40.115
some people say, 
“I don’t know how to read.” 


06:40.115 --> 06:43.318
But then I tell them, 


06:43.318 --> 06:46.955
“I didn’t know either, 
but I learned about Jehovah. 


06:46.955 --> 06:49.000
And you can too!”


06:51.693 --> 06:56.000
If I learned to read, 
anybody can.


07:14.783 --> 07:17.120
Our theme for this month 


07:17.120 --> 07:22.125
is “Consider, Incite, and Encourage 
One Another All the More So.” 


07:22.125 --> 07:25.662
JW Broadcasting


07:25.662 --> 07:28.464
—why do we enjoy it so much? 


07:28.463 --> 07:33.135
Many of you have expressed 
how the monthly broadcast draws you closer


07:33.135 --> 07:36.272
to our brothers and sisters 
and to Jehovah’s organization. 


07:36.272 --> 07:41.277
If you’re homebound or isolated, 
you especially treasure these programs. 


07:41.277 --> 07:45.882
And yet, while we appreciate 
the advances in technology 


07:45.882 --> 07:50.285
that have made all of this possible, 
we know that your sincere desire 


07:50.285 --> 07:53.488
is to be present 
with your brothers and sisters in person 


07:53.488 --> 07:55.958
at our congregation meetings.


07:55.958 --> 08:00.161
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
around the world share this feeling. 


08:00.162 --> 08:04.167
In northern Finland, for example, 
winters are especially cold, 


08:04.167 --> 08:06.169
even by Finnish standards. 


08:06.168 --> 08:10.338
At times, temperatures plummet 
to minus 50 degrees Celsius, 


08:10.338 --> 08:13.341
or minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit! 


08:13.342 --> 08:16.879
Under those conditions, 
it’s very difficult to drive, 


08:16.878 --> 08:19.281
much less walk long distances. 


08:19.282 --> 08:22.819
Still, the brothers love 
to gather together. 


08:22.818 --> 08:24.820
How do they manage it? 


08:24.820 --> 08:28.958
In one small village, there is a brother 
who lives near the Kingdom Hall 


08:28.958 --> 08:31.093
and has a warm garage. 


08:31.093 --> 08:33.228
On meeting nights, he uses his car 


08:33.228 --> 08:36.631
to bring each family 
in the congregation to the hall. 


08:36.632 --> 08:41.437
Then he parks in his garage and runs 
the short distance back to the Kingdom Hall.


08:41.437 --> 08:46.442
When the meeting is over, he returns 
all the friends safely to their homes.


08:46.442 --> 08:50.179
In the Bible, 
gatherings for pure worship 


08:50.178 --> 08:54.716
were occasions for personal association 
with fellow believers. 


08:54.717 --> 08:58.687
Such association required travel 
to a designated place. 


08:58.687 --> 09:03.492
This involved work, 
sacrifice, even risk. 


09:03.492 --> 09:08.497
Consider what is stated 
at Exodus 34:24. 


09:08.497 --> 09:13.035
This verse has to do with the command 
that every Israelite male 


09:13.035 --> 09:17.440
should gather three times a year 
for the festivals in Jerusalem. 


09:17.440 --> 09:20.375
What would that mean 
in practical terms? 


09:20.375 --> 09:22.645
Wouldn’t the nation 
be left vulnerable to attack


09:22.645 --> 09:25.180
if no men were left 
to guard the land?


09:25.180 --> 09:27.650
And if word spread 
among the surrounding nations 


09:27.650 --> 09:30.185
that practically everyone 
congregated in Jerusalem 


09:30.185 --> 09:34.190
three times a year, 
like clockwork, year after year, 


09:34.190 --> 09:37.125
wouldn’t it be just a matter of time 
before some invading army 


09:37.125 --> 09:40.128
would come 
and pillage an Israelite city? 


09:40.128 --> 09:43.031
At Exodus 34:24, 


09:43.032 --> 09:47.304
we find 
Jehovah’s remarkable answer: 


09:47.303 --> 09:51.473
“For I will drive the nations 
away from before you, 


09:51.473 --> 09:56.145
and I will enlarge your territory, 
and nobody will desire,” 


09:56.145 --> 09:59.615
yes, even desire, “your land 


09:59.615 --> 10:03.118
“while you are going up to see 
the face of Jehovah your God 


10:03.118 --> 10:05.120
three times a year.”


10:05.120 --> 10:08.257
Jehovah kept that promise. 


10:08.257 --> 10:13.262
It’s a historical fact 
that from 1513 B.C.E. 


10:13.262 --> 10:18.300
all the way down to 66 C.E. 
no foreign nation ever came 


10:18.300 --> 10:23.105
to invade Israelite territory 
during those three annual festivals. 


10:23.105 --> 10:26.442
Jehovah placed high value 
on having his people 


10:26.442 --> 10:30.179
gather together 
in the same space. 


10:30.178 --> 10:33.315
In the Christian era, 
the apostle Paul wrote 


10:33.315 --> 10:37.587
at 1 Corinthians 14:23 
about ‘the whole congregation 


10:37.587 --> 10:40.155
coming together to one place.’


10:40.155 --> 10:44.927
Now, although modern broadcasting 
technology didn’t exist in those days, 


10:44.927 --> 10:49.932
there were other viable methods 
of communicating, such as writing letters, 


10:49.932 --> 10:54.137
that didn’t require people to be physically 
present in the same location.


10:54.137 --> 10:58.340
Still, the apostle John, 
though a capable writer, 


10:58.340 --> 11:02.043
preferred face-to-face interchange 
with fellow Christians 


11:02.043 --> 11:06.081
as he expressed 
at 2 John 12.


11:06.082 --> 11:08.084
Or consider what is stated 


11:08.083 --> 11:11.653
at Job 1:6: 


11:11.653 --> 11:16.258
“Now the day came 
when the sons of the true God 


11:16.258 --> 11:19.861
entered to take their station 
before Jehovah.”


11:19.862 --> 11:23.665
Job 2:1 speaks 
of another such day. 


11:23.665 --> 11:25.667
Just imagine! 


11:25.667 --> 11:27.670
Here Jehovah himself, 


11:27.670 --> 11:31.707
though having all conceivable methods 
of communication at his disposal, 


11:31.707 --> 11:35.779
set specific days 
for his spirit creatures in heaven 


11:35.778 --> 11:38.846
to assemble 
in his immediate presence. 


11:38.847 --> 11:43.652
Clearly, the Scriptures encourage 
regular personal association 


11:43.652 --> 11:45.654
with fellow servants of God.


11:45.653 --> 11:50.125
Virtual attendance through modern 
communication technology has value, 


11:50.125 --> 11:54.530
and we’re happy to use it, 
but it’s no substitute for being together. 


11:54.530 --> 11:56.532
And why not? 


11:56.532 --> 12:00.269
Because of what association 
with the congregation achieves. 


12:00.268 --> 12:04.473
It’s not just that we receive nutritious 
and varied spiritual food. 


12:04.473 --> 12:08.810
Meetings inform us, 
but so does JW Broadcasting. 


12:08.810 --> 12:13.282
Meetings encourage us, 
but so does JW Broadcasting. 


12:13.282 --> 12:18.020
Fellow Christians who offer comments 
and sing from the heart build us up, 


12:18.020 --> 12:22.023
and yet we can hear that also 
on JW Broadcasting. 


12:22.023 --> 12:26.028
It’s when we’re together
—all together in one place—


12:26.028 --> 12:28.830
that others can hear us 
and draw encouragement 


12:28.830 --> 12:33.468
from our heartfelt convictions, 
our smile, our handshake. 


12:33.468 --> 12:37.071
Meetings give us opportunities 
to show our brothers and sisters 


12:37.072 --> 12:41.277
that we esteem them 
as worthy of our time, 


12:41.277 --> 12:44.114
attention, and concern. 


12:44.113 --> 12:48.250
That is why we go and visit our brothers 
who are homebound or isolated 


12:48.250 --> 12:52.522
because we want to show them 
that we love them.


12:52.522 --> 12:55.925
Moreover, in a special way, 


12:55.925 --> 13:00.462
our meetings bring us 
under the influence of holy spirit. 


13:00.462 --> 13:03.399
At Revelation 2:7, 


13:03.398 --> 13:06.335
the glorified Jesus said: 


13:06.335 --> 13:09.805
“Let the one 
who has an ear hear 


13:09.805 --> 13:14.210
what the spirit says 
to the congregations.”


13:14.210 --> 13:17.980
We need that spirit 
to help us resist temptation, 


13:17.980 --> 13:21.050
to embolden and equip us 
for the ministry, 


13:21.050 --> 13:24.653
and to enable us 
to make sound decisions.


13:24.653 --> 13:28.456
Still, there’s a reason 
to attend meetings 


13:28.457 --> 13:31.394
that’s even more important 
than the pleasant company, 


13:31.393 --> 13:34.296
the peaceful atmosphere, 
the genuine refreshment, 


13:34.297 --> 13:37.365
the sense of belonging, 
the opportunities to give, 


13:37.365 --> 13:39.568
or even the fact that meetings 
are a means by which 


13:39.568 --> 13:41.770
we receive 
Jehovah’s holy spirit. 


13:41.770 --> 13:44.507
The key reason 
why we gather together 


13:44.507 --> 13:48.110
is stated at Psalm 26:12: 


13:48.110 --> 13:52.748
“My foot is standing 
on level ground; 


13:52.748 --> 13:57.753
in the great congregation, 
I will praise Jehovah.”


13:57.753 --> 14:01.656
Yes, the principal reason 
why we gather together in person 


14:01.657 --> 14:04.727
is to give Jehovah what he deserves


14:04.727 --> 14:08.730
—praise, glory, yes, worship.


14:08.730 --> 14:11.400
Our meeting attendance 
shows Jehovah 


14:11.400 --> 14:15.137
that we want to draw close 
to him and his Son. 


14:15.137 --> 14:19.542
In his abundant love, Jehovah invites 
many more to serve him and keep living. 


14:19.542 --> 14:21.544
Because he lives eternally, 


14:21.543 --> 14:25.413
Jehovah can nurture 
those relationships forever. 


14:25.413 --> 14:28.650
The Adversary can offer 
no such hope of endless life, 


14:28.650 --> 14:31.720
so he promotes selfishness, 
pride, and other negative traits 


14:31.720 --> 14:34.990
that isolate people from one another, 
even when they are in the same room, 


14:34.990 --> 14:37.458
engaged in the same activities. 


14:37.458 --> 14:41.563
In contrast, our great God 
is drawing his people 


14:41.563 --> 14:44.433
closer to himself, 
to his Son, 


14:44.433 --> 14:48.370
and to one another 
so that we “may all be one,” 


14:48.370 --> 14:52.842
as Jesus prayed 
as recorded at John 17:21.


14:52.842 --> 14:55.677
And it’s not just the act 
of converging 


14:55.677 --> 14:58.547
on the same location 
that unites us either. 


14:58.547 --> 15:02.484
Lots of people coexist in the same space 
when they go to a market, 


15:02.483 --> 15:05.853
attend a sporting event, 
or use public transportation. 


15:05.853 --> 15:09.358
Crowding of itself 
does not equate with unity. 


15:09.358 --> 15:13.361
What makes the true 
Christian congregation different? 


15:13.362 --> 15:15.697
Notice how Hebrews chapter 10, 


15:15.697 --> 15:19.369
verses 24 and 25 
answers this question. 


15:19.368 --> 15:23.305
Now here we find 
the divinely inspired standard 


15:23.305 --> 15:26.042
for all our gatherings: 


15:26.042 --> 15:30.645
“And let us 
consider one another so as to incite 


15:30.645 --> 15:35.650
“to love and fine works, 
not forsaking our meeting together, 


15:35.650 --> 15:39.187
“as some have the custom, 
but encouraging one another, 


15:39.187 --> 15:41.924
“and all the more so as you see 


15:41.923 --> 15:44.760
the day drawing near.”


15:44.760 --> 15:48.563
Now, what does it mean 
to “consider one another”? 


15:48.563 --> 15:51.900
What does it mean 
“to incite to love and fine works”? 


15:51.900 --> 15:55.903
And in what way might we 
‘encourage one another’? 


15:55.903 --> 15:59.308
The verb “consider” 
could also be rendered 


15:59.308 --> 16:02.110
“be concerned about; 
pay attention to.” 


16:02.110 --> 16:04.580
So when 
we “consider one another,” 


16:04.580 --> 16:08.117
we show interest 
that goes far beyond a brief greeting. 


16:08.117 --> 16:11.854
And when we pay careful attention 
to one another, we’re better prepared 


16:11.853 --> 16:16.791
to incite, that is, to motivate one another, 
to stir one another to action. 


16:16.792 --> 16:19.060
And how might we do this? 


16:19.060 --> 16:22.397
Not by making comparisons 
or shaming our brothers, 


16:22.397 --> 16:24.734
for that would hardly be 
“encouraging one another,” 


16:24.733 --> 16:28.270
we endeavor to lift one another’s hearts 
when we’re together. 


16:28.270 --> 16:31.407
And when we do this 
to the best of our ability, 


16:31.407 --> 16:35.077
then we can be confident 
that Jehovah’s spirit will do the rest, 


16:35.077 --> 16:38.414
and that our brothers 
will feel strengthened.


16:38.413 --> 16:40.848
It’s evident, then, 
that true worship 


16:40.848 --> 16:45.653
means participation; 
it requires a response. 


16:45.653 --> 16:50.325
Another noteworthy example of this 
is the encouragement we both give 


16:50.325 --> 16:54.162
and receive when we sing together 
with our brothers and sisters. 


16:54.162 --> 16:58.167
In ancient Israel, 
at times they had a chorus, 


16:58.167 --> 17:00.635
such as the one described 
in Nehemiah chapter 12 


17:00.635 --> 17:03.772
that we talked about 
in our midweek meeting back in February. 


17:03.772 --> 17:07.910
Much of Israel’s group singing 
was antiphonal, 


17:07.910 --> 17:12.247
that is, some of the singers 
prompted others to respond. 


17:12.247 --> 17:15.984
For instance, Psalm 106 
which begins and ends with the words 


17:15.983 --> 17:18.386
“Praise Jah!” or “Hallelujah!” 


17:18.387 --> 17:23.359
encouraged the people 
to say in response: “Amen!” 


17:23.358 --> 17:26.361
Psalm 136 was written 


17:26.362 --> 17:30.232
to allow for different choruses 
to answer one another. 


17:30.232 --> 17:33.435
Now just imagine 
responding choruses 


17:33.435 --> 17:37.005
singing these alternating lines: 


17:37.005 --> 17:40.942
“Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; 


17:40.942 --> 17:44.012
“his loyal love endures forever. 


17:44.012 --> 17:46.815
“Give thanks to the God of gods, 


17:46.815 --> 17:49.685
“for his loyal love endures forever. 


17:49.685 --> 17:52.487
“Give thanks to the Lord of lords, 


17:52.487 --> 17:55.290
for his loyal love endures forever.”


17:55.290 --> 17:58.960
And on it went for 26 verses!


17:58.960 --> 18:02.030
To this day, 
singing demonstrates 


18:02.030 --> 18:06.168
our heartfelt response 
to the goodness of Jehovah. 


18:06.168 --> 18:09.638
What a joy it is to sing 
in company with others who are moved 


18:09.638 --> 18:13.308
to pour out the depths 
of their feelings to Jehovah! 


18:13.308 --> 18:17.378
And now at our Kingdom Halls, 
we’re accompanied by orchestral renderings


18:17.378 --> 18:20.515
of many of our songs
—another reason to sing out 


18:20.515 --> 18:23.718
at our midweek
and weekend meetings.


18:23.718 --> 18:27.721
And speaking of the midweek meeting, 
how are you enjoying the new format? 


18:27.722 --> 18:31.927
More of the program is devoted 
to delving into the Bible itself. 


18:31.927 --> 18:35.330
Time spent on preparing us 
for our public ministry 


18:35.330 --> 18:40.335
focuses more than ever 
on situations we face in field service. 


18:40.335 --> 18:44.272
And the meetings move along 
at a satisfying pace.


18:44.272 --> 18:49.277
Yes, JW Broadcasting 
is a wonderful blessing, 


18:49.277 --> 18:53.282
a powerful means to talk to 
and fortify our brothers 


18:53.282 --> 18:55.950
around the world
—simultaneously. 


18:55.950 --> 19:00.022
Still, nothing can replace 
the experience 


19:00.022 --> 19:02.224
of worshipping Jehovah 
in concert 


19:02.223 --> 19:06.093
with our fellow servants of God 
at congregation meetings. 


19:06.093 --> 19:10.831
When a meeting concludes 
and we lift our heads 


19:10.832 --> 19:15.370
after the final prayer, 
we find ourselves surrounded 


19:15.370 --> 19:19.775
by others who love Jehovah 
and support his sovereignty.


19:19.775 --> 19:22.177
These important benefits 
are detailed 


19:22.177 --> 19:25.247
in the April 2016 
study article 


19:25.247 --> 19:28.117
“Why Should We Meet 
Together for Worship?” 


19:28.117 --> 19:31.854
This month, we’re studying 
that article worldwide. 


19:31.853 --> 19:35.256
Later, in October, 
we begin a special campaign 


19:35.257 --> 19:38.394
to invite the public 
to our meetings. 


19:38.393 --> 19:42.063
If you do not yet regularly associate 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses 


19:42.063 --> 19:46.735
or if you travel away 
from your congregation, use jw.org 


19:46.735 --> 19:49.003
to find a meeting you can attend. 


19:49.003 --> 19:51.973
Click: “About Us,” “Meetings,” 


19:51.973 --> 19:54.308
and “Find a Location Near You” 


19:54.308 --> 19:57.511
or simply scroll to the bottom 


19:57.512 --> 19:59.715
of any jw.org page 


19:59.715 --> 20:02.583
and click “Attend Our Meetings.” 


20:02.583 --> 20:06.621
At our meetings, 
you’ll experience what it means 


20:06.622 --> 20:11.594
to consider, incite, and ‘encourage 
one another all the more so 


20:11.593 --> 20:15.830
as we see 
the day drawing near.’


20:15.830 --> 20:19.668
We’ve discussed 
vital ways we benefit 


20:19.668 --> 20:22.836
when we come together 
for worship at Christian meetings.


20:22.837 --> 20:24.840
What many notice 


20:24.840 --> 20:28.177
when they first attend meetings 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


20:28.177 --> 20:32.047
is that they hear 
God’s name, Jehovah. 


20:32.047 --> 20:36.519
In this life story, 
Soten Yoeun relates the impact 


20:36.518 --> 20:39.120
that learning God’s name 
had on her 


20:39.120 --> 20:43.000
after surviving 
the killing fields of Cambodia.


20:45.693 --> 20:49.000
On the killing fields 
in Cambodia, 


20:50.532 --> 20:53.635
I prayed to God, 


20:53.635 --> 20:56.000
but I didn’t know his name.


21:05.847 --> 21:08.417
When I was a very young girl, 


21:08.417 --> 21:10.819
they separated our family 


21:10.818 --> 21:13.521
and they put me 
to work in the rice field 


21:13.522 --> 21:17.994
from five in the morning 
till nine in the evening.


21:17.993 --> 21:21.863
When you see 
some other children that get killed, 


21:21.863 --> 21:26.133
you really desperately cry 
for help inside. 


21:26.133 --> 21:29.136
You always think 
that you are next. 


21:29.137 --> 21:33.142
But in my heart I always believed 
that there had to be a true God 


21:33.142 --> 21:37.212
somewhere, somehow 
that can help me get through this.


21:37.212 --> 21:42.000
One year later, 
my family decided to escape Cambodia. 


21:43.918 --> 21:48.000
We walk close to six 
or seven months to Thailand. 


21:50.858 --> 21:53.000
And I have 20 brothers and sisters


21:55.530 --> 21:58.000
—only 4 of us survived.


22:01.703 --> 22:06.375
I have a blind aunt that holds 
on my shoulder all the time. 


22:06.375 --> 22:11.000
But one day, we got caught. 


22:12.013 --> 22:17.018
As they start shooting, 
I push my aunt down to the ground 


22:17.018 --> 22:20.755
and try to pretend 
that we are dead. 


22:20.755 --> 22:22.757
And when I get up, 


22:22.757 --> 22:26.000
I had no idea 
where my parent was.


22:28.097 --> 22:31.232
We spent 
many months in the jungle. 


22:31.232 --> 22:33.235
As I try to survive, 


22:33.235 --> 22:37.905
I eat whatever I can find, 
and I also help my auntie to survive. 


22:37.905 --> 22:41.308
One day when I go 
out to look for food, 


22:41.308 --> 22:44.111
I walked so far away 


22:44.112 --> 22:46.649
I couldn’t find my way back. 


22:46.648 --> 22:50.918
I start crying really hard 
underneath a tree 


22:50.918 --> 22:53.655
and look up to the sky 


22:53.655 --> 22:56.592
and pray to the true God. 


22:56.592 --> 23:00.595
I was raised as a child 
to pray to Buddhas. 


23:00.595 --> 23:02.597
But on this night 


23:02.597 --> 23:06.869
when I start praying, 
I specifically said 


23:06.868 --> 23:09.738
that I’m not praying 
to Buddha


23:09.738 --> 23:12.000
—I’m praying 
to the true God. 


23:13.575 --> 23:15.577
And I say, 


23:15.577 --> 23:18.347
“True God, 
if you are really here, 


23:18.347 --> 23:21.282
“please help me 


23:21.282 --> 23:23.585
“because I am really scared 


23:23.585 --> 23:26.000
and I’m hungry 
and I’m cold.” 


23:27.522 --> 23:32.000
After I pray, I just fall to sleep 
under the big tree.


23:34.028 --> 23:38.566
Eventually, I make it 
into the refugee camp in Thailand, 


23:38.567 --> 23:41.804
and I was reunited 
with my family. 


23:41.803 --> 23:45.740
We lived in the refugee camp 
in Thailand 


23:45.740 --> 23:50.078
for about ten years 
before we come to United States. 


23:50.078 --> 23:54.015
My searching for the true God, 
it didn’t stop there. 


23:54.015 --> 23:58.052
We tried to go 
to different churches, 


23:58.052 --> 24:00.655
but we 
didn’t understand anything.


24:00.655 --> 24:03.125
One day when I come home 
from school, 


24:03.125 --> 24:05.527
I met this gentlemen 
named Herold, 


24:05.527 --> 24:08.830
and he asked if he can talk 
to me about God. 


24:08.830 --> 24:13.368
I agree because I saw he have a Bible; 
he must be a good man. 


24:13.368 --> 24:18.373
When he talked to me, 
I tried to pay attention so hard, 


24:18.373 --> 24:22.000
but I still didn’t understand 
what he was saying.


24:23.912 --> 24:26.715
And he went very slow.


24:26.715 --> 24:29.750
And then he said, “Your name?” 
I said, “My name Soten.” 


24:29.750 --> 24:33.555
And then he said, “Your name, Soten; 
my name is Herold. 


24:33.555 --> 24:36.000
God’s name, Jehovah.”


24:37.892 --> 24:41.497
I never thought 
that God had name.


24:41.497 --> 24:45.567
And ever since that day on, 
I never forget Jehovah’s name. 


24:45.567 --> 24:48.035
It’s superglued in my heart. 


24:48.035 --> 24:50.772
He gave me his phone number. 


24:50.772 --> 24:53.675
He say he gonna ask his wife 
to stop by someday, 


24:53.675 --> 24:56.945
but then I move away 
from where I lived.


24:56.945 --> 25:00.548
Even though I didn’t do 
the truth at that time, 


25:00.548 --> 25:03.685
I always pray to Jehovah. 


25:03.685 --> 25:08.690
After I learned God’s name, 
I went back to the church. 


25:08.690 --> 25:11.092
The priest would start out 


25:11.092 --> 25:15.364
with “heavenly Father” 
but leave out Jehovah’s name. 


25:15.363 --> 25:17.598
So I raised my hand.


25:17.598 --> 25:19.266
I asked him, “Sir, 


25:19.267 --> 25:21.737
“when you pray “heavenly Father,” 
why don’t you say 


25:21.737 --> 25:23.472
“‘heavenly Father, Jehovah’?


25:23.472 --> 25:26.000
Why you not using God’s name?”


25:28.577 --> 25:32.514
And then he told me that God 
does not force me to be here, 


25:32.513 --> 25:35.316
so I’m welcomed to leave 


25:35.317 --> 25:38.320
or stay if I want. 


25:38.320 --> 25:40.322
So because I realized 


25:40.322 --> 25:43.459
that they don’t use 
Jehovah’s name, 


25:43.458 --> 25:46.000
I left and never returned.


25:48.162 --> 25:52.267
And after many years, 
I tried to call Herold, 


25:52.267 --> 25:55.670
but no one 
picked up the phone. 


25:55.670 --> 25:57.738
So I leave a message. 


25:57.738 --> 26:01.610
I was hoping 
that they remembered me. 


26:01.610 --> 26:06.000
Two weeks later, 
Herold comes to my door, 


26:07.515 --> 26:12.000
but at the time, I was working at night 
and asleep during the day. 


26:14.888 --> 26:17.000
But Herold never give up; 
he come back. 


26:19.227 --> 26:21.964
And I keep on praying 
to Jehovah, 


26:21.963 --> 26:25.633
asking for someone 
to knock on my door. 


26:25.633 --> 26:28.101
And finally, one day 


26:28.102 --> 26:31.940
I open the door, 
and when I saw him, 


26:31.940 --> 26:33.942
I almost couldn’t talk. 


26:33.942 --> 26:35.744
I was teared up. 


26:35.743 --> 26:38.280
I was so happy to see him 


26:38.280 --> 26:41.783
because this is the man 
who introduced me to Jehovah’s name.


26:41.783 --> 26:45.953
Eventually, I start 
to study with a sister, 


26:45.953 --> 26:49.123
and she helped me 
grow spiritually. 


26:49.123 --> 26:52.626
To know that you have 
a heavenly Father 


26:52.627 --> 26:55.030
that cares about you


26:55.030 --> 26:57.965
—that was 
the best feeling on earth. 


26:57.965 --> 27:02.437
It makes me want to know more about him
—want to learn more about him. 


27:02.437 --> 27:04.772
I would ask questions: 
“Did he like this? 


27:04.772 --> 27:06.775
Did he like that?” 


27:06.775 --> 27:09.000
And then when I go 
to the Kingdom Hall, 


27:11.112 --> 27:14.000
I hear Jehovah’s name 
so many times. 


27:16.217 --> 27:18.252
I feel, that’s it! 


27:18.252 --> 27:21.322
I found my place.


27:21.322 --> 27:24.125
I got baptized in 2013. 


27:24.125 --> 27:28.963
My blind aunt that I help her 
survive through the jungle, 


27:28.963 --> 27:31.766
she’s still living until today. 


27:31.767 --> 27:35.937
And now that I can get a chance 
to talk to her about Jehovah, 


27:35.937 --> 27:37.539
that was a blessing.


27:37.538 --> 27:40.541
And I can’t stress enough 


27:40.542 --> 27:42.810
how wonderful 


27:42.810 --> 27:46.080
and big privilege 
that I receive from Jehovah


27:46.080 --> 27:50.018
—just to know 
who he is and to learn 


27:50.018 --> 27:53.721
that there is true God. 


27:53.722 --> 27:56.457
He have a name, 


27:56.457 --> 27:59.000
and his name is Jehovah.


28:08.135 --> 28:10.938
Sister Yoeun 
still carries painful memories 


28:10.938 --> 28:15.410
from what she and her family suffered 
because of man’s ruthless wars. 


28:15.410 --> 28:17.945
But she now has hope 
for the future 


28:17.945 --> 28:21.548
and the comfort of knowing 
her heavenly Father, Jehovah


28:21.548 --> 28:24.485
—something we 
all share with her. 


28:24.485 --> 28:27.555
Sister Yoeun has the added joy 
of worshipping the true God 


28:27.555 --> 28:30.558
together with her husband 
and young daughter.


28:30.558 --> 28:32.893
When we’re at our meetings, 


28:32.893 --> 28:36.330
we help the congregation 
to stay close together, 


28:36.330 --> 28:40.068
part of the “one flock” 
that follows the “one shepherd.” 


28:40.068 --> 28:44.738
In the following dramatization, 
note the way in which one young man 


28:44.738 --> 28:49.000
receives Jehovah’s love 
through faithful undershepherds.


28:50.745 --> 28:53.748
I always loved music. 


28:53.748 --> 28:56.851
I got my first guitar 
when I was 15, 


28:56.852 --> 29:00.000
and since then it’s been my way 
of expressing myself.


29:01.923 --> 29:03.925
When they asked, 


29:03.925 --> 29:06.995
“Dave, do you want 
to join the band?” 


29:06.995 --> 29:09.497
I didn’t have to think twice.


29:09.497 --> 29:14.000
Making music, 
that’s all that really mattered to me. 


29:15.703 --> 29:18.271
I thought being a musician 
would make me happy.


29:18.272 --> 29:22.000
So that is the path 
I followed.


29:26.882 --> 29:31.000
Only it is not 
what I thought it to be.


29:36.792 --> 29:39.000
I work here 
during the day to pay the bills. 


29:40.728 --> 29:44.231
I thought my life 
would turn out better. 


29:44.232 --> 29:47.435
But something was missing.


29:47.435 --> 29:53.000
Instead of being happy, 
I just felt lost.


29:57.712 --> 30:00.000
Man, I’m distracted!


30:08.422 --> 30:11.000
They are friendly 
and look happy.


30:18.733 --> 30:22.403
He gave me a tract and said: 


30:22.403 --> 30:26.140
“Many people are searching 
for true happiness. 


30:26.140 --> 30:29.000
Maybe you 
are one of them.”


30:30.512 --> 30:33.000
This could help.


30:38.452 --> 30:42.090
I quickly wrote down my address 


30:42.090 --> 30:47.000
and asked whether they would mind 
passing by after I finished my shift.


30:50.932 --> 30:54.969
I was searching all right.


30:54.968 --> 30:59.000
Actually, the answers 
were in front of me all along.


31:03.978 --> 31:08.000
How come I only get it now?


31:11.585 --> 31:15.055
You see, 


31:15.055 --> 31:17.892
I was baptized. 


31:17.892 --> 31:19.000
But I never gave 
the truth a chance.


31:26.902 --> 31:30.000
Roy did come as promised. 


31:32.007 --> 31:35.000
I told him, 
“I’m a baptized brother.”


31:41.115 --> 31:44.000
He really listened to me.


31:46.653 --> 31:48.990
Then he shared Psalm 100:3:


31:48.990 --> 31:52.160
“Know that Jehovah is God. 


31:52.160 --> 31:55.930
“He is the one who made us, 
and we belong to him. 


31:55.930 --> 32:00.502
We are his people 
and the sheep of his pasture.”


32:00.502 --> 32:04.472
In the Bible, 
Jehovah is likened to a shepherd. 


32:04.472 --> 32:07.342
He knows 
every single one of his sheep, 


32:07.342 --> 32:10.000
and he knows 
when one goes missing.


32:11.878 --> 32:16.683
A lost sheep is not a lost cause; 
it still belongs to him. 


32:16.683 --> 32:18.886
And Jehovah 
doesn’t spare any efforts 


32:18.887 --> 32:22.000
in searching for it 
until he finds it.


32:27.562 --> 32:30.765
I was like one of those lost sheep. 


32:30.765 --> 32:33.000
But I still belonged 
to Jehovah, 


32:35.803 --> 32:39.000
and he has never 
forgotten about me.


32:44.378 --> 32:47.548
Roy promised 
we would keep in touch 


32:47.548 --> 32:51.000
and invited me 
to the Sunday meeting.


33:00.762 --> 33:02.930
Man, I was nervous 
that morning. 


33:02.930 --> 33:05.000
I wanted to look my best.


33:11.805 --> 33:15.443
Roy and Matthew 
were waiting for me, 


33:15.443 --> 33:18.278
giving me a warm welcome


33:18.278 --> 33:22.250
—something I’ll never forget.


33:22.250 --> 33:25.000
How I missed this! 


33:27.122 --> 33:30.725
This is indeed 
Jehovah’s congregation. 


33:30.725 --> 33:34.000
This is where I belong.


33:39.000 --> 33:44.000
The truth has never 
been so clear to me.


33:48.575 --> 33:53.000
How I enjoy the close company
of my brothers and sisters!


33:55.983 --> 33:58.986
What I enjoy most 
is helping others 


33:58.987 --> 34:02.000
to find our loving Father, 
Jehovah.


34:06.327 --> 34:11.000
With Jehovah’s help, 
I will never be lost again.


34:18.873 --> 34:21.875
The November 2015 broadcast stressed 


34:21.875 --> 34:26.813
that there is no better place to be 
than in Jehovah’s protective arms. 


34:26.813 --> 34:31.285
Those who have drifted away from Jehovah
were then, and are still now, 


34:31.285 --> 34:34.688
warmly encouraged 
to act without delay. 


34:34.688 --> 34:38.025
As we saw depicted, 
Jehovah provides shepherds 


34:38.025 --> 34:40.628
who care for his sheep 
and lovingly guide them 


34:40.628 --> 34:43.263
back into his organization.


34:43.263 --> 34:46.333
When the preaching work 
was getting started 


34:46.333 --> 34:48.735
in such countries 
as South Korea, 


34:48.735 --> 34:52.773
Jehovah often used missionaries 
to help strengthen our brothers. 


34:52.773 --> 34:55.910
In an archived interview, 
Brother Chong-il Park 


34:55.910 --> 34:59.113
describes the effect 
this had on his sacred service 


34:59.113 --> 35:03.000
and how it prepared him 
for the trials he would face.


35:05.687 --> 35:08.824
From 1939 on, 
our brothers 


35:08.823 --> 35:12.493
didn’t have any contact 
with Jehovah’s organization, 


35:12.493 --> 35:16.863
and they thought 
that no organization existed. 


35:16.863 --> 35:19.000
Then, in 1948, 


35:19.000 --> 35:22.102
a brother 
read from a newspaper 


35:22.102 --> 35:25.239
about the activity 
of Watchtower Society. 


35:25.238 --> 35:28.175
And it surprised the brothers. 


35:28.175 --> 35:31.312
So brothers wrote the Society, 
and the Society 


35:31.312 --> 35:34.715
was so happy 
hearing from Korean brothers, 


35:34.715 --> 35:36.783
and they answered 


35:36.783 --> 35:41.255
with many booklets 
in Korean. 


35:41.255 --> 35:43.992
There were 
two different reactions. 


35:43.992 --> 35:47.094
Some brothers was excited 
about preaching work. 


35:47.093 --> 35:50.598
Yet, 
another group questioned: 


35:50.598 --> 35:54.568
“Is that true organization 
of Jehovah?” 


35:54.568 --> 35:58.705
First missionary group
—Brother and Sister Steele—


35:58.705 --> 36:03.310
arrived on August 9, 1949. 


36:03.310 --> 36:05.513
All the questions 
were answered 


36:05.513 --> 36:09.116
by Brother Steele, 
and then 


36:09.117 --> 36:12.119
right away 
brothers were preaching 


36:12.118 --> 36:14.955
in unity.


36:14.955 --> 36:17.392
I began pioneering 


36:17.392 --> 36:20.862
in January 1950. 


36:20.862 --> 36:23.397
And then in March 1950, 


36:23.397 --> 36:26.967
six more missionaries 
arrived from Gilead School. 


36:26.967 --> 36:29.904
We had only one congregation 
in Seoul. 


36:29.903 --> 36:34.241
And the missionaries 
were busy for many Bible studies. 


36:34.242 --> 36:38.679
So many interested persons 
coming to the meetings. 


36:38.678 --> 36:41.081
The public talk was arranged 


36:41.082 --> 36:44.485
in school auditorium
—first time. 


36:44.485 --> 36:47.755
And there were 


36:47.755 --> 36:52.427
over 360 people attended, 


36:52.427 --> 36:57.399
whereas the publishers was 


36:57.398 --> 37:02.336
about 60.


37:02.337 --> 37:05.439
The same day, 
Korean War broke out, 


37:05.438 --> 37:09.376
and the missionaries 
had to leave 


37:09.377 --> 37:12.647
on 27th of June 


37:12.647 --> 37:15.850
to Japan. 


37:15.850 --> 37:20.655
And then our brothers 
had to take refuge 


37:20.655 --> 37:23.623
to southern part 
of Korea. 


37:23.623 --> 37:26.960
I was hiding 
in the country. 


37:26.960 --> 37:28.963
Then few days later, 


37:28.963 --> 37:32.500
the secret police 
from Communist found us. 


37:32.500 --> 37:34.535
We explained to him 


37:34.535 --> 37:38.338
as a Christian 
we cannot participate in the war, 


37:38.338 --> 37:44.000
so we had 
to hide ourselves. 


37:45.045 --> 37:49.450
And then he says: “Well, 
I do not know much about religion, 


37:49.450 --> 37:53.853
“so I better take 
one of my friends 


37:53.853 --> 37:55.890
“who knows about religion. 


37:55.890 --> 37:58.225
“So I will 
come back tomorrow. 


37:58.225 --> 38:01.362
Don’t leave from here.” 


38:01.362 --> 38:05.299
So, then, 
we waited until next day, 


38:05.298 --> 38:07.668
and he came with another. 


38:07.668 --> 38:10.938
So I started preaching 
from the Bible 


38:10.938 --> 38:15.075
about why 
this war broke out 


38:15.075 --> 38:17.077
and the many problems 
in the world 


38:17.077 --> 38:20.347
and so on, 
because the fulfillment 


38:20.347 --> 38:23.384
of Jesus’ prophecy 
in Matthew 24. 


38:23.383 --> 38:25.585
And then they say, 
“Well, thank you very much 


38:25.585 --> 38:28.522
for your preaching.” 


38:28.522 --> 38:30.659
And then say, “Goodbye.” 


38:30.658 --> 38:34.095
Then two days later, 
the latter one came 


38:34.095 --> 38:37.565
with another friend 
so that we could preach to them. 


38:37.565 --> 38:41.035
During three months 
they were staying in Seoul, 


38:41.035 --> 38:45.000
and, in fact, 
they protected us.


38:47.775 --> 38:52.847
I was picked 
by South Korean army 


38:52.847 --> 38:57.952
to serve the back support 


38:57.952 --> 39:02.457
of the military 
in front line to carry arms 


39:02.457 --> 39:04.592
to the soldiers, 


39:04.592 --> 39:08.195
which I could not accept, 


39:08.195 --> 39:11.732
so I refused it. 


39:11.732 --> 39:14.469
And then 


39:14.468 --> 39:19.040
I was beaten.


39:19.040 --> 39:21.175
And then one day 


39:21.175 --> 39:24.278
this company has to move 
to another place. 


39:24.278 --> 39:26.280
I hide myself 


39:26.280 --> 39:28.782
in behind the ceiling 


39:28.782 --> 39:32.754
so that they don’t notice 


39:32.753 --> 39:35.355
when they leave the place. 


39:35.355 --> 39:39.193
And the next morning 
when I came down, 


39:39.193 --> 39:41.995
there was nothing left. 


39:41.995 --> 39:47.000
I walked on one street, 
toward one direction, 


39:47.000 --> 39:50.738
and then I found a sign 


39:50.738 --> 39:54.006
that said 
“International Bible Students Association.” 


39:54.007 --> 39:58.512
So I stayed with the brothers 
for six months.


39:58.512 --> 40:03.117
Brother Steele 
came back from Japan 


40:03.117 --> 40:07.689
by himself to take care 
of the brothers. 


40:07.688 --> 40:11.291
In 1952, Brother Steele 
recommended me 


40:11.292 --> 40:14.095
to Gilead School. 


40:14.095 --> 40:19.100
So that I was invited 
in 22nd class. 


40:19.100 --> 40:23.270
So I took the steps 


40:23.270 --> 40:25.873
to get the passport. 


40:25.873 --> 40:30.811
And then the government find out 
that I didn’t serve in military. 


40:30.812 --> 40:35.917
They gave me draft notice 
instead of passport. 


40:35.917 --> 40:40.454
So I had to stand 
for the neutrality 


40:40.453 --> 40:44.925
instead of going to Gilead School, 
which made me to be confined 


40:44.925 --> 40:48.495
in military prison 
for two years.


40:48.495 --> 40:52.633
Then 1958, I was enrolled 


40:52.633 --> 40:57.303
in Gilead School in 32nd class. 


40:57.303 --> 40:59.840
I really appreciate 


40:59.840 --> 41:03.377
that great Gilead School training. 


41:03.377 --> 41:08.382
Since my job in the branch, 
especially in translation work


41:08.382 --> 41:12.587
—and translation work 
involves much deep knowledge—


41:12.587 --> 41:15.189
the Gilead training 


41:15.188 --> 41:18.458
has certainly helped 
in translation work.


41:18.458 --> 41:21.028
The real appreciation 


41:21.028 --> 41:24.565
about the truth 
and the organization, 


41:24.565 --> 41:29.570
the brothers’ qualities, 
the humbleness and meekness, 


41:29.570 --> 41:33.340
certainly it helped me 


41:33.340 --> 41:35.408
to follow the examples 


41:35.408 --> 41:39.000
to apply 
in the full-time service.


41:43.817 --> 41:47.287
Did you note what Brother Park 
said he appreciated most 


41:47.287 --> 41:51.225
even after enduring persecution 
and prison for his faith? 


41:51.225 --> 41:54.160
It was the Christlike qualities 
of his brothers 


41:54.160 --> 41:58.032
and the training he received 
from Jehovah’s organization


41:58.032 --> 42:02.704
—another example of the benefits 
that result from our meeting together. 


42:02.703 --> 42:06.573
If you’d like to find more ways 
to imitate Brother Park’s faith, 


42:06.573 --> 42:09.310
you can read his life story 
beginning on page 12 


42:09.310 --> 42:13.247
of the December 2008 issue 
of Awake!


42:13.247 --> 42:15.917
Like many older ones 
before them, 


42:15.917 --> 42:19.454
younger brothers and sisters 
are taking on challenging assignments 


42:19.453 --> 42:22.556
that bring them 
rich spiritual rewards. 


42:22.557 --> 42:27.360
We go next to India to hear 
from Brother Francis Rodrigues. 


42:27.360 --> 42:31.032
He’s using his training 
from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers 


42:31.032 --> 42:35.000
to teach people 
in the Indian Sign Language field.


46:07.180 --> 46:11.585
Brother Rodrigues searches for those 
rightly disposed for everlasting life 


46:11.585 --> 46:15.255
wherever he can find them 
despite the obstacles. 


46:15.255 --> 46:18.925
And you may have noted 
that his joy comes from directing people 


46:18.925 --> 46:23.063
to the congregation to be part 
of our true spiritual brotherhood. 


46:23.063 --> 46:27.666
That example is repeated millions 
of times over through the diligent efforts 


46:27.667 --> 46:31.272
of publishers and pioneers 
around the world. 


46:31.272 --> 46:34.875
Why not examine your ministry 
to find ways to help 


46:34.875 --> 46:38.945
yet more people to build 
a good relationship with Jehovah?


46:38.945 --> 46:42.282
As we’ve seen 
just in this program, 


46:42.282 --> 46:46.220
examples of faith 
come in a variety of forms. 


46:46.220 --> 46:50.623
In the April 2016 program, 
we saw the first two installments 


46:50.623 --> 46:54.260
in the series 
“Viewpoints on the Origin of Life.” 


46:54.260 --> 46:59.265
We’ll now enjoy two more examples of those
whose backgrounds in scientific study 


46:59.265 --> 47:04.000
enabled them to cultivate 
strong faith in the Creator.


47:08.675 --> 47:11.545
My name 
is Rocío Picado Herrero. 


47:11.545 --> 47:16.817
I studied chemistry 
at the University of Salamanca, in Spain. 


47:16.817 --> 47:20.087
I specialize in organic chemistry. 


47:20.087 --> 47:23.690
This field focuses 
on the study of the carbon atom 


47:23.690 --> 47:27.000
and all the compounds 
that are derived from this atom.


47:28.895 --> 47:32.365
I believed that life 
came about through evolution. 


47:32.365 --> 47:35.435
I remember seeing a picture 
in a natural science book 


47:35.435 --> 47:38.772
that depicted the embryos 
of different vertebrates, 


47:38.772 --> 47:43.610
and in the early stages of development, 
the similarities were outstanding. 


47:43.610 --> 47:46.780
But when I started studying 
at the university, 


47:46.780 --> 47:49.182
I began studying 
in detail the process 


47:49.182 --> 47:51.985
on which 
the evolution theory is based. 


47:51.985 --> 47:55.388
To my surprise, 
I discovered that these processes 


47:55.388 --> 47:57.723
were not proven facts. 


47:57.723 --> 47:59.793
As a chemist, I’m fascinated 


47:59.793 --> 48:02.930
by the distribution 
of atoms within a molecule.


48:02.930 --> 48:06.333
In living creatures, 
the 20 amino acids 


48:06.333 --> 48:09.068
that are vital 
for the synthesis of life, 


48:09.068 --> 48:12.138
the basic proteins 
required for life, 


48:12.138 --> 48:16.810
interestingly, 
are all levorotatory or left-handed.


48:16.810 --> 48:20.413
So when a ray 
of polarized light arrives, 


48:20.413 --> 48:24.416
these amino acids 
divert the light toward the left. 


48:24.417 --> 48:29.089
There is no explanation for this 
because the logical thing would be 


48:29.088 --> 48:33.026
that if this were a random process, 
half would be right-handed 


48:33.027 --> 48:36.000
and the other half 
would be left-handed.


48:40.600 --> 48:45.572
I asked myself, ‘How could evolution 
produce compounds that are levorotatory


48:45.572 --> 48:48.000
and precisely the ones 
essential for life?’


48:53.147 --> 48:56.884
In the end, I had to conclude 
that there must be a force, 


48:56.883 --> 49:00.320
a Designer, a Creator of life 
and of the elements 


49:00.320 --> 49:03.023
and the amino acids 
required for life.


49:03.023 --> 49:05.525
Even though 
I had a religious upbringing, 


49:05.525 --> 49:09.462
my ideas were not clear 
as to who God was. 


49:09.462 --> 49:12.532
I merely viewed him 
as a Supreme Being 


49:12.532 --> 49:15.000
before whom 
we would be held accountable.


49:16.803 --> 49:18.971
The Bible 
is not a science textbook. 


49:18.972 --> 49:22.142
Its purpose is not to describe 
the universe we live in 


49:22.142 --> 49:24.645
or the laws 
that regulate our universe. 


49:24.645 --> 49:27.413
But when it does mention science, 


49:27.413 --> 49:31.351
and when it discusses scientific matters, 
it does so with great accuracy. 


49:31.352 --> 49:35.355
And undoubtedly the greatest benefit 
is that it allows me to enjoy 


49:35.355 --> 49:38.592
a personal relationship 
with the Creator of the universe


49:38.592 --> 49:42.000
—a universe that fascinates me 
from a scientific perspective.


49:46.533 --> 49:48.535
My name is Davey Loos. 


49:48.535 --> 49:51.905
I studied biochemistry 
at the University of Leuven in Belgium, 


49:51.905 --> 49:55.608
and after that time 
I did a PhD in the same area.


49:55.608 --> 49:59.445
When I was a young child, 
I believed in the Bible. 


49:59.445 --> 50:03.717
But growing up, 
I kind of lost my interest in it. 


50:03.717 --> 50:06.620
When you go to university 
and you study life sciences 


50:06.620 --> 50:08.922
or biochemistry, for example,


50:08.922 --> 50:12.625
you get introduced into the idea 
of the origin of life very quickly 


50:12.625 --> 50:14.627
and also into the principle 
of evolution.


50:14.627 --> 50:17.297
The professors 
who taught these courses, 


50:17.297 --> 50:19.767
they were really scientists 
with long careers, 


50:19.767 --> 50:23.970
and they were well-established scientists, 
and we had a lot of respect for them. 


50:23.970 --> 50:28.000
So there was just no way to really question
the principle of evolution.


50:29.743 --> 50:33.746
In 1999, there was a war 
in Europe—in Kosovo—


50:33.747 --> 50:36.950
and I remember reading 
in the Bible as a child 


50:36.950 --> 50:41.755
about the future events 
that would take place, 


50:41.755 --> 50:45.525
and I started wondering whether the war 
in Kosovo was one of those events. 


50:45.525 --> 50:48.000
So that lead me 
to pick up the Bible again.


50:49.462 --> 50:53.700
At the time, I felt that I had to reexamine 
my beliefs about the origin of life 


50:53.700 --> 50:57.000
and also about the principle 
of evolution.


50:58.705 --> 51:01.708
Based on the theory of evolution, 
we would expect to see 


51:01.708 --> 51:05.878
an abundance of transitional forms 
to be present in the fossil record. 


51:05.878 --> 51:09.181
But when we do look at the fossil evidence,
we just don’t see that. 


51:09.182 --> 51:11.685
We see that the major species 


51:11.685 --> 51:14.187
come into existence 
at specific times, 


51:14.187 --> 51:16.957
and their form and structure 
is still exactly the same


51:16.957 --> 51:19.125
as their form 
and structure today.


51:19.125 --> 51:23.630
It was actually Darwin himself 
who wrote in his book 


51:23.630 --> 51:27.700
that the biggest objection 
that could be brought against this theory 


51:27.700 --> 51:30.870
would be the fact 
that the fossil record 


51:30.870 --> 51:34.808
does not show an abundance 
of transitional forms. 


51:34.808 --> 51:39.045
And that’s what really happens 
if you look at the set of data


51:39.045 --> 51:43.817
—the fossil record seems to prove 
the opposite of evolution.


51:43.817 --> 51:48.222
As a biochemist, 
I had the opportunity to learn about 


51:48.222 --> 51:50.890
and study 
many different biomolecules. 


51:50.890 --> 51:54.393
And I observed 
that pretty much every biomolecule 


51:54.393 --> 51:56.563
is really a complex molecule. 


51:56.563 --> 52:00.900
We can look at them 
as nanoscale molecular motors 


52:00.900 --> 52:05.000
or machines that are performing 
very complex and specific tasks.


52:06.372 --> 52:11.210
For me, the complexity that we see in nature
and the complexity in those molecules 


52:11.210 --> 52:15.282
points to the fact 
that there really is a Creator.


52:15.282 --> 52:17.950
Did you see common ground 
that could help you 


52:17.950 --> 52:21.722
in your next discussion 
with someone who believes in evolution? 


52:21.722 --> 52:24.790
When Sister Picado Herrero’s 
chemistry research 


52:24.790 --> 52:26.793
showed evidence of design,


52:26.793 --> 52:31.063
she called to mind her view of God 
from her religious upbringing. 


52:31.063 --> 52:33.666
The person you meet 
who believes in evolution 


52:33.667 --> 52:37.337
might also have unanswered questions 
about God from their upbringing, 


52:37.337 --> 52:40.207
and they may respond 
to the simple evidences


52:40.207 --> 52:42.642
of a Creator 
that you present. 


52:42.642 --> 52:45.579
Brother Loos 
was moved by world events 


52:45.578 --> 52:48.981
to pick up the Bible 
and reexamine his beliefs.


52:48.982 --> 52:52.652
Everyone we meet, 
even firm believers in evolution, 


52:52.652 --> 52:57.657
are affected by world conditions 
and may listen to our message of hope. 


52:57.657 --> 53:00.794
So when someone says 
that he believes in evolution, 


53:00.793 --> 53:03.996
don’t be quick to assume 
that he’ll reject the good news. 


53:03.997 --> 53:08.735
Really, our ministry 
and other aspects of life often improve 


53:08.735 --> 53:11.538
when we slow down, 
take our time, 


53:11.538 --> 53:14.140
and as our music video admonishes: 


53:14.140 --> 53:18.000
“Don’t Run Fast.”


53:24.217 --> 53:32.792
You can walk, but please don’t run.
It’s hard to do when you’re having fun.


53:32.792 --> 53:38.865
But there’s a reason we don’t race;
When you’re with the friends,


53:38.865 --> 53:42.902
It’s not the time or place.


53:42.902 --> 53:58.319
Don’t run so fast.
Take your time and make things last.


53:58.318 --> 54:10.263
Learn to love the things you do.
Just don’t run fast.


54:10.263 --> 54:19.505
You’ve got things you have to do,
People to serve, who depend on you.


54:19.505 --> 54:25.878
But don’t forget why you’re here;
Learn to love the friends;


54:25.878 --> 54:29.748
Let them know you care.


54:29.748 --> 54:44.330
Don’t run so fast.
Take your time and make things last.


54:44.330 --> 54:57.010
Learn to love the things you do.
Just don’t run fast.


54:57.010 --> 55:04.850
You can run to someone’s door.
Is there someone home?


55:04.850 --> 55:10.757
Well, you’re not real sure.
But look around and see everyone,


55:10.757 --> 55:17.430
People walking by. Can you talk to one?


55:17.430 --> 55:32.778
Don’t run so fast.
Take your time and make things last.


55:32.778 --> 55:45.258
Learn to love the things you do.
Just don’t run fast.


55:45.258 --> 55:53.000
Oh. Just don’t run fast!


55:57.470 --> 56:01.607
Of course, we shouldn’t run 
at all in the Kingdom Hall. 


56:01.607 --> 56:05.079
But in a figurative sense, 
this counsel, not to run fast, 


56:05.078 --> 56:07.480
applies to more 
than just our young ones. 


56:07.480 --> 56:12.018
As we saw, even when we’re busy 
with important theocratic work, 


56:12.018 --> 56:16.021
we can still take the time 
to consider, incite, 


56:16.022 --> 56:18.157
and encourage our brothers. 


56:18.157 --> 56:21.160
And rather than rushing 
through our field service, 


56:21.160 --> 56:24.497
we want to imitate 
Jesus’ focus on finding people 


56:24.497 --> 56:26.565
and reaching hearts. 


56:26.565 --> 56:29.835
Jehovah reaches our hearts 
in ever so many ways, 


56:29.835 --> 56:32.905
such as when we attend 
our spiritual gatherings. 


56:32.905 --> 56:35.575
By now, some of you 
have already attended 


56:35.575 --> 56:39.978
the 2016 “Remain Loyal to Jehovah!” 
regional convention. 


56:39.978 --> 56:43.716
But millions of us still have 
an exciting three days ahead 


56:43.717 --> 56:46.319
with 47 well-prepared talks, 


56:46.318 --> 56:49.055
18 songs that we’ll 
sing to Jehovah, 


56:49.055 --> 56:52.392
and more than 50 audio 
and video presentations, 


56:52.392 --> 56:55.162
including 2 feature-length dramas.


56:55.162 --> 56:58.565
All of these program parts 
have been prepared to help us 


56:58.565 --> 57:02.968
remain loyal to God 
despite serious challenges. 


57:02.968 --> 57:05.738
For instance, 
how can we maintain our loyalty 


57:05.738 --> 57:08.340
when under stress or temptation? 


57:08.340 --> 57:11.143
What did Jehovah 
personally teach Job 


57:11.143 --> 57:13.145
that can strengthen 
our loyalty? 


57:13.145 --> 57:16.883
And why does the Bible say 
that Jehovah’s loyal love 


57:16.883 --> 57:19.951
is more precious than life itself? 


57:19.952 --> 57:22.722
To find out more 
of what you can expect, 


57:22.722 --> 57:25.125
review the full convention program, 


57:25.125 --> 57:28.327
which can be downloaded 
from jw.org. 


57:28.327 --> 57:30.464
You won’t want to miss any part 


57:30.463 --> 57:34.333
of the “Remain Loyal to Jehovah!” 
convention program!


57:34.333 --> 57:37.536
As we close, 
we bring you greetings 


57:37.537 --> 57:41.207
from the Las Perlas-Ngäbere 
congregation in Panama. 


57:41.207 --> 57:44.110
The Volcán region 
is the highest point in the country, 


57:44.110 --> 57:48.013
enjoying a cool climate 
for growing coffee 


57:48.013 --> 57:50.081
and a variety of vegetables. 


57:50.082 --> 57:52.819
The busy harvest work 
from October to December 


57:52.818 --> 57:55.086
brings large numbers 


57:55.087 --> 57:58.090
of Ngäbere-speaking people 
to the area. 


57:58.090 --> 58:01.560
Their kind nature gives our brothers 
excellent opportunities 


58:01.560 --> 58:03.630
to teach them 
about God’s Kingdom. 


58:03.630 --> 58:05.632
Local brothers and sisters 


58:05.632 --> 58:10.304
provide regular support 
to the Ngäbere Remote Translation Office. 


58:10.303 --> 58:12.705
And some are making the effort 


58:12.705 --> 58:16.000
to learn the language to assist 
in the congregation’s spiritual harvest. 


58:20.447 --> 58:23.382
We send them 
our warm Christian love 


58:23.382 --> 58:28.387
and greetings in return and pray for them 
to continue in their zealous spirit. 


58:28.387 --> 58:32.725
We thank you and hope 
you’ve enjoyed our program. 


58:32.725 --> 58:35.828
This is JW Broadcasting 


58:35.828 --> 58:49.393
from Brooklyn, New York!
