00:00.917 --> 00:03.787
Welcome to the program, 
brothers and sisters!


00:03.787 --> 00:06.890
During the next hour, 
you will hear the story of a brother 


00:06.890 --> 00:09.658
who previously protected 
the president of a country. 


00:09.658 --> 00:14.163
But seeing the love among God’s people 
made him refocus his life 


00:14.163 --> 00:18.901
to bearing witness 
about the Sovereign of the universe.


00:18.902 --> 00:21.070
We cherish our international brotherhood. 


00:21.070 --> 00:24.340
Our brothers and sisters 
in the former Soviet Union took great risks 


00:24.340 --> 00:27.743
during the Cold War to convey their love 


00:27.743 --> 00:31.546
to fellow Witnesses 
on the other side of the globe.


00:31.547 --> 00:35.452
Does our love for Jehovah motivate us 
to avoid living a double life? 


00:35.452 --> 00:39.589
This dramatization 
will remind us of key principles 


00:39.588 --> 00:43.860
to protect us when we are tempted 
to draw closer to Satan’s world.


00:43.860 --> 00:48.000
This is the July program 
of JW Broadcasting!


01:06.182 --> 01:08.752
In the book 
Insight on the Scriptures, 


01:08.752 --> 01:10.787
under the heading “Christian,” 


01:10.787 --> 01:13.055
it makes clear that claiming to be Christian 


01:13.055 --> 01:15.125
requires more than simply 


01:15.125 --> 01:17.127
a mere confession of faith. 


01:17.127 --> 01:19.995
It is more than 
being a nominal Christian


01:19.995 --> 01:22.165
—a Christian in name only.


01:22.165 --> 01:24.633
For example, 
according to the Bible, 


01:24.633 --> 01:26.836
it is necessary that belief 


01:26.837 --> 01:30.407
be demonstrated by works, 
not just words. 


01:30.407 --> 01:33.009
And since we were born 
as sinners, 


01:33.008 --> 01:36.245
those who become Christians 
need to repent, 


01:36.245 --> 01:40.117
to turn around, 
to dedicate their lives to Jehovah, 


01:40.117 --> 01:42.152
to worship and serve him, 


01:42.152 --> 01:45.489
and then to submit 
to water baptism. 


01:45.488 --> 01:48.658
They must keep themselves 
clean from fornication, 


01:48.658 --> 01:52.161
from idolatry, 
and from consuming blood. 


01:52.162 --> 01:55.365
They are to strip off 
the old personality, 


01:55.365 --> 01:59.468
including such things 
as fits of anger, obscene talk, 


01:59.468 --> 02:02.805
lying, stealing, drunkenness, 


02:02.805 --> 02:07.710
and as Galatians chapter 5 says: 
“things like these.” 


02:07.710 --> 02:12.382
Yes, they are to bring their lives 
into accord with Bible principles. 


02:12.382 --> 02:15.152
Christians are to be 
kind and considerate, 


02:15.152 --> 02:17.154
mild-tempered and patient, 


02:17.153 --> 02:20.156
and are to exercise self-control. 


02:20.157 --> 02:22.525
They provide 
and care for their own 


02:22.525 --> 02:25.662
and love 
their neighbor as themselves. 


02:25.662 --> 02:28.464
That’s a lot, isn’t it? 


02:28.463 --> 02:32.401
It’s not a matter 
of just glibly saying, 


02:32.402 --> 02:34.404
“I am a Christian.”


02:34.403 --> 02:37.740
But despite all of those 
impressive characteristics 


02:37.740 --> 02:39.908
that we just enumerated, 


02:39.908 --> 02:42.011
what did Jesus say 


02:42.012 --> 02:44.914
the main identifying quality 


02:44.913 --> 02:47.316
of a true Christian would be? 


02:47.317 --> 02:51.487
Most of you know the answer to that, 
but let’s read it again 


02:51.487 --> 02:56.860
from John 13:34, 35. 


02:56.860 --> 03:00.363
It says: “I am giving you 
a new commandment, 


03:00.363 --> 03:04.133
“that you love one another; 
just as I have loved you, 


03:04.133 --> 03:07.003
“you also love one another. 


03:07.003 --> 03:10.540
“By this all will know 
that you are my disciples


03:10.540 --> 03:15.512
—if you have love among yourselves.”


03:15.512 --> 03:18.014
Those are the theme verses 


03:18.013 --> 03:20.383
for my discussion 
with you this month. 


03:20.383 --> 03:22.385
The topic is: 


03:22.385 --> 03:26.923
“Love—The Identifying Mark 
of a Disciple of Jesus.”


03:26.923 --> 03:30.393
Did you notice 
in verse 34 that Jesus said 


03:30.393 --> 03:35.398
that he was giving them 
at that time a “new commandment”? 


03:35.398 --> 03:39.135
But it sounds like 
a very old commandment, doesn’t it? 


03:39.135 --> 03:41.437
Why, over 1,500 years 


03:41.437 --> 03:44.640
before Jesus said 
the words we just read, 


03:44.640 --> 03:46.910
the Law given to Moses said: 


03:46.910 --> 03:51.180
“You must love 
your fellow man as yourself.”


03:51.180 --> 03:53.382
—Leviticus 19:18.


03:53.382 --> 03:57.087
So, what was “new” 
about Jesus’ command 


03:57.087 --> 03:59.422
in John chapter 13? 


03:59.422 --> 04:03.960
He said that true Christians 
were to love each other 


04:03.960 --> 04:07.363
“just as I have loved you.” 


04:07.363 --> 04:09.965
That is what was different. 


04:09.965 --> 04:12.035
That was new, 


04:12.035 --> 04:15.705
not just love the other person 
as you love yourself, 


04:15.705 --> 04:18.373
but love him just like 


04:18.373 --> 04:21.210
Jesus loved His followers.


04:21.210 --> 04:24.380
Well, what kind of love 
would that be? 


04:24.380 --> 04:28.417
Self-sacrificing love
—and usually we think 


04:28.417 --> 04:30.620
of Jesus’ ultimate sacrifice, 


04:30.620 --> 04:33.022
his willingly giving his life 


04:33.022 --> 04:37.627
so that we might have the hope 
of everlasting life. 


04:37.627 --> 04:41.430
But when you think about it, 
that aspect of Jesus’ love 


04:41.430 --> 04:45.335
was exemplified 
in a self-sacrificing death! 


04:45.335 --> 04:47.970
Now, it is true, 
that as a Christian, 


04:47.970 --> 04:52.675
we might at some time have to give 
our life for a fellow Christian. 


04:52.675 --> 04:54.843
But we hope 
it doesn’t come to that.


04:54.843 --> 04:59.515
So instead of talking 
about a self-sacrificing death, 


04:59.515 --> 05:03.720
we want to discuss 
showing this new kind of love 


05:03.720 --> 05:07.790
as evidenced 
in a self-sacrificing life, 


05:07.790 --> 05:10.927
not necessarily our death. 


05:10.927 --> 05:15.799
You see, Jesus’ life
—his three-and-a-half-year ministry—


05:15.798 --> 05:20.336
was a self-sacrificing life 
of loving others.


05:20.337 --> 05:24.174
In addition to doing good 


05:24.173 --> 05:26.475
when something requires it, 


05:26.475 --> 05:28.477
a true follower of Jesus 


05:28.477 --> 05:31.447
is to take 
the initiative to help others 


05:31.447 --> 05:33.817
spiritually and otherwise. 


05:33.817 --> 05:37.020
He is to work actively 
for their good. 


05:37.020 --> 05:40.222
The preaching and teaching 
of the good news to others


05:40.222 --> 05:43.760
—some of whom may even be hostile—


05:43.760 --> 05:48.330
is one of the greatest expressions 
of love, for it can result 


05:48.330 --> 05:51.233
in everlasting life 
to the recipients. 


05:51.233 --> 05:53.703
However, 
according to Paul’s words 


05:53.703 --> 05:57.340
at 1 Thessalonians 2:8, 


05:57.340 --> 06:02.078
a true Christian must 
‘impart not only the good news of God 


06:02.078 --> 06:05.881
but also his very self’ 


06:05.882 --> 06:08.985
in helping those who 
accept the good news. 


06:08.985 --> 06:11.987
It’s that kind of love 


06:11.987 --> 06:16.092
that Jesus said would be 
an identifying mark of his disciples, 


06:16.092 --> 06:19.195
not specifically that his followers 


06:19.195 --> 06:22.765
would all be dying for each other, 


06:22.765 --> 06:27.770
but more so that they 
would all be living for each other. 


06:27.770 --> 06:30.305
Yes, displaying self-sacrificing love 


06:30.305 --> 06:33.675
for one another 
every day of their lives.


06:33.675 --> 06:36.712
The four Gospels 
are a treasure trove 


06:36.712 --> 06:39.615
of Jesus’ self-sacrificing love. 


06:39.615 --> 06:42.752
And yet, 
they do not cover his actions 


06:42.752 --> 06:45.722
every day of his life 
as the Christ. 


06:45.722 --> 06:48.390
His three-and-a-half-year ministry 


06:48.390 --> 06:53.162
amounts to nearly 
1,300 days of life and love. 


06:53.162 --> 06:57.032
The written record 
of Jesus’ life is admittedly brief, 


06:57.032 --> 07:00.704
but it is grand indeed! 


07:00.703 --> 07:04.473
However, the reality 
of observing Jesus every day 


07:04.473 --> 07:08.543
must have been far grander 
than what we have in print. 


07:08.543 --> 07:10.813
What we have in print 
might be likened 


07:10.813 --> 07:14.016
to a photo album 
of Jesus’ life, 


07:14.017 --> 07:16.252
some snapshots. 


07:16.252 --> 07:20.857
By comparison, 
what his apostles experienced 


07:20.857 --> 07:23.960
with Jesus day after day 


07:23.960 --> 07:28.663
was like a continuous video 
of his example of love. 


07:28.663 --> 07:33.201
No wonder that, 
at John 21:25, 


07:33.202 --> 07:35.204
the apostle said: 


07:35.203 --> 07:37.473
“There are also . . . 


07:37.473 --> 07:40.208
“many other things that Jesus did, 


07:40.208 --> 07:44.046
“which if ever they were written 
in full detail, 


07:44.047 --> 07:46.449
“I suppose the world itself 


07:46.448 --> 07:49.000
could not contain the scrolls written.”


07:50.352 --> 07:55.357
It said there were 
‘many other things Jesus did,’ 


07:55.357 --> 07:58.694
not many other things 
that he said, 


07:58.693 --> 08:03.098
but that he did, 
yes, deeds or acts 


08:03.098 --> 08:06.768
demonstrating 
his self-sacrificing life of love! 


08:06.768 --> 08:10.305
We already mentioned 
the all-important preaching work 


08:10.305 --> 08:13.075
as being an act 
of love on our part. 


08:13.075 --> 08:15.512
But how else 
do we manifest 


08:15.512 --> 08:19.349
the most obvious trait 
of a genuine Christian


08:19.348 --> 08:23.551
—love like Jesus had?


08:23.552 --> 08:27.122
Let’s start by thinking 
of the elders in the congregation. 


08:27.122 --> 08:30.594
At Philippians 2:17, 


08:30.593 --> 08:34.130
Paul said that he 
had ‘poured himself out 


08:34.130 --> 08:37.400
to the congregation 
like a drink offering.’ 


08:37.400 --> 08:39.402
What did that mean? 


08:39.402 --> 08:42.205
It meant that he 
drained himself out, 


08:42.205 --> 08:44.507
both physically and emotionally, 


08:44.507 --> 08:47.042
to support the Philippians.


08:47.042 --> 08:49.079
Many of the elders 
in our congregations 


08:49.078 --> 08:51.480
have the same self-sacrificing love 


08:51.480 --> 08:53.615
for those under their care. 


08:53.615 --> 08:56.352
They give of their time 
to shepherd 


08:56.352 --> 08:58.520
and readjust those in need. 


08:58.520 --> 09:00.823
They take the lead 
in the ministry. 


09:00.823 --> 09:02.858
They respond when there is 


09:02.858 --> 09:04.860
a serious health issue or tragedy. 


09:04.860 --> 09:09.498
They pour themselves out for the friends, 
thus identifying themselves 


09:09.498 --> 09:12.000
as disciples of Christ.


09:12.000 --> 09:15.403
But we do not have 
to be an elder 


09:15.403 --> 09:18.173
to provide a word 
of encouragement, do we? 


09:18.173 --> 09:22.245
If we all keep focused 
on others in the congregation, 


09:22.245 --> 09:24.247
not just ourselves, 


09:24.247 --> 09:27.717
we will know 
who needs to be bolstered 


09:27.717 --> 09:31.520
because of trials 
or circumstances that they face. 


09:31.520 --> 09:36.525
Giving in this way 
is evidence of Christlike love. 


09:36.525 --> 09:40.295
You may be thinking, 
‘But I’m just a little old sister 


09:40.295 --> 09:42.598
‘who finds it hard to squeeze out 


09:42.598 --> 09:45.166
a word of encouragement to others.’ 


09:45.167 --> 09:48.737
Perhaps you don’t have 
to say anything, 


09:48.737 --> 09:51.140
just be there 


09:51.140 --> 09:54.143
at the meetings 
or in the service. 


09:54.143 --> 09:57.446
When others see your face, 
they are encouraged. 


09:57.447 --> 10:02.452
Follow along 
as I read Acts 28:15. 


10:02.452 --> 10:05.955
It reads: 
“From there the brothers, 


10:05.955 --> 10:08.123
“when they heard the news about us, 


10:08.123 --> 10:11.193
“came as far 
as the Marketplace of Appius 


10:11.193 --> 10:13.528
“and Three Taverns to meet us. 


10:13.528 --> 10:17.300
“On catching sight of them, 


10:17.300 --> 10:19.368
“Paul thanked God 


10:19.368 --> 10:22.638
and took courage.”


10:22.638 --> 10:25.006
Paul “took courage” 


10:25.007 --> 10:29.412
just by seeing the brothers 
who came out to meet him. 


10:29.412 --> 10:31.714
You encourage your brothers 


10:31.713 --> 10:34.983
and sisters by your presence. 


10:34.983 --> 10:36.985
Please follow along as I read 


10:36.985 --> 10:41.123
Philippians 2:1-4. 


10:41.123 --> 10:45.393
Paul here describes it 
as “encouragement in Christ.” 


10:45.393 --> 10:47.261
He says: 


10:47.262 --> 10:51.400
“If, then, there is 
any encouragement in Christ, 


10:51.400 --> 10:54.637
“if any consolation of love, 


10:54.637 --> 10:57.072
“if any spiritual fellowship, 


10:57.072 --> 11:00.509
“if any tender affection 
and compassion, 


11:00.508 --> 11:03.011
“make my joy full by being 


11:03.012 --> 11:07.350
“of the same mind 
and having the same love, 


11:07.350 --> 11:11.787
“being completely united, 
having the one thought in mind. 


11:11.787 --> 11:15.590
“Do nothing out of contentiousness 
or out of egotism, 


11:15.590 --> 11:17.660
“but with humility 


11:17.660 --> 11:21.430
“consider others superior to you, 


11:21.430 --> 11:25.067
“as you look out not only 
for your own interests, 


11:25.067 --> 11:29.205
but also for the interests of others.”


11:29.205 --> 11:32.708
Did you notice 
the self-sacrificing aspect 


11:32.708 --> 11:34.976
of this love and encouragement? 


11:34.977 --> 11:38.747
Yes, he talked about having love, 
but then he said, 


11:38.747 --> 11:43.585
“not . . . for your own interests, 
but . . . for the interests of others.” 


11:43.585 --> 11:47.155
That type of love
—in the interests of others—


11:47.155 --> 11:51.527
is the identifying mark 
of true Christians.


11:51.527 --> 11:54.330
What about visiting 
the sick in your congregation 


11:54.330 --> 11:56.898
or those who are housebound? 


11:56.898 --> 12:01.403
Sometimes these dear ones are 
“out of sight, out of mind.” 


12:01.403 --> 12:05.741
We visit with those we see 
when at the Kingdom Hall, 


12:05.742 --> 12:10.079
but do we think about those 
who are shut-ins? 


12:10.078 --> 12:14.816
What was a major part 
of Jesus’ loving acts when on earth? 


12:14.817 --> 12:18.020
There are numerous accounts 
of Jesus and his apostles 


12:18.020 --> 12:20.022
healing the sick. 


12:20.022 --> 12:23.425
It’s true that we 
cannot heal the sick, 


12:23.425 --> 12:28.430
but it is in our power 
to visit the sick. 


12:28.430 --> 12:31.433
And what a healing 
that is to their spirit! 


12:31.433 --> 12:33.435
It means so much when 


12:33.435 --> 12:37.038
they are not just prayed for 
at a meeting, 


12:37.038 --> 12:40.976
but when those words of prayer 
are backed up 


12:40.977 --> 12:44.880
with an act of love
—a visit to them in person. 


12:44.880 --> 12:49.452
That is Christlike love in action. 


12:49.452 --> 12:54.190
Why not scroll down the list 
of those in your service group 


12:54.190 --> 12:56.692
with the thought in mind 
of checking on those 


12:56.692 --> 12:59.629
who have been missing 
from the meetings? 


12:59.628 --> 13:01.830
Do they need a meal? 


13:01.830 --> 13:04.267
Do they need some help 


13:04.267 --> 13:06.269
perhaps around the house? 


13:06.268 --> 13:09.605
Do they need transportation 
to the doctor? 


13:09.605 --> 13:14.610
Can we allow our love 
to expand to fill their needs?


13:14.610 --> 13:16.712
Contributing to the worldwide work, 


13:16.712 --> 13:19.715
which cares for the needs 
of our brothers around the world, 


13:19.715 --> 13:21.883
is another act of love. 


13:21.883 --> 13:26.888
It demonstrates that we are 
a true disciple of Christ. 


13:26.888 --> 13:30.591
Related to that, many of you have, 
at your own expense, 


13:30.592 --> 13:33.429
traveled to far-flung places 


13:33.428 --> 13:37.265
to help rebuild 
after a natural disaster has struck. 


13:37.265 --> 13:41.737
The overwhelming response 
from the victims is evidence 


13:41.737 --> 13:46.075
of your self-sacrificing life 
and love for your brothers.


13:46.075 --> 13:49.043
It is hoped 
that the reminder of Jesus 


13:49.043 --> 13:53.781
at John 13:34, 35 
will be good for all of us, 


13:53.782 --> 13:56.019
not just for this month, 


13:56.018 --> 13:59.655
but for our whole course of life. 


13:59.655 --> 14:03.525
You know, about one third 
of the world’s population 


14:03.525 --> 14:05.527
claims to be Christian. 


14:05.527 --> 14:09.532
But how many of them 
show self-sacrificing love 


14:09.532 --> 14:12.300
outside of their immediate family? 


14:12.300 --> 14:15.938
Most are like a baseball team 
in a uniform. 


14:15.938 --> 14:18.306
They think having the word “Christian” 


14:18.307 --> 14:21.410
emblazoned across the front 
of their uniform 


14:21.410 --> 14:23.845
is all that is required. 


14:23.845 --> 14:27.583
However, most of them 
simply “sit on the bench,” 


14:27.583 --> 14:30.251
or on a pew in church, 


14:30.252 --> 14:33.989
and many do not even attend 
“the game.” 


14:33.988 --> 14:37.391
They do not live 
the life of a Christian. 


14:37.392 --> 14:41.497
Jesus made clear 
that being a true disciple of his 


14:41.497 --> 14:44.600
is not merely 
“wearing a uniform,” 


14:44.600 --> 14:47.368
simply claiming to be 
his follower. 


14:47.368 --> 14:49.571
No, it involves 


14:49.572 --> 14:53.342
actively demonstrating 
works of love, 


14:53.342 --> 14:55.945
“swinging hard for the team,” 


14:55.945 --> 15:00.182
imitating the all-time greatest examples 
of love, 


15:00.182 --> 15:03.585
Jehovah God and his Son, 
Jesus Christ. 


15:03.585 --> 15:07.923
As Paul said 
at 2 Corinthians 8:8, 


15:07.923 --> 15:12.928
we need “to test 
the genuineness of [our] love.” 


15:12.928 --> 15:15.863
Yes, we need to daily prove 


15:15.863 --> 15:19.868
that we are 
a genuine disciple of Jesus.


15:19.868 --> 15:24.005
Brother Reinmueller will now 
share some examples of how 


15:24.005 --> 15:26.242
the Bible principles 
we just discussed 


15:26.242 --> 15:28.477
have helped people 
around the world. 


15:28.477 --> 15:29.379
Alex.


15:29.378 --> 15:32.280
Thank you, Brother Herd, 
for that warm encouragement. 


15:32.280 --> 15:34.283
We’re more motivated than ever 


15:34.283 --> 15:36.818
to prove our love for Jehovah and others.


15:36.818 --> 15:40.021
We recently met Mamuka Tektumanashvili, 


15:40.022 --> 15:41.657
from the country of Georgia. 


15:41.657 --> 15:46.595
He was a high-ranking officer 
in the special forces there for many years. 


15:46.595 --> 15:50.332
What made him realize 
that defending his country 


15:50.332 --> 15:53.669
is not the highest honor 
a man can have in his life? 


15:53.668 --> 15:56.000
This is his story.


16:18.593 --> 16:21.396
For 18 years 
I served in a special unit 


16:21.397 --> 16:23.932
responsible 
for presidential security. 


16:23.932 --> 16:27.269
This mission 
demanded total self-sacrifice. 


16:27.268 --> 16:29.605
For example, 
the first and the last vehicles 


16:29.605 --> 16:32.273
of the presidential escort 
belonged to this unit. 


16:32.273 --> 16:34.543
So if an attack 
occurred on the president, 


16:34.543 --> 16:37.000
we were the first ones 
to be hit with the fire.


16:43.385 --> 16:45.953
For the last ten years 
of service, I worked 


16:45.953 --> 16:47.956
as an instructor 
and trained new staff 


16:47.957 --> 16:50.425
to provide 
presidential security in the future. 


16:50.425 --> 16:53.295
Those working in this field 
must be fearless. 


16:53.295 --> 16:55.297
They must be professionals, 


16:55.297 --> 16:58.000
and that is what I taught 
to succeeding generations.


17:03.038 --> 17:05.306
I just loved my job. 


17:05.307 --> 17:07.642
I was a fervent patriot. 


17:07.642 --> 17:10.945
I had a special regard 
for the flag of my country. 


17:10.945 --> 17:13.000
In one bag, 
I always had weapons and the flag. 


17:16.285 --> 17:18.353
Patriotism 
was so deep-rooted in me 


17:18.353 --> 17:20.355
that I would beat up a person 


17:20.355 --> 17:23.000
simply because he was 
of another nationality.


17:25.060 --> 17:27.062
I always thought 
that God would never allow


17:27.062 --> 17:30.065
people like me 
to draw close to him. 


17:30.065 --> 17:33.768
One day, Jehovah’s Witnesses came 
and preached to my wife and me. 


17:33.768 --> 17:35.836
We were so interested 
in the truth that my wife


17:35.837 --> 17:38.440
even expressed 
a desire to study the Bible. 


17:38.440 --> 17:41.710
Because there were rumors 
circulating about Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


17:41.710 --> 17:45.647
I decided first to make sure that everything
was decent at their meetings


17:45.647 --> 17:48.984
and only then allow my wife 
to associate with them. 


17:48.983 --> 17:50.985
After the meeting, 
I was absolutely thrilled. 


17:50.985 --> 17:54.990
Everyone was well-mannered, 
with friendly, smiling faces. 


17:54.990 --> 17:59.060
I realized that there was nothing there 
to threaten my wife’s well-being. 


17:59.060 --> 18:03.265
On the contrary, their association 
would be beneficial for her.


18:03.265 --> 18:07.002
Soon my wife 
and our eldest daughter got baptized. 


18:07.002 --> 18:10.539
As for me, I enjoyed associating 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


18:10.538 --> 18:13.275
Later, I also started 
to study the Bible. 


18:13.275 --> 18:16.678
I knew that I had to make 
drastic changes in my life, 


18:16.678 --> 18:19.000
but my job 
prevented me from doing so. 


18:20.615 --> 18:23.085
Moreover, I felt 
that door-to-door preaching 


18:23.085 --> 18:26.288
was far more difficult 
than engaging in combat. 


18:26.288 --> 18:31.000
I respected Jehovah’s Witnesses 
for their courage and strength.


18:32.760 --> 18:35.763
Little by little, 
I too was changing for the better. 


18:35.763 --> 18:40.000
I wanted to quit my job and inform 
my colleagues about my religious beliefs. 


18:42.703 --> 18:46.040
So I wrote down all the Bible verses 
I had recently learned 


18:46.040 --> 18:49.000
and then pinned them 
on the wall in my office.


18:50.745 --> 18:53.082
I also started to think 
about how to make a living 


18:53.082 --> 18:56.385
after leaving my job 
and decided to learn a trade. 


18:56.385 --> 18:59.153
I started to buy tools 
in order to be ready 


18:59.153 --> 19:01.423
to take care of my family. 


19:01.423 --> 19:04.000
I realized that the time 
had come to make a decision. 


19:06.828 --> 19:08.930
The day I quit my job 


19:08.930 --> 19:11.000
was one of the happiest days 
of my life. 


19:12.233 --> 19:15.170
Since then, I’ve been able 
to dedicate every minute of my life 


19:15.170 --> 19:17.840
to Jehovah 
with a clean conscience. 


19:17.840 --> 19:20.000
In a few months, I got baptized.


19:21.243 --> 19:24.445
In the beginning, 
we were hardly making a living. 


19:24.445 --> 19:27.248
However, this taught me 
to trust in Jehovah. 


19:27.248 --> 19:31.353
I tried my best to keep 
service to Jehovah in first place. 


19:31.353 --> 19:33.555
I deeply appreciate 
the support of my brothers 


19:33.555 --> 19:36.000
and sisters 
and association with them.


19:48.403 --> 19:51.038
Before, I used to carry out 
the orders of men


19:51.038 --> 19:53.508
—some of which 
I carried out reluctantly. 


19:53.508 --> 19:55.510
But now I am happy to carry out 


19:55.510 --> 19:57.980
an assignment from Jehovah 
with the same spirit 


19:57.980 --> 20:00.448
that the prophet Isaiah had, 
who said: 


20:00.448 --> 20:02.816
“Here I am! Send me!”


20:02.817 --> 20:06.555
As a family, we decided to move 
where the need was greater, 


20:06.555 --> 20:10.000
and this has united 
our family even more.


20:11.993 --> 20:13.028
This is the bag 


20:13.028 --> 20:15.230
in which 
I always carried weapons, 


20:15.230 --> 20:19.167
but now they are replaced 
with a Bible and Bible literature. 


20:19.167 --> 20:21.169
In the past, I thought 


20:21.168 --> 20:23.171
I could never preach 
from door to door. 


20:23.172 --> 20:25.274
But now I can say with conviction 


20:25.273 --> 20:28.410
that the words of Jesus 
have proved true in my case: 


20:28.410 --> 20:31.000
“All things are possible with God.”


20:37.552 --> 20:40.689
Brother Tektumanashvili 
now serves as an elder, 


20:40.688 --> 20:45.126
and he has also been 
a regular pioneer since 2014.


20:45.127 --> 20:49.264
While Brother Tektumanashvili 
served the government for many years, 


20:49.263 --> 20:52.233
there are those who live 
on the other side of the law. 


20:52.233 --> 20:56.405
How does Jehovah’s unprejudiced love 
reach out to them? 


20:56.405 --> 20:58.540
Join us as we travel 


20:58.540 --> 21:01.677
to the Democratic Republic of Congo 
in Africa, 


21:01.677 --> 21:05.014
where our brothers make 
special efforts to reach people 


21:05.013 --> 21:10.000
we would not normally 
find from door to door.


21:13.522 --> 21:18.000
I could say that my past 
was really an unhappy past. 


21:19.193 --> 21:22.000
I went through very difficult times 
during my childhood. 


21:23.665 --> 21:25.667
I lost hope 


21:25.667 --> 21:29.404
that I could ever have 
a better life. 


21:29.403 --> 21:31.406
Because of that, 


21:31.407 --> 21:35.000
I started to associate 
with the wrong people in my life. 


21:37.078 --> 21:41.350
One night, I was arrested 
and sent to Buluo Prison. 


21:41.350 --> 21:45.000
It is a high-security prison 
in Congo.


21:50.292 --> 21:53.129
Prison is a very dangerous place. 


21:53.128 --> 21:56.565
But I was surprised how they 
accepted the truth so easily. 


21:56.565 --> 21:59.267
Really, I was amazed.


21:59.267 --> 22:02.070
We needed to obtain permission 


22:02.070 --> 22:04.372
to be able to continue 
to preach in the prison. 


22:04.372 --> 22:08.000
We had so enjoyed 
the preaching work there. 


22:11.278 --> 22:14.783
I went to see the authorities in the city 
to find out what was required 


22:14.783 --> 22:18.000
so that we could have permission 
to preach in the prison. 


22:20.322 --> 22:24.125
To my great amazement, 
they simply handed me a paper 


22:24.125 --> 22:27.095
and told me to put 
my request in writing. 


22:27.095 --> 22:29.097
They asked me to wait. 


22:29.097 --> 22:32.067
Within minutes, 
I had the authorization 


22:32.067 --> 22:35.104
in my hands 
without paying anything at all. 


22:35.103 --> 22:37.271
Every time the situation 


22:37.272 --> 22:39.574
seemed insurmountable to us, 


22:39.573 --> 22:41.643
impossible to us, 


22:41.643 --> 22:43.645
we saw the hand of Jehovah 


22:43.645 --> 22:46.000
providing us 
with the suitable solution.


22:49.250 --> 22:52.087
The authorization gave a great boost 


22:52.087 --> 22:54.689
to this special witnessing initiative. 


22:54.688 --> 22:58.560
In harmony with 1 Corinthians 9:22, 23, 


22:58.560 --> 23:02.830
the brothers could then 
‘become all things to people of all sorts, 


23:02.830 --> 23:07.035
so that they might 
by all possible means save some.’


23:07.035 --> 23:11.105
Some religious leaders 
who were also prisoners 


23:11.105 --> 23:14.342
were extremely opposed 
to our presence. 


23:14.342 --> 23:18.000
They conspired and had us 
thrown out of our meeting place.


23:20.315 --> 23:24.418
The prisoners themselves 
were concerned about this. 


23:24.418 --> 23:29.000
They found another meeting place 
even more spacious than the former.


23:35.030 --> 23:39.100
Since Buluo is eight kilometers 
away from our congregation, 


23:39.100 --> 23:42.270
to transport the group who support 
the preaching work and meetings, 


23:42.270 --> 23:44.672
the body of elders organized two minibuses 


23:44.672 --> 23:47.000
to go out every Saturday to Buluo. 


23:49.477 --> 23:53.047
Once they arrive, 
they begin the preaching work at 8:30, 


23:53.047 --> 23:55.717
and at 10 o’clock 
the meetings start. 


23:55.717 --> 23:59.000
All the meetings of the week 
are held on the Saturday.


24:02.990 --> 24:07.162
Concerning Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
personally, I am very impressed. 


24:07.162 --> 24:10.965
It’s more than three years they’ve been 
more active in helping the detainees. 


24:10.965 --> 24:14.970
The reeducation of the prisoners 
is assured by Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


24:14.970 --> 24:18.640
This is a good collaboration 
on the part of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


24:18.640 --> 24:22.000
With this I’m very happy.


24:29.650 --> 24:31.820
One hundred 
and seventy-five attended 


24:31.820 --> 24:34.222
the circuit assembly 
in December 2014, 


24:34.222 --> 24:38.194
which was held in the prison, 
and seven were baptized. 


24:38.193 --> 24:42.000
Local media covered the event.


24:44.265 --> 24:47.502
This is the first time I have seen 
Jehovah’s Witnesses 


24:47.502 --> 24:49.939
baptized here 
in the Buluo Prison. 


24:49.938 --> 24:51.940
This is a good thing. 


24:51.940 --> 24:55.010
I encourage you 
to continue with this assistance.


24:55.010 --> 24:58.380
Every week there are 
more than 80 in attendance 


24:58.380 --> 25:02.283
and sometimes 
more than that, even 140. 


25:02.283 --> 25:04.318
In the attendance 
there are the 36 publishers


25:04.318 --> 25:08.121
—the brothers who learned 
the truth in Buluo Prison—


25:08.122 --> 25:12.000
30 are baptized 
and 6 unbaptized.


25:16.063 --> 25:19.766
I visited many churches 
because I had a lot of questions, 


25:19.767 --> 25:23.000
but I never got 
any exact answers. 


25:24.672 --> 25:28.510
When I went to see 
Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


25:28.510 --> 25:31.412
they gave me accurate answers 
from the Bible. 


25:31.412 --> 25:34.482
To know that Jehovah 
is compassionate 


25:34.482 --> 25:36.484
and ready to forgive, 


25:36.483 --> 25:39.000
these are the qualities 
that touched me.


25:41.557 --> 25:43.892
I used to be a soldier. 


25:43.892 --> 25:45.894
I was in the military. 


25:45.893 --> 25:48.230
I attended various churches 


25:48.230 --> 25:50.732
because I had a question 
that bothered me a lot. 


25:50.732 --> 25:53.902
I wondered why God allows 
bad things to happen 


25:53.902 --> 25:56.705
to people all the time. 


25:56.705 --> 26:00.575
While I was in prison, 


26:00.575 --> 26:05.000
Jehovah’s Witnesses came to visit 
and talk to us. 


26:07.282 --> 26:09.817
I asked them 
the same question, 


26:09.817 --> 26:14.289
“Why does God allow sickness 
and suffering to continue?” 


26:14.288 --> 26:18.000
They replied by using 
three Bible verses. 


26:19.627 --> 26:23.000
I was very happy because I received 
the answer to my question.


26:28.703 --> 26:31.673
Papy Okito is a brother 


26:31.673 --> 26:33.708
who learned 
the truth in prison. 


26:33.708 --> 26:36.410
He made 
such remarkable progress 


26:36.410 --> 26:39.000
that those in charge 
now have confidence in him. 


26:42.150 --> 26:44.285
Like Joseph in the Bible, 


26:44.285 --> 26:48.757
he has been placed in a position 
of supervision over the other prisoners. 


26:48.757 --> 26:52.094
He also made further progress, 
and thus, the management has requested 


26:52.093 --> 26:56.698
that his prison sentence 
be reduced.


26:56.698 --> 26:59.000
When I arrived in the prison, 
I had lost hope. 


27:00.568 --> 27:02.603
I thought for me 
it was the end. 


27:02.603 --> 27:04.605
By means of the Bible, 


27:04.605 --> 27:07.875
I have found joy 
and hope in my life. 


27:07.875 --> 27:12.747
That is why today I am happy 
even though I am still here. 


27:12.747 --> 27:16.000
But I know 
that the Paradise is for me.


27:31.432 --> 27:34.269
It’s been five years 
since the brothers 


27:34.268 --> 27:36.570
started preaching 
in the Buluo Prison. 


27:36.570 --> 27:41.342
At times, the publishers place 
up to 500 magazines in one weekend. 


27:41.342 --> 27:45.247
Although our success is not 
measured by the number of placements, 


27:45.247 --> 27:47.749
this response does paint 
a clear picture 


27:47.748 --> 27:50.718
of the spiritual thirst 
among these prisoners. 


27:50.718 --> 27:54.188
In the last few months, 
inside these prison walls, 


27:54.188 --> 27:57.958
11 more unbaptized publishers 
have been approved. 


27:57.958 --> 28:02.263
What a loving act by Jehovah 
and his organization 


28:02.263 --> 28:06.400
to help such individuals satisfy 
their spiritual needs!


28:06.400 --> 28:09.037
In the late 1950’s, 


28:09.037 --> 28:11.339
the opposition 
against Jehovah’s Witnesses 


28:11.338 --> 28:13.340
in the former Soviet Union 


28:13.340 --> 28:16.978
resulted in homes being searched, 
brothers being followed, 


28:16.978 --> 28:19.546
and many of our brothers 
and sisters being sent 


28:19.547 --> 28:21.549
to Communist concentration camps 


28:21.548 --> 28:24.085
in Siberia, 
among other places. 


28:24.085 --> 28:27.755
In 1956 and 1957, 


28:27.755 --> 28:32.527
over 462,000 
convention delegates worldwide 


28:32.527 --> 28:35.197
unanimously adopted a petition 


28:35.197 --> 28:39.134
which clearly outlined the treatment 
Jehovah’s Witnesses were enduring. 


28:39.133 --> 28:41.970
It was sent 
to the Soviet authorities, 


28:41.970 --> 28:45.038
but sadly, not much changed. 


28:45.038 --> 28:48.876
The next year, 
at the 1958 international convention 


28:48.877 --> 28:50.879
at Yankee Stadium 
in New York, 


28:50.878 --> 28:55.083
a talk was given entitled 
“Behind the Iron Curtain.” 


28:55.083 --> 28:58.085
During the talk, 
delegates were surprised 


28:58.085 --> 29:00.455
when a recording of greetings 
and songs from brothers 


29:00.455 --> 29:03.157
and sisters in the Soviet Union 
was played. 


29:03.157 --> 29:06.160
Despite the risk of losing 
their freedom, 


29:06.160 --> 29:09.397
the brothers produced 
and sent these recordings. 


29:09.397 --> 29:11.465
Well, a few months ago, 


29:11.465 --> 29:14.602
some of those who were involved 
in making the recording 


29:14.602 --> 29:17.572
were able to listen to it 
for the first time


29:17.572 --> 29:20.575
Several of them 
found out only then 


29:20.575 --> 29:24.245
that the recording had been played 
at the convention at Yankee Stadium. 


29:24.245 --> 29:29.000
Our team was present 
at that gathering.


29:43.898 --> 29:48.435
The brothers told us 
to prepare songs for a recording.


29:48.435 --> 29:51.973
When we were singing, 
I never imagined 


29:51.973 --> 29:55.143
that it was for a convention, 
because I did not know about that. 


29:55.143 --> 29:57.145
We sang as usual.


29:57.145 --> 30:01.850
The chorus was made up 
of about 20 persons, 


30:01.850 --> 30:04.818
and the recording 
was made in a room 


30:04.818 --> 30:08.000
in a barrack-like building.


30:12.627 --> 30:17.632
I just looked after the chorus 
to give them the right tone.


30:17.632 --> 30:21.970
If someone sang a little off-key, 
she would right away remark: 


30:21.970 --> 30:26.307
“Altos, you are off!” 
or “Tenor, you are off!” 


30:26.307 --> 30:30.000
so that there would be no slips, 
no mistakes.


30:32.047 --> 30:34.449
We had to be very careful 


30:34.448 --> 30:37.285
when we were recording.


30:37.285 --> 30:39.453
And so we knew not to talk. 


30:39.453 --> 30:41.521
I could not tell 
anyone about it. 


30:41.522 --> 30:44.000
It was secret
—absolutely secret.


30:50.598 --> 30:53.066
They chose a brother 
who spoke very good Russian, 


30:53.067 --> 30:56.237
who had good intonation, 
and who had a good voice. 


30:56.237 --> 31:01.000
And as I recall, we made 
the recording on our first attempt.


31:03.612 --> 31:07.000
Brother Yuriy Dobychin 
said the greetings.


31:10.352 --> 31:13.755
I was young then, 
and I had a good voice. 


31:13.755 --> 31:17.758
So I had to say 
the greetings 


31:17.758 --> 31:21.195
from the brothers 
in the Soviet Union 


31:21.195 --> 31:25.000
for the brothers gathered 
at Yankee Stadium.


31:35.810 --> 31:39.813
As the brothers who made 
the recording told me, 


31:39.813 --> 31:42.016
the most difficult assignment 
for them 


31:42.017 --> 31:44.285
was how to get this recording 


31:44.285 --> 31:47.522
across the border. 


31:47.522 --> 31:50.459
The brothers cut it up 
into pieces 


31:50.458 --> 31:53.193
and sewed it 
into the lining of a jacket 


31:53.193 --> 31:57.631
because that’s how 
confidential letters were sent. 


31:57.632 --> 32:00.835
One married couple 
from Poland, 


32:00.835 --> 32:02.837
who were vacationing 
in Russia, 


32:02.837 --> 32:05.105
agreed to take it 
back with them


32:05.105 --> 32:09.143
—to take it 
out of the Soviet Union. 


32:09.143 --> 32:13.000
And that’s where they ran 
into serious problems.


32:16.650 --> 32:18.687
From Brother Scheider’s letter, 


32:18.687 --> 32:21.000
who received 
the audio recording in Poland: 


32:24.958 --> 32:27.000
“The security officers separated 
our brother from the others. 


32:29.363 --> 32:31.698
“Then an officer said to him: 


32:31.698 --> 32:34.000
‘Please give us the film 
and the three letters you have with you.’ 


32:35.903 --> 32:37.905
“The brother saw now, 
of course, 


32:37.905 --> 32:40.308
“that there had been 
a traitor somewhere. 


32:40.308 --> 32:43.443
“He and his wife 
were now thoroughly searched. 


32:43.443 --> 32:46.013
“Every square centimeter 
of their cases 


32:46.013 --> 32:49.483
“was carefully examined 
together with their contents. 


32:49.483 --> 32:51.986
“Then both were stripped naked. 


32:51.987 --> 32:54.455
“While this was going on, 
they yelled at the brother: 


32:54.455 --> 32:58.727
‘Tell us where you have hidden everything 
or to whom you have given it!’ 


32:58.727 --> 33:03.430
“They were absolutely convinced 
that he had everything with him. 


33:03.430 --> 33:05.467
“Several times they took him 
to the office 


33:05.467 --> 33:08.269
“of the frontier police 
and to the security police, 


33:08.268 --> 33:10.638
“searching him 
again and again 


33:10.638 --> 33:13.775
“and being terribly angry. 


33:13.775 --> 33:16.077
“But they finally had to give up. 


33:16.077 --> 33:18.479
“They kept him back 
for 24 hours 


33:18.478 --> 33:22.250
“and questioned him 
in the presence of ten specialists. 


33:22.250 --> 33:26.000
But he came out victorious.”


33:29.757 --> 33:32.594
Sadly, even the brothers 


33:32.593 --> 33:35.963
who were involved 
don’t know who this couple 


33:35.963 --> 33:38.000
who brought the tape 
into Poland was.


35:25.172 --> 35:28.375
Well, for me it was, of course, a great joy, 
since the goal was reached after all.


35:28.375 --> 35:31.378
Everything was so wonderful 
at that time. 


35:31.378 --> 35:33.380
I really enjoyed it all!


35:33.380 --> 35:36.850
Nothing could describe 
the joy I felt.


35:36.850 --> 35:41.000
I was overwhelmed with feelings.


35:45.860 --> 35:50.865
And so my voice was recorded, 
and the greetings were heard 


35:50.865 --> 35:56.000
in New York 
at Yankee Stadium.


36:11.318 --> 36:15.455
These dear brothers and sisters 
have no regrets. 


36:15.455 --> 36:17.825
They are happy 
that their efforts encouraged 


36:17.825 --> 36:20.895
so many thousands 
back then and today. 


36:20.895 --> 36:24.132
The kind of love 
these brothers and sisters showed 


36:24.132 --> 36:27.802
is often noticed 
by those not in the truth. 


36:27.802 --> 36:30.337
A young couple from the United States, 


36:30.337 --> 36:32.707
Jeremiah and Holly Draper, 


36:32.707 --> 36:36.000
experienced just that.


36:41.682 --> 36:44.352
The blessings that I enjoy today 


36:44.352 --> 36:47.789
are so numerous.


36:47.788 --> 36:50.390
I have a true inner sense 


36:50.390 --> 36:52.993
of joy and happiness.


36:52.993 --> 36:56.196
I can’t help 
but be appreciative, 


36:56.197 --> 36:59.234
so grateful 
for all that Jehovah does.


36:59.233 --> 37:04.000
But it wasn’t 
always this way for us.


37:15.917 --> 37:20.000
It was a dark world growing up. 


37:22.590 --> 37:25.000
I never knew 
what being a child was like. 


37:28.628 --> 37:30.765
I was afraid 


37:30.765 --> 37:34.402
of who I would grow up to be. 


37:34.402 --> 37:38.605
I felt like I had no choice. 


37:38.605 --> 37:41.575
Then at a very young age, 
I, as well, 


37:41.575 --> 37:43.510
started to partake 


37:43.510 --> 37:45.780
of what I saw going on around me. 


37:45.780 --> 37:49.050
I learned quickly that it helped numb 


37:49.050 --> 37:51.018
the feelings that I had. 


37:51.018 --> 37:54.355
Drugs were a way 
to escape that. 


37:54.355 --> 37:57.090
I was in a lot of trouble 
with the law. 


37:57.090 --> 37:59.760
I knew I needed change, 


37:59.760 --> 38:03.998
so I joined the military 
at a young age.


38:03.998 --> 38:08.768
Around my teenage years, 
my life became difficult. 


38:08.768 --> 38:13.273
I started to turn to drugs and alcohol 
and self-destructive ways, 


38:13.273 --> 38:17.110
but none of these things 
were making me happy. 


38:17.110 --> 38:19.613
I was very lonely. 


38:19.613 --> 38:23.650
No one knew me; 
no one cared to know me. 


38:23.650 --> 38:25.953
I felt so lost, 


38:25.953 --> 38:29.423
and I was trying 
to fill this big hole in my heart 


38:29.423 --> 38:32.225
with so many things,


38:32.225 --> 38:35.830
and none of it worked. 


38:35.830 --> 38:39.500
One of my many car accidents, 
due to drugs and alcohol, 


38:39.500 --> 38:43.637
ended me up in jail 


38:43.637 --> 38:47.000
for 30 days straight. 


38:49.643 --> 38:53.180
I felt like a hopeless mess. 


38:53.180 --> 38:57.685
I just knew 
something’s got to change. 


38:57.685 --> 38:59.753
So I joined the military, 


38:59.753 --> 39:01.821
thinking it was going to be 


39:01.822 --> 39:05.192
the positive great change 
that I needed, 


39:05.192 --> 39:08.962
but it was not.


39:08.962 --> 39:11.265
I remember 
joining the military 


39:11.265 --> 39:13.267
hoping that it 
would bring some sort 


39:13.267 --> 39:15.269
of authority into my life, 


39:15.268 --> 39:19.706
but I again started 
to spiral 


39:19.707 --> 39:23.944
into my anger,
my alcohol and drug abuse. 


39:23.943 --> 39:28.215
The military decided 
to let me out. 


39:28.215 --> 39:33.220
But during deployment 
is where I met Holly. 


39:33.220 --> 39:35.823
Holly also got 
out of the military, 


39:35.823 --> 39:38.458
and we started 
to live a life together.


39:38.458 --> 39:42.696
But we were still searching 
for something to fill 


39:42.697 --> 39:45.000
the emptiness 
that we both felt in our lives. 


39:46.400 --> 39:50.337
Jeremiah and I were both working 
in a steel factory in Montana. 


39:50.337 --> 39:55.009
During this time, 
I was being trained on a drill 


39:55.008 --> 39:57.545
by one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
a sister named Molly. 


39:57.545 --> 39:59.980
Molly said, “You’re 
going to have down time


39:59.980 --> 40:02.817
“on this machine, 
maybe a couple of hours, 


40:02.817 --> 40:06.087
so feel free to read 
whatever I have in my tool box.” 


40:06.087 --> 40:08.089
I opened it 


40:08.088 --> 40:10.423
and immediately 
a little yellow book, 


40:10.423 --> 40:13.160
What Does the Bible Really Teach?, 
caught my eye. 


40:13.160 --> 40:15.128
I loved the pictures. 


40:15.128 --> 40:17.498
The scriptures 
at the beginning of the book, 


40:17.498 --> 40:21.235
they touched my heart immediately, 
and I felt like, 


40:21.235 --> 40:23.937
‘These answer all the questions 


40:23.937 --> 40:26.540
I’ve been searching 
for my entire life!’ 


40:26.540 --> 40:29.743
Another sister came over, 
her name was Cory, 


40:29.743 --> 40:31.978
and she said:
“Molly and I can come over, 


40:31.978 --> 40:34.415
“and we can talk to you 
about the Bible tomorrow. 


40:34.415 --> 40:38.018
If you have any questions, 
we’d love to answer them using the Bible.” 


40:38.018 --> 40:41.288
I said, “Yes, come over!”


40:41.288 --> 40:43.456
I was a little bit 
more apprehensive. 


40:43.457 --> 40:45.759
I stayed just to make sure 
nothing got weird, 


40:45.758 --> 40:47.761
but this was finally 


40:47.762 --> 40:50.764
something very different. 


40:50.763 --> 40:53.533
And I realized what they were saying 
came from the Bible. 


40:53.533 --> 40:55.701
I’d never seen that before. 


40:55.702 --> 40:58.139
They invited us 
to the Kingdom Hall. 


40:58.138 --> 41:01.475
We went in, 
everybody had their Bible, 


41:01.475 --> 41:04.912
had time to look 
the scriptures up together, 


41:04.912 --> 41:07.749
and everybody was 
so warm and inviting.


41:07.748 --> 41:11.618
These were the people 
I’d been searching for my entire life.


41:11.618 --> 41:13.653
All of a sudden change 
was possible. 


41:13.653 --> 41:16.456
We knew what changes 
we needed to make in our life.


41:16.457 --> 41:18.659
What we were doing, 
our actions, 


41:18.658 --> 41:22.061
we had to clear out things 
that Jehovah hates.


41:22.062 --> 41:24.064
Like just going through 
our house and deciding 


41:24.063 --> 41:26.133
what it is 
that we need to get rid of. 


41:26.133 --> 41:28.801
By allowing the truth 
to transform our lives, 


41:28.802 --> 41:31.072
Holly and I’ve received 
many blessings, 


41:31.072 --> 41:35.609
and eventually we were able 
to come here together and serve at Bethel.


41:35.608 --> 41:38.245
We got the truth in a weld shop, 


41:38.245 --> 41:41.515
and now I get to weld 
here in Jehovah’s house for him.


41:41.515 --> 41:44.752
I perform maintenance 
on water fountains, 


41:44.752 --> 41:47.487
refrigerators, coolers. 


41:47.487 --> 41:50.590
Being trained by the brothers 
and sisters I work with 


41:50.590 --> 41:53.360
just helps me to refine 
my Christian personality.


41:53.360 --> 41:56.097
It’s so nice to know 
that Jehovah 


41:56.097 --> 41:58.365
is looking down on us; 


41:58.365 --> 42:00.733
that he was able 
to see through 


42:00.733 --> 42:03.236
all of the trash 
that was there in our life. 


42:03.237 --> 42:05.272
He was able to find something 


42:05.272 --> 42:07.274
and decided to work with it. 


42:07.273 --> 42:11.911
And I really think of a scripture, 
Psalm 145:19: 


42:11.912 --> 42:16.150
“He satisfies the desire 
of those 


42:16.150 --> 42:20.620
“who fear him; 
he hears their [cry] for help, 


42:20.620 --> 42:22.055
and [he] rescues them.” 


42:22.055 --> 42:23.890
Jehovah did that for us. 


42:23.890 --> 42:27.393
If you ask Jehovah 
to display his hand in your life, 


42:27.393 --> 42:30.130
no doubt at all in my mind, 


42:30.130 --> 42:33.000
that will happen.


42:34.535 --> 42:38.205
Did you notice how 
Jeremiah and Holly were touched 


42:38.205 --> 42:40.240
by the Christian love shown to them 


42:40.240 --> 42:43.077
when they visited 
the Kingdom Hall for the first time? 


42:43.077 --> 42:45.445
Jeremiah said that everybody 


42:45.445 --> 42:47.815
was so warm and inviting. 


42:47.815 --> 42:50.517
Yes, love truly is 


42:50.517 --> 42:53.754
the identifying mark of Jesus’ disciples.


42:53.753 --> 42:57.323
But Jesus taught that love 
for fellow believers and our neighbor 


42:57.323 --> 43:00.093
is second to our love for Jehovah. 


43:00.093 --> 43:03.463
Being kind and encouraging to others 


43:03.463 --> 43:06.266
is of little value if it’s not rooted 


43:06.267 --> 43:09.637
in a deep desire 
to please our heavenly Father. 


43:09.637 --> 43:12.372
In the following dramatization, 


43:12.372 --> 43:14.942
a young brother is reminded of the value 


43:14.942 --> 43:18.000
of carefully examining his heart.


43:29.957 --> 43:31.959
My name is Shawn. 


43:31.958 --> 43:34.000
I was raised in the truth.


43:36.330 --> 43:39.000
I was doing everything right.


43:49.510 --> 43:52.000
But I was doing everything wrong.


44:17.905 --> 44:20.107
I was in my senior year of high school. 


44:20.107 --> 44:23.177
Everything was going great 


44:23.177 --> 44:27.000
until this new girl joined our school.


44:33.420 --> 44:35.755
I really don’t know 
how it even started. 


44:35.755 --> 44:39.000
We just sort of hit it off 
and became good friends. 


44:41.195 --> 44:44.000
I mean, she was so easy to talk to.


45:10.890 --> 45:12.893
Before I knew it, 


45:12.893 --> 45:15.628
we were texting all the time. 


45:15.628 --> 45:19.000
Then, one thing led to another.


45:21.468 --> 45:24.336
Honestly, when things 
started to get physical, 


45:24.337 --> 45:27.140
I thought I could control it, 


45:27.140 --> 45:30.000
but it was only getting worse.


45:41.788 --> 45:44.256
I didn’t want to let my parents down. 


45:44.257 --> 45:47.000
So I started lying to them, 


45:50.663 --> 45:55.000
and then I started lying to myself. 


45:57.137 --> 46:01.809
I thought if I could just keep 
going to the meetings and do my parts, 


46:01.808 --> 46:05.000
it could somehow be OK.


46:07.213 --> 46:10.000
But I was far from OK.


46:14.087 --> 46:18.825
The next night, we had family worship. 


46:18.825 --> 46:23.000
We were reading about the account 
of Ananias and his wife, Sapphira. 


46:29.368 --> 46:34.373
When a special fund was set up 
for needy Christians, Ananias sold a field. 


46:34.373 --> 46:38.311
But then, he boldly claimed 
he was contributing 


46:38.312 --> 46:41.615
the entire proceeds of its sale. 


46:41.615 --> 46:45.485
In reality, though, 
Ananias had “secretly held back 


46:45.485 --> 46:49.322
some of the price” 
for his personal gain.


46:49.322 --> 46:53.360
Peter boldly said to him: 
“You have lied, 


46:53.360 --> 46:57.000
not to men, but to God.” 


46:58.932 --> 47:01.000
Jehovah wasn’t fooled 
by their pretense. 


47:05.238 --> 47:09.241
Then we read Psalm 44:21: 


47:09.242 --> 47:11.245
“[God] is aware 


47:11.245 --> 47:16.000
of the secrets of the heart.”


47:24.992 --> 47:29.000
Reading this account of Ananias 
and Sapphira made me realize 


47:37.103 --> 47:42.000
I wasn’t just lying 
to my parents or my friends. 


47:43.943 --> 47:46.000
I was lying to Jehovah. 


47:47.580 --> 47:50.717
As much as I didn’t want 
to let my parents down, 


47:50.717 --> 47:54.000
even more so, 
I didn’t want to let Jehovah down.


48:02.262 --> 48:05.999
I prayed long that night. 


48:05.998 --> 48:08.000
I didn’t hold anything back.


48:14.675 --> 48:19.000
By the next morning, 
I knew what I wanted to do.


48:51.210 --> 48:55.948
It wasn’t easy, 
but my parents were very supportive, 


48:55.948 --> 48:59.000
and I also got the help 
I needed from the elders.


49:13.567 --> 49:16.904
It’s been a few years, 
but as I look back now, 


49:16.903 --> 49:20.000
I was one of those kids 
living a double life. 


49:22.575 --> 49:25.000
But now with Jehovah’s help, 


49:26.380 --> 49:29.000
I’m living the best life.


49:31.585 --> 49:35.088
What a clear warning this is, 


49:35.088 --> 49:38.558
not only for young ones 
but also for those of us 


49:38.558 --> 49:41.528
who have served Jehovah 
for many, many years. 


49:41.528 --> 49:46.165
As we well know, serving Jehovah 
faithfully for many decades 


49:46.165 --> 49:49.837
is only valuable 
if we ‘endure to the end.’ 


49:49.837 --> 49:53.307
By developing 
intense love for Jehovah, 


49:53.307 --> 49:57.877
we’ll be able to overcome 
whatever temptations or trials we face.


49:57.877 --> 50:00.580
And speaking 
of enduring to the end, 


50:00.580 --> 50:04.685
Brother Mark Sanderson recently spoke 
at morning worship in Bethel 


50:04.685 --> 50:08.588
about how our eager expectation 
of the day of Jehovah 


50:08.588 --> 50:12.291
will help us to endure faithfully 
in this system of things. 


50:12.292 --> 50:15.395
Pay close attention 
to some of the ways 


50:15.395 --> 50:17.000
we show such expectation.


50:18.898 --> 50:21.368
Well, here’s the question 
we want to ask this morning: 


50:21.368 --> 50:26.171
Is it actually possible 
to speed up the day of Jehovah? 


50:26.172 --> 50:28.842
Well, if we look at our text this morning 


50:28.842 --> 50:33.680
at 2 Peter 3:11, 


50:33.680 --> 50:35.848
we’ve had that read for us, 


50:35.848 --> 50:38.485
so we know 
that expression at the end 


50:38.485 --> 50:42.222
that we should “consider 
what sort of people you ought to be 


50:42.222 --> 50:46.394
in holy acts of conduct 
and deeds of godly devotion.” 


50:46.393 --> 50:48.661
But then it goes on to say: 


50:48.662 --> 50:52.232
“As you await and keep close in mind 


50:52.232 --> 50:55.369
the presence of the day of Jehovah.” 


50:55.368 --> 50:57.936
Well, now, if you look at the footnote 


50:57.937 --> 51:00.240
on this expression in verse 12, 


51:00.240 --> 51:02.775
you’ll notice that the expression 


51:02.775 --> 51:05.478
“keep close in mind” literally means 


51:05.478 --> 51:09.281
to “speed up” the day of Jehovah. 


51:09.282 --> 51:11.652
Well, now, how can we do that? 


51:11.652 --> 51:14.387
Well, it’s true we cannot bring 


51:14.387 --> 51:17.457
the day forward of Jehovah 
even one day, 


51:17.457 --> 51:20.694
nor can we move it 
back even one day. 


51:20.693 --> 51:24.030
That is not within our power. 
That day is set. 


51:24.030 --> 51:27.967
But how can we, then, 
“speed up” 


51:27.967 --> 51:31.204
the day of Jehovah 
as it says there in verse 12? 


51:31.203 --> 51:35.441
Well, we keep that day 
close in our mind. 


51:35.442 --> 51:38.112
We never let it be out of our sight. 


51:38.112 --> 51:40.147
As the footnote also says, 


51:40.147 --> 51:43.082
we “eagerly desire” it. 


51:43.082 --> 51:45.652
Well, now, 
if we’re persons like that, 


51:45.652 --> 51:49.222
Peter says 
that we’re going to be busy 


51:49.222 --> 51:51.725
in “deeds of godly devotion.” 


51:51.725 --> 51:53.793
Well, now, 
just as a quick reminder: 


51:53.793 --> 51:55.828
What is godly devotion? 


51:55.828 --> 51:59.731
Well, just looking 
at our New World Translation glossary, 


51:59.732 --> 52:01.735
here’s the definition: 


52:01.735 --> 52:04.770
It’s “reverence, worship, 


52:04.770 --> 52:07.073
“and service to Jehovah God, 


52:07.073 --> 52:11.110
with loyalty 
to his universal sovereignty.” 


52:11.110 --> 52:13.780
Well, what do we get 
from that definition? 


52:13.780 --> 52:17.817
Did you notice
—reverence, worship, service? 


52:17.817 --> 52:22.389
You see, godly devotion 
is not passive; it’s active. 


52:22.388 --> 52:26.660
It’s reflected 
in action and in activity.


52:26.660 --> 52:29.062
Well, that’s why the apostle Peter 


52:29.062 --> 52:31.197
used the expression in verse 11, 


52:31.197 --> 52:34.167
“deeds of godly devotion.” 


52:34.167 --> 52:38.037
Well, what are some of the ways 
that we demonstrate this quality? 


52:38.037 --> 52:40.474
Well, some of them are just very small. 


52:40.473 --> 52:43.410
For example, what about hospitality? 


52:43.410 --> 52:47.080
At 1 Peter 4:9, 


52:47.080 --> 52:50.483
when the apostle Peter 
wrote his first letter, he said: 


52:50.483 --> 52:54.720
“Be hospitable 
to one another without grumbling.” 


52:54.720 --> 52:57.857
Well, there are 
so many opportunities 


52:57.857 --> 53:00.960
for us to imitate Jehovah 
and be hospitable


53:00.960 --> 53:04.563
—to share with others 
according to their needs. 


53:04.563 --> 53:08.668
And this really is an expression 
not only for another person 


53:08.668 --> 53:11.705
but it’s an expression 
of our love for Jehovah


53:11.705 --> 53:13.873
—our desire to want 
to imitate him. 


53:13.873 --> 53:15.875
Well, we all acknowledge that. 


53:15.875 --> 53:17.977
But here’s the question: 


53:17.977 --> 53:20.447
When was the last time 


53:20.447 --> 53:23.717
that you acted hospitably? 


53:23.717 --> 53:26.620
Or when was the last time 
I acted hospitably? 


53:26.620 --> 53:30.823
You see, it’s not enough just to love 
the quality of hospitality. 


53:30.823 --> 53:33.726
If we are going 
to have deeds of godly devotion, 


53:33.727 --> 53:35.729
we’re going to have to practice it.


53:35.728 --> 53:37.730
Here’s another one. 


53:37.730 --> 53:42.035
What about helping the elderly 
that are in our midst? 


53:42.035 --> 53:44.837
You know, 
our elderly brothers need help. 


53:44.837 --> 53:47.074
They need help 
to get to the meetings. 


53:47.073 --> 53:50.076
They need help 
to get out in the field ministry. 


53:50.077 --> 53:52.812
Some of them 
are confined to their homes. 


53:52.812 --> 53:57.150
Well, if that’s the case, 
they may need help from younger ones 


53:57.150 --> 54:00.287
to assist them 
with shopping or doing errands 


54:00.287 --> 54:03.990
or just doing 
some chore around the house. 


54:03.990 --> 54:06.693
Well, that’s something 
that has been mentioned 


54:06.693 --> 54:08.995
in many Watchtower articles. 


54:08.995 --> 54:11.998
It’s been mentioned 
at many conventions and assemblies. 


54:11.998 --> 54:15.035
It’s been mentioned 
at many congregation meetings. 


54:15.035 --> 54:17.037
But now here’s a question: 


54:17.037 --> 54:19.239
When was the last time 


54:19.238 --> 54:22.075
that you did something 
for an elderly brother or sister? 


54:22.075 --> 54:24.077
Or when was the last time I did? 


54:24.077 --> 54:26.345
You see, we need to think 


54:26.345 --> 54:29.315
about not just loving these ideas 


54:29.315 --> 54:32.785
but what are we doing to really help? 


54:32.785 --> 54:36.657
See, that’s showing 
deeds of godly devotion.


54:36.657 --> 54:40.860
Well, of course, we also have to think 
about the more major things. 


54:40.860 --> 54:44.163
What about attending 
our congregation meetings? 


54:44.163 --> 54:47.433
Hebrews 10:23-25


54:47.433 --> 54:50.470
—that scripture 
that we quote so many times—


54:50.470 --> 54:54.640
says that we should ‘not forsake 
our meeting together.’ 


54:54.640 --> 54:59.612
But it goes on to say 
that we should ‘encourage one another.’ 


54:59.612 --> 55:02.582
So it’s not enough 
just to be at the meeting. 


55:02.582 --> 55:06.452
When we’re there, we want to reach out 
and do everything that we can 


55:06.452 --> 55:10.457
to encourage our brothers 
and really participate in the meeting. 


55:10.457 --> 55:15.162
You see, godly devotion 
is not passive; it’s active. 


55:15.162 --> 55:19.532
And so, what sort of persons ought we to be 
when we’re at the meeting? 


55:19.532 --> 55:22.469
Well, we know we want to be active, 


55:22.468 --> 55:25.271
fully involved with the program.


55:25.272 --> 55:28.442
But now, of course, 
what’s the most important way 


55:28.442 --> 55:31.410
that we exercise 
these deeds of godly devotion? 


55:31.410 --> 55:33.980
Well, you’ll remember 
that the apostle Paul 


55:33.980 --> 55:37.583
at 1 Timothy 3:16 


55:37.583 --> 55:41.921
referred to ‘the sacred secret 
of godly devotion,’ 


55:41.922 --> 55:46.359
and he showed there 
that Jesus really was that secret. 


55:46.358 --> 55:49.361
You see, he was 
the one who demonstrated 


55:49.362 --> 55:52.632
godly devotion 
in a perfect sense. 


55:52.632 --> 55:56.602
Now, Paul in that verse, 
1 Timothy 3:16, 


55:56.602 --> 56:01.374
went on to say that Jesus 
was ‘preached among the nations.’ 


56:01.373 --> 56:04.843
Well, then, that really is 
a vital part 


56:04.843 --> 56:06.980
of our deeds of godly devotion


56:06.980 --> 56:10.483
—preaching about Christ Jesus, 
his Kingdom, 


56:10.483 --> 56:12.985
and everything 
that will be accomplished. 


56:12.985 --> 56:17.223
But brothers, 
how much incentive we have today 


56:17.223 --> 56:20.526
to be involved fully 
in our preaching work. 


56:20.527 --> 56:24.797
We have tools today 
like we have never had before.


56:24.797 --> 56:27.767
You know, over the summer 
as I was attending 


56:27.767 --> 56:31.570
a number of different regional conventions 
in different parts of the world, 


56:31.570 --> 56:35.242
I enjoyed so much, 
no doubt just as you have, 


56:35.242 --> 56:38.945
using the JW Library app 


56:38.945 --> 56:42.348
and downloading 
the Why Study the Bible? video 


56:42.348 --> 56:44.850
in a number of different languages. 


56:44.850 --> 56:48.153
We had one real interesting experience 
when we were in Europe. 


56:48.153 --> 56:52.625
We got into a taxi 
with a driver from Africa. 


56:52.625 --> 56:55.328
And right away, 
we asked him what his language was. 


56:55.328 --> 56:58.965
Well, he told us it was 
a language not familiar to us at all. 


56:58.965 --> 57:01.267
But while he was driving, 


57:01.267 --> 57:05.539
we managed to download 
the Why Study the Bible? video, 


57:05.538 --> 57:09.375
and it automatically 
began to play as we were in the car. 


57:09.375 --> 57:12.145
Well, as soon as the man heard it, 
he started shouting: 


57:12.145 --> 57:14.180
“What’s happening? 
What’s happening?” 


57:14.180 --> 57:17.017
I think he thought 
he was hearing a voice from heaven 


57:17.017 --> 57:20.052
when he heard 
his own language in the taxi. 


57:20.052 --> 57:23.389
But we reassured him 
that that was not the case. 


57:23.388 --> 57:25.591
But he was so moved. 


57:25.592 --> 57:29.529
He almost didn’t want to take the fare, 
if you can imagine, 


57:29.528 --> 57:33.298
and initially 
he had been quite unfriendly. 


57:33.298 --> 57:36.435
But when he saw 
what was available on our website, 


57:36.435 --> 57:38.437
he was deeply moved. 


57:38.437 --> 57:41.107
Well, maybe 
you’ve had a similar experience. 


57:41.107 --> 57:43.175
Just as a note of future reference: 


57:43.175 --> 57:45.245
It’s probably not a good idea 
to play the video 


57:45.245 --> 57:47.447
when someone is driving.


57:47.447 --> 57:52.385
Well, if we have 
real godly devotion that’s active, 


57:52.385 --> 57:56.990
we’re going to be busy 
in doing deeds of godly devotion. 


57:56.990 --> 57:59.325
You know, 
there’s an old saying that says: 


57:59.325 --> 58:02.528
“Time flies when you’re having fun.” 


58:02.528 --> 58:06.866
Well, you know, even scientists 
acknowledge that there’s truth in that. 


58:06.867 --> 58:10.537
A study that was published 
in the year 2012 


58:10.537 --> 58:14.740
in the journal 
Psychological Science said this: 


58:14.740 --> 58:16.977
Although we tend to believe 


58:16.977 --> 58:20.012
that time flies 
when we’re having a good time, 


58:20.012 --> 58:23.717
these studies 
indicate that what it is 


58:23.717 --> 58:27.920
about the enjoyable time 
that causes it to go by more quickly. 


58:27.920 --> 58:31.390
It seems to be the goal pursuit 


58:31.390 --> 58:36.028
or achievement-directed action 
we’re engaged in that matters. 


58:36.028 --> 58:40.966
Just being content or satisfied 
may not make time fly, 


58:40.967 --> 58:44.770
but being excited or actively pursuing 


58:44.770 --> 58:46.772
a desired object can. 


58:46.772 --> 58:48.775
Isn’t that interesting?


58:48.775 --> 58:51.577
Well, now, if we’re 
the sort of persons that are busy 


58:51.577 --> 58:55.649
with holy acts of conduct 
and deeds of godly devotion, 


58:55.648 --> 59:00.353
reaching out for that most important goal 
of everlasting life, 


59:00.353 --> 59:04.556
we will speed up the coming 
of the day of Jehovah 


59:04.557 --> 59:07.960
in our hearts and our minds.


59:07.960 --> 59:09.962
What deeds of godly devotion 


59:09.962 --> 59:12.632
do you remember 
from that fine presentation? 


59:12.632 --> 59:15.769
Among other things, 
Brother Sanderson explained 


59:15.768 --> 59:20.606
that one deed of godly devotion 
is to be hospitable to one another. 


59:20.607 --> 59:24.677
Hospitality is also the theme 
of this month’s music video, 


59:24.677 --> 59:28.000
which is entitled 
“Follow the Course [of Hospitality].”


59:37.657 --> 59:55.675
It might be a meal or snacks or coffee
Or fun and games, maybe just talking.


59:55.675 --> 1:00:09.088
Jehovah is the one who put it on our table.
So could we be able . . .


1:00:09.088 --> 1:00:17.496
“Follow the course of hospitality.”
Imitate God above.


1:00:17.497 --> 1:00:28.000
Do it with true impartiality.
That’s what it means to love.


1:00:37.283 --> 1:00:46.725
The roof above our heads 
is from our heavenly Father.


1:00:46.725 --> 1:00:54.167
But if we need to share, 
would it be a bother?


1:00:54.167 --> 1:01:03.442
Let’s feel the joy 
that only ever comes from giving!


1:01:03.442 --> 1:01:08.580
That’s Christian living.


1:01:08.580 --> 1:01:18.190
“Follow the course of hospitality.”
Imitate God above.


1:01:18.190 --> 1:01:26.000
Do it with true impartiality.
That’s what it means to love.


1:01:36.808 --> 1:01:46.151
Some people don’t have what we have.
It’s up to us to share.


1:01:46.152 --> 1:01:55.294
Disaster strikes, then they’re without.
Will we really care?


1:01:55.293 --> 1:02:04.303
Could we open up our home 
and host a friend in need?


1:02:04.303 --> 1:02:06.671
Do a kindly deed.


1:02:06.672 --> 1:02:17.015
“Follow the course of hospitality.”
Imitate God above.


1:02:17.015 --> 1:02:26.025
Do it with true impartiality.
That’s what it means to love.


1:02:26.025 --> 1:02:35.300
That’s what it means to love.
That’s what it means to love.


1:02:35.300 --> 1:02:37.303
What a nice song! 


1:02:37.303 --> 1:02:41.206
And while that music video 
brings this program to its conclusion, 


1:02:41.207 --> 1:02:43.409
we’d like to encourage you to watch a video 


1:02:43.408 --> 1:02:47.746
that will be posted later this month 
about Sister Cindy McIntosh. 


1:02:47.747 --> 1:02:50.650
She was in the military for many years 


1:02:50.650 --> 1:02:55.253
and described herself as having become 
a “dark and uncaring person.” 


1:02:55.253 --> 1:02:57.223
But then Jehovah taught her 


1:02:57.223 --> 1:03:00.025
what true love means. 


1:03:00.025 --> 1:03:04.930
The video is entitled I Put Down My Rifle 
and is available on Video on Demand 


1:03:04.930 --> 1:03:08.000
in the “Interviews 
and Experiences” category.


1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.672
Yes, love truly is 
the identifying mark of true Christians. 


1:03:12.672 --> 1:03:14.974
That’s what stands out 
when you 


1:03:14.973 --> 1:03:17.976
visit other congregations, 
perhaps when traveling. 


1:03:17.977 --> 1:03:22.014
One good example 
is the Nong Khai Congregation 


1:03:22.013 --> 1:03:25.283
in the northeastern corner of Thailand. 


1:03:25.283 --> 1:03:28.386
The 32 publishers send their love.


1:03:28.387 --> 1:03:31.024
There’s a great need in Thailand, 


1:03:31.023 --> 1:03:33.893
which is why half 
of the 10 appointed brothers 


1:03:33.893 --> 1:03:37.296
in the congregation 
and half of the 18 pioneers 


1:03:37.297 --> 1:03:40.199
are “need greaters.” 


1:03:40.198 --> 1:03:43.635
Witnessing carts have been set up 
at a nearby border crossing, 


1:03:43.635 --> 1:03:46.338
with ten languages 
regularly featured. 


1:03:46.338 --> 1:03:48.908
Many copies 
are placed with visitors 


1:03:48.908 --> 1:03:51.676
from countries 
where our work is restricted. 


1:03:51.677 --> 1:03:54.114
Sometimes over 1,000 pieces of literature 


1:03:54.113 --> 1:03:57.250
are placed in a single day 
at the border crossing.


1:03:57.250 --> 1:03:59.785
The Nong Khai Congregation 
had the privilege 


1:03:59.785 --> 1:04:03.255
of being a host congregation 
when a special convention 


1:04:03.255 --> 1:04:06.858
was arranged 
in October of last year. 


1:04:06.858 --> 1:04:11.630
And during the convention, 
they were surprised and overjoyed to hear 


1:04:11.630 --> 1:04:15.735
that the New World Translation 
was now available 


1:04:15.735 --> 1:04:18.337
in the Thai language.


1:04:18.337 --> 1:04:22.074
We pray that Jehovah continues to bless 
the brothers and sisters in Thailand.


1:04:22.073 --> 1:04:25.911
And all of you around the world, 
we love you very much! 


1:04:25.912 --> 1:04:42.445

from Brooklyn, New York.
