Imagine for a moment

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:05.355 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that you’re planning a road trip.

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You have everything you need:

00:00:07.357 --> 00:00:11.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a map, a car, and plenty of fuel.

00:00:11.628 --> 00:00:14.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before you start the engine, though,

00:00:14.097 --> 00:00:17.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to know your destination
—wouldn’t you agree?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t know where you are trying to go,

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you won’t know which road to take.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:25.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true of our ministry,

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:28.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is, in a sense, like that road trip.

00:00:28.945 --> 00:00:33.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Acts 13:48 shows, we’re always searching

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for “those who [are] rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:40.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have everything we need for the journey,

00:00:40.423 --> 00:00:44.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including all the tools
in our Teaching Toolbox.

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:48.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would you say is our destination?

00:00:48.598 --> 00:00:51.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the most important goal

00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:54.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are trying
to accomplish in our ministry?

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it placing literature?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
directing people to jw.org®?

00:01:00.777 --> 00:01:03.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making return visits?

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting Bible studies?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
educating people about the Bible?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or making disciples
of Christ Jesus and baptizing them?

00:01:16.059 --> 00:01:18.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each of those goals has value.

00:01:18.862 --> 00:01:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But which one is our primary goal?

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the destination that we want to reach?

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:28.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus identified it

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 28:19, 20.

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:33.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he said:

00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:37.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, therefore, and make disciples

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of people of all the nations,
baptizing them in the name

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:46.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the Father and
of the Son and of the holy spirit,

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“teaching them to observe all the things

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:52.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have commanded you.”

00:01:52.595 --> 00:01:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our destination, then,
is a baptized disciple.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each person we meet,

00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:04.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each piece of literature that we place,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each time we direct attention to the website,

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each return visit we make,

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each Bible study we conduct

00:02:12.615 --> 00:02:14.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we should have the final goal

00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:19.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of making a baptized disciple.

00:02:19.055 --> 00:02:22.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is baptism essential?

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put simply, it’s because baptism

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is necessary for salvation.

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:30.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what the Bible tells us

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Peter 3:21:

00:02:36.172 --> 00:02:40.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Baptism . . . is also now saving you

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“(not by the removing
of the filth of the flesh,

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:47.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but by the request to God
for a good conscience),

00:02:47.517 --> 00:02:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.”

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from the time
we meet an interested person,

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:58.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to have our eyes on that goal

00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:01.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of making a baptized disciple.

00:03:01.698 --> 00:03:06.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, the November 1977 <i>Kingdom Ministry </i>

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made this statement
regarding those we study with:

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Our discussions should reflect

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:16.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a genuine <i>personal </i> interest in the student

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:20.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as a potential disciple and therefore

00:03:20.083 --> 00:03:24.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a potential brother or sister in the faith.”

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t have that end-point

00:03:27.357 --> 00:03:31.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a baptized disciple fixed firmly in mind,

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could end up stuck on side roads.

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, watch this video,

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if you can identify
the problem that our brother has.

00:03:45.074 --> 00:03:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going out
in field service after lunch?

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I’m going to be there, but I’ve got
one return visit that I’ve got to make.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, see you.

00:03:51.147 --> 00:03:51.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you.

00:03:59.422 --> 00:04:02.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My neighbor lost his job after 20 years,

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:04.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a result,
he’s got to move out of his house,

00:04:05.495 --> 00:04:07.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
got to move into an apartment.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to go help him out a little bit

00:04:10.133 --> 00:04:14.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pack up to make it a little easier
for him to make that move.

00:04:15.972 --> 00:04:18.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know,
won’t it be nice at a time period

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:21.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we don’t have to worry
about economic troubles like that?

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:22.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, it will.

00:04:22.545 --> 00:04:24.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, you know,
that’s why I’m so happy

00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my grandchildren
chose to go for higher education.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:29.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They both landed good jobs.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know that bridge
you cross when you come here.

00:04:32.088 --> 00:04:34.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve noticed that they’re starting
to do some work on it.

00:04:34.223 --> 00:04:36.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s pretty extensive work.

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:37.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re going to replace that whole bridge.

00:04:37.727 --> 00:04:39.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to the newspaper article,

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s going to be
like a six to eight month project.

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wow!
That is a long time.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:44.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, you know, Chris,

00:04:44.867 --> 00:04:47.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the reason why I came by
is I wanted to show you this magazine.

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love these.
These are so well written.

00:04:51.307 --> 00:04:53.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 48:17 is a key scripture here.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:55.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it says:

00:04:55.178 --> 00:04:57.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am your God,

00:04:57.213 --> 00:05:01.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the One teaching you to benefit yourself.”

00:05:01.084 --> 00:05:02.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s familiar.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:05.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think your dad
read that to me once or twice.

00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:07.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How’s your dad doing anyway?

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:08.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing good.

00:05:08.358 --> 00:05:10.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, you know,
they said they’ve got more Bible studies

00:05:10.426 --> 00:05:12.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than they can even cover in one week.

00:05:12.495 --> 00:05:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, well, you know, I can remember
when you and your dad came here.

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:18.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were a little kid about this high,

00:05:18.401 --> 00:05:20.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you just stayed right by his side.

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your dad was so proud.

00:05:22.705 --> 00:05:26.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Chris,
I know my dad had offered

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:28.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study the Bible with you in the past.

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:30.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John, to be honest,

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m too old to change;

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:35.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m set in my ways now.

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:38.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that God is just going
to have to take me the way I am.

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:41.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More chocolate?

00:05:41.891 --> 00:05:44.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhm, yeah.
I don’t mind.

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:49.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you identify
with the brother in that video?

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:52.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever had a return visit with someone

00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:54.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who just loves your company?

00:05:54.537 --> 00:05:58.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve been leaving literature
with that person for months

00:05:58.107 --> 00:06:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even years—
and yet the person

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:04.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has no genuine interest in progressing.

00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:07.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that a problem?

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apparently, the person isn’t interested

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in becoming a disciple of Christ Jesus.

00:06:13.823 --> 00:06:18.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our time would be better spent
searching for other people

00:06:18.428 --> 00:06:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are “rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, that doesn’t mean
that there’s no value

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:30.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in placing literature
or leaving contact cards

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:33.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that direct people to jw.org.

00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These provisions are part
of our Teaching Toolbox for a reason.

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:41.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They can play a vital role
in reaching the hearts

00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who are “rightly disposed.”

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:48.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So continue to make good use of these tools

00:06:48.624 --> 00:06:51.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s organization provides.

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:56.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,
never lose sight of your goal

00:06:56.265 --> 00:06:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start Bible studies with interested ones

00:06:59.368 --> 00:07:01.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and then the ultimate goal:

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:06.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about a person
you’ve been studying with for years,

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:13.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the person isn’t making changes,

00:07:13.049 --> 00:07:15.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hasn’t stopped going to church,

00:07:15.318 --> 00:07:19.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shows no real interest
in attending Christian meetings?

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:23.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some people are glad
to study the Bible with us

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:27.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simply for the fact
that they value Bible education.

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we love to teach people about the Bible.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have to remember
that providing Bible education

00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:40.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for its own sake is not our primary goal.

00:07:40.176 --> 00:07:43.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, it could be a side road.

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:45.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is,

00:07:45.982 --> 00:07:49.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some people who value Bible education

00:07:49.051 --> 00:07:51.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not interested in becoming

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
baptized disciples of Jesus.

00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:58.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world is full of Bible scholars

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are highly educated in the Bible

00:08:01.197 --> 00:08:05.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but who do not become
disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:08:05.768 --> 00:08:10.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, one Bible scholar was educated

00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:13.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a Bible institute, a religious college,

00:08:13.776 --> 00:08:16.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a theological seminary.

00:08:16.546 --> 00:08:20.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He holds a doctorate in religious studies.

00:08:20.316 --> 00:08:24.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a thorough knowledge
of Biblical Greek,

00:08:24.387 --> 00:08:28.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s written 30 books about the Bible.

00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:30.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, he describes himself

00:08:30.826 --> 00:08:34.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an “agnostic atheist.”

00:08:34.363 --> 00:08:38.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So just providing Bible education

00:08:38.167 --> 00:08:41.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not our primary goal.

00:08:41.637 --> 00:08:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want people to build faith in God

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:49.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have
their own relationship with Jehovah

00:08:49.111 --> 00:08:52.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will move them toward the destination

00:08:52.815 --> 00:08:56.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of dedication and baptism.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:09:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why it’s important to honestly analyze

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the progress of our Bible students.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they simply taking in knowledge?

00:09:07.563 --> 00:09:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do they prepare in advance for the study?

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do they answer
in their own words and from their heart?

00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:18.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they making changes in their life

00:09:18.407 --> 00:09:21.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conform to what they’ve learned?

00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they attending
and benefiting from Christian meetings?

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:30.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not, we may need to follow the advice

00:09:30.353 --> 00:09:35.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>Kingdom Ministry</i>
of October 1988, which stated:

00:09:36.392 --> 00:09:40.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a student is not making
meaningful progress

00:09:40.062 --> 00:09:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after you have patiently aided him

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:46.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“over a reasonable period of time,

00:09:46.002 --> 00:09:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it may be best to use the time

00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:53.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to better advantage
searching for deserving ones.

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:55.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Depending on the circumstances,

00:09:55.878 --> 00:10:00.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may be wise to discontinue the study.”

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:04.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why is it so important to be selective

00:10:04.587 --> 00:10:06.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about who we spend our time with?

00:10:06.956 --> 00:10:09.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t conducting an unproductive study

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
better than knocking on doors
where no one is home

00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:15.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or where no one shows interest?

00:10:15.598 --> 00:10:19.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To answer that, let’s read Jesus’ words

00:10:19.068 --> 00:10:23.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 10:11-13.

00:10:23.272 --> 00:10:25.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when instructing his disciples

00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:29.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how to conduct
their ministry, Jesus said:

00:10:30.146 --> 00:10:33.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Into whatever city or village you enter,

00:10:33.616 --> 00:10:36.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“search out who in it is deserving,

00:10:36.485 --> 00:10:39.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and stay there until you leave.

00:10:39.388 --> 00:10:43.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you enter the house,
greet the household.

00:10:43.426 --> 00:10:45.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the house is deserving,

00:10:45.861 --> 00:10:49.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let the peace you wish it come upon it;

00:10:49.231 --> 00:10:51.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but if it is not deserving,

00:10:51.567 --> 00:10:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let the peace from you return upon you.”

00:10:56.072 --> 00:10:58.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In harmony with those verses,

00:10:58.574 --> 00:11:03.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to focus our attention
on deserving ones

00:11:03.112 --> 00:11:05.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus instructed,

00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:10.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

00:11:10.286 --> 00:11:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, there is a balance.

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:17.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be patient
with those we call on and study with,

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not everyone progresses at the same rate.

00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:25.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we call on people and study with them,

00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:30.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should never lose sight of our goal
—our destination—

00:11:30.906 --> 00:11:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “make disciples . . . , baptizing them.”

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have that goal clearly in mind,

00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:42.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll know when we are moving toward it,

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll know
when we are getting sidetracked.

00:11:46.055 --> 00:11:48.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could illustrate it like this:

00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:51.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of a plane on a runway.

00:11:51.761 --> 00:11:55.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That plane is like a person you’ve visited

00:11:55.197 --> 00:12:00.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you believe shows
sincere interest in the Bible’s message.

00:12:00.302 --> 00:12:03.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your short-term goal at this point

00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to get them off the runway
and into a Bible study.

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:11.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do, that means
the plane has taken off.

00:12:11.847 --> 00:12:14.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But once your study is airborne,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have to keep
your sights on your destination.

00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:21.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t just stay in the air indefinitely.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:26.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your goal is to make a baptized disciple.

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:29.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If, in a reasonable amount of time,

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:33.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the student isn’t progressing,
what will you do?

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:38.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To keep the study going
would be like flying in circles.

00:12:38.574 --> 00:12:41.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same way, a Bible study

00:12:41.877 --> 00:12:46.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s simply suspended
in the air goes nowhere.

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:48.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to land the plane

00:12:48.684 --> 00:12:52.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—either at the destination
of a baptized disciple

00:12:52.588 --> 00:12:56.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at the termination of the study.

00:12:57.293 --> 00:13:00.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if something is holding
your Bible student back

00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:03.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the destination of baptism

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:06.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe an attachment to holiday celebrations

00:13:06.802 --> 00:13:10.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an unclean habit, like smoking?

00:13:10.539 --> 00:13:15.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how this issue arises
in the following brief video.

00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:18.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started studying the Bible,

00:13:18.013 --> 00:13:21.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were various factors
that hindered my study.

00:13:21.584 --> 00:13:24.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a truck driver,
and I was on the road a lot.

00:13:24.353 --> 00:13:27.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the worst kind
of friendships,

00:13:27.089 --> 00:13:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I smoked.

00:13:28.591 --> 00:13:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I smoked, on average, 60 cigarettes a day.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that if I
was going to make the needed adjustments,

00:13:35.364 --> 00:13:37.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to change my profession.

00:13:37.366 --> 00:13:39.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I changed my job.

00:13:39.368 --> 00:13:42.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if I wanted to get baptized,
I had to stop smoking.

00:13:43.739 --> 00:13:46.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I cut down to two or three cigarettes a day.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I bought a single cigarette.

00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lit it, and I prayed to Jehovah.

00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:58.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I begged him to help me,

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:00.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he did help me

00:14:00.122 --> 00:14:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—so much so that I never smoked again.

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:05.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to this day,
I don’t even have the urge to smoke.

00:14:07.296 --> 00:14:12.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten years after my first Bible study,
I was baptized.

00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:14.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been serving Jehovah for 20 years now,

00:14:14.236 --> 00:14:17.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with my wife and all my children.

00:14:18.574 --> 00:14:22.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice this man
had to pray to Jehovah

00:14:22.194 --> 00:14:25.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get the help he needed
to overcome smoking?

00:14:25.764 --> 00:14:29.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, he had to cultivate

00:14:29.101 --> 00:14:32.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own relationship with Jehovah

00:14:32.071 --> 00:14:36.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to build the faith
he needed to stop smoking.

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:40.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same way, we need to help our students

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build their own relationship with Jehovah

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:47.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they’ll also overcome any obstacles

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:52.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that might hold them back
from progressing to baptism.

00:14:52.691 --> 00:14:57.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if you’re not
presently conducting a Bible study?

00:14:57.496 --> 00:14:59.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if you’ve never had the privilege

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:03.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of having one
of your Bible students get baptized?

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:07.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that mean your service
to Jehovah is not valuable?

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:15:09.842 --> 00:15:14.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we each
do our part in the ministry.

00:15:14.313 --> 00:15:17.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what the apostle Paul said

00:15:17.316 --> 00:15:20.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 3:6, 7:

00:15:21.186 --> 00:15:25.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I planted, Apollos watered,

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:28.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but God kept making it grow,

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that neither is
the one who plants anything

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:33.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor is the one who waters,

00:15:33.932 --> 00:15:37.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but God who makes it grow.”

00:15:38.103 --> 00:15:42.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So never feel
that your efforts are unimportant.

00:15:42.908 --> 00:15:44.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Paul said,

00:15:44.910 --> 00:15:49.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s accomplished
in the ministry is a group effort.

00:15:49.081 --> 00:15:51.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person reaches baptism,

00:15:51.483 --> 00:15:53.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it isn’t just because of the effort

00:15:53.552 --> 00:15:56.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the person who conducted the study.

00:15:56.588 --> 00:15:59.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The efforts of others played a role.

00:15:59.692 --> 00:16:03.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps someone else
initiated that person’s interest

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:06.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by placing literature
or in some other way

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:10.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving a witness.

00:16:10.002 --> 00:16:12.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember what Paul said.

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:16.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the one “who makes it grow.”

00:16:16.208 --> 00:16:19.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one that is drawing to himself

00:16:19.645 --> 00:16:24.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who are “rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:27.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a privilege we have

00:16:27.619 --> 00:16:30.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be fellow workers with Jehovah

00:16:30.222 --> 00:16:35.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we help people
become disciples of Christ Jesus!

00:16:35.227 --> 00:16:38.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we keep that goal clearly in mind,

00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:41.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how will it help us?

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:44.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t be content just to place literature

00:16:44.737 --> 00:16:48.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just to direct interest to jw.org.

00:16:48.507 --> 00:16:50.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We won’t be satisfied

00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:54.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just making return visits
or starting Bible studies.

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:59.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll always have in mind
our primary destination

00:16:59.318 --> 00:17:02.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—making disciples of Christ

00:17:02.588 --> 00:17:05.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and baptizing them.

00:17:05.724 --> 00:17:07.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We of the Governing Body

00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:14.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you work shoulder to shoulder with us

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:16.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping “rightly disposed” ones

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:21.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become baptized disciples of Jesus.
