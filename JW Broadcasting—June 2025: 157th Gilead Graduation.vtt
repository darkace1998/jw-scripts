00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:04.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
We warmly welcome all of you

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:08.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this edition of JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
March 8, 2025:

00:00:29.758 --> 00:00:32.970 line:10% position:50% align:center
graduation day for the 157th class

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.056 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:36.056 --> 00:00:38.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fifty-four graduates

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:43.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 28 countries completed months
of intense Bible instruction.

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:46.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before receiving their diplomas,

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:48.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
what parting words of encouragement

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:52.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
did they receive
from members of the Governing Body,

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:55.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
their instructors,
and other experienced brothers?

00:00:55.951 --> 00:01:00.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are pleased to share with you
parts of that graduation program,

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was held
at the Watchtower Educational Center

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:05.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Patterson, New York.

00:01:07.755 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear Gilead students, this is your day!

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:14.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe it?

00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:18.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Graduation day, March 8, 2025.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems like just yesterday you were
being introduced to the Bethel family,

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how quickly five months passes!

00:01:26.732 --> 00:01:28.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today you will become graduates.

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:32.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re thrilled to be here
with you on this special day!

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, this day will have

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:38.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
highs and lows,

00:01:38.452 --> 00:01:41.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe as you think about departing

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
and separating from your class 157 family.

00:01:46.585 --> 00:01:51.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve become closer
than brothers and sisters during this time.

00:01:51.465 --> 00:01:56.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be bittersweet, perhaps,
as you contemplate departing.

00:01:56.178 --> 00:01:58.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
One recent graduate expressed

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:02.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it is like having a wedding
and a funeral in the same day.

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
But during the past five months,

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:11.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve developed
a spiritual feeding program like no other

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:17.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
with study and preparation
in advance of each day in the classroom.

00:02:17.032 --> 00:02:19.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember the intensity.

00:02:19.243 --> 00:02:21.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember the blood, the sweat, the tears,

00:02:21.954 --> 00:02:24.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a sense, as you prepared for classes,

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:26.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you prepared for tests

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the challenge
of keeping up with all of that.

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:31.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe the last couple of days

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:34.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve gone through Gilead withdrawal,
in a sense.

00:02:35.175 --> 00:02:37.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
For that reason,
in my introductory comments,

00:02:37.261 --> 00:02:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would like to address the theme

00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:43.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stay Hungry—Stay Thirsty.”

00:02:43.976 --> 00:02:46.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, stay hungry.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider two things

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you should continue to hunger for

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
moving forward
in your sacred service to Jehovah.

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to open to Matthew chapter 5,
and notice with me, please, verse 3.

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know what this verse says.

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:07.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount
—Matthew 5:3—there he said:

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:12.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are those
conscious of their spiritual need,

00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:16.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
since the Kingdom of the heavens
belongs to them.”

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
So “happy are those
conscious of their spiritual need,”

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “those who are beggars for the spirit,”
as we note in the footnote,

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:26.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we might even say,
‘those who are hungry for spiritual food.’

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry.

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be like a bear just before hibernation.

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:39.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
They enter a state called hyperphagia,

00:03:39.156 --> 00:03:41.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
or increased appetite.

00:03:41.366 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
During that time period,
some bears consume 20,000 calories a day.

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:50.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re searching for food
20 out of 24 hours a day.

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:54.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe during Gilead School,
you were hungry as a bear,

00:03:55.756 --> 00:03:58.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
devouring food, eating it up spiritually

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:01.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, at times, maybe literally as well.

00:04:01.053 --> 00:04:05.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you hoping to shed a few pounds
after you depart school?

00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:08.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in a spiritual sense,
what’s the major difference

00:04:08.727 --> 00:04:13.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
between being hungry as a bear
prior to hibernation and you?

00:04:14.483 --> 00:04:16.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you’re not going into hibernation.

00:04:17.986 --> 00:04:20.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s very little downtime
between the end of class

00:04:20.656 --> 00:04:24.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and starting in your theocratic assignments.

00:04:24.034 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t live off the fat
you’ve stored up at Gilead.

00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:31.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can expect to face bigger tests
in your assignments

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
than you even had in the classroom.

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
So instead of a bear before hibernation,

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:41.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s compare your situation
to a bird before migration.

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:46.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
They too enter a state called hyperphagia

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:49.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prepare them for their long flights,
to prepare them for the work ahead.

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:51.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might not be migrating

00:04:51.728 --> 00:04:54.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
(although some of you will be, yes),

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
but maybe you received a new assignment

00:04:56.817 --> 00:04:59.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
for which you need
to keep strengthening your spirituality.

00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:01.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the key to success?

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:06.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry—stay hungry.

00:05:06.702 --> 00:05:08.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will Jehovah satisfy your hunger?

00:05:08.745 --> 00:05:11.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what can we learn
from a miracle that Jesus performed?

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:15.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you turn to John chapter 6,
notice with me, please, in verse 11,

00:05:17.296 --> 00:05:21.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of Jesus’ miracles
where he fed a multitude

00:05:21.008 --> 00:05:23.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
—John 6:11.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again the question is,
Will Jehovah satisfy your spiritual hunger?

00:05:27.306 --> 00:05:29.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what’s expressed here—John 6:11:

00:05:29.683 --> 00:05:32.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus took the bread,
and after giving thanks,

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:34.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he distributed it
to those who were sitting there;

00:05:34.688 --> 00:05:36.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he did likewise with the small fish,

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:42.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had as much as they wanted.”

00:05:44.281 --> 00:05:46.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus multiplied five loaves and two fish

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fed possibly over 15,000 people.

00:05:50.287 --> 00:05:54.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many people
is he feeding spiritually in our day?

00:05:54.124 --> 00:05:55.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Millions.

00:05:58.462 --> 00:06:00.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result?

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:04.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back then “they had as much as they wanted.”

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so that’s true of you as well.

00:06:06.553 --> 00:06:08.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry.

00:06:08.013 --> 00:06:09.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to feed spiritually.

00:06:09.806 --> 00:06:12.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can have as much as you want.

00:06:12.142 --> 00:06:15.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
what’s available in <i> JW Library</i>®  alone?

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 330 Morning Worship programs,
over ten years of broadcasts

00:06:19.441 --> 00:06:22.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that’s more than
120 hours of spiritual food.

00:06:22.986 --> 00:06:27.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three complete years
of regional conventions from 2020 to 2022

00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:29.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we can watch them again if we choose.

00:06:29.952 --> 00:06:33.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s just some of the video content,
not to mention audio, including music.

00:06:33.997 --> 00:06:35.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about written publications?

00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:39.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower </i> magazines
go back to 1950;

00:06:39.544 --> 00:06:42.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>Awake! </i> magazines go back to 1970;

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:48.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
1,815 <i>Watchtower</i>  magazines are available;

00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:52.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
1,011 <i>Awake!</i>  magazines
are available just in <i> JW Library.</i>

00:06:54.142 --> 00:06:57.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is Jehovah through his Son
providing meat in due season?

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:00.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:07:00.232 --> 00:07:02.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 25:6 says:

00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:04.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In this mountain Jehovah of armies

00:07:04.444 --> 00:07:07.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will make for all the peoples
a banquet of rich dishes,

00:07:07.197 --> 00:07:10.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a banquet of fine wine,
of rich dishes filled with marrow,

00:07:10.701 --> 00:07:12.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
of fine, filtered wine.”

00:07:12.744 --> 00:07:14.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are well-fed spiritually.

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:17.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can have as much as we want.

00:07:18.458 --> 00:07:23.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah through his Son
provided in the first century;

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:25.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah through his Son

00:07:25.215 --> 00:07:28.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
is providing spiritually
for his people in our day.

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:30.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry.

00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:33.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, do you ever eat
your favorite meal and say,

00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:37.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’ll never have that again’?

00:07:37.102 --> 00:07:39.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we keep coming back.

00:07:39.896 --> 00:07:42.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the point in a spiritual sense?

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:45.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can continue to feed
on some of the things

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:48.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve enjoyed in the past.

00:07:48.155 --> 00:07:51.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although we like to hear new things,
maybe refinements in our understanding,

00:07:51.408 --> 00:07:53.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s good to go back
and review what we already know

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:56.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
to drive in the nails, so to speak.

00:07:56.204 --> 00:07:57.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:00.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, although we like to hear
new things at times,

00:08:00.876 --> 00:08:02.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
go back to your Gilead notes.

00:08:04.254 --> 00:08:07.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to drive in the nails.

00:08:07.424 --> 00:08:08.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry.

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:11.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never become satiated, or fully satisfied.

00:08:11.261 --> 00:08:15.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of a study period,
crave the next study period.

00:08:15.098 --> 00:08:16.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s next on the menu?

00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:19.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s our hunger for spiritual food.

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:22.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider one more hunger.

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:24.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re still there in Matthew,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice Jesus’ words in verse 6:

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:33.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy are those hungering
and thirsting for righteousness,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
since they will be filled.”

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:38.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
So who are such ones?

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:39.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note says:

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:43.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is, those who long to see
corruption and injustice replaced

00:08:43.627 --> 00:08:45.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with God’s standards of right and wrong;

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
they strive to conform to those standards.”

00:08:48.173 --> 00:08:50.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:08:50.175 --> 00:08:53.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry for Jehovah’s righteousness.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:56.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how does Jehovah
satisfy our hunger for righteousness?

00:08:56.306 --> 00:08:58.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
One <i>Watchtower </i> stated this:

00:08:58.141 --> 00:09:00.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Spiritual hunger
and thirst for righteousness

00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:03.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be fully satisfied in the new world.”

00:09:03.814 --> 00:09:06.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we “keep in expectation.”

00:09:06.858 --> 00:09:10.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another <i>Watchtower</i>  stated:
“Let us not lose heart or be amazed

00:09:10.487 --> 00:09:15.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
that oppression and violence have taken away
righteousness in the satanic world.”

00:09:16.410 --> 00:09:21.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we do not become insensitive
to the circumstances,

00:09:21.289 --> 00:09:23.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unrighteousness of this world.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:28.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
We avoid the path of the ridiculors,
as mentioned at 2 Peter 3:4,

00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:30.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
who say

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:34.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “all things are continuing exactly
as they were from creation’s beginning.”

00:09:34.052 --> 00:09:35.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:09:36.388 --> 00:09:38.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world’s moral decay

00:09:38.974 --> 00:09:43.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
is evidence that God’s Kingdom
and his righteousness are close at hand.

00:09:43.854 --> 00:09:46.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how we take comfort in that!

00:09:46.398 --> 00:09:51.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry for God’s righteousness,
confident that you will be filled.

00:09:51.319 --> 00:09:56.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear Gilead students,
stay hungry for spiritual food.

00:09:56.032 --> 00:09:58.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry for God’s righteousness.

00:09:59.828 --> 00:10:01.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about staying thirsty?

00:10:01.997 --> 00:10:05.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ll talk about that
at the end of the program.

00:10:09.463 --> 00:10:11.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next part of our program

00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:14.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
is something we always look forward to,
<i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:10:14.968 --> 00:10:19.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this one will feature
interviews of Gilead students

00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:22.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
from branches that care for nearly 25 percent

00:10:22.851 --> 00:10:24.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the publishers worldwide.

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:27.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Trent Lippold,
another of the Gilead instructors,

00:10:27.481 --> 00:10:29.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
will care for the interviews.

00:10:29.483 --> 00:10:31.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which countries are these?

00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:32.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:04.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to <i>The Inside Story</i>.

00:11:04.059 --> 00:11:06.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the book of Acts chapter 1, verse 8,

00:11:06.102 --> 00:11:08.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said to his disciples that they
would be witnesses of him

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:11.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:11:11.441 --> 00:11:14.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today we are going to meet guests
from the 157th class

00:11:14.611 --> 00:11:17.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are serving
in “distant part[s] of the earth.”

00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:21.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s meet our first guest,
Brother Fernando Simão from Brazil.

00:11:36.007 --> 00:11:37.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, Fernando.

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:38.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:11:38.385 --> 00:11:39.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good to have you on <i>The Inside Story</i>.

00:11:39.636 --> 00:11:40.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
A pleasure.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
You come from Brazil.

00:11:41.763 --> 00:11:43.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re serving at the branch there
in São Paulo.

00:11:43.515 --> 00:11:44.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:44.975 --> 00:11:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know there is a place in Brazil
that is very close to your heart.

00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:49.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:11:49.896 --> 00:11:52.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love the Amazon region.

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:56.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is it about the Amazon region,
Fernando?

00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:59.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe two words: the people.

00:11:59.072 --> 00:12:00.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:12:00.031 --> 00:12:02.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are amazing.

00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:03.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m interested.

00:12:03.285 --> 00:12:05.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it about the people there?

00:12:05.245 --> 00:12:07.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
They really accept the truth.

00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:12.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have a good inclination to serve Jehovah

00:12:12.544 --> 00:12:15.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to hear about God.

00:12:15.046 --> 00:12:17.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s amazing because

00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:22.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are able to preach to them all the time.

00:12:22.554 --> 00:12:25.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is it like
to actually preach to them?

00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:27.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s it like to converse with them?

00:12:27.434 --> 00:12:30.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can talk about many different matters.

00:12:30.562 --> 00:12:34.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
But since they live
in the middle of the jungle,

00:12:34.524 --> 00:12:38.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
the middle of the creation
that Jehovah made for us,

00:12:39.613 --> 00:12:42.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can use that to help them.

00:12:42.282 --> 00:12:45.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, they face some challenges

00:12:45.076 --> 00:12:48.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the new world will solve,

00:12:48.997 --> 00:12:52.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this can be the matter
that we talk with them about.

00:12:52.667 --> 00:12:53.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:12:53.793 --> 00:12:58.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how is it
that you first visited the Amazon?

00:12:58.423 --> 00:13:02.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been there many years ago.

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:04.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
We received in our house

00:13:04.012 --> 00:13:08.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
a brother who went to MTS in São Paulo,

00:13:08.099 --> 00:13:12.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was serving at that time
on a boat over there.

00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:14.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he invited us to visit.

00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:18.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I went there with my two fleshly brothers

00:13:18.068 --> 00:13:20.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the first time.

00:13:20.195 --> 00:13:21.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:13:21.237 --> 00:13:24.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he started a fire in you . . .

00:13:24.115 --> 00:13:24.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:24.991 --> 00:13:26.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . for the Amazon region.

00:13:26.326 --> 00:13:29.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have they had preaching campaigns
in the region?

00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:30.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:30.955 --> 00:13:35.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had this a few years ago

00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:38.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a big campaign with a lot of good results.

00:13:38.463 --> 00:13:41.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw an increase over there.

00:13:41.341 --> 00:13:44.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many people are coming into the truth

00:13:44.135 --> 00:13:47.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
—new congregations and new circuits.

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:51.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many brothers
are supporting the work over there.

00:13:51.226 --> 00:13:54.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
You mentioned something
that really touched you

00:13:54.604 --> 00:13:58.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the brothers who participated
in the preaching campaigns.

00:13:58.233 --> 00:13:59.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us about that?

00:13:59.526 --> 00:14:03.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few of them decided to stay.

00:14:04.739 --> 00:14:08.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
They went just to support
for maybe one week or two weeks.

00:14:08.535 --> 00:14:12.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then they noticed the need,

00:14:12.288 --> 00:14:13.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they decided to stay.

00:14:13.707 --> 00:14:15.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
They moved over there.

00:14:15.125 --> 00:14:18.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are serving and taking the lead
in the congregation.

00:14:18.962 --> 00:14:21.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me, it’s amazing.

00:14:22.298 --> 00:14:25.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that in Brazil
you have some SKE schools.

00:14:25.176 --> 00:14:28.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
How has SKE been used to support
the work in the Amazon region?

00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:32.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are sending, in the last years,

00:14:32.434 --> 00:14:35.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
many brothers to serve over there.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:39.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the school, they are assigned

00:14:39.232 --> 00:14:42.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those congregations that need help.

00:14:42.902 --> 00:14:45.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s been

00:14:45.864 --> 00:14:48.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
an amazing gift from Jehovah, actually,

00:14:48.533 --> 00:14:51.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help the growth over there.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:53.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very nice.

00:14:53.037 --> 00:14:56.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Brazil branch
and Audio/Video Services (AVS)

00:14:56.291 --> 00:14:58.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
have prepared a video about preaching . . .

00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:59.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:14:59.753 --> 00:15:00.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . in the Amazon region.

00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:02.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’m really looking forward to seeing

00:15:02.756 --> 00:15:04.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
what it’s like there
and why it’s so special to you.

00:15:04.841 --> 00:15:06.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s enjoy it together.

00:15:06.134 --> 00:15:07.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see.

00:15:14.392 --> 00:15:17.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brazil is vast.

00:15:17.353 --> 00:15:20.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the largest country in South America

00:15:20.774 --> 00:15:23.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fifth largest in the world.

00:15:24.819 --> 00:15:28.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
It contains a wide range of landscapes,

00:15:28.239 --> 00:15:31.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
including wetlands, savannas,

00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:34.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
mountains, and rainforests.

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:39.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is home to the largest river system
in the world,

00:15:39.292 --> 00:15:41.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
the mighty Amazon.

00:15:42.337 --> 00:15:45.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have about 920,000 publishers in Brazil.

00:15:47.091 --> 00:15:48.968 line:10% position:50% align:center
New congregations and new circuits

00:15:48.968 --> 00:15:50.804 line:10% position:50% align:center
are being formed every year,

00:15:50.804 --> 00:15:52.347 line:10% position:50% align:center
with approximately 

00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:55.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
25,000 people getting baptized each year.

00:15:56.726 --> 00:16:00.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Brazil is on fire!

00:16:00.438 --> 00:16:02.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, there is still

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
much work to be done.

00:16:04.692 --> 00:16:06.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know?

00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:07.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are more than 

00:16:07.862 --> 00:16:11.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
28 million people living
in the Amazon region of Brazil,

00:16:11.115 --> 00:16:14.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hundreds of indigenous languages
are spoken there.

00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
An incredible help has been

00:16:18.581 --> 00:16:21.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers (SKE).

00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:25.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in Brazil,
we have two educational centers for SKE,

00:16:27.006 --> 00:16:29.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as some satellite locations.

00:16:29.884 --> 00:16:33.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past two years alone,
54 classes have been held.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:38.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
The school is very focused
on the Amazon region

00:16:38.977 --> 00:16:41.020 line:10% position:50% align:center
because there is such a need there.

00:16:42.438 --> 00:16:44.983 line:10% position:50% align:center
In fact, a quarter of all graduates

00:16:44.983 --> 00:16:47.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Brazil go to that area.

00:16:48.361 --> 00:16:51.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
But once the graduates arrive,

00:16:51.406 --> 00:16:53.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are not left on their own.

00:16:54.742 --> 00:16:56.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
The local brothers teach them things

00:16:56.578 --> 00:16:59.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
like what to say or not say

00:16:59.205 --> 00:17:01.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how to act in certain situations.

00:17:02.792 --> 00:17:05.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
The teachers are the local brothers.

00:17:05.879 --> 00:17:07.171 line:10% position:50% align:center
The dynamics of preaching

00:17:07.171 --> 00:17:08.256 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the Amazon region

00:17:08.256 --> 00:17:11.009 line:10% position:50% align:center
involves traveling great distances.

00:17:12.176 --> 00:17:14.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember during our first visits
into the interior,

00:17:14.971 --> 00:17:17.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
the local brothers would say, “Brother,

00:17:17.473 --> 00:17:20.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
you need more time here
for us to go into the interior.”

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought, ‘I’m already in the interior!’

00:17:24.731 --> 00:17:27.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we discovered that there is an interior
of the interior, 

00:17:27.275 --> 00:17:31.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
which involves even more days of travel
and longer boat trips.

00:17:33.865 --> 00:17:37.911 line:10% position:50% align:center
We graduated from SKE on October 6, 2024,

00:17:39.162 --> 00:17:41.623 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we were assigned to the Amazonas region.

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:46.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made us a bit anxious at first

00:17:46.544 --> 00:17:48.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we had no idea

00:17:48.922 --> 00:17:52.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
what that area would be like
or if we would find work or not.

00:17:55.303 --> 00:17:58.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly,
we expected it to be more difficult,

00:17:58.431 --> 00:18:00.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was completely the opposite.

00:18:01.434 --> 00:18:03.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re doing really well here.

00:18:06.439 --> 00:18:09.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
This assignment has been a true gift for us.

00:18:11.986 --> 00:18:14.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Field service in the Amazon is great!

00:18:14.656 --> 00:18:16.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are so receptive.

00:18:18.284 --> 00:18:21.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can see, Brazil is a big country

00:18:21.371 --> 00:18:24.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a big heart to go with it.

00:18:27.251 --> 00:18:31.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is indeed blessing
our hardworking brothers

00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:33.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sisters

00:18:33.424 --> 00:18:35.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they joyfully share

00:18:35.843 --> 00:18:39.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
in reaching those
in the remote areas of Brazil.

00:19:15.049 --> 00:19:17.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is amazing, Fernando!

00:19:17.051 --> 00:19:21.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, really impressive, the work
that’s going on there in that region.

00:19:21.723 --> 00:19:23.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:19:23.141 --> 00:19:27.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
May I ask you, What has been
your longest trip to the Amazon region?

00:19:27.395 --> 00:19:31.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been there for more than 20 days,

00:19:31.691 --> 00:19:34.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
20-25 days, around that.

00:19:34.152 --> 00:19:35.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:19:35.153 --> 00:19:37.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long did it take you to get there?

00:19:37.196 --> 00:19:40.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes more than one day by boat.

00:19:40.992 --> 00:19:43.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what they call a slow boat.

00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:46.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have fast boats and airplanes.

00:19:46.914 --> 00:19:49.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s nice.

00:19:49.042 --> 00:19:50.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can enjoy the trip.

00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very beautiful—an amazing river.

00:19:53.588 --> 00:19:55.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever way you go
to be able to preach the word, . . .

00:19:55.673 --> 00:19:56.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:19:56.507 --> 00:19:57.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . it’s a great privilege. 

00:19:57.717 --> 00:19:58.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, Fernando.

00:19:58.843 --> 00:20:02.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thanks for sharing your special place
with us here on <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:20:02.388 --> 00:20:03.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
A pleasure.

00:20:03.848 --> 00:20:05.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s meet our next guests.

00:20:05.892 --> 00:20:09.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re Carla and Judah Curran,
from Central America.

00:20:23.910 --> 00:20:25.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Carla and Judah, nice to have you 

00:20:25.953 --> 00:20:27.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
here on <i>The Inside Story</i>.

00:20:27.455 --> 00:20:29.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re both serving presently

00:20:29.582 --> 00:20:32.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Mexico at the Central America branch.

00:20:32.085 --> 00:20:34.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long have you been in Mexico?

00:20:34.504 --> 00:20:36.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seven years now, not too long.

00:20:36.422 --> 00:20:38.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were serving in Honduras
in the field before that.

00:20:38.966 --> 00:20:40.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:20:40.718 --> 00:20:43.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you come from Canada,
but how did you get to Honduras?

00:20:44.639 --> 00:20:45.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents.

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:48.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
So growing up, Mom and Dad
were always looking

00:20:48.643 --> 00:20:50.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
for where to serve where the need was great.

00:20:50.812 --> 00:20:53.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we moved a lot when I was a kid.

00:20:53.064 --> 00:20:55.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a brother and a sister.

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:58.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our family of five
was constantly on the move.

00:20:58.611 --> 00:21:03.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I was 15, Mom and Dad told us,

00:21:03.533 --> 00:21:06.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We’re thinking next move: Honduras.”

00:21:07.412 --> 00:21:10.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we thought, ‘OK, sounds fun.’

00:21:10.832 --> 00:21:14.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, literally, we just packed our car

00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:16.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
(everything we could
inside our car or on top of our car),

00:21:16.504 --> 00:21:20.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
said goodbye to our family in Canada,

00:21:20.007 --> 00:21:23.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
and drove from Canada to Honduras.

00:21:23.136 --> 00:21:24.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as a kid,

00:21:24.387 --> 00:21:29.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
a 15-year-old, Honduras became home.

00:21:29.058 --> 00:21:31.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ministry became my life.

00:21:31.227 --> 00:21:34.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started pioneering soon after we got there.

00:21:34.522 --> 00:21:37.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I got appointed as a special pioneer.

00:21:37.775 --> 00:21:41.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was really nice to be assigned
to isolated areas of the country as well.

00:21:41.404 --> 00:21:44.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
I got to serve on an island called Guanaja

00:21:44.449 --> 00:21:48.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Mosquito Coast—beautiful experiences
throughout the country.

00:21:48.411 --> 00:21:49.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very nice.

00:21:49.704 --> 00:21:51.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I know you told me
your dad is a planner.

00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:54.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
So maybe to a 15-year-old, it felt like you
just packed the car and left, but—

00:21:54.167 --> 00:21:56.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
He probably did more than that,
but it seemed like that.

00:21:56.961 --> 00:21:57.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:21:58.504 --> 00:22:00.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about you, Carla?

00:22:00.131 --> 00:22:02.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you get to Honduras?

00:22:02.008 --> 00:22:03.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I was born in Ireland.

00:22:03.509 --> 00:22:06.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my parents are from England.

00:22:06.888 --> 00:22:09.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were both intrepid
when they were younger.

00:22:09.015 --> 00:22:11.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
They moved to Ireland
to serve where the need was greater.

00:22:11.642 --> 00:22:15.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
They met there, got married,
started special pioneering together.

00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when my brother and I came along,

00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:20.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
they carried on
special pioneering together with us.

00:22:20.651 --> 00:22:22.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we were raised in the ministry.

00:22:22.862 --> 00:22:27.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they really loved it,
and they helped us to love it as well.

00:22:27.241 --> 00:22:30.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I moved away from home

00:22:30.077 --> 00:22:32.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
after I finished school,
I started pioneering.

00:22:32.955 --> 00:22:36.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I just carried on
enjoying the ministry.

00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:38.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
But around that time, there were a lot

00:22:38.377 --> 00:22:42.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
of my friends who were reaching out
to serve where the need was greater abroad.

00:22:42.006 --> 00:22:44.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was something I, I don’t know—

00:22:44.342 --> 00:22:47.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
It became a good goal for me as well, 
to expand my ministry.

00:22:47.887 --> 00:22:51.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one day, a friend invited me.

00:22:51.098 --> 00:22:52.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
She sent me a message.

00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:55.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said: “There’s a chance for us
to go to Honduras together.

00:22:55.478 --> 00:22:59.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a small island called Guanaja,
in the middle of the Caribbean.”

00:22:59.565 --> 00:23:00.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like, why not?

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:03.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t sound like something
you should turn down.

00:23:03.819 --> 00:23:06.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the time, I had no money;
I had nothing in the bank.

00:23:06.948 --> 00:23:10.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was filling my car with two dollars’ worth
of petrol at a time.

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:12.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
We weren’t going very far.

00:23:12.537 --> 00:23:16.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just at that time,
within the half hour of her message,

00:23:16.707 --> 00:23:21.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
my work offered me a full-time position
just for a couple of months.

00:23:21.128 --> 00:23:22.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said yes.

00:23:22.505 --> 00:23:25.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah gave me a way to go to Honduras.

00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I went after three months of working,

00:23:28.386 --> 00:23:32.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I arrived in a very small little island
in the middle of the Caribbean.

00:23:32.056 --> 00:23:34.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a special pioneer

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had red hair picked me up in a boat.

00:23:36.352 --> 00:23:38.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this was him.

00:23:38.896 --> 00:23:40.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were married within the year.

00:23:42.608 --> 00:23:44.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
You said, Judah,

00:23:44.193 --> 00:23:47.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it became home for you.

00:23:47.113 --> 00:23:51.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there anything specific
about Honduras or Central America,

00:23:51.701 --> 00:23:54.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Mexico, that made it feel like home?

00:23:54.912 --> 00:23:57.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Fernando said, the people.

00:23:57.123 --> 00:23:59.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
And

00:23:59.584 --> 00:24:02.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
when my family arrived to Honduras,
we saw it right away.

00:24:02.461 --> 00:24:04.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like I mentioned, we drove to Honduras.

00:24:04.839 --> 00:24:07.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So seven days and a family of five

00:24:07.883 --> 00:24:11.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
sitting together, you can imagine
what that journey would have been like.

00:24:11.178 --> 00:24:14.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when arriving in the country,
we arrived in the middle of a hurricane,

00:24:14.807 --> 00:24:16.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we didn’t know about
when we left Canada.

00:24:16.851 --> 00:24:19.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
So on day seven coming into Honduras,

00:24:19.562 --> 00:24:22.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
we caught Hurricane Mitch.

00:24:22.023 --> 00:24:25.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were driving through the country

00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:27.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the pouring rain and got to a little town

00:24:27.653 --> 00:24:30.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we got stuck.

00:24:30.239 --> 00:24:31.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no going forward.

00:24:31.824 --> 00:24:33.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
The road was blocked by water.
We went back.

00:24:33.826 --> 00:24:35.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had closed the bridge already.

00:24:35.953 --> 00:24:38.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we couldn’t speak the language,

00:24:38.205 --> 00:24:40.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re stuck in a little town.

00:24:40.249 --> 00:24:43.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Dad just rolled the window down

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said all he could in Spanish: 

00:24:45.671 --> 00:24:47.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Testigos de Jehová,”</i>

00:24:47.465 --> 00:24:50.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
something like that in his broken Spanish:
“Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:24:50.676 --> 00:24:53.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
He spoke better Spanish after that.

00:24:53.137 --> 00:24:55.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sure enough, 
the man who was there pointed.

00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a sister just there.

00:24:57.433 --> 00:25:00.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the, I think, seven publishers
in that town at the time.

00:25:00.853 --> 00:25:02.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they took us in.

00:25:02.855 --> 00:25:06.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were in the middle
of a hurricane, suffering,

00:25:06.233 --> 00:25:08.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were happy to have us.

00:25:09.487 --> 00:25:11.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were feeding us fried chicken.

00:25:11.322 --> 00:25:13.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the sisters
had a little restaurant there.

00:25:13.199 --> 00:25:14.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were excited about that.

00:25:16.535 --> 00:25:17.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for a few days,
we were stuck in this town.

00:25:17.828 --> 00:25:19.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what a welcome we got in their homes!

00:25:19.955 --> 00:25:21.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s how it was everywhere we went.

00:25:21.957 --> 00:25:24.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just into people’s homes
—they would love to have us.

00:25:24.543 --> 00:25:27.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was such a warm family.

00:25:27.004 --> 00:25:29.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
A warm welcome and hospitality—

00:25:29.173 --> 00:25:31.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you describe
the hospitality, Carla?

00:25:31.801 --> 00:25:34.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I would say
that straightaway you’re in.

00:25:34.679 --> 00:25:36.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re in with them.

00:25:36.472 --> 00:25:38.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you mean by that?

00:25:38.474 --> 00:25:41.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
As in there’s no breaking-the-ice phase.

00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:42.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no warming-up-to-you phase.

00:25:42.978 --> 00:25:45.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like straightaway,
as soon as you arrive in the congregation,

00:25:45.272 --> 00:25:47.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re in with them.

00:25:47.608 --> 00:25:50.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you’re passing by their house,
for example,

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:54.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re thirsty; you’re hot:

00:25:54.031 --> 00:25:57.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
They invite you in; they sit you
in front of a fan; they give you water.

00:25:57.451 --> 00:25:59.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need a nap:
They have a bed; they have a hammock;

00:25:59.787 --> 00:26:01.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have a porch, if you want a porch.

00:26:01.747 --> 00:26:05.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
So their hospitality
is never just on their terms;

00:26:05.876 --> 00:26:07.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s to meet the needs that you have.

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever need you had at that time,
they were just willing to fill it.

00:26:12.049 --> 00:26:12.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:26:12.842 --> 00:26:15.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can pick you up at the airport too.

00:26:15.511 --> 00:26:16.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:26:16.762 --> 00:26:17.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is very nice.

00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:18.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned it quickly.

00:26:21.934 --> 00:26:24.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judah, for you

00:26:24.103 --> 00:26:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a young, single special pioneer,
did you enjoy the hospitality?

00:26:29.525 --> 00:26:30.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did.

00:26:30.693 --> 00:26:33.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I have to say
that it was kind of embarrassing,

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
the hospitality I was shown,
so much so that I pretty much never cooked.

00:26:38.617 --> 00:26:39.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
So—

00:26:39.493 --> 00:26:41.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
He still doesn’t.

00:26:42.163 --> 00:26:44.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why
I never got to learn how to cook.

00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:47.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were just too hospitable
in the assignments that I was in.

00:26:47.543 --> 00:26:48.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, brothers and sisters.

00:26:51.088 --> 00:26:53.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very, very nice, yeah,
that just makes it home,

00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:57.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
going to a distant land
and to be so warmly welcomed.

00:26:57.887 --> 00:26:58.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, there was

00:26:58.888 --> 00:27:00.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
an expression they would use
when they would invite me over.

00:27:00.806 --> 00:27:03.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’d say: “Just come on in.
We’ll add more water to the soup.”

00:27:03.768 --> 00:27:05.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was the expression
no matter what they were eating.

00:27:05.561 --> 00:27:07.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a figurative expression,
but it was beautiful.

00:27:07.813 --> 00:27:09.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have an expression
like that in Portuguese?

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:14.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we add water to the beans, yeah,
but the same idea.

00:27:14.361 --> 00:27:15.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:27:15.070 --> 00:27:16.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:27:16.030 --> 00:27:17.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the ministry though?

00:27:17.406 --> 00:27:20.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it like to preach
in the areas where you’ve served?

00:27:21.911 --> 00:27:24.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Central America,
in Honduras where we were,

00:27:24.205 --> 00:27:26.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s just such a respect for the Bible.

00:27:26.582 --> 00:27:29.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was so easy to start conversations.

00:27:29.376 --> 00:27:32.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that meant getting to know our Bibles.

00:27:32.171 --> 00:27:34.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember when we got there,

00:27:34.256 --> 00:27:37.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d not used the Bible much in the ministry,
maybe a verse I’d memorized.

00:27:37.843 --> 00:27:40.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then I’d be going in service
with families

00:27:40.304 --> 00:27:42.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had kids (maybe ten years old)

00:27:42.348 --> 00:27:45.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
who knew all these scriptures,
different ones they were reading.

00:27:45.309 --> 00:27:48.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m like, ‘How do they know
so many verses in the Bible?’

00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then just going more in service,

00:27:50.314 --> 00:27:53.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized it’s
because everybody wants to hear the Bible.

00:27:53.776 --> 00:27:56.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was really nice,
getting to know the Scriptures.

00:27:56.612 --> 00:27:58.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about for you, Carla?

00:27:58.572 --> 00:28:02.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
So coming from Ireland to Honduras,
was there much of a learning curve for you?

00:28:02.618 --> 00:28:05.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, the same as Judah,
just getting to know your Bible.

00:28:05.329 --> 00:28:08.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
So maybe you’re used to using
just one or two scriptures at a door.

00:28:08.833 --> 00:28:10.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
You had your favorites.

00:28:10.793 --> 00:28:13.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there you could just,
like, use the whole range of the Bible.

00:28:13.504 --> 00:28:16.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that was really nice,
getting to know the Bible better

00:28:16.423 --> 00:28:18.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also getting to know the publications

00:28:18.217 --> 00:28:21.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there are so many opportunities
to conduct Bible studies.

00:28:21.053 --> 00:28:24.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you really got familiar with them
and the publications.

00:28:24.765 --> 00:28:28.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also something I really appreciated
was you’d arrive

00:28:28.644 --> 00:28:30.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
at their house,
and they weren’t expecting you,

00:28:30.604 --> 00:28:33.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they sat you down,
and they got their Bible out.

00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:36.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you were speaking,
they would take notes and underline.

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:41.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
So seeing their appreciation
 for the Bible really helped

00:28:41.198 --> 00:28:44.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
and kind of like cemented it down for you
as well, just how amazing the Bible is.

00:28:44.952 --> 00:28:47.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, what a beautiful experience, so nice!

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:50.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch in Central America,

00:28:50.332 --> 00:28:53.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with AVS, has prepared a nice video

00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:57.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to be able to see some of these areas
and and perhaps some of this hospitality.

00:28:57.506 --> 00:28:58.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m looking forward to seeing it with you.

00:28:58.883 --> 00:29:00.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too.

00:29:05.556 --> 00:29:09.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Central America is a large region of land

00:29:09.143 --> 00:29:11.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
that includes the countries of Panama,

00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:13.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Costa Rica,

00:29:13.439 --> 00:29:15.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nicaragua,

00:29:15.566 --> 00:29:17.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honduras,

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
El Salvador,

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:21.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guatemala,

00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:22.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Belize.

00:29:24.241 --> 00:29:27.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
It extends in an arc
roughly 1,800 kilometers,

00:29:27.328 --> 00:29:31.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 1,100 miles, in length
from the northwest to the southeast.

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:35.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no matter where you live
in Central America,

00:29:35.377 --> 00:29:39.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are never more than 200 kilometers,
 or 125 miles away, from the sea.

00:29:39.924 --> 00:29:42.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
By September 2012,

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:46.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
the preaching work
in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama

00:29:48.349 --> 00:29:53.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
all came under the supervision
of the Central America branch in Mexico.

00:29:53.103 --> 00:29:56.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
What efforts are being made
to reach honesthearted ones

00:29:56.148 --> 00:29:58.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some of the diverse areas
of Central America?

00:30:00.069 --> 00:30:02.446 line:10% position:50% align:center
It has truly been a beautiful experience

00:30:02.446 --> 00:30:04.281 line:10% position:50% align:center
to be here in El Salvador.

00:30:06.659 --> 00:30:10.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
The training that we received
at the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:30:10.412 --> 00:30:13.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been so helpful because it taught us

00:30:13.207 --> 00:30:17.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
that beyond delivering a message,
it is important to have empathy

00:30:17.252 --> 00:30:20.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really listen and understand people.

00:30:24.218 --> 00:30:28.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, people here are quite religious
and devoted to their faith.

00:30:28.013 --> 00:30:30.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
I try to demonstrate Christian qualities,

00:30:30.516 --> 00:30:34.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
like those we are learning
in the <i>Love People—Make Disciples </i> brochure.

00:30:37.064 --> 00:30:40.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we observe people
and listen to what they want to express.

00:30:40.484 --> 00:30:43.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wait for the right moment
to preach to them.

00:30:44.488 --> 00:30:46.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
That indicates that Jehovah

00:30:46.156 --> 00:30:49.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
is blessing the efforts we make
to find the deserving ones.

00:30:50.119 --> 00:30:51.745 line:10% position:50% align:center
Here in La Ceiba,

00:30:51.745 --> 00:30:53.372 line:10% position:50% align:center
we preach in different languages,

00:30:53.372 --> 00:30:56.041 line:10% position:50% align:center
for example, sign language, Miskito,

00:30:56.041 --> 00:30:58.293 line:10% position:50% align:center
Garifuna, and Spanish.

00:31:00.129 --> 00:31:04.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has really blessed
the efforts of the publishers here.

00:31:04.508 --> 00:31:05.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
The local people

00:31:05.718 --> 00:31:08.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
are amazed when one greets them
in their language.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is something
that has been very positive.

00:31:17.855 --> 00:31:20.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also have the use of jw.org.

00:31:21.608 --> 00:31:23.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And their faces shine

00:31:23.694 --> 00:31:25.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they are shown
a video in their language.

00:31:27.197 --> 00:31:29.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are completely amazed and very happy

00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:32.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have made videos in their language.

00:31:35.247 --> 00:31:38.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have seen
Jehovah’s blessing in the territory

00:31:38.751 --> 00:31:41.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also seen the support from our brothers.

00:31:41.378 --> 00:31:44.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feeling like we have many partners
to preach with,

00:31:44.798 --> 00:31:49.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make return visits with,
and to conduct Bible studies with

00:31:49.511 --> 00:31:52.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this makes the ministry even more enjoyable.

00:31:53.057 --> 00:31:53.974 line:10% position:50% align:center
Mexico City

00:31:53.974 --> 00:31:55.601 line:10% position:50% align:center
is one of the largest cities in the world.

00:31:56.852 --> 00:31:59.021 line:10% position:50% align:center
The main city

00:31:59.021 --> 00:32:01.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a population of over nine million.

00:32:01.482 --> 00:32:03.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many languages are spoken

00:32:03.942 --> 00:32:08.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not just the main languages
like English, Spanish, French

00:32:08.739 --> 00:32:10.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also indigenous languages.

00:32:10.783 --> 00:32:13.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
The number of languages
present a big challenge,

00:32:13.869 --> 00:32:17.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
because how do we reach all those people?

00:32:17.081 --> 00:32:19.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one thing that has really helped is

00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:21.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
public witnessing.

00:32:21.335 --> 00:32:22.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have, for example,

00:32:22.961 --> 00:32:25.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 24 locations

00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:29.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
for special metropolitan witnessing
just in Mexico City.

00:32:29.426 --> 00:32:32.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that opens up a big opportunity
to reach people

00:32:32.471 --> 00:32:33.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their native language.

00:32:33.597 --> 00:32:37.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
So recently two groups
were formed in Haitian Creole.

00:32:37.893 --> 00:32:39.728 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s beautiful to welcome people

00:32:39.728 --> 00:32:41.480 line:10% position:50% align:center
who speak another language

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.065 line:10% position:50% align:center
and to be able to learn it to transmit

00:32:43.065 --> 00:32:45.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s message in that language.

00:32:46.944 --> 00:32:49.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can see, Central America’s

00:32:49.488 --> 00:32:52.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
diversity is also its beauty.

00:32:53.367 --> 00:32:55.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people
are “[reflecting] like mirrors”

00:32:55.661 --> 00:32:57.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
his great love

00:32:57.246 --> 00:32:59.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
by reaching out to people of all

00:32:59.164 --> 00:33:01.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
nationalities, tongues, and backgrounds.

00:33:08.674 --> 00:33:09.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remarkable!

00:33:09.675 --> 00:33:11.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for that.

00:33:11.677 --> 00:33:14.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing to see the variety

00:33:14.263 --> 00:33:16.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
of places and the work
that’s being done there.

00:33:16.306 --> 00:33:18.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed there’s a lot of water.

00:33:18.517 --> 00:33:21.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of water, a lot of beaches
—do you swim there?

00:33:21.854 --> 00:33:24.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, on the island where we were,

00:33:24.606 --> 00:33:27.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
pretty much every week
we would spend a nice day at the beach,

00:33:27.067 --> 00:33:29.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoying the water and snorkeling.

00:33:29.111 --> 00:33:31.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Crystal clear, beautiful.

00:33:31.113 --> 00:33:32.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miss it.

00:33:32.531 --> 00:33:33.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Crystal clear.

00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:36.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of water in the Amazon region
—do you swim there?

00:33:36.326 --> 00:33:38.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes,

00:33:39.037 --> 00:33:42.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s not crystal and clear all the time.

00:33:42.749 --> 00:33:46.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes we have
crocodiles and piranhas.

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to look.

00:33:51.175 --> 00:33:53.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but it’s possible to do that.

00:33:54.469 --> 00:33:57.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
But again, Judah and Carla,

00:33:57.264 --> 00:33:58.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
just a beautiful spirit we see

00:33:58.348 --> 00:33:59.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the brothers and sisters there
and the hard work.

00:33:59.975 --> 00:34:01.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much.

00:34:01.101 --> 00:34:03.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for letting us talk to you

00:34:03.937 --> 00:34:06.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the amazing preaching work
there in Central America.

00:34:06.523 --> 00:34:07.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:34:07.691 --> 00:34:09.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s meet our next guests.

00:34:09.151 --> 00:34:12.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re Christian and Karina Zaguetti,
from the Philippines.

00:34:30.589 --> 00:34:32.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christian and Karina, welcome.

00:34:32.007 --> 00:34:35.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for being here with us
on <i>The Inside Story</i>.

00:34:35.552 --> 00:34:38.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you both are serving in the Philippines
at the Philippines branch.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:42.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’re not from the Philippines;
you’re from Brazil.

00:34:42.893 --> 00:34:46.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did you get
from Brazil to the Philippines?

00:34:46.605 --> 00:34:47.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good question.

00:34:47.564 --> 00:34:50.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m asking myself how I ended up there.

00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:55.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
So actually we got transferred

00:34:55.572 --> 00:34:58.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Brazil branch
to the Philippines branch

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:02.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a project for the Computer Department,
initially for two years.

00:35:02.871 --> 00:35:05.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Initially.”
It’s a long project.

00:35:05.249 --> 00:35:09.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we’ve been there
for almost 15 years now.

00:35:09.086 --> 00:35:10.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s beautiful though.

00:35:10.337 --> 00:35:12.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did it happen?

00:35:12.047 --> 00:35:15.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it that happened
that got you to the Philippines?

00:35:15.467 --> 00:35:19.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, so we got an invitation.

00:35:19.304 --> 00:35:23.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were possibilities
for us to serve in another branch.

00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:26.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was serving single

00:35:26.687 --> 00:35:28.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Brazil for 12 years.

00:35:28.897 --> 00:35:30.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we got married.

00:35:30.315 --> 00:35:31.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was there.

00:35:31.733 --> 00:35:32.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fernando was there.

00:35:32.985 --> 00:35:33.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fernando was there?

00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:35.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.
Yeah, he was in our wedding.

00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:38.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got approved to stay in Bethel.

00:35:38.323 --> 00:35:41.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then just few months
after we got married,

00:35:41.493 --> 00:35:44.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had this possibility to serve
in another branch.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we considered.

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:46.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:49.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked about it; we prayed about it
—maybe, maybe another time.

00:35:49.668 --> 00:35:52.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
New in Bethel.

00:35:52.212 --> 00:35:54.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you ended up in the Philippines.

00:35:54.798 --> 00:35:57.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, just three months later,

00:35:57.467 --> 00:36:01.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
this next opportunity came,
a new invitation to go to the Philippines.

00:36:01.805 --> 00:36:04.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we realized that Jehovah

00:36:04.725 --> 00:36:07.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanted us to go to a foreign assignment.

00:36:07.311 --> 00:36:09.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we prayed about it, and we said yes.

00:36:09.479 --> 00:36:12.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want to be like Jonah and say no.

00:36:12.065 --> 00:36:14.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re like, “Let’s go.”

00:36:14.151 --> 00:36:16.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, well, Jonah was a courageous prophet.

00:36:16.403 --> 00:36:17.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true.

00:36:17.029 --> 00:36:18.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re courageous.

00:36:18.030 --> 00:36:19.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah went to his assignment.

00:36:19.489 --> 00:36:23.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here you are in the Philippines,
so it’s a long way from home.

00:36:24.619 --> 00:36:28.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you say that helped
make the Philippines your home?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Definitely the brotherhood,
Jehovah’s organization.

00:36:34.296 --> 00:36:36.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s truly a big family.

00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And being so far from home,

00:36:38.842 --> 00:36:41.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can feel the love from the brothers

00:36:41.553 --> 00:36:44.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation and in the Bethel family

00:36:44.014 --> 00:36:46.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how they welcomed us,

00:36:46.391 --> 00:36:49.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
how they always were so concerned
for our well-being,

00:36:49.478 --> 00:36:53.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also how they always went
out of their way to care for us.

00:36:53.648 --> 00:36:55.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was beautiful to see,

00:36:55.525 --> 00:36:58.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that definitely made us feel at home
pretty quickly.

00:36:58.278 --> 00:36:59.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure it would.

00:36:59.863 --> 00:37:03.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of an example, Christian,
of how they did that for you?

00:37:03.617 --> 00:37:07.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the brothers, they did so many things
for us to make us feel at home.

00:37:07.746 --> 00:37:09.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, I think, one thing
that touched our hearts was . . .

00:37:09.664 --> 00:37:10.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:37:10.665 --> 00:37:14.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . when we were still having
the food arrangement at Bethel.

00:37:14.544 --> 00:37:18.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we had to go down to the dining hall
to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:37:18.507 --> 00:37:21.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we had this single brother at our table,

00:37:21.468 --> 00:37:24.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bethel table in the dining hall,
and he was

00:37:24.805 --> 00:37:28.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
from one of the distant provinces
in the country.

00:37:28.683 --> 00:37:32.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were having
a little bit of a hard time

00:37:32.437 --> 00:37:34.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
having fish and rice for breakfast.

00:37:34.898 --> 00:37:36.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re still trying.

00:37:37.067 --> 00:37:38.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fish and rice.

00:37:38.443 --> 00:37:39.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, big eyes.

00:37:39.986 --> 00:37:42.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Big eyes and with the tail
—the whole fish is there.

00:37:44.282 --> 00:37:46.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this brother,
I think he was concerned about us,

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:49.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he said,
“Hey, what is your favorite food?”

00:37:49.329 --> 00:37:51.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have anything to say at the moment.

00:37:51.331 --> 00:37:54.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just thought about maybe
a hamburger with fries.

00:37:54.084 --> 00:37:56.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think that’s my favorite food, I guess.

00:37:56.128 --> 00:37:59.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
So instead of fish and rice for breakfast,
hamburger and fries for breakfast.

00:37:59.047 --> 00:38:02.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say for lunch and dinner.

00:38:02.092 --> 00:38:05.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then the following day,

00:38:05.887 --> 00:38:09.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
right in front of our Bethel room,
there was a package there.

00:38:09.891 --> 00:38:11.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:38:11.226 --> 00:38:12.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the brother gave it to us.

00:38:12.519 --> 00:38:14.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was concerned about our well-being.

00:38:14.938 --> 00:38:15.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was amazing.

00:38:15.897 --> 00:38:18.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just a little thing
but among so many others.

00:38:18.066 --> 00:38:19.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
It meant a lot.

00:38:19.067 --> 00:38:19.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:38:19.734 --> 00:38:21.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Made for us to feel at home.

00:38:21.486 --> 00:38:22.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:38:22.279 --> 00:38:24.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in the package was a hamburger and fries.

00:38:24.197 --> 00:38:25.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
A hamburger and fries.

00:38:25.657 --> 00:38:26.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made him happy.

00:38:26.741 --> 00:38:28.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Definitely.
Definitely.

00:38:28.118 --> 00:38:29.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true.

00:38:29.077 --> 00:38:30.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it would make you feel at home.

00:38:30.495 --> 00:38:32.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s absolutely beautiful.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:34.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so you’re serving at the branch.

00:38:34.124 --> 00:38:35.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch is in Manila.

00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:39.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Manila is one of the most densely
populated cities in the world.

00:38:39.296 --> 00:38:42.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is preaching like
in the city of Manila?

00:38:42.883 --> 00:38:44.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s true.

00:38:44.009 --> 00:38:46.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s one of the most densely populated 
cities in the world.

00:38:46.803 --> 00:38:48.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a lot of people everywhere.

00:38:48.638 --> 00:38:51.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the good thing is that they are really—

00:38:51.975 --> 00:38:54.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not hard to talk to people
about the truth

00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:56.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
or about the Bible, especially the Bible,

00:38:56.813 --> 00:39:00.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Judah mentioned and Fernando
mentioned about these regions.

00:39:00.066 --> 00:39:03.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they have a real respect for the Bible.

00:39:03.528 --> 00:39:07.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have all these arrangements
in place like street witnessing,

00:39:07.949 --> 00:39:12.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
metropolitan witnessing, cart witnessing.

00:39:12.287 --> 00:39:15.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a variety of business territories
to cover,

00:39:15.624 --> 00:39:17.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we also have mall witnessing.

00:39:17.709 --> 00:39:19.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mall witnessing?

00:39:19.127 --> 00:39:21.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mall witnessing is an interesting form
of preaching.

00:39:21.588 --> 00:39:25.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s hard
not get distracted by the stores.

00:39:26.718 --> 00:39:28.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I love the coffee shops there.

00:39:29.554 --> 00:39:30.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s interesting.

00:39:30.972 --> 00:39:33.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can still meet and talk to people
in these areas,

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are fine if you approach them
at the right moment, the right time.

00:39:38.605 --> 00:39:39.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
You mean in the coffee shop?

00:39:39.856 --> 00:39:41.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the coffee shop, 
it can be in the coffee shop.

00:39:41.525 --> 00:39:43.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I see why Christian loves coffee so much.

00:39:43.401 --> 00:39:44.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:39:44.778 --> 00:39:47.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would like to try to find a shopping mall

00:39:47.155 --> 00:39:49.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the middle of the Amazon rainforest . . .

00:39:51.576 --> 00:39:53.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . with a coffee shop.

00:39:53.078 --> 00:39:56.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a coffee shop, yeah, it would be nice.

00:39:57.249 --> 00:40:01.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, the branch in the Philippines
and AVS have prepared a video.

00:40:01.253 --> 00:40:04.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re looking forward to seeing
what preaching is like in the Philippines,

00:40:04.631 --> 00:40:07.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly in the Metropolitan Manila area.

00:40:07.968 --> 00:40:09.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s look at it.

00:40:11.888 --> 00:40:15.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Philippines is an island country
of Southeast Asia,

00:40:15.976 --> 00:40:18.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
located in the Pacific Ocean.

00:40:20.188 --> 00:40:24.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
It consists of more than 7,000 islands
and islets

00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:26.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 800 kilometers,

00:40:26.611 --> 00:40:29.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 500 miles, off the coast of Vietnam.

00:40:31.324 --> 00:40:32.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you know that the Philippines

00:40:32.993 --> 00:40:35.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the second most populous Asian country

00:40:35.662 --> 00:40:38.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
with English as an official language,
following India?

00:40:40.667 --> 00:40:44.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
The capital, Manila,
is part of a greater metropolitan region

00:40:44.796 --> 00:40:46.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
known as Metropolitan Manila.

00:40:48.425 --> 00:40:51.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, while this is the smallest

00:40:51.177 --> 00:40:55.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
region in the Philippines,
it is also the most densely populated,

00:40:55.307 --> 00:40:59.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
being home to over 13 million Filipinos.

00:40:59.936 --> 00:41:03.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it like to preach
in this densely populated area?

00:41:05.525 --> 00:41:06.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 10 percent

00:41:06.651 --> 00:41:08.278 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the publishers in the Philippines

00:41:08.278 --> 00:41:10.905 line:10% position:50% align:center
reside in Metro Manila.

00:41:10.905 --> 00:41:14.075 line:10% position:50% align:center
That is over 30,000 publishers.

00:41:14.075 --> 00:41:17.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, over 9,400 of them

00:41:17.412 --> 00:41:19.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
serve as regular pioneers.

00:41:19.914 --> 00:41:22.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Metro Manila is a city of contrasts.

00:41:22.917 --> 00:41:26.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has high buildings
in its central business districts.

00:41:26.838 --> 00:41:29.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also has informal settlements

00:41:29.215 --> 00:41:31.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
in narrow streets and alleyways.

00:41:31.718 --> 00:41:33.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
A street of less than a kilometer (0.6 mi)

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:36.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be home to hundreds of families.

00:41:38.224 --> 00:41:39.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some congregations in our circuit,

00:41:39.893 --> 00:41:40.769 line:10% position:50% align:center
especially those that are

00:41:40.769 --> 00:41:42.437 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the metropolitan area,

00:41:42.437 --> 00:41:43.813 line:10% position:50% align:center
are assigned to work on

00:41:43.813 --> 00:41:45.899 line:10% position:50% align:center
many apartment buildings.

00:41:45.899 --> 00:41:49.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the congregation’s body of elders
have trained specific individuals

00:41:49.319 --> 00:41:52.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to penetrate
these areas effectively.

00:41:55.367 --> 00:41:57.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some areas in Metro Manila

00:41:57.577 --> 00:42:00.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
are so densely populated
that we don’t always have

00:42:00.121 --> 00:42:03.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
accurate maps or specific addresses
for everyone.

00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:07.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it can be a real challenge to determine

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:10.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether these areas
have been well covered or not.

00:42:12.384 --> 00:42:15.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
But thanks to good theocratic training

00:42:15.595 --> 00:42:17.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and useful online tools,

00:42:17.931 --> 00:42:20.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
these areas are getting mapped out.

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:26.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Filipino Sign Language territory
is an interesting field in Metro Manila.

00:42:26.523 --> 00:42:29.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many brothers and sisters
have learned sign language

00:42:29.317 --> 00:42:33.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to help the deaf ones
learn the good news.

00:42:34.197 --> 00:42:35.365 line:10% position:50% align:center
We can see Jehovah’s blessing

00:42:35.365 --> 00:42:38.827 line:10% position:50% align:center
through the fulfillment of Haggai 2:7.

00:42:40.286 --> 00:42:42.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
It feels as though Jehovah is indeed

00:42:42.747 --> 00:42:46.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘shaking these territories
so that the precious ones,’

00:42:46.376 --> 00:42:51.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
those rightly disposed hearts,
will come to his organization and serve him.

00:42:51.297 --> 00:42:55.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personally, it’s very encouraging to see
how the brothers and sisters

00:42:55.552 --> 00:42:58.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
endure faithfully and joyfully.

00:43:00.098 --> 00:43:03.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
They endure not because
they do not have a choice.

00:43:03.852 --> 00:43:07.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
They endure because they are happy,
doing God’s work

00:43:07.105 --> 00:43:09.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and loving the people.

00:43:10.483 --> 00:43:13.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, as you can see, the Philippines

00:43:13.445 --> 00:43:15.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a preaching paradise.

00:43:15.864 --> 00:43:19.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is making sure that no one

00:43:19.033 --> 00:43:21.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
gets missed in this historic time of the end.

00:43:34.549 --> 00:43:35.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:43:35.341 --> 00:43:39.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is so much being done
and so much work to do.

00:43:39.179 --> 00:43:40.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me ask you this, though

00:43:40.638 --> 00:43:43.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
(the brother mentioned there are
so many publishers

00:43:43.016 --> 00:43:46.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Metro Manila area
and a lot of regular pioneers):

00:43:46.102 --> 00:43:49.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even with so many publishers there,

00:43:49.397 --> 00:43:52.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
is there still a need?

00:43:52.442 --> 00:43:53.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, there’s still a need.

00:43:53.651 --> 00:43:57.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s actually one of the regions
in the country

00:43:57.322 --> 00:44:00.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is growth in publishers.

00:44:00.492 --> 00:44:03.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact,

00:44:03.328 --> 00:44:07.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
nearly 20 percent of those
who were baptized in the Philippines

00:44:07.791 --> 00:44:12.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
were coming from this particular area
in Manila, in the Manila region.

00:44:12.462 --> 00:44:14.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there is growth there for sure.

00:44:14.297 --> 00:44:15.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:44:15.006 --> 00:44:17.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow, interesting!
Thank you so much.

00:44:17.383 --> 00:44:19.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christian and Karina,
thank you so much for being here.

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:22.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thank you for your self-sacrificing
spirit in being in the Philippines,

00:44:22.931 --> 00:44:26.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
making it your home, and supporting
the work that’s going on there.

00:44:26.392 --> 00:44:27.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we say thank you to all of you

00:44:27.852 --> 00:44:29.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being with us on <i>The Inside Story</i>

00:44:29.896 --> 00:44:33.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your self-sacrificing spirit
to support the preaching work.

00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:37.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said the fields
“are white for harvesting.”

00:44:37.403 --> 00:44:39.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by what we’ve seen today,
indeed they are!

00:44:39.906 --> 00:44:43.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s beautiful to see the spirit
—the intrepid spirit—

00:44:43.076 --> 00:44:47.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters in preaching
the good news of God’s Kingdom

00:44:47.413 --> 00:44:52.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to see the support
of the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:44:52.043 --> 00:44:55.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help this work grow worldwide.

00:44:55.588 --> 00:44:59.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to seeing all of you
on another edition of <i>The Inside Story</i>.

00:45:27.662 --> 00:45:30.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the time has now come

00:45:30.081 --> 00:45:33.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the principal talk of this graduation.

00:45:33.835 --> 00:45:36.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be presented
by a member of the Governing Body,

00:45:36.004 --> 00:45:37.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:40.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he has chosen the theme

00:45:40.091 --> 00:45:43.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Desirable Thing In a Man Is . . .”

00:45:43.595 --> 00:45:45.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s give him our attention.

00:45:46.306 --> 00:45:49.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is “as high as the heavens.”

00:45:49.934 --> 00:45:51.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
It “fills the earth.”

00:45:52.854 --> 00:45:57.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is extended “to a thousand generations.”

00:45:57.775 --> 00:46:00.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it “endures forever.”

00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:46:02.989 --> 00:46:07.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is one of Jehovah’s
most beautiful qualities

00:46:07.452 --> 00:46:10.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his loyal love.

00:46:10.622 --> 00:46:13.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is loyal love?

00:46:14.334 --> 00:46:17.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one of our publications says this:

00:46:17.378 --> 00:46:21.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Loyal love defies a concise definition

00:46:21.674 --> 00:46:23.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
in many languages.’

00:46:23.509 --> 00:46:25.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’d like to say English is one of them.

00:46:26.763 --> 00:46:31.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trying to find a concise definition
is not easy,

00:46:31.351 --> 00:46:33.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’ll take a stab at it.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:38.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “Glossary of Bible Terms”
in the <i>New World Translation</i>  says this:

00:46:39.233 --> 00:46:44.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Loyal love refers] to love
motivated by commitment,

00:46:44.238 --> 00:46:49.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
integrity, loyalty, and deep attachment.”

00:46:50.078 --> 00:46:52.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another reference says this:

00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:53.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is kindness

00:46:53.790 --> 00:46:57.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that lovingly attaches itself to persons,

00:46:57.877 --> 00:46:59.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“becoming evident

00:46:59.963 --> 00:47:04.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
in continual kind [actions].”

00:47:04.133 --> 00:47:06.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you get that,

00:47:06.177 --> 00:47:11.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“becoming evident
in continual kind [actions]”?

00:47:12.308 --> 00:47:16.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
But perhaps the best reference
that I’ve found

00:47:16.312 --> 00:47:18.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the one that said this:

00:47:18.523 --> 00:47:23.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The best way to grasp the essence
of the Biblical expression ‘[loyal love]’

00:47:23.528 --> 00:47:27.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is by studying how God treated

00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
his true worshippers
down through the ages.”

00:47:29.993 --> 00:47:31.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:47:31.828 --> 00:47:35.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think about how Jehovah
protected and fed the Israelites

00:47:35.957 --> 00:47:38.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they were
in the wilderness for 40 years.

00:47:38.626 --> 00:47:40.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he brought them
into the Promised Land,

00:47:40.795 --> 00:47:44.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gave them judges
to rescue them from their enemies.

00:47:44.716 --> 00:47:48.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave them prophets
to rescue them and bring them back

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:51.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they got involved in false worship.

00:47:52.098 --> 00:47:55.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because Jehovah stuck with them

00:47:55.101 --> 00:48:00.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
in good times
and in the very most difficult of times,

00:48:00.815 --> 00:48:02.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could say this to the nation.

00:48:02.817 --> 00:48:03.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it

00:48:03.860 --> 00:48:08.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jeremiah 31:3.

00:48:10.033 --> 00:48:12.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
About midway down the verse,
Jehovah says:

00:48:12.994 --> 00:48:17.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have loved you
with an everlasting love.

00:48:18.875 --> 00:48:23.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why I have drawn you to me
with loyal love.”

00:48:24.756 --> 00:48:26.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that is so true.

00:48:26.799 --> 00:48:29.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are drawn to Jehovah

00:48:29.177 --> 00:48:32.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his loyal love for us.

00:48:32.638 --> 00:48:34.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can trust it.

00:48:34.932 --> 00:48:38.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can rely on it in good times

00:48:38.269 --> 00:48:42.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the very most difficult of times
in our lives.

00:48:42.065 --> 00:48:45.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are always living in expectation

00:48:45.651 --> 00:48:48.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s loyal love,

00:48:48.154 --> 00:48:50.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
which he manifests

00:48:50.156 --> 00:48:55.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his continual kind acts
toward each of us.

00:48:55.078 --> 00:48:59.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, don’t we love
Jehovah’s loyal love?

00:49:04.504 --> 00:49:08.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, while we can never equal Jehovah
in showing loyal love,

00:49:08.841 --> 00:49:12.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Scriptures do show
that this is a quality

00:49:12.261 --> 00:49:16.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we as humans
must display toward others.

00:49:16.891 --> 00:49:20.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s read together what it says
in Proverbs chapter 3

00:49:22.438 --> 00:49:26.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 3:3.

00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:30.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Do not let loyal love

00:49:30.446 --> 00:49:32.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and faithfulness leave you.

00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:35.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Tie them around your neck;

00:49:35.451 --> 00:49:39.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
write them on the tablet of your heart.”

00:49:39.413 --> 00:49:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you learn from that?

00:49:41.958 --> 00:49:46.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are expected by Jehovah
to display loyal love.

00:49:46.921 --> 00:49:49.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how do we as humans

00:49:49.924 --> 00:49:52.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
display loyal love to other people?

00:49:53.386 --> 00:49:55.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, just as Jehovah’s loyal love

00:49:55.847 --> 00:49:59.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
causes him to attach himself to us

00:49:59.475 --> 00:50:03.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
with commitment and loyalty,

00:50:03.104 --> 00:50:07.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, we want to attach ourselves to others,

00:50:07.441 --> 00:50:11.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
not simply with warm and fuzzy feelings,

00:50:12.947 --> 00:50:16.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with continual, enduring,

00:50:16.826 --> 00:50:21.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
steadfast acts of kindness

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:23.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
that demonstrate our loyal love.

00:50:24.375 --> 00:50:26.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why is this an important topic

00:50:26.627 --> 00:50:30.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all of you who are graduating today?

00:50:30.047 --> 00:50:32.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s consider three reasons.

00:50:32.049 --> 00:50:34.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the first:

00:50:34.177 --> 00:50:37.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have all been recipients

00:50:37.847 --> 00:50:40.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
of loyal love from others.

00:50:40.433 --> 00:50:43.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did you get here to Gilead?

00:50:43.269 --> 00:50:46.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I don’t mean how did you get here
to the auditorium this morning.

00:50:47.356 --> 00:50:52.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how is it that you
got to this point in your life

00:50:52.361 --> 00:50:55.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
that today you are graduating
from the Gilead School?

00:50:56.866 --> 00:51:00.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good for all of you to pause now

00:51:00.077 --> 00:51:02.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reflect on that question.

00:51:02.622 --> 00:51:06.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who were the people who loved you?

00:51:06.417 --> 00:51:08.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who were the people who helped you

00:51:08.961 --> 00:51:12.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you could be here today graduating?

00:51:12.256 --> 00:51:14.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who stood by you

00:51:14.508 --> 00:51:17.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
in good times and in bad times?

00:51:18.763 --> 00:51:22.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe some of you think
of your dear parents,

00:51:22.475 --> 00:51:26.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of whom
might be here today in the audience.

00:51:26.145 --> 00:51:28.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are, this is a happy day, right?

00:51:28.231 --> 00:51:29.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t need to ask.

00:51:30.733 --> 00:51:34.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it was the brother or sister
who studied the Bible with you.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:37.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it was the circuit overseer

00:51:37.281 --> 00:51:39.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
who encouraged you when you were young

00:51:39.909 --> 00:51:43.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that older sister in the congregation

00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:47.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
who believed in you
and encouraged you to pioneer

00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:50.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to put in your application for Bethel.

00:51:50.544 --> 00:51:53.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, today is a day for you

00:51:53.214 --> 00:51:57.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
to look through the photo album of your heart

00:51:58.678 --> 00:52:03.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
and consider all of the people
who have shown loyal love to you

00:52:03.641 --> 00:52:07.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have encouraged you
all along the way

00:52:07.478 --> 00:52:11.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then to be like Jehovah

00:52:11.315 --> 00:52:14.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and show loyal love to them.

00:52:14.193 --> 00:52:16.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you write them a card,

00:52:16.487 --> 00:52:19.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
send them a letter or an email,

00:52:19.740 --> 00:52:23.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe a text message or a gift

00:52:23.703 --> 00:52:26.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you see, some kind act

00:52:26.455 --> 00:52:31.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain that bond
of loyal love between you.

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:35.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how are you benefited by doing so?

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, among other things,

00:52:38.634 --> 00:52:42.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
it helps to keep you humble and modest.

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:46.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always remembering that the things
that you have achieved thus far

00:52:46.434 --> 00:52:49.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and whatever you may achieve
in the future

00:52:49.770 --> 00:52:53.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not solely due to your efforts

00:52:53.774 --> 00:52:57.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
but is, in large part, due to the loyal love

00:52:57.111 --> 00:53:00.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have experienced from Jehovah

00:53:00.239 --> 00:53:04.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from so many other loyal friends.

00:53:04.452 --> 00:53:07.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
And never underestimate the power

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:10.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a simple act of loyal love.

00:53:10.666 --> 00:53:15.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, one day
I suddenly began to think about a couple  

00:53:15.504 --> 00:53:17.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had helped us so much

00:53:17.673 --> 00:53:20.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the court cases in Moscow.

00:53:20.718 --> 00:53:24.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided to just send them
a brief text message

00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:27.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to see how they were doing,
to check on them,

00:53:27.183 --> 00:53:29.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let them know
I was thinking about them.

00:53:30.353 --> 00:53:34.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just a few minutes later,
a text came back:

00:53:34.357 --> 00:53:38.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brother Mark, we can’t believe
you wrote to us right now.

00:53:39.487 --> 00:53:43.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were both on our knees,
praying to Jehovah,

00:53:43.949 --> 00:53:47.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“begging him for some encouragement

00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:52.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
when suddenly
we heard ‘ding’ on our phone.”

00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:58.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prove yourselves to be
like your heavenly Father

00:53:58.672 --> 00:54:01.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
by demonstrating loyal love

00:54:01.258 --> 00:54:04.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all of the people who have loved you

00:54:04.178 --> 00:54:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who have helped you

00:54:06.222 --> 00:54:10.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be sitting in these front rows
of this auditorium today.

00:54:11.977 --> 00:54:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the second:

00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:18.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your assignments, you brothers
who are graduating

00:54:18.442 --> 00:54:22.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
are going to serve,
in one sense or another, as overseers.

00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:27.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, always demonstrate loyal love
to the brothers and sisters

00:54:27.201 --> 00:54:29.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom you’re going to oversee and care for.

00:54:29.620 --> 00:54:33.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that sounds like
a very obvious statement, doesn’t it?

00:54:34.125 --> 00:54:38.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, for us as humans,
it can be challenging.

00:54:38.712 --> 00:54:41.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, why so?

00:54:41.257 --> 00:54:44.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as we’ve discussed,
when it comes to humans,

00:54:44.427 --> 00:54:49.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
loyal love involves a bond
between two people

00:54:49.098 --> 00:54:54.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the continual kind deeds
that occur between them

00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:57.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
that create this lasting bond.

00:54:57.106 --> 00:54:59.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s the challenge.

00:54:59.358 --> 00:55:01.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, as imperfect humans,

00:55:01.569 --> 00:55:04.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may be very quick to form a bond

00:55:04.989 --> 00:55:08.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
with people whom we feel
a connection with

00:55:08.033 --> 00:55:13.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
—people who have similar abilities,
similar talents, similar interests.

00:55:13.038 --> 00:55:15.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you work in the Service Department,

00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:17.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re drawn to the circuit overseers,
the missionaries,

00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:19.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
the special pioneers, the desk men.

00:55:19.962 --> 00:55:22.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re all wonderful!

00:55:23.674 --> 00:55:28.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re a translator,
oh, you love the translators!

00:55:28.053 --> 00:55:31.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That brother helped
to translate the Bible, my!”

00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:33.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right?

00:55:33.225 --> 00:55:36.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you just love them
and can’t get enough of them.

00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:41.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you work in the Legal Department,
you even love the lawyers.

00:55:43.068 --> 00:55:46.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, sorry, we all love the lawyers, sorry.

00:55:46.155 --> 00:55:48.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you all.

00:55:49.116 --> 00:55:50.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so on and so on.

00:55:52.369 --> 00:55:57.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, we all love
those wonderful, capable people

00:55:57.374 --> 00:56:00.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom we easily admire and look up to.

00:56:00.711 --> 00:56:05.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s a question,
What about all the faithful people?

00:56:05.591 --> 00:56:08.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about
all the faithful servants of Jehovah

00:56:08.469 --> 00:56:11.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom we just don’t have
that immediate connection with?

00:56:11.388 --> 00:56:14.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me be far more clear:

00:56:14.266 --> 00:56:18.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about all the faithful people
who are just plain annoying?

00:56:20.898 --> 00:56:22.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know who you are.

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:30.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
People who won’t take your phone calls.

00:56:38.249 --> 00:56:43.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what are we going to do
with all of those people?

00:56:43.879 --> 00:56:46.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have an answer because,

00:56:46.715 --> 00:56:49.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to be quite frank with you,

00:56:49.218 --> 00:56:51.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible is filled with annoying people.

00:56:53.806 --> 00:56:56.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we all love Abraham, right?

00:56:56.058 --> 00:56:58.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all love Abraham.

00:56:58.102 --> 00:57:00.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, if you go to Genesis chapter 18—

00:57:00.145 --> 00:57:02.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re not going to read all of this,

00:57:02.314 --> 00:57:04.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m just going to remind you
of this account that you know well

00:57:04.984 --> 00:57:06.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Genesis 18.

00:57:07.736 --> 00:57:10.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, you know, we go down here,

00:57:10.322 --> 00:57:13.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we hear Abraham praying to Jehovah.

00:57:13.117 --> 00:57:15.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
It begins about verse 24.

00:57:15.911 --> 00:57:19.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Abraham begins to go
into this thing with Jehovah:

00:57:19.248 --> 00:57:21.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah, what if there are 50?’
See?

00:57:21.417 --> 00:57:23.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What if there are 45?

00:57:23.127 --> 00:57:24.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What if there are 40?

00:57:24.837 --> 00:57:26.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What if there are 30?

00:57:26.338 --> 00:57:27.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What if there are 20?

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:29.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if there are ten?’

00:57:29.466 --> 00:57:31.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s annoying.

00:57:32.136 --> 00:57:34.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just annoying.
Sorry.

00:57:36.265 --> 00:57:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what did Jehovah do

00:57:39.435 --> 00:57:42.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that man who was a bit annoying?

00:57:43.439 --> 00:57:45.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loved him.

00:57:45.232 --> 00:57:46.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loved him.

00:57:46.775 --> 00:57:48.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loyally stuck by him.

00:57:49.612 --> 00:57:53.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although Abraham had been dead
for more than a thousand years,

00:57:54.742 --> 00:57:59.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
He continued to call him
“Abraham my friend.”

00:58:00.205 --> 00:58:03.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s real loyal love.

00:58:03.917 --> 00:58:05.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Peter?

00:58:05.919 --> 00:58:08.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter could be very annoying.

00:58:09.048 --> 00:58:12.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about just one occasion,
Matthew chapter 17

00:58:13.886 --> 00:58:15.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 17.

00:58:15.888 --> 00:58:19.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here, here’s Jesus,

00:58:19.391 --> 00:58:22.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s the occasion of the transfiguration.

00:58:22.436 --> 00:58:25.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a miraculous event, right?

00:58:25.939 --> 00:58:29.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here Peter is watching

00:58:29.151 --> 00:58:31.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jesus is being transfigured,

00:58:31.445 --> 00:58:34.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he sees him speaking
with Moses and Elijah.

00:58:34.657 --> 00:58:36.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an event!
Right?

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:40.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t it be exciting to see this,
this supernatural event?

00:58:40.454 --> 00:58:42.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does Peter say?

00:58:43.749 --> 00:58:47.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Hey, let’s put up tents,
and we can go camping.’

00:58:51.340 --> 00:58:53.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is annoying.

00:58:54.051 --> 00:58:56.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is annoying.

00:58:58.222 --> 00:59:00.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it doesn’t end there.

00:59:00.683 --> 00:59:03.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Peter went on
to deny Jesus three times.

00:59:05.562 --> 00:59:07.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s annoying.

00:59:08.232 --> 00:59:12.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did Jesus do
with that man who could be so annoying?

00:59:14.321 --> 00:59:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave him “the keys of the Kingdom.”

00:59:17.783 --> 00:59:21.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
He entrusted him
with great responsibility.

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:26.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed true loyal love
to that annoying man.

00:59:27.626 --> 00:59:29.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:34.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you work as overseers
and you deal with your brothers and sisters

00:59:34.383 --> 00:59:37.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even the annoying ones—

00:59:37.761 --> 00:59:40.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember the principle,
the simple principle,

00:59:40.764 --> 00:59:43.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus stated at Luke chapter 6.

00:59:43.183 --> 00:59:44.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you read it with me?

00:59:44.560 --> 00:59:49.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it, Luke 6:32:

00:59:49.022 --> 00:59:53.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you love those loving you,
of what credit is it to you?

00:59:54.695 --> 00:59:57.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For even the sinners
love those loving them.

00:59:57.865 --> 01:00:01.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And if you do good
to those doing good to you,

01:00:01.410 --> 01:00:04.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of what credit is it to you?

01:00:04.121 --> 01:00:06.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even the sinners do the same.”

01:00:07.374 --> 01:00:10.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
So demonstrate loyal love,

01:00:10.377 --> 01:00:15.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just to those whom you feel
that immediate connection with,

01:00:15.382 --> 01:00:19.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to all the faithful ones
whom you will oversee and care for.

01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:23.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work to form a bond of love,

01:00:23.307 --> 01:00:26.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
even with the annoying ones.

01:00:27.644 --> 01:00:29.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s the third:

01:00:29.688 --> 01:00:33.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
People in your assignments
need your loyal love.

01:00:33.859 --> 01:00:37.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the stated purpose of Gilead
is to train men and women

01:00:37.404 --> 01:00:41.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can strengthen
and stabilize God’s people.

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:43.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, who are those people?

01:00:43.452 --> 01:00:45.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who are they?

01:00:45.078 --> 01:00:49.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re simple, humble,
faithful men and women

01:00:49.792 --> 01:00:54.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are just trying their best
to serve Jehovah.

01:00:54.254 --> 01:00:58.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some are widows, some are orphans,
some are elderly,

01:00:58.884 --> 01:01:03.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
others are victims of natural disasters
and calamities of every sort.

01:01:03.722 --> 01:01:07.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some are facing devastating diseases,

01:01:07.434 --> 01:01:10.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
while others are imprisoned for their faith.

01:01:10.854 --> 01:01:13.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these people

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:18.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
need for you
to loyally attach yourself to them,

01:01:18.695 --> 01:01:21.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reassure them of your love

01:01:21.657 --> 01:01:24.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
through your continual kind deeds.

01:01:25.577 --> 01:01:27.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to do so

01:01:27.579 --> 01:01:31.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to require
more than just warm feelings.

01:01:31.875 --> 01:01:34.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to take your time.

01:01:34.211 --> 01:01:38.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to take your emotional energy.

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:41.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is what Jehovah
instructs us to do

01:01:41.593 --> 01:01:44.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Zechariah 7:9.

01:01:44.429 --> 01:01:46.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you read it with me

01:01:46.140 --> 01:01:50.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Zechariah 7:9?

01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:55.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “This is what
Jehovah of armies says,

01:01:55.065 --> 01:01:58.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Judge with true justice,

01:01:58.443 --> 01:02:00.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and deal with one another

01:02:00.821 --> 01:02:04.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
in loyal love and mercy.’”

01:02:04.491 --> 01:02:06.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah instructs us

01:02:06.493 --> 01:02:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “deal with one another in loyal love.”

01:02:10.706 --> 01:02:13.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Showing loyal love
for your brothers and sisters

01:02:13.917 --> 01:02:17.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are struggling or who are suffering

01:02:17.337 --> 01:02:21.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
will show that you really got the point

01:02:21.216 --> 01:02:23.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your Gilead training

01:02:23.427 --> 01:02:28.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that you are in your assignments
to strengthen and to stabilize

01:02:28.432 --> 01:02:32.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to loyally love and support—
your brothers and sisters.

01:02:32.978 --> 01:02:35.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember
—remember—

01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:38.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
they need
—they need—

01:02:38.108 --> 01:02:40.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
your loyal love.

01:02:40.736 --> 01:02:43.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what have we learned
in this discussion?

01:02:43.906 --> 01:02:46.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loyal love
is one of the most beautiful qualities

01:02:46.283 --> 01:02:49.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our amazing God, Jehovah.

01:02:49.077 --> 01:02:51.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah also expects

01:02:51.121 --> 01:02:56.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are going to display
loyal love to one another,

01:02:56.043 --> 01:02:58.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we will go through

01:02:58.086 --> 01:03:01.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
the photo album of our heart

01:03:01.381 --> 01:03:06.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remember those
who have displayed loyal love to us,

01:03:06.011 --> 01:03:10.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we will loyally love all of those
under our oversight

01:03:10.182 --> 01:03:14.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
(even the annoying ones),

01:03:14.394 --> 01:03:17.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we will reach out with loyal love

01:03:17.856 --> 01:03:19.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who are suffering

01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:24.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who most need
our kindness and attention.

01:03:25.197 --> 01:03:29.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you work hard in these ways
to display loyal love,

01:03:29.785 --> 01:03:34.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
what can all of you
who are graduating today expect?

01:03:34.623 --> 01:03:38.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that you will be deeply loved

01:03:38.418 --> 01:03:41.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
by our heavenly Father, Jehovah,

01:03:41.004 --> 01:03:45.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also by all your brothers and sisters

01:03:45.384 --> 01:03:47.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom you are going to serve.

01:03:47.386 --> 01:03:49.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how do we know this?

01:03:49.054 --> 01:03:51.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s because of something
the Bible says here

01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:55.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 19:22.

01:03:57.187 --> 01:04:01.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 19:22 says:

01:04:01.233 --> 01:04:04.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The desirable thing in a man

01:04:04.361 --> 01:04:08.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
is his loyal love.”

01:04:08.657 --> 01:04:13.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may the blessing of Jehovah
go with all of you wherever you go.

01:04:14.204 --> 01:04:16.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may you never forget

01:04:16.456 --> 01:04:20.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the desirable thing in a man
is his loyal love.”

01:04:26.717 --> 01:04:31.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now the time has come
for the presentation of the diplomas.

01:04:31.555 --> 01:04:34.182 line:90% position:50% align:center

Well, would you like to see the entire class?

01:08:46.810 --> 01:08:49.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead class 157,

01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:51.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re happy that we don’t
have to say Jegar-sahadutha,

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:55.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Brother Splane mentioned
in a previous graduation,

01:08:55.026 --> 01:08:57.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the Aramaic term for Gilead.

01:08:57.862 --> 01:09:00.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at this time,
we’d like to have Brother Sebastian Stock,

01:09:00.699 --> 01:09:02.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will read a letter
from the graduating class.

01:09:08.373 --> 01:09:10.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To the Governing Body:

01:09:11.293 --> 01:09:13.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Over the past five months,

01:09:13.295 --> 01:09:18.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have ‘seen our Grand Instructor
with our own eyes.’

01:09:18.008 --> 01:09:21.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We journeyed through his Word
and now our hearts

01:09:21.344 --> 01:09:25.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are overflowing with love,
gratitude, and trust in him.

01:09:26.766 --> 01:09:29.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When we began our Gilead training,

01:09:29.185 --> 01:09:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we often viewed scriptures
as individual puzzle pieces

01:09:32.147 --> 01:09:35.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“selected and applied to certain situations.

01:09:35.483 --> 01:09:39.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now we have experienced
how these pieces come together

01:09:39.613 --> 01:09:44.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to reveal a unified
and complete mosaic of Bible truth.

01:09:44.075 --> 01:09:46.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We thank you for the undeserved privilege

01:09:46.911 --> 01:09:50.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to dig deep into
and immerse ourselves in God’s Word.

01:09:52.125 --> 01:09:56.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We appreciate the time and energy
that you shared with our class.

01:09:56.504 --> 01:09:59.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We benefited not only from the lectures

01:09:59.341 --> 01:10:03.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but also from the attention
you dedicated to us afterwards.

01:10:03.553 --> 01:10:07.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have been strengthened
and encouraged by your humility

01:10:07.432 --> 01:10:11.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and how you have cultivated
‘the mind of Christ.’

01:10:11.227 --> 01:10:14.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your deep love and respect
for Jehovah’s Word motivates us

01:10:14.648 --> 01:10:18.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to continue to build our own appreciation.

01:10:18.276 --> 01:10:23.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your self-sacrificing spirit
encourages us to imitate your example.

01:10:24.115 --> 01:10:27.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are thankful that Jehovah
uses you as a means

01:10:27.118 --> 01:10:30.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to ‘instruct us about the good way
in which we should walk.’

01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:35.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are grateful for our instructors.

01:10:35.502 --> 01:10:39.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They helped us to ‘peer into
the perfect law’ of God’s Word,

01:10:39.089 --> 01:10:43.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“discern its principles,
and make personal application.

01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:46.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Enthusiasm for the Bible accounts
brought them to life

01:10:46.971 --> 01:10:51.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and helped get the words off the page
and into our minds and hearts.

01:10:51.935 --> 01:10:55.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Their dedication to the art of teaching
reinforced our desire

01:10:55.772 --> 01:10:57.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to give our all each and every day

01:10:57.774 --> 01:11:00.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we could
fully benefit from the class.

01:11:01.277 --> 01:11:03.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We want to express our gratitude

01:11:03.822 --> 01:11:06.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the entire Theocratic Schools Department

01:11:06.908 --> 01:11:09.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for their tireless efforts behind the scenes

01:11:09.119 --> 01:11:12.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make our busy daily routine
as smooth as possible.

01:11:12.831 --> 01:11:16.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Additionally, we are grateful
to the U.S. Bethel family

01:11:16.876 --> 01:11:20.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for their hospitality and generosity.

01:11:20.797 --> 01:11:23.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They have shown us in a practical way
what it means

01:11:23.383 --> 01:11:25.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to show love and kindness to strangers.

01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:28.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Knowing that they demonstrate

01:11:28.763 --> 01:11:32.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“this love to every class year after year

01:11:32.308 --> 01:11:35.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“must certainly make
our heavenly Father smile.

01:11:35.729 --> 01:11:38.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your beautiful example touched our hearts!

01:11:40.483 --> 01:11:43.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As we depart for our assignments,

01:11:43.111 --> 01:11:45.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have in mind David’s words:

01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:49.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Be courageous and strong and go to work.

01:11:49.451 --> 01:11:52.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not be afraid or be terrified,

01:11:52.036 --> 01:11:55.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for Jehovah God, my God, is with you.’

01:11:56.583 --> 01:12:00.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you for this indescribable gift
of being trained

01:12:00.253 --> 01:12:04.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to help strengthen and stabilize
his people wherever we may serve.

01:12:04.841 --> 01:12:08.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your brothers, Class 157.”

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:12.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has been accomplished.

01:12:12.182 --> 01:12:14.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re now graduates.

01:12:14.225 --> 01:12:16.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re proud of you,

01:12:16.269 --> 01:12:19.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
not for the academic achievement that you’ve

01:12:19.731 --> 01:12:24.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
striven for during this class,
but the remarkable effect

01:12:24.611 --> 01:12:29.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the wisdom, the love that you’ve
developed during this divine education.

01:12:30.283 --> 01:12:33.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
We anticipate
the strengthening and stabilizing

01:12:33.411 --> 01:12:37.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you will do
in your respective branch territories.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:43.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in the introduction we discussed
the need for all of us to stay hungry.

01:12:43.296 --> 01:12:45.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what about staying thirsty?

01:12:45.423 --> 01:12:47.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider that for just a moment.

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:49.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss one thirst

01:12:49.219 --> 01:12:52.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to quench every single day.

01:12:52.597 --> 01:12:55.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to open to Psalm 143

01:12:56.810 --> 01:12:59.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice with me, please, verses 5 and 6

01:13:00.438 --> 01:13:02.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 143:5, 6.

01:13:02.649 --> 01:13:06.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
There David said:
“I remember the days of old;

01:13:06.653 --> 01:13:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I meditate on all your activity;
I eagerly ponder over the work of your hands.

01:13:11.699 --> 01:13:13.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I spread out my hands to you;

01:13:13.993 --> 01:13:18.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am like a parched land
that thirsts for you.”

01:13:19.582 --> 01:13:23.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
So David thirsted for Jehovah.

01:13:23.127 --> 01:13:26.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thirst for Jehovah
as a parched land thirsts for water.

01:13:26.631 --> 01:13:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Water makes the land revive;
it makes it flourish.

01:13:30.426 --> 01:13:33.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a dry, crusty riverbed in Africa

01:13:33.179 --> 01:13:38.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
is revived and flourishes when distant rains
come and saturate the soil,

01:13:38.142 --> 01:13:42.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we want to satisfy our thirst
for Jehovah on a daily basis.

01:13:42.355 --> 01:13:44.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?
How do we do that?

01:13:44.482 --> 01:13:48.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we want to continue to learn more
about our Father on a daily basis,

01:13:48.903 --> 01:13:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
digging into his Word.

01:13:50.947 --> 01:13:53.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hosea 6:3 says:

01:13:53.241 --> 01:13:56.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will know, we will earnestly seek
to know Jehovah. . . .

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:58.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will come to us like a pouring rain,

01:13:58.288 --> 01:14:02.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
like a spring rain that saturates the earth.”

01:14:03.459 --> 01:14:07.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even at Gilead, you have only learned
“the fringes of [Jehovah’s] ways.”

01:14:07.797 --> 01:14:10.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s so much more that’s available

01:14:10.425 --> 01:14:13.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the organization,
through Jehovah’s organization.

01:14:13.761 --> 01:14:16.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep thirsting, keep learning.

01:14:16.055 --> 01:14:17.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
So learn about Jehovah.

01:14:17.682 --> 01:14:22.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing:
Maintain a regular routine of prayer.

01:14:22.103 --> 01:14:27.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pray constantly”
is what 1 Thessalonians 5:17 tells us.

01:14:27.025 --> 01:14:29.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note says:

01:14:29.068 --> 01:14:32.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul was not expecting the Thessalonians
to pray at every moment.

01:14:32.447 --> 01:14:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, he was encouraging them
to have a prayerful attitude.”

01:14:35.825 --> 01:14:37.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
So thirst for Jehovah.

01:14:37.952 --> 01:14:41.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep your relationship with him close.

01:14:41.247 --> 01:14:43.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always look to Jehovah.

01:14:43.082 --> 01:14:46.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
And will Jehovah satisfy your thirst for him?

01:14:46.419 --> 01:14:48.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

01:14:48.421 --> 01:14:51.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can learn something
from what occurred in Samson’s life.

01:14:51.925 --> 01:14:54.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found in Judges chapter 15.

01:14:56.429 --> 01:14:58.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just as we had assurance earlier

01:14:58.514 --> 01:15:01.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will care
for your spiritual hunger

01:15:01.351 --> 01:15:03.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will care for your thirst as well.

01:15:03.353 --> 01:15:05.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judges chapter 15, interestingly,

01:15:05.605 --> 01:15:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 17 through 19 describe Samson’s life.

01:15:11.486 --> 01:15:15.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had just experienced, as the verse says,

01:15:15.698 --> 01:15:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Jehovah’s spirit empowered him.”

01:15:17.533 --> 01:15:19.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
He became absorbed
in a theocratic assignment,

01:15:19.911 --> 01:15:21.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
fighting Jehovah’s enemies the Philistines

01:15:21.913 --> 01:15:25.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “with the jawbone of a donkey”
killing a thousand Philistines.

01:15:25.583 --> 01:15:26.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then what?

01:15:26.668 --> 01:15:28.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 17 says: “When he finished speaking,

01:15:28.753 --> 01:15:32.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he threw the jawbone away
and called that place Ramath-lehi.

01:15:32.674 --> 01:15:34.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then he became very thirsty,

01:15:36.177 --> 01:15:38.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he called on Jehovah and said:

01:15:38.179 --> 01:15:41.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It was you who gave this great salvation
into the hand of your servant.

01:15:41.391 --> 01:15:45.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But now am I to die of thirst and fall
into the hands of the uncircumcised?’

01:15:46.521 --> 01:15:49.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So God split open a hollow that was in Lehi,

01:15:49.899 --> 01:15:52.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and water flowed from it.

01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:54.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he drank,

01:15:54.362 --> 01:15:57.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“his spirit returned and he revived.

01:15:57.991 --> 01:16:01.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why he named
the place En-hakkore,

01:16:01.285 --> 01:16:04.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is in Lehi to this day”

01:16:04.872 --> 01:16:06.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
—”En-hakkore,”

01:16:06.499 --> 01:16:10.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah split open a hollow
to satisfy Samson’s thirst,

01:16:10.378 --> 01:16:12.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
his spirit returned, and he revived.

01:16:12.839 --> 01:16:14.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the point?

01:16:14.924 --> 01:16:18.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no antitypical jawbone of a donkey.

01:16:18.344 --> 01:16:19.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:16:19.637 --> 01:16:22.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in future days you will certainly be busy

01:16:22.682 --> 01:16:27.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
in theocratic assignments,
just as Samson was.

01:16:27.437 --> 01:16:31.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be sure to return to En-hakkore regularly

01:16:31.733 --> 01:16:34.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
and revive your spirit
by drawing close to our God.

01:16:34.861 --> 01:16:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is a lifeline to your success.

01:16:38.865 --> 01:16:41.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay hungry, and stay thirsty,

01:16:41.993 --> 01:16:45.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
dear Gilead graduates.

01:16:45.204 --> 01:16:47.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this Gilead graduation
and for any occasion

01:16:47.915 --> 01:16:49.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
of eating and drinking at Jehovah’s table,

01:16:49.917 --> 01:16:53.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
may our hearts’ sentiments
be those of the psalmist

01:16:53.171 --> 01:16:56.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 107:1, 9.

01:16:57.759 --> 01:17:00.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says: “Give thanks to Jehovah,

01:17:00.386 --> 01:17:04.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
for he is good;
his loyal love endures forever.”

01:17:04.182 --> 01:17:07.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
That ties in with Brother Mark’s talk too.

01:17:07.268 --> 01:17:12.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 9 says:
“For he has satisfied the thirsty

01:17:12.315 --> 01:17:16.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
and filled the hungry with good things.”

01:17:16.486 --> 01:17:19.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
So all praise goes to Jehovah

01:17:19.072 --> 01:17:21.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his bounteous spiritual gifts to us.

01:17:21.699 --> 01:17:23.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear Gilead graduates,

01:17:23.534 --> 01:17:26.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
stay hungry for spiritual food
and for God’s righteousness.

01:17:26.954 --> 01:17:30.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay thirsty for Jehovah on a daily basis,

01:17:30.625 --> 01:17:32.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he, our loving Father,

01:17:32.668 --> 01:17:36.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue to fill you up
with an abundance of rich dishes.

01:17:36.506 --> 01:17:38.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you all very much.

01:17:39.801 --> 01:17:42.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
How faith-strengthening and encouraging

01:17:42.845 --> 01:17:47.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only for the Gilead graduates
but for each of us!

01:17:47.350 --> 01:17:49.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s more!

01:17:49.352 --> 01:17:52.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the coming weeks,
look for additional talks

01:17:52.563 --> 01:17:56.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the graduation in the <i> JW Library  </i>app

01:17:56.067 --> 01:17:59.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the Videos section on jw.org.

01:18:00.571 --> 01:18:04.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this month’s postcard,
we travel to the Netherlands.

01:18:06.744 --> 01:18:09.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Netherlands means “the lowlands,”

01:18:09.747 --> 01:18:14.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
a fitting name for a country with more than
a quarter of its land below sea level

01:18:14.627 --> 01:18:18.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nearly 20 percent reclaimed from the sea,

01:18:18.214 --> 01:18:19.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
lakes, and marshes.

01:18:19.966 --> 01:18:23.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Iconic windmills
and wooden shoes are reminders

01:18:23.886 --> 01:18:27.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
that managing water is a way of life here.

01:18:28.766 --> 01:18:31.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
An ingenious system of dunes, dikes, pumps,

01:18:31.519 --> 01:18:34.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
and barriers protects against floods.

01:18:34.856 --> 01:18:38.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Life’s water” of Bible truth
started flowing into this land

01:18:38.901 --> 01:18:41.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the early 1900’s.

01:18:41.237 --> 01:18:43.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the beginning of World War II,

01:18:43.489 --> 01:18:46.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were
about 500 Jehovah’s Witnesses here.

01:18:47.535 --> 01:18:52.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
They suffered severe persecution
by the occupying Nazis.

01:18:52.290 --> 01:18:55.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 300 of our brothers

were deported to concentration camps.

01:18:58.004 --> 01:19:02.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, more than 130 of them died.

01:19:03.259 --> 01:19:07.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite these challenges,
with Jehovah’s help

01:19:07.013 --> 01:19:10.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the faithful stand
of our brothers and sisters,

01:19:26.824 --> 01:19:28.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
zealously preach here.
