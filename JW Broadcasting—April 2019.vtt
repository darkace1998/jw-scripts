Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:05.055 --> 00:00:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my friend Saki Marais,

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Writing Committee
of the Governing Body.

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:15.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s here to help me discuss
the gifts we present to Jehovah God.

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:19.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saki, can you tell us
what the program is all about?

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:21.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be my pleasure.

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:24.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll meet Sister Lillian Barnes.

00:00:24.107 --> 00:00:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regardless of our age,
we can learn from her example

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of loyal endurance.

00:00:30.146 --> 00:00:34.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What Bible counsel for young ones
continues to motivate her

00:00:34.484 --> 00:00:37.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve Jehovah whole-souled?

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll go to the United States branch

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:41.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Wallkill, New York,

00:00:41.291 --> 00:00:44.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see how they produce Braille Bibles.

00:00:45.528 --> 00:00:49.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has the revised
New World Translation in Braille helped

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:53.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these brothers and sisters
give their gifts to God?

00:00:54.938 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why is physical cleanliness

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an important part of our clean worship?

00:01:01.411 --> 00:01:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll find out in this dramatization

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Principles for Daily Living series.

00:01:08.651 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the April 2019 edition

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:14.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month I’d like to talk
about “Presenting Your Gifts to God.”

00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly have every reason
to consider this topic.

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:43.219 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, why is that?

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:45.588 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s because Jehovah gives us so much.

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:48.358 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
James 1:17 says:

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:53.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every good gift
and every perfect present is from above,

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming down
from the Father of the celestial lights.”

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:02.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
Jehovah allows us to enjoy the gift of life,

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:07.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though our first parents
tried to take that from us.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s provided us with a variety of foods.

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:15.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The environment is just right to support life.

00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:18.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s given us his precious Word, the Bible,

00:02:18.655 --> 00:02:23.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can come to know
him and his purposes.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the greatest “perfect present”
Jehovah has given us is the ransom.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:32.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sacrificed
a great deal to arrange for Jesus

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:36.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to buy back for us the hope of everlasting life.

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:40.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was at no obligation on Jehovah’s part.

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:43.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was totally a gift of love.

00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me 1 John 4:9:

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By this the love of God
was revealed in our case,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that God sent
his only-begotten Son into the world

00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we might gain life through him.”

00:02:57.694 --> 00:03:01.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a gift of love from Jehovah, our God!

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that move us to do?

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve had the experience
of a close friend or family member

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:11.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unexpectedly giving you a valuable gift.

00:03:11.741 --> 00:03:14.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, what are you thinking?

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are probably trying to think
of what you can give in return.

00:03:19.415 --> 00:03:24.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much more so
would we want to ‘present our gifts to God’

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to show
our sincere appreciation for all he’s done!

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:32.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some possible gifts

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:36.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
would be pleased to receive from us.

00:03:36.366 --> 00:03:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you in our viewing audience

00:03:38.568 --> 00:03:41.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been moved to give your life to Jehovah,

00:03:41.838 --> 00:03:44.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dedicating yourself to do his will.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s commendable!

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Romans 12 urges us to do.

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there are some of you listening

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:57.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have thought
about this way of giving back to Jehovah,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you haven’t yet taken this vital step.

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:03.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the appeal the apostle Paul makes

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:1:

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:09.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, I appeal to you
by the compassions of God, brothers,

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:13.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:15.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“holy and acceptable to God,

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:19.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sacred service with your power of reason.”

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:22.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your life is precious.

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:24.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Presenting your body, your whole soul,

00:04:24.914 --> 00:04:29.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to God is one of the best gifts
you can give to him.

00:04:29.619 --> 00:04:32.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This involves our sacred service to Jehovah

00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:34.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s for sure.

00:04:34.757 --> 00:04:37.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the daily activities of life?

00:04:37.827 --> 00:04:41.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you do housework on a daily basis.

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:45.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others of you have
school to attend and homework to do.

00:04:45.635 --> 00:04:48.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you perform secular work.

00:04:48.338 --> 00:04:50.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s shopping to do.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others enjoy using
a small percentage of their time

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:59.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to engage in some type
of recreation or entertainment.

00:04:59.048 --> 00:05:02.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once you’re dedicated and baptized,

00:05:02.585 --> 00:05:06.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is all part of your gift to Jehovah.

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:08.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please consider with me

00:05:08.091 --> 00:05:12.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 3:23, 24.

00:05:12.996 --> 00:05:17.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After discussing
a whole list of daily activities of life,

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what does Jehovah tell us?

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 3:23, 24:

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:24.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whatever you are doing,

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:28.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah,

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:30.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and not for men,

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:32.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you know that it is from Jehovah

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:35.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will receive the inheritance as a reward.”

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:39.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that a Christian’s day-to-day activities

00:05:39.922 --> 00:05:42.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not part of his sacred service.

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the fact that Paul urges us

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:50.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work “whole-souled as to Jehovah”

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:53.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes us think of our entire course of life.

00:05:53.503 --> 00:05:58.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our life course
can become a gift presented to God.

00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:03.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, do we act and dress
with proper decorum at all times?

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understandably,
we don’t wear a suit and tie or a dress

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:11.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for every activity of life.

00:06:11.254 --> 00:06:14.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in “whatever you are doing,”

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:18.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is your behavior and dress a gift to Jehovah?

00:06:19.662 --> 00:06:22.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If while engaging in any activity,

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:27.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d be embarrassed to identify
ourselves as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:06:27.203 --> 00:06:30.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then can we really claim to be presenting

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a gift to Jehovah in our daily life?

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:38.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What other gifts are in our possession
that we can present to God?

00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:41.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about godly morality?

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:44.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keeping your dedicated body clean morally

00:06:44.887 --> 00:06:47.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a gift to Jehovah.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what Romans 12:1 said?

00:06:50.893 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said that the bodies we present to Jehovah

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be “holy and acceptable to God.”

00:06:59.435 --> 00:07:03.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we give in to temptation unrepentantly,

00:07:03.606 --> 00:07:07.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be likened to asking Jehovah

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:09.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give our gift back;

00:07:09.378 --> 00:07:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re taking back our dedicated life from him.

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:18.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worse yet, it is tantamount
to taking the gift away from Jehovah

00:07:18.688 --> 00:07:21.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and giving that precious gift to Satan.

00:07:22.992 --> 00:07:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That does not make sense.

00:07:25.828 --> 00:07:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep clean morally.

00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:31.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a precious gift presented to God.

00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:34.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, when we’re dedicated and baptized,

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are other gifts that we’d be expected

00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to present to Jehovah on a regular basis.

00:07:41.444 --> 00:07:43.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most obvious ways

00:07:43.446 --> 00:07:47.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is mentioned here at Hebrews 10:23.

00:07:47.683 --> 00:07:52.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you already guess
what this gift to Jehovah would be?

00:07:52.488 --> 00:07:54.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 10:23:

00:07:57.026 --> 00:08:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us hold firmly the public declaration
of our hope without wavering,

00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the one who promised is faithful.”

00:08:05.468 --> 00:08:08.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The public declaration of our hope

00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:11.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a gift to those we speak to,

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:16.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s also considered
a gift extended to Jehovah.

00:08:16.012 --> 00:08:20.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
Hebrews 13:15 calls our preaching work

00:08:20.783 --> 00:08:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a sacrifice of praise,

00:08:23.586 --> 00:08:26.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is, the fruit of our lips

00:08:26.222 --> 00:08:29.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make public declaration to his name.”

00:08:29.792 --> 00:08:33.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Israelites used to regularly offer

00:08:33.563 --> 00:08:36.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best of their animals or grain

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:39.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as sacrificial gifts to Jehovah.

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:42.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sharing in the ministry formally or informally

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a gift to God.

00:08:45.541 --> 00:08:47.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regularly attending our Christian meetings

00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:49.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and participating in them

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:54.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is part of our worship and pleases Jehovah.

00:08:54.016 --> 00:08:58.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are familiar with Hebrews 10:24, 25.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It speaks of our custom of meeting together.

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:03.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for what purpose do we meet?

00:09:05.027 --> 00:09:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I was there in your home with you,

00:09:08.097 --> 00:09:10.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would you answer?

00:09:10.099 --> 00:09:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might quickly say,

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I go to the meetings to be built up
and to be encouraged spiritually.”

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:19.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt you do.

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:22.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at Hebrews 10:24, 25,

00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the purpose of attending is expressed

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:28.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a totally different way.

00:09:28.584 --> 00:09:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of going
with the sole intent of being encouraged,

00:09:33.589 --> 00:09:35.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 24 says

00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:39.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are to “consider one another

00:09:39.161 --> 00:09:41.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so as to incite [others]

00:09:41.998 --> 00:09:44.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love and fine works.”

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 25 says

00:09:46.869 --> 00:09:50.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are to be “encouraging one another.”

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:56.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should attend our meetings
with the goal of being a gift to others.

00:09:56.712 --> 00:10:00.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Encouraging others is the goal.

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:03.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do this by our sincere interest in others

00:10:03.552 --> 00:10:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before and after the meeting.

00:10:06.622 --> 00:10:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you come to the Kingdom Hall early

00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:10.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage others?

00:10:10.993 --> 00:10:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When in the traveling work, years ago,

00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:16.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I drove in to the parking lot

00:10:16.832 --> 00:10:18.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got out of our car.

00:10:18.768 --> 00:10:22.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two brothers approached us and warmly said:

00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:26.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brother and Sister Herd,
we were waiting for you.

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:31.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy to have you
with our congregation this week.”

00:10:32.315 --> 00:10:37.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were they elders,
ministerial servants, or pioneers?

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:42.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they were two little preteenage boys!

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That boost gave us a fine start

00:10:45.928 --> 00:10:48.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a special week of activity.

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:53.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also encourage others
by participating in the meetings.

00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:57.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouragement
to the whole congregation!

00:10:57.106 --> 00:11:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, if we all go to the meetings

00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:03.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with that goal and motive,

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:07.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will be the result to us individually?

00:11:07.783 --> 00:11:11.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all will come away built up

00:11:11.087 --> 00:11:13.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouraged spiritually.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:16.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we must never forget

00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:19.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that being at our Christian meetings
and participating,

00:11:19.795 --> 00:11:22.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including singing the songs

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saying “Amen” to the prayers,

00:11:26.302 --> 00:11:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is actually worshipping Jehovah.

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:33.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are presenting a gift to him
at every meeting you attend.

00:11:35.244 --> 00:11:37.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From ancient times until now,

00:11:37.346 --> 00:11:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s faithful servants
have contributed materially

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:44.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the support of true worship.

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s presenting a gift to God as well,

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:51.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we thank all of you for your support.

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:54.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body is able to provide so much

00:11:54.497 --> 00:11:57.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the benefit of the worldwide brotherhood

00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:00.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of your generosity.

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:12:02.638 --> 00:12:05.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much!

00:12:05.775 --> 00:12:08.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you Christian parents?

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:10.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What gift can you present to Jehovah?

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:12.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your children!

00:12:12.248 --> 00:12:15.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you do your best to ‘bring your children up

00:12:15.217 --> 00:12:18.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah,’

00:12:18.421 --> 00:12:21.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are preparing a gift to your God.

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:23.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the number of brothers

00:12:23.692 --> 00:12:27.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking the lead in the organization at this time.

00:12:27.596 --> 00:12:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are Governing Body members, helpers,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Branch Committee members, circuit overseers,

00:12:35.137 --> 00:12:38.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
elders, and ministerial servants.

00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:42.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did so many of these come from?

00:12:42.344 --> 00:12:46.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of thousands
were children of Christian parents.

00:12:46.348 --> 00:12:50.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The parents followed
the admonition of Ephesians 6:4.

00:12:52.054 --> 00:12:55.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are thousands more brothers and sisters

00:12:55.057 --> 00:12:58.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have been raised
in the truth by godly parents

00:12:58.828 --> 00:13:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are spearheading
the work in the ministry,

00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Bethel service,

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on construction projects, and in relief work.

00:13:08.637 --> 00:13:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank you, parents,
for all that you’ve done

00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:15.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the precious gifts
you have offered up to Jehovah

00:13:15.544 --> 00:13:17.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his organization.

00:13:17.546 --> 00:13:20.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the older ones
in our congregations?

00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:25.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m 84 years young with eternity in view.

00:13:25.754 --> 00:13:30.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at some point,
we start to admit that we’re getting old.

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:34.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We start to feel that we’re getting old.

00:13:34.263 --> 00:13:38.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We start to look like we’re getting old.

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us find ourselves
slipping physically or even mentally.

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:47.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we becoming
less and less valuable to Jehovah?

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:52.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is our gift now tarnished by age?

00:13:52.114 --> 00:13:54.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might begin to think so,

00:13:54.283 --> 00:13:58.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s not at all how
Jehovah views older ones

00:13:58.287 --> 00:14:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have dedicated themselves to him,

00:14:01.123 --> 00:14:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
possibly many decades ago.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A tarnished gold coin

00:14:06.695 --> 00:14:10.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has as much value as a shiny new one.

00:14:11.100 --> 00:14:13.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 16:31 instructs us

00:14:13.636 --> 00:14:17.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “gray hair is a crown of beauty

00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:20.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it is found in the way of righteousness.”

00:14:21.277 --> 00:14:26.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not so much the color
of the hair that Jehovah admires.

00:14:26.015 --> 00:14:29.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, it’s the life of self-sacrifice

00:14:29.485 --> 00:14:31.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that gray hair represents.

00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:34.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah views older ones

00:14:34.223 --> 00:14:37.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are still found in the way of righteousness

00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:40.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as precious gifts to him.

00:14:41.864 --> 00:14:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do pieces of antique furniture often cost

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:48.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much more than a brand new piece of furniture?

00:14:48.203 --> 00:14:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or why is an older bottle of fine wine

00:14:52.675 --> 00:14:57.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often more expensive
than a newer vintage wine?

00:14:57.546 --> 00:15:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Age brings value to a gift.

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You older ones have wisdom and experience

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:10.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that others in the congregation can benefit from.

00:15:11.193 --> 00:15:14.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that you
need to be holding the microphone

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:18.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waxing eloquent
on every paragraph at a meeting,

00:15:18.867 --> 00:15:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but modestly sharing your experience

00:15:21.537 --> 00:15:24.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wisdom with others on a personal basis

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be so helpful and encouraging.

00:15:28.277 --> 00:15:31.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves you older ones.

00:15:31.113 --> 00:15:36.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even if you’re bent with age in your mind,

00:15:36.118 --> 00:15:40.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stand tall as a precious gift
presented to Jehovah.

00:15:41.590 --> 00:15:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all of us, young and old,

00:15:45.294 --> 00:15:50.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider how we can enhance
our gifts presented to Jehovah.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:53.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have not yet dedicated our life to God,

00:15:53.902 --> 00:15:58.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is it time to seriously consider this gift?

00:15:58.007 --> 00:16:00.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we enhance our gift

00:16:00.009 --> 00:16:04.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by more closely monitoring 
our view of Christian morality?

00:16:04.947 --> 00:16:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we look at or think about

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could compromise our gift to God.

00:16:10.686 --> 00:16:15.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about our ministry or attendance
and participation at the meetings

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or contributing materially

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide work?

00:16:20.162 --> 00:16:22.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You parents,

00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:25.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do your best to package

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:27.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the gift of your children

00:16:27.736 --> 00:16:31.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they will be useful to Jehovah.

00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:33.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you older ones,

00:16:33.342 --> 00:16:38.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forget that when it comes
to wisdom and experience,

00:16:38.347 --> 00:16:41.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you only get better with age.

00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:45.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is the best of Jehovah’s servants.

00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:48.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been around the longest.

00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:53.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s meet a sister who’s applied the counsel

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve God from her youth on.

00:16:56.365 --> 00:16:59.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Lillian Barnes is from Jamaica.

00:16:59.902 --> 00:17:03.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her gifts to Jehovah 
may have changed with age,

00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:06.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what she gives to him today

00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:09.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in no way less valuable.

00:21:29.204 --> 00:21:31.206 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, then,

00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.808 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“your Grand Creator

00:21:32.808 --> 00:21:34.876 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the days of your youth.”

00:21:34.876 --> 00:21:37.846 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That was Sister Barnes’ determination.

00:21:37.846 --> 00:21:40.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lillian is now 108 years old

00:21:40.582 --> 00:21:44.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and has been baptized for nearly 82 years.

00:21:44.419 --> 00:21:48.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her beautiful example shows the contentment

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:52.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from serving God
whole-souled at any age.

00:21:53.428 --> 00:21:55.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To give Jehovah our best,

00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:59.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need God’s Word
to know how to worship him.

00:21:59.334 --> 00:22:02.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why Jehovah’s organization works hard

00:22:02.671 --> 00:22:07.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the Bible available
to as many people as possible.

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:11.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the United States branch
in Wallkill, New York,

00:22:11.113 --> 00:22:13.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are producing Braille copies

00:22:13.682 --> 00:22:16.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the revised New World Translation.

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:21.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it take
to make a good quality Braille Bible,

00:22:21.556 --> 00:22:25.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how are Braille readers
using this beautiful gift?

00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:31.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2013, our English-printed Bibles

00:22:31.867 --> 00:22:34.369 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were revised and, shortly thereafter,

00:22:34.369 --> 00:22:36.438 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Braille Bibles were approved

00:22:36.438 --> 00:22:38.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be revised in English and Portuguese.

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew it was going to be a large job.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:42.711 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were having problems

00:22:42.711 --> 00:22:44.713 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the pages either tearing

00:22:44.713 --> 00:22:47.049 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or coming completely out of the Bible.

00:22:47.049 --> 00:22:50.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tried changing the paper
to see if that would be a simple solution,

00:22:50.152 --> 00:22:55.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we had a brother
who is blind come in and help us.

00:22:55.057 --> 00:22:58.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to test the paper
in the machine and actually walk it

00:22:58.126 --> 00:23:01.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right over to the brother,
and he gave us immediate feedback

00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:03.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on adjustments to the machine

00:23:03.698 --> 00:23:05.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or if it wasn’t working at all.

00:23:07.202 --> 00:23:11.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our testing,
we tried about 25 different types of paper,

00:23:11.807 --> 00:23:15.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we ended up coming back to the idea

00:23:15.043 --> 00:23:18.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the binding was
the best way to find a durable solution.

00:23:18.814 --> 00:23:20.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result is that the durability

00:23:20.715 --> 00:23:23.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is 400 percent stronger than it was before.

00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:26.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can pick up an entire book

00:23:26.521 --> 00:23:28.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by holding just one page.

00:23:29.991 --> 00:23:31.159 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the Literature Production Office,

00:23:31.159 --> 00:23:32.394 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we have ones who receive

00:23:32.394 --> 00:23:34.196 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the requests for the Braille Bibles,

00:23:34.196 --> 00:23:36.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have ones
who will review these requests

00:23:36.865 --> 00:23:39.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they come into the system,
and then we have

00:23:39.534 --> 00:23:42.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a separate set of brothers who make sure
that all the materials are here on time.

00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:45.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get our orders from the office,

00:23:45.674 --> 00:23:46.675 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then the office

00:23:46.675 --> 00:23:48.477 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will tell us how many to make

00:23:48.477 --> 00:23:50.512 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—maybe the specific volume number.

00:23:50.512 --> 00:23:52.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Braille Bibles come

00:23:52.581 --> 00:23:55.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Wallkill printery
on the Braille production floor.

00:23:55.117 --> 00:23:58.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right at the end of the machine,
we have a Braille paper roll.

00:23:58.753 --> 00:24:01.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We make sure
that there’s nothing wrong with that roll,

00:24:01.223 --> 00:24:03.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it gets fed into the machine

00:24:03.892 --> 00:24:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it creates Braille
on both sides of the page.

00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:08.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after that,
it gets cut and punched.

00:24:08.697 --> 00:24:11.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gather it
and do some quality inspection.

00:24:11.199 --> 00:24:15.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll bind it together;
we’ll rivet each section into a binder

00:24:15.237 --> 00:24:17.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has been prelabeled
with a volume number,

00:24:17.739 --> 00:24:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do an inspection on it,
pop it in a box, and then send it out the door.

00:24:22.377 --> 00:24:26.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To produce the English Bible in Braille
takes about four and a half hours,

00:24:26.448 --> 00:24:28.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which then breaks out into 28 volumes,

00:24:28.884 --> 00:24:31.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Portuguese Bible 
in Braille takes closer

00:24:31.653 --> 00:24:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to five and a half hours,
and that breaks out into 32 volumes.

00:24:35.924 --> 00:24:38.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We did not start production with Genesis,

00:24:38.093 --> 00:24:41.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we wanted the brothers
and sisters to be able to receive the volume

00:24:41.329 --> 00:24:43.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be
on the congregation Bible reading schedule

00:24:43.331 --> 00:24:45.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our midweek meetings.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we receive
the files for each volume,

00:24:49.304 --> 00:24:52.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s being printed and sent out
to our brothers and sisters.

00:24:53.408 --> 00:24:56.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s important to me
to be able to read God’s Word

00:24:56.778 --> 00:24:58.947 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
rather than just listening

00:24:58.947 --> 00:25:01.449 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because I am a visual person.

00:25:01.449 --> 00:25:04.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the eyesight is gone, but I’m still visual.

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:08.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learn better from reading
than I do from listening.

00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:10.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In my mind when I’m listening,

00:25:10.258 --> 00:25:11.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
my mind wanders,

00:25:11.526 --> 00:25:13.595 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but when I’m reading, I can stop

00:25:13.595 --> 00:25:16.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on what I’m studying.

00:25:16.298 --> 00:25:18.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That helps me
with my relationship with Jehovah.

00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:20.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It has helped me a lot,

00:25:20.402 --> 00:25:21.836 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because a lot of things

00:25:21.836 --> 00:25:22.938 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I don’t have to look up

00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:24.706 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because it’s in plain English.

00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:27.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have so many things
 in this new Bible

00:25:27.542 --> 00:25:30.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I can use, like the outline.

00:25:30.045 --> 00:25:33.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can get that outline
and find something fast.

00:25:34.015 --> 00:25:36.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has the appendix,
the word index,

00:25:36.484 --> 00:25:38.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the glossary.

00:25:38.253 --> 00:25:39.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the time of the Memorial,

00:25:39.988 --> 00:25:43.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to read the events
of the last week of Jesus’ life.

00:25:44.793 --> 00:25:49.364 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoy reading with one hand

00:25:49.364 --> 00:25:51.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pulling the other hand down

00:25:51.833 --> 00:25:54.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reading the footnotes.

00:25:56.004 --> 00:25:58.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can participate more
in the midweek meeting.

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:02.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, in the section
“Digging for Spiritual Gems,”

00:26:02.711 --> 00:26:07.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers always get someone
from the audience to read the scriptures.

00:26:07.515 --> 00:26:09.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once I got the new Bible,

00:26:09.884 --> 00:26:12.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could raise my hand
and volunteer to read,

00:26:12.554 --> 00:26:15.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so the whole meeting opened up.

00:26:16.057 --> 00:26:18.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The revised edition

00:26:18.526 --> 00:26:22.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps me be more effective at the meeting,

00:26:22.330 --> 00:26:25.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helps me to find

00:26:25.834 --> 00:26:28.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly what I need.

00:26:28.003 --> 00:26:31.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before the revision,
when he’d have a part on the meeting,

00:26:31.406 --> 00:26:35.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would have to get his Brailler out
and have me dictate one sentence at a time

00:26:35.777 --> 00:26:38.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he could type it all out
—what he was going to use in his part.

00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:41.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is nice because he has

00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:43.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right wording
that all the friends have.

00:26:44.552 --> 00:26:46.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like to carry it from house to house,

00:26:46.554 --> 00:26:49.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I can only take
the one volume because they’re huge.

00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:54.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whatever the initial call is,
I can take that scripture

00:26:54.362 --> 00:26:57.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see if the householder
will let me read a scripture for them.

00:26:58.199 --> 00:27:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means so much to be able to read
the Scriptures and to do personal study.

00:27:03.138 --> 00:27:07.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am very thankful for all the work
our brothers have done up in Wallkill.

00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:10.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really appreciate the effort

00:27:10.945 --> 00:27:15.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’ve all gone through,
because that’s a lot of work.

00:27:15.283 --> 00:27:19.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Jehovah’s organization,
they care for everyone.

00:27:19.921 --> 00:27:24.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so thankful
that they had the Braille Bible for the blind.

00:27:24.492 --> 00:27:27.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what draws me closer to Jehovah

00:27:27.395 --> 00:27:30.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—being able to study his Word
and look the scriptures up.

00:27:31.399 --> 00:27:34.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new Bible is personal to me.

00:27:34.336 --> 00:27:37.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like it was
a personal answer to a prayer.

00:27:37.238 --> 00:27:41.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah supplied it because that’s
the main thing I wanted to read,

00:27:41.443 --> 00:27:45.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I am so thankful to Jehovah.

00:27:48.383 --> 00:27:51.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like these brothers and sisters,

00:27:51.086 --> 00:27:54.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
treasure the gift of God’s Word.

00:27:54.656 --> 00:27:58.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pray that Jehovah
continue to bless the efforts

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the revised New World Translation

00:28:01.429 --> 00:28:05.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
available in more languages and formats.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the Bible and Christian publications,

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:12.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re equipped to do
all we can in the preaching work.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That desire to ‘fully accomplish our ministry’

00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:20.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is captured in this month’s original song

00:28:20.849 --> 00:28:23.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All I Can Give.”

00:28:34.028 --> 00:28:41.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O heavenly Father,
I want to give all I can give.

00:28:44.239 --> 00:28:53.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My desire is to please you
and love you as long as I live.

00:28:55.383 --> 00:29:03.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll help those who listen
to find in your Word what they need.

00:29:06.227 --> 00:29:14.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To preach and to teach
is the way I can really succeed.

00:29:16.571 --> 00:29:25.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I praise you, Jehovah,
my faith’s getting stronger each day.

00:29:27.282 --> 00:29:37.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll reflect on my dedication.
I’ll walk in your way.

00:29:37.959 --> 00:29:43.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O heavenly Father,
to you I give praise,

00:29:43.631 --> 00:29:48.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Determined to serve you
in so many ways.

00:29:48.803 --> 00:29:55.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My heart is wide open
as long as I live.

00:29:55.543 --> 00:30:03.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I’ll love you
and give you all I can give.

00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:39.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whole-souled devotion
and love for my brothers I’ll show.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:47.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Volunteering to play my part
is the best way I know.

00:30:50.164 --> 00:30:58.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m happier when I am giving
than when I receive,

00:31:00.174 --> 00:31:09.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I’m taking the time
to help others who may be in need.

00:31:11.185 --> 00:31:20.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I praise you, Jehovah,
my faith’s getting stronger each day.

00:31:20.695 --> 00:31:32.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll reflect on my dedication.
I’ll walk in your way.

00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:37.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O heavenly Father,
to you I give praise,

00:31:37.512 --> 00:31:43.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Determined to serve you
in so many ways.

00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:50.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My heart is wide open
as long as I live.

00:31:50.158 --> 00:31:58.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I’ll love you
and give you all I can give.

00:32:00.668 --> 00:32:06.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O heavenly Father,
to you I give praise,

00:32:06.174 --> 00:32:11.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Determined to serve you
in so many ways.

00:32:11.579 --> 00:32:17.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My heart is wide open
as long as I live.

00:32:17.986 --> 00:32:27.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I’ll love you
and give you all I can give.

00:32:33.735 --> 00:32:37.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what ways did you see
the brothers and sisters

00:32:37.271 --> 00:32:40.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving all they could in the ministry?

00:32:40.074 --> 00:32:42.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They witnessed at every opportunity.

00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:46.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They preached door to door,
in public witnessing,

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at businesses, informally,
and in remote areas.

00:32:50.551 --> 00:32:54.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They used our Teaching Toolbox,
including videos,

00:32:54.222 --> 00:32:58.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach people
in a language they really understood.

00:32:58.926 --> 00:33:01.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ministry is an important way

00:33:01.796 --> 00:33:04.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we imitate Jehovah’s love for people.

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:08.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also want to imitate Jehovah’s holiness.

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:13.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Herd explained
why we strive to stay morally clean.

00:33:13.675 --> 00:33:16.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about keeping physically clean?

00:33:16.611 --> 00:33:19.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not always easy for busy Christians.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization,

00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:23.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see how Grayson gives his son

00:33:23.885 --> 00:33:27.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the loving counsel on cleanliness that he needs.

00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:36.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I graduated
from high school that summer

00:33:36.197 --> 00:33:37.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanted to start
regular pioneering.

00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:41.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my dad, Grayson.

00:33:44.138 --> 00:33:46.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dad was having
car trouble that morning

00:33:46.808 --> 00:33:49.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and needed a ride to work,
so I gave him one.

00:33:53.214 --> 00:33:57.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, my car
was a little messy and smelly.

00:34:03.257 --> 00:34:06.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, it was winter,
and my car is pretty old anyway.

00:34:06.894 --> 00:34:08.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why bother?

00:34:08.096 --> 00:34:11.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I get a new car,
then I’ll keep it clean.

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:15.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he was making
a big deal out of nothing.

00:34:20.641 --> 00:34:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That morning was not good.

00:34:33.354 --> 00:34:36.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought it was over.

00:34:36.090 --> 00:34:39.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later that evening,
Dad brought it up again.

00:34:40.261 --> 00:34:42.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time, it went better.

00:34:44.499 --> 00:34:47.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He showed me a picture of his first car.

00:34:47.335 --> 00:34:49.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It looked pretty old too.

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:52.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that while our home
or car may not be

00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:56.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fancy or luxurious,
it should be as clean and presentable

00:34:56.144 --> 00:34:57.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as circumstances allow.

00:34:59.514 --> 00:35:02.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still didn’t see what the big deal was.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:05.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, he explained
that Jehovah is a clean God,

00:35:05.353 --> 00:35:07.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from ancient times,
he has always required

00:35:07.789 --> 00:35:09.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his people be a clean people.

00:35:11.092 --> 00:35:13.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the Mosaic Law
that Jehovah gave to Israel,

00:35:14.061 --> 00:35:17.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cleanness and worship
were inseparable.

00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:21.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It specified that priests were required

00:35:21.035 --> 00:35:23.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wash their hands and feet

00:35:23.037 --> 00:35:25.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before offering sacrifices to Jehovah.

00:35:25.339 --> 00:35:28.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While in an unclean state, an Israelite

00:35:28.042 --> 00:35:30.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could not have any part in worship,

00:35:30.878 --> 00:35:33.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it could mean death.

00:35:36.884 --> 00:35:39.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “I’m not an Israelite,

00:35:39.587 --> 00:35:41.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re not
under the Mosaic Law anymore.”

00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:45.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “True, but it gives us insight

00:35:45.259 --> 00:35:47.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Jehovah’s thinking.”

00:35:47.361 --> 00:35:48.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Law emphasized that cleanness

00:35:48.896 --> 00:35:52.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was required
of all those who worshipped him.

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:55.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as Malachi 3:6 tells us,

00:35:55.102 --> 00:35:57.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah has not changed.’

00:35:59.240 --> 00:36:02.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, he said something
that really stuck with me,

00:36:03.244 --> 00:36:06.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Besides, it’s not all about us.”

00:36:07.048 --> 00:36:09.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, he gave me a scripture to look up.

00:36:10.418 --> 00:36:13.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4:

00:36:14.622 --> 00:36:18.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In no way are we giving
any cause for stumbling,

00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:22.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that no fault
may be found with our ministry;

00:36:22.096 --> 00:36:24.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but in every way

00:36:24.298 --> 00:36:28.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.”

00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:44.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that things like our appearance,

00:36:44.819 --> 00:36:47.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our homes, and our cars

00:36:47.755 --> 00:36:51.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—these can all be
a silent witness to Jehovah in themselves.

00:36:51.659 --> 00:36:54.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made sense to me now.

00:36:54.228 --> 00:36:56.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not all about us.

00:36:56.530 --> 00:36:59.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew what I had to do.

00:37:05.873 --> 00:37:09.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did I clean my car,
but later that year,

00:37:09.777 --> 00:37:12.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to turn in
my application for pioneering.

00:37:15.116 --> 00:37:19.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m glad for the lesson
I learned from my dad.

00:37:19.487 --> 00:37:21.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not all about us.

00:37:23.291 --> 00:37:25.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in little ways,

00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can reflect favorably
on the God we love.

00:37:31.198 --> 00:37:35.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What made Grayson’s counsel effective?

00:37:36.037 --> 00:37:40.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although he reacted to sitting in the dirty car,

00:37:40.942 --> 00:37:45.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he waited until he was calm to give counsel.

00:37:45.012 --> 00:37:49.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He based what he said
on God’s standards in the Bible.

00:37:49.216 --> 00:37:53.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it took humility
for his son to see that his cleanliness

00:37:53.587 --> 00:37:58.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could affect how others
view Jehovah’s clean people.

00:37:58.592 --> 00:38:01.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humility helps us to accept correction,

00:38:01.262 --> 00:38:03.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it can do even more.

00:38:03.731 --> 00:38:07.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the topic of this Bethel morning worship,

00:38:07.201 --> 00:38:11.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherein Brother Mark Noumair asks why humility

00:38:11.472 --> 00:38:16.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was such an important lesson for Jesus’ apostles

00:38:16.177 --> 00:38:19.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and why it still is for us today.

00:38:20.114 --> 00:38:22.783 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is interesting that Peter gives counsel

00:38:22.783 --> 00:38:25.152 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about cultivating humility.

00:38:25.152 --> 00:38:26.487 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn the clock back

00:38:26.487 --> 00:38:28.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and learn why the quality of humility

00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:30.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was indelibly etched

00:38:30.958 --> 00:38:32.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the mind and heart of Peter.

00:38:32.827 --> 00:38:36.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles to Luke chapter 22.

00:38:36.464 --> 00:38:38.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Luke chapter 22,

00:38:38.499 --> 00:38:43.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll find Jesus getting ready
for that final Passover in 33 C.E.

00:38:43.104 --> 00:38:46.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in Luke 22, starting in verse 8,

00:38:46.774 --> 00:38:51.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is Thursday afternoon, Nisan 13,
and what happens?

00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:55.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 8: “Jesus sent Peter [there he is]

00:38:55.383 --> 00:38:58.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and John, saying: ‘Go and get

00:38:58.586 --> 00:39:01.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Passover ready for us to eat.’”

00:39:01.722 --> 00:39:04.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Get it ready, Peter and John.’

00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:08.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 9: “They said to him:
‘Where do you want us to get it ready?’”

00:39:08.896 --> 00:39:12.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They understood the instructions: Get it ready.

00:39:12.199 --> 00:39:14.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said to go into Jerusalem,

00:39:14.201 --> 00:39:17.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll find the man
with the earthenware jar.

00:39:17.038 --> 00:39:20.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 12: “And that man

00:39:20.074 --> 00:39:23.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will show you
a large, furnished upper room.

00:39:23.177 --> 00:39:25.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get it ready there.”

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:30.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 13: “So they left 
and found it just as he had told them,

00:39:30.151 --> 00:39:34.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they prepared for the Passover.”

00:39:34.688 --> 00:39:38.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get it ready; prepare the Passover.

00:39:38.793 --> 00:39:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would that include?

00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:46.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bread, wine, oil for the lamps,

00:39:46.233 --> 00:39:51.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lamb, a towel, a basin, water.

00:39:51.872 --> 00:39:53.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Basin and water

00:39:53.908 --> 00:39:56.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they knew 
how important washing feet was.

00:39:56.744 --> 00:40:00.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They witnessed when
Jesus reproved Simon the Pharisee

00:40:00.414 --> 00:40:04.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the statement: Simon,
“you gave me no water for my feet.”

00:40:04.785 --> 00:40:08.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Simon, you gave me no water.

00:40:08.022 --> 00:40:10.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You missed the mark on this one.’

00:40:10.558 --> 00:40:14.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as they stared
at that basin and water,

00:40:14.995 --> 00:40:18.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they prepared
and got the room ready,

00:40:18.699 --> 00:40:22.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did they look at each other
and wonder:

00:40:22.136 --> 00:40:24.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Who’s going to wash the feet?

00:40:24.138 --> 00:40:25.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who’s going to do it?’

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had a golden opportunity
to apply all the things that Jesus

00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:32.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been teaching them
for three and a half years on humility.

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the time.

00:40:34.782 --> 00:40:37.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After three and a half years,
conduct yourself as a lesser one.

00:40:37.585 --> 00:40:39.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t lord it over others.

00:40:39.386 --> 00:40:41.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You want to serve others and not be served.

00:40:41.922 --> 00:40:43.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was it; this was the time.

00:40:43.991 --> 00:40:47.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could have showed Jesus
that they got the point; they got it.

00:40:47.628 --> 00:40:50.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had time to think about it
and time to pray about it.

00:40:50.631 --> 00:40:53.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Thursday afternoon,

00:40:53.534 --> 00:40:57.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now we progress
and let’s see what happens.

00:40:57.538 --> 00:41:01.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now progress
to the evening, and it’s Nisan 14.

00:41:01.108 --> 00:41:04.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s pick up the account in John chapter 13.

00:41:05.713 --> 00:41:09.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They got the room ready,
they followed the instructions,

00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:13.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now let’s go to John 13
and get John’s vantage point from this.

00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:17.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was there;
he was with Peter getting it ready.

00:41:17.358 --> 00:41:22.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now it’s 98 C.E.,
and John is writing this information.

00:41:22.363 --> 00:41:26.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had time to reflect
and to think about this for years,

00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:30.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now look what he says in verse 3:

00:41:30.404 --> 00:41:32.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So Jesus,

00:41:32.873 --> 00:41:37.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing that the Father
had given all things into his hands

00:41:37.144 --> 00:41:40.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he came from God
and was going to God.”

00:41:40.281 --> 00:41:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing these things
—he understood that.

00:41:43.851 --> 00:41:48.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sat back and said:
‘Jesus knew who he was; he knew all things.

00:41:48.422 --> 00:41:51.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He had the full understanding of his dignity.

00:41:51.525 --> 00:41:54.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew that he
had been entrusted with all things.

00:41:54.328 --> 00:41:55.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew.

00:41:55.563 --> 00:41:58.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew he was the second greatest
personage in the universe.

00:41:58.566 --> 00:42:01.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew he was
“the firstborn of all creation.”

00:42:01.368 --> 00:42:04.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He knew he had shared 
with his Father in creating all things.

00:42:04.605 --> 00:42:08.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had knowledge of all this
—knowing all these things.’

00:42:08.375 --> 00:42:11.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John sits back; he writes this.

00:42:11.378 --> 00:42:13.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then knowing this,

00:42:13.747 --> 00:42:17.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 4 is the contrast:

00:42:17.818 --> 00:42:22.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He got up from the evening meal
and laid aside his outer garments.

00:42:22.823 --> 00:42:25.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Taking a towel,
he wraps it around his waist.

00:42:25.859 --> 00:42:28.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘After that, he puts the water
into the basin

00:42:28.195 --> 00:42:30.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and starts to wash
the feet of the disciples

00:42:30.097 --> 00:42:33.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dry them off with the towel
that was wrapped around him.’

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing who He was,

00:42:35.703 --> 00:42:38.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John said He did this.

00:42:38.906 --> 00:42:43.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only does John reflect
on who Jesus was,

00:42:43.043 --> 00:42:46.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no, he reflects on why Jesus did it.

00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:47.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did he do it?

00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:50.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what John was interested in,

00:42:50.117 --> 00:42:54.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we get that answer back in verse 1,

00:42:54.388 --> 00:42:56.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where John says why:

00:42:56.523 --> 00:43:00.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Because he loved his own
that were in the world;

00:43:00.594 --> 00:43:03.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he loved them to the end.’

00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:06.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John said He “loved them to the end.”

00:43:06.467 --> 00:43:07.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:43:07.868 --> 00:43:11.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to instill in them qualities
that would help them conquer the world,

00:43:11.772 --> 00:43:15.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualities that would strengthen
the Christian congregation,

00:43:15.242 --> 00:43:18.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualities such as unselfish love
and humility.

00:43:18.412 --> 00:43:20.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved them to the end.

00:43:20.414 --> 00:43:22.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never gave up on them.

00:43:22.416 --> 00:43:26.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had their weaknesses,
but he did not give up.

00:43:26.287 --> 00:43:29.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for Peter, some 30 years later,

00:43:29.523 --> 00:43:31.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s thinking about humility.

00:43:31.792 --> 00:43:34.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John, some 60 years later,

00:43:34.161 --> 00:43:36.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the lesson Jesus taught
about humility,

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:40.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s echoing loud and clear
in his mind and heart.

00:43:40.467 --> 00:43:44.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the fact remains
that neither of them

00:43:44.805 --> 00:43:48.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had the humility at the time
to apply what Jesus

00:43:48.075 --> 00:43:50.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been teaching them
for three and a half years.

00:43:51.412 --> 00:43:56.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after John finished his writing, he sat back;

00:43:56.417 --> 00:43:59.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was under inspiration;
he finished that writing.

00:43:59.286 --> 00:44:02.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he sit back,
reread what he just wrote,

00:44:02.389 --> 00:44:05.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and perhaps say to himself:

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:08.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I wish I could have written

00:44:08.562 --> 00:44:13.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that after Jesus washed the feet
of one or two of his disciples,

00:44:13.567 --> 00:44:17.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I got up and washed the feet

00:44:17.371 --> 00:44:19.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of the rest of my brothers?

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:24.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I took that towel, and I imitated the Christ?

00:44:24.144 --> 00:44:27.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, Peter and I got up?’

00:44:27.348 --> 00:44:30.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is, they didn’t.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:32.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we learn?

00:44:32.186 --> 00:44:35.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow valuable lessons
that Jesus teaches us

00:44:35.923 --> 00:44:38.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to echo in our minds and hearts

00:44:38.058 --> 00:44:42.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only after we missed
the opportunity to apply them.

00:44:42.996 --> 00:44:47.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in a practical setting
for us serving here at Bethel:

00:44:47.968 --> 00:44:52.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Even though I know
I have the seniority

00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:54.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—I have full knowledge of my seniority—

00:44:54.908 --> 00:44:59.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will I get up and fight the attitude
of entitlement?

00:44:59.913 --> 00:45:04.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have
authority entrusted to me as the overseer;

00:45:04.852 --> 00:45:09.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I am the overseer;
I know that. I have full knowledge of that.

00:45:09.022 --> 00:45:11.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Fine, will I get up

00:45:11.658 --> 00:45:14.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and roll my sleeves back
and do the grunt work?

00:45:14.294 --> 00:45:17.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or do I just find pleasure
in giving orders?

00:45:17.798 --> 00:45:21.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have
a wonderful privilege of service;

00:45:21.101 --> 00:45:23.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know that; others know it too.

00:45:23.804 --> 00:45:27.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fine, but will I get up to train others?’

00:45:27.975 --> 00:45:32.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Jackson reminded us of this
at the last Gilead graduation

00:45:32.346 --> 00:45:36.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he said to treasure your privileges,
but don’t hoard them.

00:45:36.717 --> 00:45:38.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means we have to get up.

00:45:38.752 --> 00:45:43.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes humility 
to train others to take our place.

00:45:43.624 --> 00:45:46.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘As a brother or a sister,

00:45:46.527 --> 00:45:51.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have more experience
than the other person in my job.

00:45:51.398 --> 00:45:54.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have the experience; I know that.

00:45:54.668 --> 00:45:57.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I have more experience than my workmate.

00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:02.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Fine, but will I get up in all humility

00:46:02.276 --> 00:46:05.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and share information that I have

00:46:05.145 --> 00:46:08.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘with others to make their job easier?

00:46:08.382 --> 00:46:12.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or will I hold the knowledge I have hostage?’

00:46:12.386 --> 00:46:16.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we get up in all humility
and do these things,

00:46:16.657 --> 00:46:21.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can say that Jesus’ humble act,
as recorded here in John 13,

00:46:21.662 --> 00:46:24.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has made a lasting
and indelible impression

00:46:24.598 --> 00:46:27.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only on Peter and John
but on me.

00:46:28.735 --> 00:46:31.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful lesson!

00:46:31.572 --> 00:46:34.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Humility will improve the way

00:46:34.575 --> 00:46:38.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we carry out our theocratic assignments.

00:46:38.111 --> 00:46:43.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It honors our fellow workers,
and it promotes unity.

00:46:43.116 --> 00:46:47.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unified servants of God get things done.

00:46:47.087 --> 00:46:49.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Peru,

00:46:49.089 --> 00:46:53.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
local brothers worked 
with international servants and volunteers

00:46:53.427 --> 00:46:56.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to complete two new Assembly Halls.

00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this report,

00:46:58.732 --> 00:47:02.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hear what the brothers
learned from working together

00:47:02.002 --> 00:47:04.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how the new Assembly Halls

00:47:04.271 --> 00:47:07.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are being used to glorify Jehovah.

00:47:27.127 --> 00:47:29.196 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I suppose whatever we give to Jehovah

00:47:29.196 --> 00:47:32.332 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is little in comparison with what he gives to us.

00:47:32.332 --> 00:47:34.401 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And like Malachi 3:10 says, you know,

00:47:34.401 --> 00:47:36.036 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we just have to ‘bring in the tenth part.’

00:47:36.036 --> 00:47:38.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s really all that Jehovah is asking,

00:47:38.038 --> 00:47:40.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he pours out a blessing.

00:47:40.040 --> 00:47:43.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And part of those blessings from Malachi 3:10,

00:47:43.477 --> 00:47:46.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I consider to be
the friendships that we’ve gained.

00:47:47.247 --> 00:47:49.249 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For me, my favorite thing is the people.

00:47:49.249 --> 00:47:52.386 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s always just getting to work

00:47:52.386 --> 00:47:54.388 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with your brothers every day.

00:47:54.388 --> 00:47:58.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The personalities shine through,
even with language differences.

00:47:58.225 --> 00:48:00.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just make friends,
and you just get this taste

00:48:00.928 --> 00:48:03.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what the new world is going to be like.

00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:05.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Side by side with our brothers,

00:48:05.499 --> 00:48:08.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve made parent figures
and brother and sister figures,

00:48:08.936 --> 00:48:12.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everybody just becomes
part of such a solid family.

00:48:14.341 --> 00:48:17.578 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Working along with the local brothers and sisters

00:48:17.578 --> 00:48:19.079 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
made it clear to me

00:48:19.079 --> 00:48:21.448 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we really are in the organization

00:48:21.448 --> 00:48:24.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is directing today.

00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:29.723 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What I have seen is how Jehovah’s spirit

00:48:29.723 --> 00:48:32.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
operates in his organization.

00:48:32.593 --> 00:48:35.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were many international servants here

00:48:35.662 --> 00:48:37.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from various countries,

00:48:37.698 --> 00:48:40.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with different personalities,

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:43.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with our local brothers
with their distinct customs.

00:48:44.371 --> 00:48:47.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when it was time to work, we were as one.

00:48:48.976 --> 00:48:52.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There wasn’t a big guy, a little guy,

00:48:52.312 --> 00:48:54.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone more intelligent, or less intelligent.

00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:57.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all formed one united team.

00:48:58.819 --> 00:49:01.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The language definitely was an issue for me.

00:49:02.623 --> 00:49:04.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first I thought,

00:49:04.625 --> 00:49:07.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Will I really be able to work with the brothers?’

00:49:07.828 --> 00:49:10.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since I didn’t understand the language,

00:49:10.597 --> 00:49:13.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how could I explain
the work that had to be done?

00:49:17.104 --> 00:49:19.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, if you go in there with a good attitude

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re just having
a good time working with your brothers,

00:49:21.908 --> 00:49:23.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not going to have too much of a problem.

00:49:23.777 --> 00:49:25.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Smiles
—they cross borders.

00:49:33.654 --> 00:49:35.656 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The Chiclayo dedication program

00:49:35.656 --> 00:49:38.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was held April 9, 2016,

00:49:38.725 --> 00:49:40.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the Trujillo Assembly Hall

00:49:40.761 --> 00:49:43.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was dedicated shortly thereafter,

00:49:43.163 --> 00:49:45.599 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on July 31.

00:49:50.137 --> 00:49:53.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All present marveled with appreciation

00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:55.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at seeing the facilities,

00:49:55.642 --> 00:49:57.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their own new Assembly Hall.

00:50:01.682 --> 00:50:03.684 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Before, we had to work a lot,

00:50:03.684 --> 00:50:06.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
maybe up to 15 days beforehand

00:50:06.153 --> 00:50:09.056 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to prepare a completely inappropriate site.

00:50:09.056 --> 00:50:10.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not anymore.

00:50:10.490 --> 00:50:12.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the brothers only need to maintain it

00:50:12.693 --> 00:50:16.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and simply arrive
in order to enjoy their assembly.

00:50:17.297 --> 00:50:19.366 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that this new Assembly Hall

00:50:19.366 --> 00:50:21.134 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will strengthen the spirituality

00:50:21.134 --> 00:50:23.036 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of our dear brothers and sisters.

00:50:24.638 --> 00:50:27.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I can say something about the video monitors:

00:50:27.874 --> 00:50:31.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve revolutionized
Jehovah’s method of teaching.

00:50:32.813 --> 00:50:34.915 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We get so much more out of the talks now

00:50:34.915 --> 00:50:35.982 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because we can see

00:50:35.982 --> 00:50:37.551 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the gestures of the brothers.

00:50:37.551 --> 00:50:39.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It really touches the heart.

00:50:39.553 --> 00:50:41.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so amazing!

00:50:42.856 --> 00:50:45.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember more than 25 years ago,

00:50:45.692 --> 00:50:47.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah and said,

00:50:47.894 --> 00:50:51.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, please,
permit me at some point to see

00:50:51.865 --> 00:50:53.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an Assembly Hall here.”

00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:55.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now Jehovah let me

00:50:55.869 --> 00:50:57.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be part of the buying process,

00:50:57.871 --> 00:51:00.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of getting the documentation,

00:51:00.006 --> 00:51:02.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of being part of the construction.

00:51:02.209 --> 00:51:04.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember, and I say,

00:51:04.611 --> 00:51:07.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah answered my prayer.”

00:51:09.282 --> 00:51:12.953 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, it affected me

00:51:12.953 --> 00:51:15.555 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
seeing the construction progress

00:51:15.555 --> 00:51:17.557 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because when we first arrived

00:51:17.557 --> 00:51:19.726 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at our project in Chiclayo,

00:51:19.726 --> 00:51:21.728 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you know what the brothers had

00:51:21.728 --> 00:51:24.698 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and what they were using as an Assembly Hall.

00:51:24.698 --> 00:51:26.700 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then to see the finished project

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.969 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we see now,

00:51:28.969 --> 00:51:31.905 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m so happy for the brothers and sisters.

00:51:31.905 --> 00:51:34.775 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s so beautiful, clean, neat, and tidy.

00:51:34.775 --> 00:51:37.544 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s like, in reality, for where it is,

00:51:37.544 --> 00:51:39.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it’s a little jewel within that whole city

00:51:39.579 --> 00:51:43.750 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to me when I see the completed project.

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:48.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know that brothers
do just love to be able to care for that place,

00:51:48.755 --> 00:51:52.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to worship Jehovah there,
and to be with their brothers and sisters.

00:51:52.759 --> 00:51:55.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing that will ever compare

00:51:55.462 --> 00:51:58.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this wonderful experience
we’ve been able to have.

00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:03.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been great!

00:52:08.208 --> 00:52:10.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve enjoyed a wonderful program.

00:52:10.877 --> 00:52:13.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our videos showed us so many of the ways

00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:17.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can present our gift to Jehovah.

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:19.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I agree.

00:52:19.152 --> 00:52:21.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw our brothers, young and old,

00:52:21.888 --> 00:52:24.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
give their best in the ministry,

00:52:24.357 --> 00:52:27.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation, at Bethel,

00:52:27.761 --> 00:52:29.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on construction projects.

00:52:29.996 --> 00:52:33.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we heard good counsel to be humble,

00:52:33.133 --> 00:52:37.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
morally clean, and physically clean.

00:52:37.003 --> 00:52:39.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to conclude our program,

00:52:39.306 --> 00:52:43.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have greetings
from our brothers and sisters in Chad.

00:52:44.144 --> 00:52:47.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chad is located in north-central Africa.

00:52:47.714 --> 00:52:50.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the Sahara Desert in the north,

00:52:50.317 --> 00:52:54.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most of Chad’s more than 13 million people

00:52:54.154 --> 00:52:57.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
live in the fertile southern regions.

00:52:57.157 --> 00:53:00.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fewer than a thousand brothers live and preach

00:53:00.193 --> 00:53:04.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this vast field dotted with remote villages.

00:53:04.397 --> 00:53:07.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The capital city is N’Djamena.

00:53:07.567 --> 00:53:10.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Five congregations
are busy spreading the good news

00:53:10.503 --> 00:53:13.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the city and its surrounding area.

00:53:13.673 --> 00:53:18.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of these, just south of the capital,
is the Walia Congregation.

00:53:19.512 --> 00:53:22.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They preach regularly along the Logone River,

00:53:22.716 --> 00:53:26.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they often meet people
traveling from faraway areas.

00:53:27.687 --> 00:53:30.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their busy activity also helped to establish

00:53:30.690 --> 00:53:33.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new congregation in nearby Koundoul.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers in Koundoul and Walia

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:41.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send us
their heartfelt Christian love and greetings.

00:53:41.201 --> 00:53:43.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We pray for Jehovah to bless

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:47.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their gifts of brotherly affection and self-sacrifice.
