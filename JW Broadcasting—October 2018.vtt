‎Welcome, brothers and sisters,
to JW Broadcasting! 

00:00:06.356 --> 00:00:08.358 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this edition,

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:12.362 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we’ll glorify Jehovah’s name
in our discussions and segments. 

00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:14.364 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example:

00:00:14.364 --> 00:00:17.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How was the discovery
of this ancient manuscript

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a tremendous help
to the New World Bible Translation Committee? 

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:25.308 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How did it support 
their decision to restore God’s name

00:00:25.308 --> 00:00:28.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures? 

00:00:28.244 --> 00:00:30.180 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’ll find out. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We’ll visit the Quechua-speaking people
in the Andes Mountains. 

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:36.553 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What special efforts 
have our brothers been making there

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:38.988 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to spread the good news?

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:43.660 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what new tool do they have 
to glorify God’s name in Quechua?

00:00:45.361 --> 00:00:48.565 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How did you feel 
when you finally found Jehovah? 

00:00:48.565 --> 00:00:50.867 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And how does it feel now

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:54.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when you can help 
someone in his or her search

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:56.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to know the true God? 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.275 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You’ll enjoy a new original song

00:00:59.275 --> 00:01:02.212 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about the search for Jehovah. 

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:05.749 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You’re watching JW Broadcasting

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:07.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for October 2018.

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:29.472 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s hard to believe 
that it’s already been five years 

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:33.710 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎since the release
of the revised New World Translation in English. 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.114 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What a wonderful blessing
from Jehovah it has been!

00:01:38.114 --> 00:01:43.119 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do you remember why the Governing Body 
saw the need for a revised edition? 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.756 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One reason was to honor God’s name,

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:51.761 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎including it in six more places 
where new evidence made it possible. 

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.898 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Another reason to revise the English text

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:59.803 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was to allow Bible translation 
into even more languages. 

00:01:59.803 --> 00:02:03.339 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thousands of questions 
from Bible translation teams

00:02:03.339 --> 00:02:05.341 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎showed where the English text

00:02:05.341 --> 00:02:08.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎could be made 
more clear and understandable

00:02:08.244 --> 00:02:11.281 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎without sacrificing accuracy. 

00:02:11.281 --> 00:02:13.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s our prayer that, in time,

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.752 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎more of our brothers can have

00:02:15.752 --> 00:02:19.422 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a revised New World Translation 
in their language. 

00:02:19.422 --> 00:02:23.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Governing Body feels 
that Jehovah is answering that prayer. 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:28.364 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Revised translations 
are now available in 13 languages. 

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:33.102 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Listen to brothers and sisters 
from four European-language groups

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:36.806 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎explain how the revised Bible 
has benefited them

00:02:36.806 --> 00:02:40.109 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in their study and in their ministry.

00:02:44.447 --> 00:02:46.449 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The release of the revised version

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.052 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation 
of the Holy Scriptures 

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:52.322 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the English language in 2013

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:55.525 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had a wonderful impact 
on the English-speaking world. 

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:01.364 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As Brother Jackson noted,

00:03:01.364 --> 00:03:04.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎more than 60 years had passed 
since the release of the first volume 

00:03:04.834 --> 00:03:07.837 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation, 
and during that time,

00:03:07.837 --> 00:03:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the English language had changed as well.

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:17.247 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎During 2017,

00:03:17.247 --> 00:03:19.182 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the revised version

00:03:19.182 --> 00:03:20.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation
of the Holy Scriptures 

00:03:20.917 --> 00:03:22.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎has been released

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:24.921 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in some major European languages,

00:03:28.191 --> 00:03:33.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎such as Italian (originally released in 1963),

00:03:33.062 --> 00:03:37.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Dutch (also originally released in 1963),

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.371 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Greek (originally released in 1997),

00:03:41.371 --> 00:03:44.440 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and Hungarian (originally released in 2000).

00:03:46.576 --> 00:03:48.778 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How do the brothers and sisters feel

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about the revised New World Translation 
in their particular language?

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.052 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The modern language

00:03:56.052 --> 00:03:57.754 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in this revised version of the Bible

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:00.290 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎helps me to understand Bible passages

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.760 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because now it flows better
and is much simpler. 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.364 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This helps me to meditate more
on what I have just read.

00:04:11.734 --> 00:04:14.737 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At Numbers 14:24,

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:16.873 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah speaks to Moses. 

00:04:16.873 --> 00:04:19.943 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the older version, 
Jehovah says about Caleb

00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:22.946 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that “a different spirit 
has proved to be with him.”

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.452 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the revised version, the verse reads

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:32.455 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that ‘my servant Caleb thinks differently’

00:04:32.455 --> 00:04:36.092 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—very clear 
and doesn’t need further explanation.

00:04:39.262 --> 00:04:41.965 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Psalm 7:9 now says

00:04:41.965 --> 00:04:43.967 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jehovah “examines the hearts

00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:45.969 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the deepest emotions,”

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:49.839 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎whereas previously it said
he examines the ‘hearts and the kidneys.’ 

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:52.342 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now it’s easier to understand.

00:04:52.342 --> 00:04:55.778 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Besides all the aspects of helping to get 

00:04:55.778 --> 00:04:57.981 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a better understanding of God’s Word,

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:01.818 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎why are brothers and sisters 
happy to use this revised version

00:05:01.818 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in field service?

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:09.158 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When reading a scripture,

00:05:09.158 --> 00:05:10.593 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you can tell that people understand

00:05:10.593 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it more quickly;

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:14.163 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there is less need to explain more. 

00:05:14.163 --> 00:05:16.666 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that’s great.

00:05:16.766 --> 00:05:19.635 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I particularly like the glossary;

00:05:19.635 --> 00:05:21.637 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎it’s a kind of mini Insight book. 

00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:23.473 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It has been very useful

00:05:23.473 --> 00:05:25.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when I study and also in the ministry.

00:05:26.476 --> 00:05:28.478 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Furthermore, I like

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.513 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that at the beginning of the Bible,

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:32.515 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there are 20 introductions

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:36.452 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that answer questions
that people in the territory often ask,

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:40.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they have Bible verses 
and very nice illustrations. 

00:05:40.056 --> 00:05:43.626 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So they are very clear and practical.

00:05:44.494 --> 00:05:48.231 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To achieve such an awesome result
by revising the New World Translation, 

00:05:48.231 --> 00:05:52.235 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which important aspects did
the translators have to keep in mind?

00:05:56.239 --> 00:05:58.241 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thanks to the modern language

00:05:58.241 --> 00:06:00.243 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is used in the revision,

00:06:00.243 --> 00:06:04.347 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎readers can understand
most Bible passages as they read them,

00:06:04.347 --> 00:06:08.151 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎without having to stop 
and read them over again. 

00:06:08.151 --> 00:06:10.486 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is possible, in part,

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:14.490 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because the text 
is not cluttered with too many words

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.828 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—trying to copy 
the Hebrew syntax and style of expression. 

00:06:18.828 --> 00:06:21.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thus, the use of modern language

00:06:21.564 --> 00:06:24.567 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎contributes to naturalness and clarity.

00:06:28.538 --> 00:06:30.573 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The language used

00:06:30.573 --> 00:06:32.842 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the revision also now allows

00:06:32.842 --> 00:06:36.112 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the emotions of the characters 
to come through more vividly. 

00:06:36.112 --> 00:06:38.247 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You straightaway notice when someone

00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:40.883 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is angry or desperate or sad.

00:06:40.883 --> 00:06:45.088 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Like in Matthew 11,
when Jesus invites us to take his yoke upon us,

00:06:45.088 --> 00:06:48.958 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎his warmth is immediately obvious.

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:52.261 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the 2003 edition,

00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:53.963 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎only one sentence was packed

00:06:53.963 --> 00:06:55.765 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into seven verses,

00:06:55.765 --> 00:06:57.767 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and its length was half a column,

00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:01.204 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎making it very cumbersome
to follow the line of thought.

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:05.274 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the revised Bible, 
this part was cut into more sentences,

00:07:05.274 --> 00:07:07.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so it is easier to grasp the idea.

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:11.481 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many parents have told us

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:12.748 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that now when they read the Bible

00:07:12.748 --> 00:07:13.749 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with their children,

00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:15.952 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they don’t have to stop to explain words

00:07:15.952 --> 00:07:18.121 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the reading is much more enjoyable.

00:07:20.456 --> 00:07:23.759 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The revised New World Translation 
will be made available

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in more languages in the near future. 

00:07:27.964 --> 00:07:30.900 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We know that Jehovah wants 
all his people to listen

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:34.170 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as he speaks to them in clear,
understandable language.

00:07:36.806 --> 00:07:39.742 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This will help us 
to come to know Jehovah even better,

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:41.744 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and our love for him

00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:43.646 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will keep growing

00:07:43.646 --> 00:07:47.650 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎while we read his Word with joy.

00:07:52.021 --> 00:07:54.857 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In addition to being clear and accurate,

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what should be the primary goal 
of any Bible translation? 

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:01.597 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The answer is found

00:08:01.597 --> 00:08:04.267 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the theme of our program this month:

00:08:04.267 --> 00:08:07.870 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Father, Glorify Your Name.” 

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.039 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s based on Jesus’ words

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:13.342 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎recorded at John 12:28. 

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:17.246 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s start by examining 
the context of those words

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:21.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as found in verses 27 and 28:

00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:26.189 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Now I am troubled, 
and what should I say? 

00:08:26.189 --> 00:08:29.192 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Father, save me out of this hour. 

00:08:29.192 --> 00:08:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Nevertheless, this is why 
I have come to this hour. 

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.732 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Father, glorify your name.’ 

00:08:36.732 --> 00:08:39.302 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Then a voice came out of heaven:

00:08:39.302 --> 00:08:43.639 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘I have glorified it and will glorify it again.’”

00:08:44.273 --> 00:08:46.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jesus uttered these words

00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:50.379 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just four days before his agonizing death. 

00:08:50.379 --> 00:08:53.015 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But even though Jesus was very troubled

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:55.518 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about what was soon to happen to him,

00:08:55.518 --> 00:08:58.854 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what was his primary concern? 

00:08:58.854 --> 00:09:02.992 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was for Jehovah’s name to be glorified.

00:09:02.992 --> 00:09:05.928 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We today are likewise concerned

00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:10.800 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about the glorification
of Jehovah’s name and his reputation.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.904 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But how can someone 
be glorified, or made famous,

00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:17.540 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if nobody knows his name? 

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:20.643 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Knowing God’s personal name, Jehovah,

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:24.580 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is closely tied in with glorifying his reputation. 

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:27.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, knowing Jehovah’s name

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.920 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is the very first step in that process. 

00:09:31.721 --> 00:09:35.791 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The June 2015 program of JW Broadcasting

00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.427 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎discussed why God’s personal name

00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:41.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎should appear in all translations of the Bible. 

00:09:41.864 --> 00:09:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You might find it helpful to review that program. 

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:50.339 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But this month, we will consider
another aspect of this subject

00:09:50.339 --> 00:09:54.277 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is far more controversial, namely,

00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:59.282 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Should the divine name appear 
in the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:02.752 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or what is commonly called 
the New Testament? 

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.355 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many scholars who agree with us

00:10:06.355 --> 00:10:09.859 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the divine name should appear 
in the Hebrew Scriptures

00:10:09.859 --> 00:10:13.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎disagree with our use of the same name

00:10:13.095 --> 00:10:15.197 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the New Testament. 

00:10:15.197 --> 00:10:19.135 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what prompted the translators 
of the New World Translation 

00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:23.172 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to restore the divine name 237 times 

00:10:23.172 --> 00:10:25.541 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures? 

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:30.212 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The answer to that question 
involves some fascinating events

00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:34.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that seem to be too amazing 
to be just coincidence. 

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:38.754 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It also requires us
to do some detective work.

00:10:38.754 --> 00:10:40.356 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Sound intriguing? 

00:10:40.356 --> 00:10:41.757 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is! 

00:10:41.757 --> 00:10:44.760 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So let’s start our journey together.

00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:49.765 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First of all, imagine that you
are back in the late 1940’s

00:10:49.765 --> 00:10:52.968 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the time when
the New World Bible Translation Committee

00:10:52.968 --> 00:10:55.971 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was translating the book of Matthew. 

00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:58.307 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As they started the project,

00:10:58.307 --> 00:11:01.911 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎no doubt they realized 
that Matthew’s account contains

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:05.181 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. 

00:11:05.181 --> 00:11:08.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many of these contain the Tetragrammaton,

00:11:08.017 --> 00:11:12.788 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is, the divine name 
in Hebrew letters in the original text. 

00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:18.461 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example,
let’s consider Matthew 22:44. 

00:11:19.962 --> 00:11:24.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This verse records Jesus
quoting the words of Psalm 110:1:

00:11:25.968 --> 00:11:30.673 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Jehovah said to my Lord:
‘Sit at my right hand.’”

00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:35.945 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But did Jesus use the divine name
when making this quote?

00:11:35.945 --> 00:11:38.581 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Or did he substitute the divine name

00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:41.584 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with an equivalent such as “Lord”? 

00:11:41.584 --> 00:11:43.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, the brothers would have realized

00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:46.555 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that many editions of the King James Version

00:11:46.555 --> 00:11:50.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did something
very interesting at Matthew 22:44.

00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:53.929 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In that verse, the English word “LORD”

00:11:53.929 --> 00:11:56.532 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is written in capital letters.

00:11:56.532 --> 00:12:00.002 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This technique is used 
throughout the King James Version 

00:12:00.002 --> 00:12:05.007 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to indicate where 
the original Hebrew text uses the divine name. 

00:12:05.007 --> 00:12:08.444 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So using “LORD”
in capital letters in this verse,

00:12:08.444 --> 00:12:12.148 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in effect, 
acknowledges that the name of God

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.483 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was originally in this quote. 

00:12:14.483 --> 00:12:16.485 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The implication is

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:19.221 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jesus used God’s name 
when making this quote.

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:25.494 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, in the years prior 
to the release of the New World Translation,

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:29.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many scholars argued 
that long before Jesus came to earth,

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:33.469 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Jewish people
had already removed the Tetragrammaton

00:12:33.469 --> 00:12:37.840 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the Greek translation of the Hebrew text
—the Septuagint. 

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:40.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If true, that would mean

00:12:40.543 --> 00:12:43.813 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that copies of the Holy Writings 
used in Jesus’ day

00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:47.283 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎would not have contained 
the divine name. 

00:12:47.283 --> 00:12:50.986 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what should the Translation Committee do? 

00:12:50.986 --> 00:12:55.458 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Should they use the divine name
in their translation or not?

00:12:55.458 --> 00:13:00.129 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is where the story becomes intriguing. 

00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:03.332 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Around that time,
some exciting discoveries

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:06.936 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were made that proved those scholars wrong.

00:13:06.936 --> 00:13:10.439 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One of these discoveries
was documented by the brothers

00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:13.108 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the foreword of the 1950 edition

00:13:13.108 --> 00:13:16.712 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:13:16.712 --> 00:13:20.749 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It involved 
some papyri copies of the Septuagint

00:13:20.749 --> 00:13:24.119 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that dated 
back to around the time of Jesus.

00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:27.957 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What did these papyri fragments reveal? 

00:13:27.957 --> 00:13:31.927 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s find out in this documentary report.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:36.665 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In 1950,

00:13:36.665 --> 00:13:40.169 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the New World Translation 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released.

00:13:40.169 --> 00:13:44.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I have the extreme pleasure of releasing

00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:46.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“the New World Translation

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:51.146 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures!” 

00:13:51.146 --> 00:13:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This translation was unique

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.052 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in that it restored 
the divine name, Jehovah,

00:13:57.052 --> 00:13:59.955 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎237 times in the main text

00:13:59.955 --> 00:14:02.725 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the so-called New Testament.

00:14:02.725 --> 00:14:06.195 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But how could they do that, 
considering that for centuries 

00:14:06.195 --> 00:14:10.032 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many Bibles did not use Jehovah’s name? 

00:14:10.032 --> 00:14:14.603 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And why did the divine name 
need to be restored?

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:16.639 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The oldest copies we have available

00:14:16.639 --> 00:14:18.641 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎do not use the divine name

00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:21.310 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures;

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.647 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they use substitutes like God or Lord.

00:14:24.647 --> 00:14:26.315 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Very early on,

00:14:26.315 --> 00:14:29.552 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the copyists of those original manuscripts,

00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:31.387 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they simply replaced

00:14:31.387 --> 00:14:35.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—they got into the practice of replacing—
God’s name. 

00:14:35.558 --> 00:14:38.727 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We know that this is not a translation

00:14:38.727 --> 00:14:41.163 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because one is a name 
and the other one is a title. 

00:14:41.163 --> 00:14:45.501 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And it’s not even  
a synonym for Jehovah, for a name.

00:14:45.501 --> 00:14:47.102 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Since the Greek Scriptures

00:14:47.102 --> 00:14:48.604 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were an inspired addition

00:14:48.604 --> 00:14:50.372 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the sacred Hebrew Scriptures and, 

00:14:50.372 --> 00:14:51.507 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in fact,

00:14:51.507 --> 00:14:53.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah’s name, God’s name,

00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:56.879 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was used some 7,000 times
in the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:14:56.879 --> 00:15:00.950 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the sudden disappearance
in the Greek text is inconsistent.

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.620 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even though 
the New World Bible Translation Committee 

00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:06.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎believed that Jehovah’s name should appear

00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:09.458 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the text of the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:11.694 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they also knew that at that time

00:15:11.694 --> 00:15:15.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎virtually all Bible scholars 
disagreed with that belief. 

00:15:15.564 --> 00:15:18.801 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those scholars argued 
that by the time of Jesus,

00:15:18.801 --> 00:15:22.972 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎even the Greek translation 
of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Septuagint, 

00:15:22.972 --> 00:15:25.608 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎no longer contained the divine name. 

00:15:25.608 --> 00:15:27.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So why would the writers 
of the New Testament

00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:32.047 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎use the divine name when their copies 
of the Holy Scriptures in Greek

00:15:32.047 --> 00:15:34.650 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did not contain the Tetragrammaton? 

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:37.953 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This view was based on faulty information.

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:39.221 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How so? 

00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:41.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Did the Septuagint still use

00:15:41.457 --> 00:15:43.659 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the divine name in Jesus’ time? 

00:15:43.659 --> 00:15:45.761 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s consider one piece of evidence

00:15:45.761 --> 00:15:47.763 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that answers this question.

00:15:48.263 --> 00:15:50.165 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Something amazing happened in 1944. 

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A theological journal published a picture

00:15:53.168 --> 00:15:55.638 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of a Greek Septuagint fragment

00:15:55.638 --> 00:15:58.974 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the Papyrus Fouad 266 collection. 

00:15:58.974 --> 00:16:02.945 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, inside that fragment 
there was the divine name.

00:16:02.945 --> 00:16:05.681 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the Greek text, 
you had the Tetragrammaton,

00:16:05.681 --> 00:16:08.083 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎not just once but throughout. 

00:16:08.083 --> 00:16:12.021 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, this fragment was very old, 
dating back to the first century B.C.E.,

00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:15.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the important point is 
that this was proof, clear proof,

00:16:15.991 --> 00:16:19.962 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the divine name was originally there.

00:16:19.962 --> 00:16:22.831 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Two Jehovah’s Witnesses were asked

00:16:22.831 --> 00:16:25.501 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to obtain photographs
of these fragments,

00:16:25.501 --> 00:16:29.204 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which were located in Cairo, Egypt.

00:16:29.204 --> 00:16:32.541 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The New World Translation Committee 
was very interested in this

00:16:32.541 --> 00:16:34.810 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because they started translating

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.279 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Greek Scriptures in 1947.

00:16:39.348 --> 00:16:43.218 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎After obtaining permission, 
pictures of 12 of the fragments 

00:16:43.218 --> 00:16:45.554 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were published in the foreword 
of the New World Translation

00:16:45.554 --> 00:16:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:16:50.826 --> 00:16:54.296 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What amazes me about this is the timing. 

00:16:55.164 --> 00:16:59.468 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When our brothers
—this New World Translation Committee—

00:16:59.468 --> 00:17:02.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did their research, before even translating,

00:17:02.037 --> 00:17:04.173 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎suddenly something that was unknown

00:17:04.173 --> 00:17:07.676 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until essentially 1944

00:17:07.676 --> 00:17:10.079 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎came to light that confirmed

00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:12.915 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the eternal name of God

00:17:13.916 --> 00:17:18.020 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had to be revealed;
it could no longer be hidden. 

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.423 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It should be shown to everyone 
who wants to worship Jehovah.

00:17:21.423 --> 00:17:25.694 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This careful preservation 
supports what Jesus said in prayer

00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:29.431 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at John 17:26, 
when he said to his Father:

00:17:29.431 --> 00:17:33.402 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I have made your name known . . . 
and will make it known.”

00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:38.240 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
we are proud to be “a people for his name.”

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Knowing his name 
is essential to knowing Jehovah himself,

00:17:42.611 --> 00:17:45.948 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the fact that Jehovah 
has provided this arrangement

00:17:45.948 --> 00:17:48.417 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎through his people

00:17:48.417 --> 00:17:50.586 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎makes it very clear

00:17:50.586 --> 00:17:54.456 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that he was gathering 
“a people for his name.”

00:17:54.456 --> 00:17:57.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is why 
this Bible translation is so beautiful,

00:17:57.793 --> 00:18:00.162 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because it brings us closer to Jehovah. 

00:18:00.162 --> 00:18:04.433 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah is not just a Lord somewhere,
which could apply to anyone,

00:18:04.433 --> 00:18:07.669 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but he is Jehovah, our God. 

00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:10.472 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He extends his hand to us and says, well,

00:18:10.472 --> 00:18:15.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘I’m Jehovah; call me by that name.’

00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:19.348 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What an amazing find! 

00:18:19.348 --> 00:18:22.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They found proof
that the divine name in Hebrew letters

00:18:22.785 --> 00:18:26.054 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was included in the text of the Septuagint

00:18:26.054 --> 00:18:28.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that would have been
available in Jesus’ day

00:18:28.924 --> 00:18:31.093 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and just at the right time

00:18:31.093 --> 00:18:33.929 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the time when the members
of the Translation Committee

00:18:33.929 --> 00:18:37.332 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were making the decision
as to whether they should use

00:18:37.332 --> 00:18:42.171 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the name Jehovah in their translation
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:18:42.171 --> 00:18:46.308 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We are so happy that the brothers 
were able to find this information

00:18:46.308 --> 00:18:50.612 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because these fragments 
were not released for general publication

00:18:50.612 --> 00:18:54.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until much later in 1971

00:18:54.716 --> 00:18:59.721 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—years after the time when the committee 
needed to make that vital decision. 

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:01.723 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But that’s not all! 

00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:04.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do you remember 
what other important material

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:08.096 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was discovered starting in 1947? 

00:19:08.096 --> 00:19:10.632 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was the Dead Sea Scrolls. 

00:19:10.632 --> 00:19:15.237 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many of these scrolls were dated
to around the time when Jesus was on earth.

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:20.242 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what did these scrolls
contain over and over again?

00:19:20.242 --> 00:19:22.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You guessed it

00:19:22.244 --> 00:19:25.214 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the Tetragrammaton—
the divine name.

00:19:25.981 --> 00:19:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Isn’t it interesting

00:19:27.983 --> 00:19:30.986 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that these discoveries
were made around the time

00:19:30.986 --> 00:19:34.756 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when our brothers were translating
the New World Translation? 

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:37.326 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Is this just coincidence

00:19:37.326 --> 00:19:40.996 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or do you see Jehovah’s hand in this? 

00:19:40.996 --> 00:19:44.399 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What has happened 
in the years since that time? 

00:19:44.399 --> 00:19:46.435 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s important to note

00:19:46.435 --> 00:19:49.204 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the divine name is consistently used

00:19:49.204 --> 00:19:51.206 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in fragments of the Septuagint

00:19:51.206 --> 00:19:54.109 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that date from the first century B.C.E.

00:19:54.109 --> 00:19:56.778 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the first century C.E. 

00:19:56.778 --> 00:20:00.582 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This has led some scholars
to acknowledge the possibility

00:20:00.582 --> 00:20:02.684 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jesus and his disciples

00:20:02.684 --> 00:20:07.322 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎used the divine name
when making these quotations.

00:20:07.322 --> 00:20:11.560 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we need to remember 
that Hebrew Scripture quotations

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.463 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎account for approximately one third

00:20:14.463 --> 00:20:16.999 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the 237 times

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:20.035 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the New World Translation
restores the divine name

00:20:20.035 --> 00:20:22.704 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures. 

00:20:22.704 --> 00:20:26.475 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what about the other 
two thirds of occurrences? 

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:29.945 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, this brings us 
to the part of our program

00:20:29.945 --> 00:20:33.715 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that involves some detective work.

00:20:33.715 --> 00:20:36.618 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Imagine that you are a detective,

00:20:36.618 --> 00:20:38.954 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and you catch an art thief

00:20:38.954 --> 00:20:42.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who has stolen 
over 200 original pieces of art

00:20:42.524 --> 00:20:46.094 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from various museums and art galleries. 

00:20:46.094 --> 00:20:49.364 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This thief not only stole each piece of art

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:53.168 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but he also substituted it with a copy.

00:20:53.168 --> 00:20:56.138 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So you need to start an investigation

00:20:56.138 --> 00:20:58.607 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and follow the clues. 

00:20:58.607 --> 00:21:01.443 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First of all, you need to find out

00:21:01.443 --> 00:21:04.846 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where each painting was located originally.

00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:09.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Once you have verified 
that fakes are hanging in those locations,

00:21:09.451 --> 00:21:12.688 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you would be in a position 
to return the originals

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.624 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to their proper locations. 

00:21:15.624 --> 00:21:19.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In a similar way, 
we have solid evidence

00:21:19.294 --> 00:21:23.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that a crime was committed 
in the second and third centuries C.E.

00:21:23.899 --> 00:21:27.135 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Apostate Christians removed the divine name

00:21:27.135 --> 00:21:29.137 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from manuscripts of the Bible

00:21:29.137 --> 00:21:33.608 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and replaced it with Kyʹri·os,
the Greek word for “Lord.” 

00:21:33.608 --> 00:21:36.778 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There is much evidence for this conclusion. 

00:21:36.778 --> 00:21:40.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So they are like the art thief in our illustration. 

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:43.085 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They stole something valuable

00:21:43.085 --> 00:21:48.090 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when they removed Jehovah’s name
from the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:50.292 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we have a problem. 

00:21:50.292 --> 00:21:53.695 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There are no copies 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:21:53.695 --> 00:21:56.698 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the first century for us to examine. 

00:21:56.698 --> 00:21:59.501 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The earliest existing manuscripts

00:21:59.501 --> 00:22:01.703 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that would have a bearing on this matter

00:22:01.703 --> 00:22:04.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎date from the late second century onward

00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:08.977 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—a time when we know that the crime 
had already been committed

00:22:08.977 --> 00:22:12.614 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and Jehovah’s name 
had already been removed. 

00:22:12.614 --> 00:22:15.484 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So how do we know where Jehovah’s name

00:22:15.484 --> 00:22:18.387 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎originally appeared in the Greek text

00:22:18.387 --> 00:22:21.289 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎before the apostates removed it? 

00:22:21.289 --> 00:22:24.760 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, just like the detective in our illustration,

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:27.362 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we need to start an investigation

00:22:27.362 --> 00:22:29.865 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and follow the clues.

00:22:29.865 --> 00:22:31.900 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To do our work properly,

00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:36.538 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we need to examine every time 
the word “Lord” appears in the text

00:22:36.538 --> 00:22:40.075 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and see if it refers to Jehovah, to Jesus,

00:22:40.075 --> 00:22:43.011 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or to some other person with the title “Lord.” 

00:22:44.279 --> 00:22:47.516 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Basically, 
there are five clues that will help us

00:22:47.516 --> 00:22:50.152 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to find out where the original artwork,

00:22:50.152 --> 00:22:54.122 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is, Jehovah’s name, 
needs to be returned to. 

00:22:54.122 --> 00:22:57.626 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s scrutinize these clues. 

00:22:57.626 --> 00:22:59.661 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The first clue is,

00:22:59.661 --> 00:23:03.532 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as we have already mentioned,
the easiest clue,

00:23:03.532 --> 00:23:05.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where the title “Lord” appears

00:23:05.534 --> 00:23:08.003 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures

00:23:08.003 --> 00:23:10.872 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that originally used the divine name. 

00:23:10.872 --> 00:23:13.008 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The second clue is

00:23:13.008 --> 00:23:16.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where the Greek text contains a Hebrew idiom

00:23:16.378 --> 00:23:19.214 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that would normally contain the divine name. 

00:23:19.214 --> 00:23:22.584 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
if someone says in English,

00:23:22.584 --> 00:23:25.220 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“He escaped by the skin of his . . . ,”

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:27.222 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what word do you expect? 

00:23:27.222 --> 00:23:29.491 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Teeth, not eye. 

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:33.128 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, the expression is “skin of his teeth.” 

00:23:33.128 --> 00:23:36.331 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is similar with Hebrew expressions. 

00:23:36.331 --> 00:23:39.301 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some of these contain the divine name. 

00:23:39.301 --> 00:23:43.338 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
the expression found at Matthew 1:20

00:23:43.338 --> 00:23:47.008 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is “the angel of Jehovah.” 

00:23:47.008 --> 00:23:50.879 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So whenever we find 
a Greek translation of a Hebrew idiom

00:23:50.879 --> 00:23:52.948 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that uses the divine name,

00:23:52.948 --> 00:23:56.952 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎this is another clue 
that Jehovah’s name should be there.

00:23:57.953 --> 00:23:59.955 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The third clue

00:23:59.955 --> 00:24:02.057 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is where the term “Lord” appears

00:24:02.057 --> 00:24:04.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the context surrounding a quotation

00:24:04.726 --> 00:24:07.696 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is originally attributed to Jehovah. 

00:24:07.696 --> 00:24:12.033 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎An example of this is Matthew 1:22:

00:24:12.734 --> 00:24:16.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“All of this actually came about to fulfill

00:24:16.037 --> 00:24:19.608 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what was spoken by Jehovah 
through his prophet, saying . . .”

00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:25.113 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The quotation 
that immediately follows at Matthew 1:23

00:24:25.113 --> 00:24:28.617 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is taken from Isaiah 7:14.

00:24:28.617 --> 00:24:30.619 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is a prophetic message

00:24:30.619 --> 00:24:33.989 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎spoken by Jehovah through Isaiah.

00:24:33.989 --> 00:24:35.991 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The fourth clue

00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:38.126 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is when we see in the Greek text

00:24:38.126 --> 00:24:42.998 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where there is no definite article 
before Kyʹri·os, the Greek word for “Lord,”

00:24:42.998 --> 00:24:47.969 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in places where the Greek grammar
normally expects a definite article. 

00:24:47.969 --> 00:24:52.574 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This clue may indicate 
that a proper name, such as Jehovah,

00:24:52.574 --> 00:24:54.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎originally was there in the text

00:24:54.709 --> 00:24:59.714 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and was removed from later manuscripts
and replaced with Kyʹri·os. 

00:24:59.714 --> 00:25:03.018 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To illustrate the importance of this clue,

00:25:03.018 --> 00:25:06.021 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎imagine that you are a newspaper reporter

00:25:06.721 --> 00:25:09.324 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who is reporting on a car accident. 

00:25:09.324 --> 00:25:12.994 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You report that Joe Smith,
the driver of the vehicle,

00:25:12.994 --> 00:25:15.297 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was killed in the accident. 

00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:18.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But just before the story goes to press,

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎your editor informs you 
that Joe Smith’s relatives

00:25:21.836 --> 00:25:24.573 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎have not yet been notified of his death. 

00:25:24.573 --> 00:25:28.343 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So you are told to remove
his name from the report.

00:25:28.343 --> 00:25:31.580 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You do that, but in doing so,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you forget to add 
the “the” before the word “driver.”

00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:37.919 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What would happen?

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:39.921 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Your report would say,

00:25:39.921 --> 00:25:43.925 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“As a result of the accident,
driver was killed.” 

00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:46.261 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That sounds strange, doesn’t it? 

00:25:46.261 --> 00:25:50.165 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It sounds like “driver” 
is the name of the person killed.

00:25:50.165 --> 00:25:52.968 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s because you suppressed the name

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:56.338 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and forgot to add the appropriate article. 

00:25:56.338 --> 00:25:59.874 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That is similar 
to what our symbolic art thieves did

00:25:59.874 --> 00:26:03.712 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when removing 
Jehovah’s name from the Bible. 

00:26:03.712 --> 00:26:05.747 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎An example of this

00:26:05.747 --> 00:26:10.085 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is found in the Greek text of Mark 13:20. 

00:26:11.253 --> 00:26:15.624 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In fact, unless Lord had cut short the days,

00:26:15.624 --> 00:26:19.027 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎no flesh would be saved.” 

00:26:19.027 --> 00:26:21.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That sounds like “Lord” is a name,

00:26:21.429 --> 00:26:25.467 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and clearly it should be Jehovah’s name. 

00:26:25.467 --> 00:26:30.038 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s why the New World Translation 
restores the divine name in this verse. 

00:26:31.139 --> 00:26:34.576 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, 
even in cases where the definite article

00:26:34.576 --> 00:26:36.645 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎occurs before the word “Lord,”

00:26:36.645 --> 00:26:38.813 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there may be other strong reasons

00:26:38.813 --> 00:26:42.617 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for viewing “Lord” 
as a substitute for the divine name,

00:26:42.617 --> 00:26:44.919 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎like the ones we already discussed.

00:26:46.354 --> 00:26:48.690 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The final clue

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:53.695 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is where the divine name 
needs to be added to avoid ambiguity. 

00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:55.730 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎An example of this

00:26:55.730 --> 00:26:59.567 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is in Mark 5:19. 

00:26:59.567 --> 00:27:02.971 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There, Jesus says to a man he healed:

00:27:02.971 --> 00:27:05.607 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Go home to your relatives,

00:27:05.607 --> 00:27:08.443 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and report to them all the things

00:27:08.443 --> 00:27:12.380 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah has done for you 
and the mercy he has shown you.”

00:27:13.114 --> 00:27:17.118 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How do we know that “Lord” 
here refers to Jehovah

00:27:17.118 --> 00:27:19.120 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and not Jesus?

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:21.489 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, in recording the same event,

00:27:21.489 --> 00:27:26.494 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Luke 8:39 uses the Greek word The·osʹ (God),

00:27:26.494 --> 00:27:31.166 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎supporting the thought 
that Kyʹri·os (Lord) at Mark 5:19

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:34.469 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is used with reference to Jehovah God. 

00:27:34.469 --> 00:27:39.341 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So these five clues helped 
the New World Bible Translation Committee

00:27:39.341 --> 00:27:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to ascertain where the name Jehovah

00:27:41.343 --> 00:27:44.646 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎should be restored to the Biblical text.

00:27:44.646 --> 00:27:47.716 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this way, they were able to right the wrong

00:27:47.716 --> 00:27:50.352 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that was committed by apostate Christians

00:27:50.352 --> 00:27:53.355 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the second and third centuries or,

00:27:53.355 --> 00:27:55.957 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in other words, they were able to return

00:27:55.957 --> 00:27:58.460 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the figurative pieces of stolen artwork

00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.196 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to their proper places. 

00:28:01.196 --> 00:28:03.865 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If you would like to review these five clues,

00:28:03.865 --> 00:28:07.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you will find a detailed explanation in Appendix C

00:28:08.336 --> 00:28:11.139 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Study Edition of the New World Translation.

00:28:12.073 --> 00:28:15.310 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You can either find this in the JW Library® app

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:19.447 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or online at Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY. 

00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:21.983 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the same Appendix C,

00:28:21.983 --> 00:28:25.320 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you will find a list 
of what we call J-References

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.889 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that support these decisions.

00:28:27.889 --> 00:28:29.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But you might ask,

00:28:29.924 --> 00:28:34.529 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘What role did these J-References play 
in making these decisions?’ 

00:28:34.529 --> 00:28:37.665 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, to help us understand 
the answer to that question,

00:28:37.665 --> 00:28:40.602 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I’d like to introduce to you 
a brother with whom I work,

00:28:40.602 --> 00:28:42.604 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Brother Nick Ahladis. 

00:28:42.604 --> 00:28:45.774 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He’s the assistant overseer 
of Translation Services.

00:28:45.774 --> 00:28:47.776 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Nick, thanks so much for being willing

00:28:47.776 --> 00:28:50.044 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to come along 
and answer some questions for us.

00:28:50.044 --> 00:28:51.513 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, I’m glad to come.

00:28:51.513 --> 00:28:55.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, now that we’ve got you here,
the first question I’d like to ask you is,

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:58.620 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What really are these so-called J-References?

00:28:58.686 --> 00:29:00.789 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well the “J” in the J-References

00:29:00.789 --> 00:29:02.824 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎stands for Jehovah. 

00:29:02.824 --> 00:29:05.460 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this is mainly a list of Bibles

00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.029 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in Hebrew and other languages

00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:10.665 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that use the divine name, Jehovah,

00:29:10.665 --> 00:29:13.601 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the main text 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:29:13.601 --> 00:29:16.504 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—or at least some form 
of the name Jehovah. 

00:29:16.504 --> 00:29:18.940 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this list began to be compiled

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by the New World Bible Translation Committee

00:29:21.509 --> 00:29:23.545 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the 1940’s.

00:29:23.912 --> 00:29:26.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So where would we find a list like that now?

00:29:26.648 --> 00:29:30.151 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, originally there was 
a list of 21 such references

00:29:30.151 --> 00:29:34.355 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the 1950 edition 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures. 

00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:36.591 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then, in 1984,

00:29:36.591 --> 00:29:39.527 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎27 such references were included

00:29:39.527 --> 00:29:42.797 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Reference Bible in English. 

00:29:42.797 --> 00:29:47.202 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And since that time, 
many more J-References have been found,

00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:49.537 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and now the list includes

00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:52.807 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎over 90 such translations and reference works. 

00:29:52.807 --> 00:29:55.443 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And you can find an up-to-date list

00:29:55.443 --> 00:29:57.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in Appendix C4 of the [Study] Bible.

00:29:58.546 --> 00:29:59.547 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Very good. 

00:29:59.547 --> 00:30:03.418 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So I guess the main question 
we’re interested in asking you is,

00:30:03.418 --> 00:30:07.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do these J-References prove in themselves

00:30:07.789 --> 00:30:11.092 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the Tetragrammaton should be 
in the Christian Greek Scriptures?

00:30:11.092 --> 00:30:13.094 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Actually, no; they don’t.

00:30:13.094 --> 00:30:16.498 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ah, now, I’m sure most of us 
weren’t expecting you to say that. 

00:30:16.498 --> 00:30:18.967 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So can you explain it a little bit more please?

00:30:18.967 --> 00:30:20.735 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, 
the New World Translation Committee

00:30:20.735 --> 00:30:25.139 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did not rely on the J-References
as the basis for their decision

00:30:25.139 --> 00:30:28.776 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to restore the divine name 
in the Christian Greek Scriptures. 

00:30:28.776 --> 00:30:31.613 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You already discussed 
the basis for the decision

00:30:31.613 --> 00:30:33.615 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎earlier in the broadcast. 

00:30:33.615 --> 00:30:36.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Rather, 
these J-References provide proof

00:30:36.651 --> 00:30:40.188 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that other translators 
have made similar decisions

00:30:40.188 --> 00:30:42.390 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when restoring the divine name

00:30:42.390 --> 00:30:46.160 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to their editions 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:48.029 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or the so-called New Testament.

00:30:48.029 --> 00:30:51.566 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, now that you’re talking 
about these other Bible translators,

00:30:51.566 --> 00:30:54.769 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎could you give us an example 
of who you’re talking about?

00:30:54.769 --> 00:30:58.540 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, a number of them 
were well-known Bible scholars. 

00:30:58.540 --> 00:31:03.545 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 19th-century 
Lutheran theologian Franz Delitzsch

00:31:03.545 --> 00:31:06.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is still considered to be 
a foremost Bible scholar

00:31:06.648 --> 00:31:09.250 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and a scholar of Biblical Hebrew. 

00:31:09.250 --> 00:31:11.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Delitzsch’s translation

00:31:11.219 --> 00:31:15.156 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New Testament in Hebrew 
was produced in 1877,

00:31:15.156 --> 00:31:17.492 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it’s one of the J-References. 

00:31:17.492 --> 00:31:20.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, it’s still one 
of the best-known New Testaments

00:31:20.595 --> 00:31:23.031 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Hebrew language. 

00:31:23.031 --> 00:31:27.001 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In that translation, 
he discerned when to use Jehovah’s name

00:31:27.001 --> 00:31:29.137 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in places where the Greek text

00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:32.407 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎contains the term Kyʹri·os, or Lord. 

00:31:32.407 --> 00:31:34.976 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The New World Bible Translation Committee

00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:38.513 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎studied all those occurrences 
from his translation

00:31:38.513 --> 00:31:43.384 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as well as the occurrences 
in others of the J-References.

00:31:43.384 --> 00:31:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So how would you summarize 
what the value is of these J-References?

00:31:47.956 --> 00:31:49.958 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, all the J-References,

00:31:49.958 --> 00:31:52.894 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎including the new ones in the Study Bible, 

00:31:52.894 --> 00:31:56.197 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎represent the view 
of translators and scholars

00:31:56.197 --> 00:31:58.333 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who arrived at the same conclusion

00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:00.969 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the New World 
Bible Translation Committee did,

00:32:01.636 --> 00:32:04.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎namely, that Jesus Christ and the apostles

00:32:04.906 --> 00:32:09.777 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎used the name Jehovah 
in their teaching and in their writings. 

00:32:09.777 --> 00:32:11.913 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this conclusion is reflected

00:32:11.913 --> 00:32:15.083 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in their translation and reference works.

00:32:15.083 --> 00:32:17.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Very interesting. 
That’s fascinating. 

00:32:17.385 --> 00:32:19.387 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So if I’ve got it right then,

00:32:19.387 --> 00:32:24.058 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what you’re saying is
that if we go to Appendix C, in C3,

00:32:24.058 --> 00:32:26.461 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there we’ve got a list of the reasons

00:32:26.461 --> 00:32:29.197 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎why the brothers
on the New World Translation Committee

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:32.100 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎decided to put
Jehovah’s name in certain verses.

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.136 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And then C4 is virtually

00:32:35.136 --> 00:32:37.572 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a list of other Bible translations

00:32:37.572 --> 00:32:40.708 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where the translators
made exactly the same decision.

00:32:40.708 --> 00:32:41.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Is that right?

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:42.710 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s exactly right.

00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:43.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Ah, that’s good. 

00:32:43.378 --> 00:32:45.213 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, thank you very much, Nick,
for coming along. 

00:32:45.213 --> 00:32:48.616 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We really appreciated hearing 
those expressions from you. 

00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:51.252 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Before you go, though, 
can we ask you, please,

00:32:51.252 --> 00:32:55.423 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Can you take back the love and greetings
and an expression of appreciation

00:32:55.423 --> 00:32:59.227 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to all those hardworking brothers and sisters
there in Translation Services?

00:32:59.227 --> 00:33:00.862 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, I’d be happy to.

00:33:00.862 --> 00:33:02.330 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Thank you very much.

00:33:03.097 --> 00:33:07.935 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why does the organization work 
so diligently to translate the Bible? 

00:33:07.935 --> 00:33:10.071 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s not so that we can feel smart

00:33:10.071 --> 00:33:13.441 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when talking to others
about the Bible and God’s name. 

00:33:13.441 --> 00:33:18.379 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎No, but it equips us to follow 
Jesus’ example in the ministry

00:33:18.379 --> 00:33:20.481 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to glorify God’s name

00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:23.618 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and make it known 
to those searching for Him. 

00:33:23.618 --> 00:33:26.054 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This month’s original song is entitled

00:33:26.054 --> 00:33:28.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The Search,”

00:33:28.056 --> 00:33:33.027 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and it shows the joy people feel 
when they find Jehovah.

00:33:51.612 --> 00:34:03.624 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We heard the words ‘seek and you’ll find’
The very priceless pearl of truth.

00:34:03.624 --> 00:34:15.169 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was a sea of doubts and questions to God
That the search would take us through.

00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:22.310 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we carried on with our sails unfurled.

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:33.187 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Like merchants on a quest, 
we knew that truth was out there.

00:34:33.187 --> 00:34:41.596 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The search—the search for the key
To answer all the things,

00:34:41.596 --> 00:34:47.435 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Things that we fight to understand:

00:34:47.435 --> 00:34:58.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The origin of man, wondering why we need 
God’s Kingdom soon to come.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:02.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Searching hard to find.

00:35:02.350 --> 00:35:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We had never known God had a name.
Jehovah is the one to call on.

00:35:14.428 --> 00:35:26.040 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we were shown, we found a piece
Of what we were searching for.

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:32.113 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And we carried on with our sails unfurled,

00:35:33.314 --> 00:35:44.358 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Finding truths about where we came from 
and where we’re heading.

00:35:44.358 --> 00:35:51.966 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The search—the search for the key
That answered all the things,

00:35:51.966 --> 00:35:58.239 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Things that we fought to understand:

00:35:58.239 --> 00:36:10.251 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The origin of man, a paradise that’s promised 
in God’s Kingdom soon to come.

00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:14.021 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Search and you will find.

00:36:14.021 --> 00:36:20.528 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now we can never hold back 
when others are searching

00:36:20.528 --> 00:36:32.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For the priceless pearl of truth,
Sailing a sea of unanswered questions.

00:36:32.773 --> 00:36:46.754 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So we help them to get through,
And we share what we’ve discovered.

00:37:07.408 --> 00:37:15.349 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The search—the search for the key
To answer all the things,

00:37:15.349 --> 00:37:21.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Things that they fight to understand:

00:37:21.155 --> 00:37:35.169 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The origin of man, living forever
in God’s Kingdom soon to come.

00:37:35.169 --> 00:37:42.043 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Search and you will find.

00:37:55.189 --> 00:37:57.858 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Maybe you once thought similarly

00:37:57.858 --> 00:38:01.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to what the lyrics from our song express:

00:38:01.429 --> 00:38:06.267 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Like merchants on a quest, 
we knew the truth was out there.” 

00:38:06.901 --> 00:38:10.571 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What a wonderful privilege it is to find Jehovah

00:38:10.571 --> 00:38:13.574 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and then to help others who are still searching. 

00:38:13.574 --> 00:38:17.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s an important way we glorify God’s name

00:38:17.111 --> 00:38:20.448 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and why we’re called Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:38:20.448 --> 00:38:22.650 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Bearing that name is, of course,

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎both a privilege and a responsibility.

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How so? 

00:38:28.155 --> 00:38:32.727 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Brother Robert Ciranko explains
in this Bethel morning worship.

00:38:32.827 --> 00:38:34.628 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By the time the apostle Peter

00:38:34.628 --> 00:38:36.464 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎wrote the words of today’s text,

00:38:36.464 --> 00:38:38.399 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎individuals who were Jews,

00:38:38.399 --> 00:38:40.668 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎proselytes, Samaritans,

00:38:40.668 --> 00:38:42.403 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and Gentiles had been brought

00:38:42.403 --> 00:38:44.071 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into the Christian congregation

00:38:44.071 --> 00:38:45.873 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as God’s people,

00:38:45.873 --> 00:38:48.109 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the spiritual Israel of God.

00:38:48.242 --> 00:38:50.644 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the verse before today’s text,

00:38:50.644 --> 00:38:53.514 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Peter outlined what their mission was.

00:38:53.514 --> 00:38:57.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s open 
to 1 Peter chapter 2 and read that.

00:38:57.451 --> 00:39:01.322 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s in verses 9 and 10 of 1 Peter 2.

00:39:02.823 --> 00:39:04.258 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He wrote:

00:39:04.258 --> 00:39:08.229 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“But you are ‘a chosen race, 
a royal priesthood,

00:39:08.229 --> 00:39:12.566 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘a holy nation, 
a people for special possession,

00:39:12.566 --> 00:39:15.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that you should declare abroad 
the excellencies’

00:39:15.836 --> 00:39:19.607 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“of the One who called you 
out of darkness into his wonderful light.

00:39:19.607 --> 00:39:21.776 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“For you were once not a people,

00:39:21.776 --> 00:39:25.212 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but now you are God’s people.”

00:39:25.212 --> 00:39:29.316 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And, of course, this refers 
to the spirit-anointed members

00:39:29.316 --> 00:39:32.119 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the congregation 
who would be responsible

00:39:32.119 --> 00:39:35.623 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for glorifying Jehovah’s name 
as his Witnesses.

00:39:35.623 --> 00:39:39.860 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And this harmonizes 
with what Peter had said years earlier

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:42.963 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the first-century governing body meeting,

00:39:42.963 --> 00:39:45.733 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as reported in Acts chapter 15.

00:39:45.733 --> 00:39:48.569 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So let’s turn there, Acts 15,

00:39:48.569 --> 00:39:52.306 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we will begin with verse 14.

00:39:52.306 --> 00:39:55.576 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It says: 
“Symeon has related thoroughly how God

00:39:55.576 --> 00:39:58.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for the first time 
turned his attention to the nations

00:39:58.312 --> 00:40:01.949 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“to take out of them a people for his name.

00:40:01.949 --> 00:40:04.051 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And with this the words 
of the Prophets agree,

00:40:04.051 --> 00:40:06.053 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“just as it is written:

00:40:06.053 --> 00:40:08.923 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘After these things 
I will return and raise up again

00:40:08.923 --> 00:40:11.058 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘the tent of David that is fallen down;

00:40:11.058 --> 00:40:13.794 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘I will rebuild its ruins and restore it,

00:40:13.794 --> 00:40:17.598 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘so that the men who remain 
may earnestly seek Jehovah,

00:40:17.598 --> 00:40:19.800 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘together with people of all the nations,

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.269 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘people who are called by my name,

00:40:22.269 --> 00:40:26.574 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎says Jehovah, who is doing these things.’”

00:40:26.574 --> 00:40:28.809 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, what about the rest of us

00:40:28.809 --> 00:40:30.945 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who are not anointed Christians

00:40:30.945 --> 00:40:34.115 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but who call ourselves Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:40:34.115 --> 00:40:36.217 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Are we also God’s people?

00:40:36.217 --> 00:40:38.252 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, most certainly!

00:40:38.252 --> 00:40:40.855 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what a proud honor it is for us

00:40:40.855 --> 00:40:43.557 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to bear the name of the only true God.

00:40:43.557 --> 00:40:46.560 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But with that name comes responsibility,

00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.464 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎one that other religious groups 
do not want to take on.

00:40:50.464 --> 00:40:52.666 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You see, we are under obligation 

00:40:52.666 --> 00:40:54.969 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to bear witness to Jehovah,

00:40:54.969 --> 00:40:57.171 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to tell the truth about him, 

00:40:57.171 --> 00:40:59.974 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to expose false teachings 

00:40:59.974 --> 00:41:02.309 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that misrepresent Jehovah.

00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:05.579 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And a classic example 
of an unscriptural dogma

00:41:05.579 --> 00:41:09.183 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that God’s people have exposed is the Trinity,

00:41:09.183 --> 00:41:11.552 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which reminds me of another hoax

00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:14.788 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that fooled many people 
who should have known better.

00:41:14.788 --> 00:41:18.826 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s the true story 
about a man named van Meegeren,

00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:22.830 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a Dutch artist, born in 1889,

00:41:22.830 --> 00:41:25.065 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who perpetrated what may have been

00:41:25.065 --> 00:41:28.936 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the most sensational art hoax of all time.

00:41:28.936 --> 00:41:31.372 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You see, he never won the critical acclaim

00:41:31.372 --> 00:41:33.574 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that he thought he was due as an artist.

00:41:33.574 --> 00:41:36.043 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So to get back at the art critics, 

00:41:36.043 --> 00:41:38.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he decided to demonstrate his talent

00:41:38.312 --> 00:41:41.282 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎by producing a painting that would fool them all,

00:41:41.282 --> 00:41:42.616 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and he set out to imitate 

00:41:42.616 --> 00:41:46.787 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the famous 17th-century Dutch impressionist, 

00:41:46.787 --> 00:41:48.989 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Johannes Vermeer.

00:41:48.989 --> 00:41:52.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, van Meegeren spent 4 years figuring out

00:41:52.359 --> 00:41:56.030 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎how to make 
a new painting look 300 years old.

00:41:56.030 --> 00:41:58.032 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The canvas was the easy part.

00:41:58.032 --> 00:42:00.034 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He just took a lesser-known painting 

00:42:00.034 --> 00:42:02.536 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the 17th century 
and removed the picture.

00:42:02.536 --> 00:42:05.105 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎His biggest problem was getting oil paint

00:42:05.105 --> 00:42:08.409 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to harden thoroughly, 
which usually takes 50 years.

00:42:08.409 --> 00:42:12.680 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He solved it 
by mixing his pigments with a synthetic resin

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:16.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎instead of oil and then baking the canvas.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:19.119 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, van Meegeren produced six paintings 

00:42:19.119 --> 00:42:22.122 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that were passed off as Vermeers.

00:42:22.122 --> 00:42:24.758 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎His greatest sold in 1937.

00:42:24.758 --> 00:42:28.896 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was entitled 
Christ and the Disciples at Emmaus.

00:42:28.896 --> 00:42:31.832 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The most authoritative art historian of the day 

00:42:31.832 --> 00:42:35.035 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎said it was a genuine Vermeer masterpiece,

00:42:35.035 --> 00:42:37.571 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎untouched, on the original canvas, 

00:42:37.571 --> 00:42:40.274 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that it had no restoration done to it.

00:42:40.274 --> 00:42:43.110 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But in reality, it was a fake.

00:42:43.110 --> 00:42:46.814 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The critic’s opinion was taken 
as gospel in the art world, 

00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:51.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so much so that this critic 
had been nicknamed “The Pope.”

00:42:51.785 --> 00:42:54.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Eventually, though, 
a chemical analysis proved 

00:42:54.722 --> 00:42:57.791 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the paint contained 
an ingredient that had not been discovered 

00:42:57.791 --> 00:43:00.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until two centuries after Vermeer died, 

00:43:00.294 --> 00:43:04.398 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and that’s what exposed 
van Meegeren as a fraud.

00:43:04.398 --> 00:43:07.635 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, something similar 
went on during the apostasy 

00:43:07.635 --> 00:43:10.638 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that took place 
after the death of the apostles.

00:43:10.638 --> 00:43:13.941 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Less than 300 years 
after the Bible was completed, 

00:43:13.941 --> 00:43:18.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a Trinitarian added to 1 John 5:7 the words 

00:43:18.145 --> 00:43:22.383 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“in heaven, the Father, 
the Word, and the Holy Ghost: 

00:43:22.383 --> 00:43:25.452 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and these three are one.”

00:43:25.452 --> 00:43:27.988 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, this addition does not appear 

00:43:27.988 --> 00:43:29.990 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the oldest Greek manuscripts, 

00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:34.061 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎proving it’s a fake; 
it’s a corruption of God’s Word.

00:43:34.061 --> 00:43:38.799 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And yet for centuries, 
the churches propagated the Trinity doctrine.

00:43:38.799 --> 00:43:40.934 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As recently as the 19th century, 

00:43:40.934 --> 00:43:42.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎almost all Bible translations 

00:43:42.970 --> 00:43:45.472 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had this spurious addition.

00:43:45.472 --> 00:43:48.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As late as 1897, Pope Leo XIII 

00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:50.811 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎upheld the corrupted text 

00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:53.047 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Latin Vulgate.

00:43:53.047 --> 00:43:55.649 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Interestingly, the New Catholic Encyclopedia 

00:43:55.649 --> 00:43:58.419 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎comments on this 
and says: “The Trinitarian dogma 

00:43:58.419 --> 00:44:03.357 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“is in the last analysis 
a late 4th century invention.

00:44:03.357 --> 00:44:05.426 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Among the Apostolic Fathers, 

00:44:05.426 --> 00:44:07.561 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“there had been nothing 
even remotely approaching 

00:44:07.561 --> 00:44:10.831 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎such a mentality or perspective.”

00:44:10.831 --> 00:44:13.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, Jehovah’s anointed Witnesses 

00:44:13.534 --> 00:44:17.671 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎firmly rejected Christendom’s Trinity dogma.

00:44:17.671 --> 00:44:22.209 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In 1915, 
The Watch Tower exposed the foolishness 

00:44:22.209 --> 00:44:25.212 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of teaching a doctrine 
that contradicts the Bible.

00:44:25.212 --> 00:44:27.214 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The Watch Tower said: 

00:44:27.214 --> 00:44:29.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In what a jumble of contradictions 

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:32.286 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and confusion 
do they find themselves who say 

00:44:32.286 --> 00:44:34.922 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that Jesus and the Father are one God!

00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:36.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“This would involve the idea 

00:44:36.924 --> 00:44:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“that our Lord Jesus acted 
the hypocrite when on earth 

00:44:39.526 --> 00:44:41.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and only pretended 
to address God in prayer, 

00:44:41.995 --> 00:44:44.398 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“when He Himself was the same God. . . .

00:44:44.398 --> 00:44:47.835 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The Father has always been immortal, 
hence could not die.

00:44:47.835 --> 00:44:50.104 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“How then, could Jesus have died? . . .

00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:53.207 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The Scriptures declare, 
however, that He did die. . . .

00:44:53.207 --> 00:44:57.311 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If they admit that Jesus really died, 
they take the other horn of the dilemma; 

00:44:57.311 --> 00:44:59.313 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for believing that their three Gods 

00:44:59.313 --> 00:45:01.315 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“are all one person as many do, 

00:45:01.315 --> 00:45:04.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“when Jesus died 
they must all three have died.

00:45:04.385 --> 00:45:07.254 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If they all died, who raised them to life?

00:45:07.254 --> 00:45:09.790 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“How foolish all this sounds! . . .

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:13.494 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Shall we thus contradict the Apostles 
and Prophets and Jesus Himself, 

00:45:13.494 --> 00:45:16.497 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and ignore reason 
and common sense, in order to hold 

00:45:16.497 --> 00:45:20.100 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“to a dogma handed to us 
from the dark, superstitious past, 

00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:22.736 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“by a corrupt apostate Church?

00:45:22.736 --> 00:45:25.239 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Nay!” says The Watch Tower.

00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:30.544 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, Jehovah’s people 
continue to uphold the excellencies

00:45:30.544 --> 00:45:33.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎ of the only true God.

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:36.517 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Whether in ancient times, 
as with the natural Israelites 

00:45:36.517 --> 00:45:39.319 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or in modern times, as with spiritual Israel, 

00:45:39.319 --> 00:45:42.823 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah’s words through Isaiah are still true.

00:45:42.823 --> 00:45:47.694 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at it at Isaiah 43:21.

00:45:47.694 --> 00:45:50.531 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Of course, 
we know in Isaiah chapter 43 

00:45:50.531 --> 00:45:53.434 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah declares: 
“You are my witnesses.”

00:45:53.434 --> 00:45:57.271 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And in verse 21 he says: 

00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:00.941 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“The people whom I formed for myself

00:46:00.941 --> 00:46:05.045 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎so that they might declare my praise.”

00:46:05.045 --> 00:46:07.147 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And the effort that Jehovah’s Witnesses​

00:46:07.147 --> 00:46:09.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—God’s people​—
have put forth to expose

00:46:09.416 --> 00:46:14.421 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎ Bible teachings that are false, 

00:46:14.421 --> 00:46:16.490 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to teach the truth about Jehovah, 

00:46:16.490 --> 00:46:19.526 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to sanctify God’s name 
has taken on proportions 

00:46:19.526 --> 00:46:22.296 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎never attained by any other religious group.

00:46:22.296 --> 00:46:24.998 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And Jehovah takes notice of that.

00:46:24.998 --> 00:46:27.935 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at Malachi the 3rd chapter.

00:46:27.935 --> 00:46:30.504 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Malachi chapter 3, 

00:46:30.504 --> 00:46:32.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎beginning with verse 16.

00:46:34.975 --> 00:46:37.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Malachi 3:​16: 

00:46:37.611 --> 00:46:41.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“At that time those 
who feared Jehovah spoke with one another, 

00:46:41.648 --> 00:46:43.617 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“each one with his companion,

00:46:43.617 --> 00:46:46.119 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and Jehovah kept paying 
attention and listening.

00:46:46.119 --> 00:46:49.223 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And a book of remembrance 
was written before him 

00:46:49.223 --> 00:46:52.893 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for those fearing Jehovah 
and for those meditating on 

00:46:52.893 --> 00:46:56.864 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“[or the footnote says, 
possibly, “treasuring”] his name.

00:46:56.864 --> 00:46:59.867 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘And they will be mine,’ 
says Jehovah of armies, 

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:03.971 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘in the day when I produce 
a special property.’”

00:47:03.971 --> 00:47:07.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So Jehovah truly does love those 

00:47:07.074 --> 00:47:10.143 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who fear him and treasure his name, 

00:47:10.143 --> 00:47:13.614 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎making them truly God’s people.

00:47:13.914 --> 00:47:16.917 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah can remove any obstacle

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:20.587 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to sanctifying his name 
and declaring the good news

00:47:20.587 --> 00:47:23.423 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—even long-held false teachings. 

00:47:23.423 --> 00:47:25.425 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what is more amazing,

00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:28.562 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he uses his people
—his special property—

00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:30.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to get the work done. 

00:47:30.564 --> 00:47:33.667 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The challenges may be different where you live,

00:47:33.667 --> 00:47:36.103 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the results are the same:

00:47:36.103 --> 00:47:40.073 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah blesses your efforts to glorify him. 

00:47:40.073 --> 00:47:43.410 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s see an example in this report from Peru,

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.846 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where our brothers are reaching the hearts

00:47:45.846 --> 00:47:50.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of Quechua-speaking people 
in the Andes Mountains.

00:48:04.164 --> 00:48:08.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My name is Faustino Camacho Quispe. 

00:48:08.802 --> 00:48:12.873 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My family and I speak Quechua or,

00:48:12.873 --> 00:48:15.075 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as we say, runa simi

00:48:15.075 --> 00:48:18.612 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the language of the people. 

00:48:18.612 --> 00:48:22.516 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We live in an agricultural community

00:48:22.516 --> 00:48:25.519 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the mountains of Peru. 

00:48:25.519 --> 00:48:28.021 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Our way of life depends on farming. 

00:48:28.021 --> 00:48:31.258 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We grow crops such as corn,

00:48:31.258 --> 00:48:34.795 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎potatoes, wheat,

00:48:34.795 --> 00:48:37.097 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and quinoa. 

00:48:37.097 --> 00:48:39.600 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We also raise a small amount of livestock.

00:48:43.737 --> 00:48:46.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many people who speak Quechua 
have moved to larger cities,

00:48:46.773 --> 00:48:49.309 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but others, like us, still enjoy

00:48:49.309 --> 00:48:52.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a more traditional way of life in the country.

00:48:54.247 --> 00:48:56.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎My family and I are Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:49:05.892 --> 00:49:08.629 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Most of our brothers and sisters in this area

00:49:08.629 --> 00:49:10.931 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎would never have been able to learn the truth

00:49:10.931 --> 00:49:14.334 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had there not been someone 
sent here to preach in Quechua.

00:49:16.903 --> 00:49:19.806 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In 1992,

00:49:19.806 --> 00:49:22.175 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Peru branch office began to expand

00:49:22.175 --> 00:49:24.478 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the work in the Quechua-language field. 

00:49:24.544 --> 00:49:28.348 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In order to reach those living in isolated areas,

00:49:28.348 --> 00:49:31.618 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎zealous brothers and sisters climbed narrow roads 

00:49:31.618 --> 00:49:34.688 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the frigid elevations of the Andes Mountains. 

00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:39.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Great efforts were made in order

00:49:39.793 --> 00:49:41.828 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to bring Quechua-speaking people

00:49:41.828 --> 00:49:45.165 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the good news in their own language. 

00:49:45.165 --> 00:49:50.070 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The people loved having publications
in their mother tongue. 

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:53.140 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, there were some challenges

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:55.842 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in carrying out this work. 

00:49:55.842 --> 00:49:58.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One problem was not having a good translation

00:49:58.445 --> 00:50:00.681 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Holy Scriptures in Quechua. 

00:50:00.681 --> 00:50:03.450 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The commonly used translations here in Peru

00:50:03.450 --> 00:50:06.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎omit God’s name in the main text. 

00:50:06.219 --> 00:50:09.389 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It can be found in the glossary of some Bibles,

00:50:09.389 --> 00:50:11.925 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and sometimes we used that in order to preach. 

00:50:11.925 --> 00:50:15.629 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But even so, it didn’t have the same impact

00:50:15.629 --> 00:50:17.998 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as seeing it in its proper place. 

00:50:17.998 --> 00:50:21.735 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That, along with the influence of false doctrines,

00:50:21.735 --> 00:50:25.272 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎made it difficult for us to teach the truth.

00:50:25.372 --> 00:50:28.909 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When we teach people about the Bible,

00:50:28.909 --> 00:50:31.344 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we want them to draw close to God;

00:50:31.344 --> 00:50:33.613 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we want them to become his friends. 

00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:35.749 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But no one can be God’s friend

00:50:35.749 --> 00:50:38.018 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if they don’t know his name. 

00:50:38.018 --> 00:50:40.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For people to be able to come to love God,

00:50:40.887 --> 00:50:43.023 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they have to know his name,

00:50:43.023 --> 00:50:47.394 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and they have to understand what it means.

00:50:47.394 --> 00:50:51.932 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was difficult for us
to use the Bible at the meetings,

00:50:51.932 --> 00:50:55.836 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the field ministry, and in our family worship.

00:51:07.347 --> 00:51:09.616 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How could Jehovah’s great name be sanctified

00:51:09.616 --> 00:51:12.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎throughout this mountainous region? 

00:51:12.219 --> 00:51:14.721 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How could the Quechua people get to know God

00:51:14.721 --> 00:51:18.258 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when his name was hidden?

00:51:18.258 --> 00:51:19.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The answer to our prayers came

00:51:19.726 --> 00:51:22.729 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when Quechua congregations
throughout the country

00:51:22.729 --> 00:51:24.264 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were invited to a special program

00:51:24.264 --> 00:51:27.834 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on May 1, 2016. 

00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:30.303 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Imagine the great joy we felt
when Brother Jackson

00:51:30.303 --> 00:51:32.906 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Governing Body
announced the release

00:51:32.906 --> 00:51:36.109 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation
of the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:51:36.109 --> 00:51:38.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in two Quechua languages!

00:51:38.378 --> 00:51:40.881 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Language number 136:

00:51:40.881 --> 00:51:44.017 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:51:44.017 --> 00:51:48.321 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in Quechua Ayacucho! 

00:51:55.962 --> 00:51:59.232 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we also have number 137:

00:51:59.232 --> 00:52:02.002 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s Quechua Cuzco! 

00:52:05.572 --> 00:52:09.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What a wonderful gift we’ve received today!

00:52:12.279 --> 00:52:15.182 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This new Quechua Bible

00:52:15.182 --> 00:52:18.718 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is a grand victory for Jehovah’s great name. 

00:52:18.718 --> 00:52:22.823 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎God’s name is no longer hidden
from the Quechua people,

00:52:22.823 --> 00:52:25.692 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎giving them the precious opportunity

00:52:25.692 --> 00:52:30.831 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to come to know our loving Creator, Jehovah.

00:52:53.887 --> 00:52:57.891 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I feel proud to use our new Bible to teach 

00:52:57.891 --> 00:53:00.360 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎my family and neighbors Jehovah’s name. 

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.329 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I am thankful every day

00:53:02.329 --> 00:53:05.131 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jehovah sent this good news to the mountains 

00:53:05.131 --> 00:53:07.133 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to us who speak runa simi

00:53:07.133 --> 00:53:11.137 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the language of the people.

00:53:14.808 --> 00:53:18.011 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was a privilege 
to be at such a happy event

00:53:18.011 --> 00:53:20.013 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and to see our brothers’ joy

00:53:20.013 --> 00:53:22.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when they received 
the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:25.085 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in two Quechua languages. 

00:53:25.085 --> 00:53:28.555 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May they use their Bibles 
to draw close to Jehovah

00:53:28.555 --> 00:53:32.859 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and glorify his name in the Andes Mountains.

00:53:32.859 --> 00:53:34.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Our program now goes

00:53:34.995 --> 00:53:37.030 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the South Pacific,

00:53:37.030 --> 00:53:40.066 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where we conclude 
with greetings from Tuvalu. 

00:53:41.635 --> 00:53:46.139 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Most of Tuvalu’s nine islands 
are ring-shaped coral atolls

00:53:46.139 --> 00:53:48.575 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎surrounding peaceful lagoons. 

00:53:48.575 --> 00:53:52.479 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎These small islands barely rise out of the sea. 

00:53:52.479 --> 00:53:55.782 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎On Funafuti, Tuvalu’s capital,

00:53:55.782 --> 00:53:59.152 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the island is just wide enough in some places

00:53:59.152 --> 00:54:03.223 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for the main road and a single house. 

00:54:03.223 --> 00:54:06.626 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The motorbike is the preferred way 
to travel on the island. 

00:54:06.626 --> 00:54:11.064 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So it’s good that our witnessing carts
come equipped with sturdy wheels.

00:54:12.265 --> 00:54:15.802 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Tuvalu has a busy remote translation office. 

00:54:15.802 --> 00:54:17.904 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In 2011,

00:54:17.904 --> 00:54:21.207 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the New World Translation 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures in Tuvaluan

00:54:21.207 --> 00:54:22.909 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was released. 

00:54:22.909 --> 00:54:27.314 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In October of last year, 
the complete Bible was released,

00:54:27.314 --> 00:54:30.150 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎making Tuvaluan 
the smallest language group

00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:33.086 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to receive the New World Translation. 

00:54:33.086 --> 00:54:36.523 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎I was assigned to Tuvalu in 1979

00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:38.825 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and enjoyed the challenging task

00:54:38.825 --> 00:54:41.895 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of helping to establish Tuvaluan translation. 

00:54:41.895 --> 00:54:45.598 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There were 
only 3 other baptized publishers back then,

00:54:45.598 --> 00:54:48.234 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but in 2017,

00:54:48.234 --> 00:54:52.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Tuvalu reported a peak of 125 publishers.

00:54:52.939 --> 00:54:55.608 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They preach to a population

00:54:55.608 --> 00:54:58.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of around 10,000 people.

00:54:58.611 --> 00:55:00.680 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Tuvaluans are warm and friendly,

00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.116 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and our brothers and sisters thoroughly enjoy 

00:55:03.116 --> 00:55:05.318 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the time they can spend together. 

00:55:06.453 --> 00:55:10.090 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They send their love 
and greetings from the South Pacific.

00:55:13.026 --> 00:55:15.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Alofa atu in Tuvaluan means

00:55:15.328 --> 00:55:17.731 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“We send our love to you all.”

00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:21.901 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We send them our love 
and pray for Jehovah’s continued blessing.

00:55:21.901 --> 00:55:24.938 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is JW Broadcasting

00:55:24.938 --> 00:55:28.942 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
