00:00.917 --> 00:03.185
We have selected the theme 


00:03.185 --> 00:06.122
“Be a Champion of Truth!” 


00:06.122 --> 00:08.659
You may have heard 
of the word “champion” 


00:08.658 --> 00:11.193
used in the context of sports. 


00:11.193 --> 00:13.195
What is a champion? 


00:13.195 --> 00:15.665
The word 
can have different meanings. 


00:15.665 --> 00:18.402
The word is related 
to the French word champ, 


00:18.402 --> 00:20.404
meaning “field.” 


00:20.403 --> 00:23.806
That word has its origin 
in the Latin word campus, 


00:23.807 --> 00:27.077
also meaning “field” 
or “battlefield.” 


00:27.077 --> 00:30.714
The Bible speaks of 
a champion on a battlefield 


00:30.713 --> 00:34.000
in 1 Samuel 17:4: 


00:36.552 --> 00:40.490
“Then a champion came out 
from the camps of the Philistines; 


00:40.490 --> 00:43.000
his name was Goliath.”


00:44.393 --> 00:47.330
Goliath was a champion 
for a wrong cause, 


00:47.330 --> 00:49.332
namely, 
to take the lead in defeating 


00:49.332 --> 00:51.869
the ancient Israelites in battle. 


00:51.868 --> 00:55.271
In our modern time, 
according to one definition, 


00:55.272 --> 00:58.340
a champion 
is “an ardent defender 


00:58.340 --> 01:00.610
“or supporter of a cause 


01:00.610 --> 01:02.612
or another person.” 


01:02.612 --> 01:05.482
Christians today 
are ardent defenders 


01:05.482 --> 01:07.950
and supporters of the truth.


01:07.950 --> 01:11.687
The Watchtower 
of January 15, 2012, 


01:11.687 --> 01:15.492
said on page 8: 
“Other champions 


01:15.492 --> 01:19.000
of Bible truth rose up 
in the centuries that followed.” 


01:20.062 --> 01:22.532
Years before, 
The Watchtower said: 


01:22.532 --> 01:25.202
“This magazine 
will never shrink in fear 


01:25.202 --> 01:28.539
from championing the truth!” 


01:28.538 --> 01:30.540
“The Watchtower 
has been championing 


01:30.540 --> 01:33.710
‘the cause of Kingdom truth.’”


01:33.710 --> 01:37.180
So, are you a champion? 


01:37.180 --> 01:39.182
In a sports competition, 


01:39.182 --> 01:42.385
only one individual 
gets to be the champion. 


01:42.385 --> 01:44.853
But in the case 
of true Christians, 


01:44.853 --> 01:47.723
all can be champions 
of the truth. 


01:47.723 --> 01:50.593
All Christians 
are to defend the truth 


01:50.593 --> 01:53.796
and become conquerors
—winners.


01:53.797 --> 01:56.199
It’s necessary 
to defend the truth 


01:56.198 --> 01:58.200
because in today’s world 


01:58.200 --> 02:01.203
truth is being attacked 
and distorted. 


02:01.203 --> 02:04.140
We are surrounded 
by a sea of lies 


02:04.140 --> 02:06.608
and misrepresentations. 


02:06.608 --> 02:09.545
How did such lies get started? 


02:09.545 --> 02:11.547
They started in the garden of Eden 


02:11.547 --> 02:14.550
when Satan told Eve lies.


02:14.550 --> 02:17.420
Satan, 
through his deceptive statements, 


02:17.420 --> 02:20.088
became “the father of the lie.” 


02:20.088 --> 02:22.758
All the problems in the world


02:22.758 --> 02:27.163
—all calamities 
(also your personal calamities), 


02:27.163 --> 02:30.600
all wars, 
all diseases, all crimes, 


02:30.600 --> 02:33.803
all unhappiness, 
sorrow, and death


02:33.803 --> 02:36.271
—started with the original lies 


02:36.272 --> 02:38.542
in the garden of Eden. 


02:38.542 --> 02:41.410
Satan is “the father of the lie.” 


02:41.410 --> 02:45.013
But today there are 
many “children” of the lie. 


02:45.013 --> 02:47.150
Every one of us is affected. 


02:47.150 --> 02:50.553
We are surrounded 
by a sea of lies.


02:50.553 --> 02:53.088
A lie is “a false statement 


02:53.088 --> 02:55.625
“deliberately presented 
as being true; 


02:55.625 --> 02:57.627
a falsehood.” 


02:57.627 --> 03:00.830
A lie is the opposite 
of the truth. 


03:00.830 --> 03:03.767
Lying involves 
saying something incorrect 


03:03.767 --> 03:07.370
to a person who is entitled to know 
the truth about a matter. 


03:07.370 --> 03:11.373
But there is also something 
that is called a half-truth. 


03:11.373 --> 03:15.911
The Bible tells Christians 
to be honest with each other. 


03:15.912 --> 03:18.582
“Now that you 
have put away deceit, 


03:18.582 --> 03:21.050
. . . speak truth,” 
wrote the apostle Paul 


03:21.050 --> 03:23.987
at Ephesians 4:25. 


03:23.987 --> 03:27.857
Lies and half-truths 
undermine trust. 


03:27.857 --> 03:30.059
A German proverb says, 


03:30.058 --> 03:32.261
“Who lies once is not believed, 


03:32.262 --> 03:34.664
even if he says the truth.” 


03:34.663 --> 03:36.665
So we need to speak openly 


03:36.665 --> 03:38.702
and honestly with each other, 


03:38.702 --> 03:41.037
not withholding 
bits of information 


03:41.037 --> 03:43.774
that could change 
the perception of the listener 


03:43.773 --> 03:45.808
or mislead him.


03:45.808 --> 03:49.011
As to lies, 
there are different types. 


03:49.012 --> 03:51.414
Some politicians 
have lied about matters 


03:51.413 --> 03:53.616
they wanted to keep secret. 


03:53.617 --> 03:56.885
Companies sometimes lie 
in advertisements 


03:56.885 --> 03:59.422
regarding their products. 


03:59.422 --> 04:01.424
What about the news media? 


04:01.423 --> 04:04.293
Many try to report events truthfully. 


04:04.293 --> 04:06.295
But we should not be gullible 


04:06.295 --> 04:09.098
and believe 
everything newspapers write 


04:09.098 --> 04:11.666
or everything we hear on radio 


04:11.667 --> 04:14.037
or see on television.


04:14.037 --> 04:16.639
Then there are religious lies. 


04:16.638 --> 04:19.041
If Satan is called 
“the father of the lie,” 


04:19.042 --> 04:22.479
then Babylon the Great, 
the global empire of false religion, 


04:22.478 --> 04:25.481
can be called 
the “mother” of the lie. 


04:25.482 --> 04:27.817
Individual false religions 


04:27.817 --> 04:30.687
could be called 
“daughters” of the lie. 


04:30.687 --> 04:33.022
Some lie by saying that sinners 


04:33.022 --> 04:36.092
will get tormented in hell forever. 


04:36.092 --> 04:38.094
Others lie by saying, 


04:38.093 --> 04:40.430
“Once saved, always saved.” 


04:40.430 --> 04:44.100
Again, others lie 
by saying that the earth 


04:44.100 --> 04:46.368
will be burned up 
on Judgment Day 


04:46.368 --> 04:49.371
and all good people 
will go to heaven. 


04:49.372 --> 04:51.707
Some worship idols. 


04:51.707 --> 04:56.000
Paul wrote at Romans 1:25: 


04:57.647 --> 05:00.717
“They exchanged 
the truth of God for the lie 


05:00.717 --> 05:03.052
“and venerated 
and rendered sacred service 


05:03.052 --> 05:07.624
to the creation 
rather than the Creator.”


05:07.623 --> 05:10.091
Then there are many lies 
of a personal nature 


05:10.092 --> 05:12.829
that people express 
in everyday life. 


05:12.828 --> 05:15.565
A businessman 
may get a phone call 


05:15.565 --> 05:18.567
but tell his secretary 
to answer the caller 


05:18.567 --> 05:20.770
by saying he is not in. 


05:20.770 --> 05:23.907
This may be considered 
a small lie. 


05:23.907 --> 05:26.975
There are small lies, 
big lies, 


05:26.975 --> 05:29.000
and malicious lies. 


05:30.145 --> 05:33.415
A child may have broken something 
but when asked initially, 


05:33.415 --> 05:37.287
out of fear of punishment, 
denies having done it. 


05:37.287 --> 05:40.824
This does not make the child 
a malicious liar.


05:40.823 --> 05:44.293
In contrast, 
what if an entrepreneur 


05:44.293 --> 05:46.895
tells his bookkeeper 
to falsify the entries 


05:46.895 --> 05:50.165
in the books 
in order to save on taxes? 


05:50.165 --> 05:52.368
This lying to the tax office 


05:52.368 --> 05:54.636
is certainly a serious lie. 


05:54.637 --> 05:58.174
It is a deliberate attempt 
to mislead somebody 


05:58.173 --> 06:00.376
that has the right to know. 


06:00.377 --> 06:03.714
It also robs the government 
of what they have established 


06:03.713 --> 06:05.915
as legal income. 


06:05.915 --> 06:09.318
We can see 
that not all lies are the same; 


06:09.318 --> 06:11.920
there are small lies, big lies, 


06:11.920 --> 06:13.990
and malicious lies. 


06:13.990 --> 06:16.592
Satan is a malicious liar. 


06:16.592 --> 06:19.395
He is the champion of the lie. 


06:19.395 --> 06:21.663
Since Jehovah hates liars, 


06:21.663 --> 06:23.933
we should avoid all lies, 


06:23.933 --> 06:26.000
not just big or malicious lies.


06:28.137 --> 06:30.940
But can we find the truth? 


06:30.940 --> 06:33.877
Some say, “Truth is relative.” 


06:33.877 --> 06:36.879
It is like saying, 
“This is truth for you, 


06:36.878 --> 06:38.948
and this is truth for me.” 


06:38.948 --> 06:41.016
This claim is not logical 


06:41.017 --> 06:43.352
when it comes to religious truth. 


06:43.352 --> 06:46.555
Either God is a Trinity 
or he’s not. 


06:46.555 --> 06:50.092
Either the soul is mortal 
or it is not. 


06:50.092 --> 06:54.697
Either there is a future paradise 
on earth or there is not. 


06:54.697 --> 06:59.000
Either homosexuality 
is acceptable to God or it is not. 


07:00.603 --> 07:05.000
Either participating in wars 
is permissible or it is not. 


07:06.042 --> 07:08.779
Truth is definite, not relative, 


07:08.778 --> 07:12.181
because Jehovah conveyed 
the truth to his servants. 


07:12.182 --> 07:15.117
Psalm 43:3 says: 


07:15.117 --> 07:18.187
“Send out your light and your truth.” 


07:18.187 --> 07:22.000
Jehovah is a Revealer of truth.


07:23.158 --> 07:26.028
One of several reasons 
why Jesus came into the world 


07:26.028 --> 07:28.363
was to “witness to the truth.” 


07:28.363 --> 07:32.768
At John 18:37b, 


07:32.768 --> 07:35.671
he said: 
“For this I have been born, 


07:35.672 --> 07:37.740
“and for this 
I have come into the world, 


07:37.740 --> 07:40.610
“that I should bear witness 
to the truth. 


07:40.610 --> 07:45.000
Everyone who is on the side 
of the truth listens to my voice.”


07:46.582 --> 07:49.519
So if we listen to Jesus, 
or read in the Bible 


07:49.518 --> 07:52.455
what he taught, 
we can learn the truth. 


07:52.455 --> 07:55.592
Jesus was the personification 
of the truth. 


07:55.592 --> 07:58.060
He said: “I am the way 


07:58.060 --> 08:01.563
and the truth and the life.” 


08:01.563 --> 08:03.698
We can find out what the truth is 


08:03.698 --> 08:06.235
by diligently studying the Bible. 


08:06.235 --> 08:09.505
Truth is that which is a fact. 


08:09.505 --> 08:12.175
For true Christians, 
the entire text 


08:12.175 --> 08:14.510
of the Hebrew 
and Christian Greek Scriptures 


08:14.510 --> 08:16.645
constitutes the truth. 


08:16.645 --> 08:19.615
Psalm 119:160 


08:19.615 --> 08:21.617
says of Jehovah: 


08:21.617 --> 08:25.354
‘The essence 
of your word is truth.’ 


08:25.353 --> 08:27.356
That is why 
it is good to do 


08:27.357 --> 08:30.225
daily Bible reading 
with meditation 


08:30.225 --> 08:33.562
and weekly family worship.


08:33.562 --> 08:37.334
At Matthew 24:45-47, we read 


08:37.333 --> 08:40.401
that for the time of the end, 
Jesus would appoint 


08:40.402 --> 08:44.207
a “faithful and discreet slave,” 
or Governing Body, 


08:44.207 --> 08:46.875
to explain the Bible
to His followers 


08:46.875 --> 08:51.013
and help them to grow 
in understanding of the truth. 


08:51.013 --> 08:53.348
Whereas Jesus’ teachings 


08:53.348 --> 08:56.085
and the written Word of God 
are inspired, 


08:56.085 --> 08:59.355
“the faithful and discreet slave” 
is not inspired, 


08:59.355 --> 09:02.000
although it champions the truth. 


09:03.158 --> 09:05.160
Nevertheless, the faithful slave 


09:05.160 --> 09:07.563
provides spiritual food. 


09:07.563 --> 09:09.665
Whereas in the first century 


09:09.665 --> 09:11.767
there was supernatural knowledge 


09:11.767 --> 09:14.770
available for apostles 
and Bible writers, 


09:14.770 --> 09:17.607
in the time of the end, 
Jehovah does not bestow 


09:17.607 --> 09:21.010
this miraculous gift anymore, 
as explained 


09:21.010 --> 09:24.913
at 1 Corinthians 13:8. 


09:24.913 --> 09:28.450
Although there is 
no divine inspiration today, 


09:28.450 --> 09:31.853
still Jesus leads 
his people progressively 


09:31.853 --> 09:34.523
through the services 
of the faithful slave. 


09:34.523 --> 09:37.726
Jesus trusts 
that the imperfect faithful slave 


09:37.727 --> 09:41.864
will do its best 
to convey spiritual food. 


09:41.863 --> 09:45.000
Do you also trust the slave?


09:46.668 --> 09:49.805
Whereas the truth 
of God’s Word does not change, 


09:49.805 --> 09:53.008
our understanding 
of the truth does change 


09:53.008 --> 09:55.276
because we 
are not perfect yet. 


09:55.277 --> 09:58.214
We understand more 
about the truth today 


09:58.213 --> 10:01.283
than Christians 
in the first century. 


10:01.283 --> 10:05.955
Do we keep up with the progressive
understanding of truth?


10:05.955 --> 10:09.625
Daniel was told: 
“Many will rove about, 


10:09.625 --> 10:13.000
and the true knowledge 
will become abundant.” 


10:14.363 --> 10:16.365
This is a gradual process. 


10:16.365 --> 10:18.833
We are still roving about. 


10:18.833 --> 10:21.703
During the Millennium, 
Jehovah will reveal 


10:21.703 --> 10:24.373
additional truths to mankind. 


10:24.373 --> 10:27.108
At Revelation 20:12, 


10:27.108 --> 10:30.713
it mentions scrolls 
that will be opened. 


10:30.713 --> 10:33.915
The apostle John reports 
that the dead are to be “judged 


10:33.915 --> 10:36.652
“out of those things 
written in the scrolls 


10:36.652 --> 10:38.989
according to their deeds.” 


10:38.988 --> 10:42.458
Evidently, then, 
these scrolls will contain 


10:42.458 --> 10:46.795
additional information for mankind 
during the thousand years. 


10:46.795 --> 10:50.198
It stands to reason 
that after the end of the Millennium, 


10:50.198 --> 10:53.268
there will be 
additional truths to learn. 


10:53.268 --> 10:56.938
Still, 
according to Ecclesiastes 


10:56.938 --> 10:59.000
chapter 3, verse 11: 


11:00.777 --> 11:02.912
“Mankind will never find out 


11:02.912 --> 11:05.614
the work 
that the true God has made.”


11:05.613 --> 11:09.085
But how do we know 
we have the truth? 


11:09.085 --> 11:12.355
At Pentecost 33 
of our Common Era, 


11:12.355 --> 11:16.025
true Christians 
numbered only about 3,000. 


11:16.025 --> 11:18.627
Today, we are millions. 


11:18.627 --> 11:20.964
And on average,
every weekend 


11:20.963 --> 11:24.566
more than 5,000 
are getting baptized. 


11:24.567 --> 11:26.635
But this in itself 


11:26.635 --> 11:29.172
is not proof 
that we have the truth. 


11:29.172 --> 11:32.240
Truth is not measured 
in numbers. 


11:32.240 --> 11:35.443
Why do we know 
we have the truth?


11:35.443 --> 11:37.980
For one, 
because we remain 


11:37.980 --> 11:41.617
in Jesus’ teaching, 
John 8:31. 


11:41.617 --> 11:43.952
Second, 
we know we have the truth 


11:43.952 --> 11:46.289
because of the deep bond of love 


11:46.288 --> 11:50.860
for each other, John 13:35. 


11:50.860 --> 11:54.597
Third, we know we have the truth 
because our conduct 


11:54.597 --> 11:58.200
adheres 
to the high moral standards of truth,


11:58.200 --> 12:00.468
John 15:10. 


12:00.468 --> 12:02.771
Fourth, 
we know we have the truth 


12:02.772 --> 12:06.575
because we remain neutral 
in the controversies of the world, 


12:06.575 --> 12:10.000
as Jesus advised 
at John 17:14. 


12:11.147 --> 12:13.482
Fifth, 
we know we have the truth 


12:13.482 --> 12:16.152
because we are 
God’s name people. 


12:16.152 --> 12:18.554
Acts 15:14 speaks 


12:18.553 --> 12:21.490
of “a people for his name.” 


12:21.490 --> 12:25.360
Jesus said: 
“The truth will set you free.” 


12:25.360 --> 12:29.232
It sets us free from fears
—like the fear of death, 


12:29.232 --> 12:33.369
fear of the future, 
and an exaggerated fear of man. 


12:33.368 --> 12:36.571
It also sets us free 
from false teachings, 


12:36.572 --> 12:40.509
from spiritism, 
and from astrology and magic. 


12:40.508 --> 12:44.446
It frees us from immorality 
and its consequences. 


12:44.447 --> 12:47.382
There are 
no other people on earth 


12:47.382 --> 12:50.719
that are 
as spiritually free as we are. 


12:50.718 --> 12:53.000
Do we appreciate that freedom? 


12:54.990 --> 12:56.458
Truth leads to freedom. 


12:56.458 --> 12:59.060
Second Corinthians 3:17 says: 


12:59.060 --> 13:01.397
“Where the spirit of Jehovah is, 


13:01.397 --> 13:03.865
there is freedom.”


13:03.865 --> 13:08.003
The truth penetrates schools. 
How so? 


13:08.003 --> 13:10.671
By means of our children 
who preach the truth 


13:10.672 --> 13:13.209
to classmates and to teachers. 


13:13.208 --> 13:15.210
Do you go to school? 


13:15.210 --> 13:18.147
Do you champion 
the truth at school? 


13:18.147 --> 13:20.149
How can you do this? 


13:20.148 --> 13:23.918
You do this not only by preaching 
but also by your conduct, 


13:23.918 --> 13:25.955
by your dress and grooming, 


13:25.955 --> 13:28.890
and by taking a stand for the truth 
when others want you 


13:28.890 --> 13:32.360
to participate 
in unchristian practices. 


13:32.360 --> 13:35.898
You also champion the truth 
by remaining honest 


13:35.898 --> 13:38.433
and not cheating 
on your exams. 


13:38.433 --> 13:41.836
And Jehovah 
will love you for that.


13:41.837 --> 13:45.040
The truth 
also penetrates prisons. 


13:45.040 --> 13:47.442
Reports have come in 
from many countries 


13:47.442 --> 13:49.479
telling of the good work 
brothers are doing 


13:49.478 --> 13:52.881
in contacting prisoners 
in various prisons, 


13:52.882 --> 13:56.652
helping some to rehabilitate 
their lives spiritually. 


13:56.652 --> 13:58.754
In a number of such institutions, 


13:58.753 --> 14:00.755
regular meetings are being held 


14:00.755 --> 14:03.625
and several prisoners 
have studied to the point 


14:03.625 --> 14:07.630
of dedication and baptism.


14:07.630 --> 14:11.700
The truth penetrates 
even walls of monasteries. 


14:11.700 --> 14:14.203
In Mexico, in 2009, 


14:14.203 --> 14:17.105
a nun was baptized who, 
because of the truth, 


14:17.105 --> 14:19.908
had left 
her monastery and order, 


14:19.908 --> 14:22.000
although she was 
the mother superior.


14:23.912 --> 14:26.649
The world 
is in utter confusion. 


14:26.648 --> 14:29.183
What a blessing
to know the truth! 


14:29.183 --> 14:31.186
We rejoice in it! 


14:31.187 --> 14:33.389
We have the truth on our lips. 


14:33.388 --> 14:36.158
We have the truth around our hips. 


14:36.158 --> 14:39.495
Ephesians chapter 6 
says that “the belt of truth” 


14:39.495 --> 14:42.063
is fastened around our waists. 


14:42.063 --> 14:45.066
We are ready to teach it. 


14:45.067 --> 14:48.404
We talk the truth, 
and we walk in the truth. 


14:48.403 --> 14:50.405
Those who continue to walk 


14:50.405 --> 14:53.208
in the truth 
will walk in it forever.


14:53.208 --> 14:56.011
Help your students 
to love the truth 


14:56.012 --> 14:58.880
and to live the truth but, 
if necessary, 


14:58.880 --> 15:02.000
to be willing to die 
for the truth and for Jehovah. 


15:03.418 --> 15:05.420
The truth is invincible 


15:05.420 --> 15:08.157
and will conquer 
this wicked world. 


15:08.157 --> 15:11.694
In some countries, 
we may have many enemies 


15:11.693 --> 15:13.828
who may want to silence us. 


15:13.828 --> 15:15.863
But the apostle Paul said 


15:15.863 --> 15:20.000
at 2 Corinthians 13:8: 


15:21.803 --> 15:25.000
“For we can do nothing 
against the truth.”


15:26.608 --> 15:30.578
Neither can our enemies 
suppress the truth. 


15:30.578 --> 15:32.781
Do we appreciate
that we have the truth


15:32.782 --> 15:34.784
—the only truth? 


15:34.783 --> 15:38.386
Is this arrogant to say? 
By no means! 


15:38.387 --> 15:41.257
It would be a sin 
if we would not say so. 


15:41.257 --> 15:43.392
Jesus was not arrogant 
when he said: 


15:43.392 --> 15:46.529
‘I am the truth.’


15:46.528 --> 15:48.863
To know the truth 
is not enough. 


15:48.863 --> 15:51.066
We need to champion it. 


15:51.067 --> 15:54.002
There are still 
many lovers of truth out there; 


15:54.002 --> 15:56.005
search for them. 


15:56.005 --> 15:58.073
Who will help you
in your search? 


15:58.073 --> 16:00.741
According to John 4:23, 


16:00.742 --> 16:03.812
Jesus said that Jehovah 
is searching for ones 


16:03.812 --> 16:06.649
that want to worship in truth. 


16:06.648 --> 16:09.585
The majority 
will not listen to the truth 


16:09.585 --> 16:12.855
because ‘they love the darkness 
rather than the light.’ 


16:12.855 --> 16:16.058
The truth may expose 
their sinful conduct, 


16:16.058 --> 16:18.460
and they 
may not have the humility 


16:18.460 --> 16:21.230
to want 
to repent and change. 


16:21.230 --> 16:24.967
We still have to preach to them
—to warn them. 


16:24.967 --> 16:26.969
Ezekiel was told: 


16:26.968 --> 16:29.771
“You must warn them from me.” 


16:29.772 --> 16:32.000
The principle applies to us as well.


16:34.175 --> 16:37.713
Paul speaks of “the sword 
of . . . God’s word.” 


16:37.713 --> 16:41.250
Use it well 
to champion the truth. 


16:41.250 --> 16:46.422
Train your students 
to be good defenders of it as well. 


16:46.422 --> 16:49.992
The time will come 
in Paradise after the final test 


16:49.992 --> 16:52.160
when it will not be necessary 


16:52.160 --> 16:54.797
to champion, 
or defend, the truth, 


16:54.797 --> 16:58.134
because nobody 
will attack it anymore. 


16:58.133 --> 17:00.968
Right now, 
whether we are adults, 


17:00.968 --> 17:05.673
teenagers, or children, 
let us follow and imitate Jesus


17:05.673 --> 17:08.776
—the greatest Champion of truth! 


17:08.777 --> 17:11.647
To that end, 
keep studying the truth. 


17:11.647 --> 17:13.649
Keep spreading the truth. 


17:13.648 --> 17:17.585
Keep loving the truth 
and Jehovah, the God of truth. 


17:17.585 --> 17:21.057
Hold fast to the truth 
as to a lifeline


17:21.057 --> 17:23.325
—as this is what it is! 


17:23.325 --> 17:26.928
By staying faithful, 
whether you survive Armageddon 


17:26.928 --> 17:29.363
or are resurrected in Paradise, 


17:29.363 --> 17:43.996
you will be a victorious 
champion of the truth!
