00:00:01.084 --> 00:00:04.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month I’d like to talk
about “Presenting Your Gifts to God.”

00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:08.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We certainly have every reason
to consider this topic.

00:00:08.858 --> 00:00:10.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, why is that?

00:00:10.794 --> 00:00:13.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s because Jehovah gives us so much.

00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:15.932 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
James 1:17 says:

00:00:15.932 --> 00:00:20.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Every good gift
and every perfect present is from above,

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
coming down
from the Father of the celestial lights.”

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:29.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
Jehovah allows us to enjoy the gift of life,

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though our first parents
tried to take that from us.

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:38.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s provided us with a variety of foods.

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:42.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The environment is just right to support life.

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:46.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s given us his precious Word, the Bible,

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:50.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can come to know
him and his purposes.

00:00:50.767 --> 00:00:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the greatest “perfect present”
Jehovah has given us is the ransom.

00:00:55.805 --> 00:01:00.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sacrificed
a great deal to arrange for Jesus

00:01:00.176 --> 00:01:04.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to buy back for us the hope of everlasting life.

00:01:04.114 --> 00:01:07.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was at no obligation on Jehovah’s part.

00:01:07.751 --> 00:01:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was totally a gift of love.

00:01:11.521 --> 00:01:15.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me 1 John 4:9:

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:18.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“By this the love of God
was revealed in our case,

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:22.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that God sent
his only-begotten Son into the world

00:01:22.398 --> 00:01:25.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we might gain life through him.”

00:01:25.135 --> 00:01:28.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a gift of love from Jehovah, our God!

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:30.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that move us to do?

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve had the experience
of a close friend or family member

00:01:35.078 --> 00:01:39.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unexpectedly giving you a valuable gift.

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:42.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Immediately, what are you thinking?

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:46.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are probably trying to think
of what you can give in return.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much more so
would we want to ‘present our gifts to God’

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:56.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to show
our sincere appreciation for all he’s done!

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some possible gifts

00:01:59.903 --> 00:02:03.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
would be pleased to receive from us.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you in our viewing audience

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:09.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been moved to give your life to Jehovah,

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:12.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dedicating yourself to do his will.

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s commendable!

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what Romans 12 urges us to do.

00:02:18.021 --> 00:02:21.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there are some of you listening

00:02:21.024 --> 00:02:25.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have thought
about this way of giving back to Jehovah,

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:28.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you haven’t yet taken this vital step.

00:02:28.832 --> 00:02:31.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the appeal the apostle Paul makes

00:02:31.534 --> 00:02:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:1:

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:37.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, I appeal to you
by the compassions of God, brothers,

00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:40.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,

00:02:40.944 --> 00:02:43.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“holy and acceptable to God,

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a sacred service with your power of reason.”

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your life is precious.

00:02:49.652 --> 00:02:52.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Presenting your body, your whole soul,

00:02:52.488 --> 00:02:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to God is one of the best gifts
you can give to him.

00:02:57.193 --> 00:03:00.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This involves our sacred service to Jehovah

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s for sure.

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the daily activities of life?

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:09.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you do housework on a daily basis.

00:03:09.205 --> 00:03:13.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others of you have
school to attend and homework to do.

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you perform secular work.

00:03:15.912 --> 00:03:18.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s shopping to do.

00:03:18.014 --> 00:03:21.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others enjoy using
a small percentage of their time

00:03:21.784 --> 00:03:26.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to engage in some type
of recreation or entertainment.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once you’re dedicated and baptized,

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is all part of your gift to Jehovah.

00:03:33.663 --> 00:03:35.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please consider with me

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:40.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 3:23, 24.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After discussing
a whole list of daily activities of life,

00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:47.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what does Jehovah tell us?

00:03:47.176 --> 00:03:50.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Colossians 3:23, 24:

00:03:50.413 --> 00:03:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whatever you are doing,

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:55.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah,

00:03:55.718 --> 00:03:57.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and not for men,

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:00.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you know that it is from Jehovah

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:03.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will receive the inheritance as a reward.”

00:04:03.893 --> 00:04:07.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that a Christian’s day-to-day activities

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not part of his sacred service.

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:14.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the fact that Paul urges us

00:04:14.037 --> 00:04:17.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work “whole-souled as to Jehovah”

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:21.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes us think of our entire course of life.

00:04:21.077 --> 00:04:26.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our life course
can become a gift presented to God.

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:31.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, do we act and dress
with proper decorum at all times?

00:04:32.055 --> 00:04:36.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understandably,
we don’t wear a suit and tie or a dress

00:04:36.559 --> 00:04:38.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for every activity of life.

00:04:38.828 --> 00:04:41.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in “whatever you are doing,”

00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:46.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is your behavior and dress a gift to Jehovah?

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:49.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If while engaging in any activity,

00:04:49.806 --> 00:04:54.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d be embarrassed to identify
ourselves as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:58.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then can we really claim to be presenting

00:04:58.014 --> 00:05:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a gift to Jehovah in our daily life?

00:05:01.284 --> 00:05:06.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What other gifts are in our possession
that we can present to God?

00:05:06.322 --> 00:05:09.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about godly morality?

00:05:09.125 --> 00:05:12.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keeping your dedicated body clean morally

00:05:12.462 --> 00:05:14.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a gift to Jehovah.

00:05:14.864 --> 00:05:18.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what Romans 12:1 said?

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:21.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said that the bodies we present to Jehovah

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:25.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should be “holy and acceptable to God.”

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we give in to temptation unrepentantly,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be likened to asking Jehovah

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give our gift back;

00:05:36.953 --> 00:05:41.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re taking back our dedicated life from him.

00:05:41.657 --> 00:05:46.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worse yet, it is tantamount
to taking the gift away from Jehovah

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and giving that precious gift to Satan.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:53.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That does not make sense.

00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:55.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep clean morally.

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:58.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a precious gift presented to God.

00:05:58.908 --> 00:06:02.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true, when we’re dedicated and baptized,

00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:05.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are other gifts that we’d be expected

00:06:05.348 --> 00:06:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to present to Jehovah on a regular basis.

00:06:09.018 --> 00:06:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most obvious ways

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is mentioned here at Hebrews 10:23.

00:06:15.258 --> 00:06:20.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you already guess
what this gift to Jehovah would be?

00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:24.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 10:23:

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us hold firmly the public declaration
of our hope without wavering,

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the one who promised is faithful.”

00:06:33.042 --> 00:06:35.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The public declaration of our hope

00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:38.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a gift to those we speak to,

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:43.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s also considered
a gift extended to Jehovah.

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,
Hebrews 13:15 calls our preaching work

00:06:48.357 --> 00:06:51.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a sacrifice of praise,

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is, the fruit of our lips

00:06:53.796 --> 00:06:57.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make public declaration to his name.”

00:06:57.366 --> 00:07:01.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Israelites used to regularly offer

00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:04.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the best of their animals or grain

00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:07.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as sacrificial gifts to Jehovah.

00:07:07.443 --> 00:07:10.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sharing in the ministry formally or informally

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a gift to God.

00:07:13.116 --> 00:07:15.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regularly attending our Christian meetings

00:07:15.418 --> 00:07:17.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and participating in them

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is part of our worship and pleases Jehovah.

00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:25.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are familiar with Hebrews 10:24, 25.

00:07:25.595 --> 00:07:28.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It speaks of our custom of meeting together.

00:07:28.931 --> 00:07:31.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for what purpose do we meet?

00:07:32.602 --> 00:07:35.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I was there in your home with you,

00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how would you answer?

00:07:37.673 --> 00:07:39.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might quickly say,

00:07:39.675 --> 00:07:44.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I go to the meetings to be built up
and to be encouraged spiritually.”

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt you do.

00:07:47.116 --> 00:07:49.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at Hebrews 10:24, 25,

00:07:49.685 --> 00:07:52.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the purpose of attending is expressed

00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:56.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a totally different way.

00:07:56.159 --> 00:08:01.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of going
with the sole intent of being encouraged,

00:08:01.164 --> 00:08:03.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verse 24 says

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:06.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are to “consider one another

00:08:06.736 --> 00:08:09.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so as to incite [others]

00:08:09.572 --> 00:08:12.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love and fine works.”

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:14.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 25 says

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:18.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are to be “encouraging one another.”

00:08:19.415 --> 00:08:24.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should attend our meetings
with the goal of being a gift to others.

00:08:24.287 --> 00:08:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Encouraging others is the goal.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do this by our sincere interest in others

00:08:31.127 --> 00:08:34.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before and after the meeting.

00:08:34.197 --> 00:08:36.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you come to the Kingdom Hall early

00:08:36.465 --> 00:08:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage others?

00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When in the traveling work, years ago,

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I drove in to the parking lot

00:08:44.407 --> 00:08:46.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got out of our car.

00:08:46.342 --> 00:08:49.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two brothers approached us and warmly said:

00:08:49.745 --> 00:08:53.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brother and Sister Herd,
we were waiting for you.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:58.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are so happy to have you
with our congregation this week.”

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:04.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were they elders,
ministerial servants, or pioneers?

00:09:04.894 --> 00:09:09.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, they were two little preteenage boys!

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That boost gave us a fine start

00:09:13.502 --> 00:09:16.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a special week of activity.

00:09:16.339 --> 00:09:21.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also encourage others
by participating in the meetings.

00:09:21.043 --> 00:09:24.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouragement
to the whole congregation!

00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:28.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, if we all go to the meetings

00:09:28.284 --> 00:09:31.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with that goal and motive,

00:09:31.454 --> 00:09:35.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will be the result to us individually?

00:09:35.358 --> 00:09:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all will come away built up

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and encouraged spiritually.

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we must never forget

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that being at our Christian meetings
and participating,

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:50.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including singing the songs

00:09:50.273 --> 00:09:53.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saying “Amen” to the prayers,

00:09:53.876 --> 00:09:56.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is actually worshipping Jehovah.

00:09:56.879 --> 00:10:01.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are presenting a gift to him
at every meeting you attend.

00:10:02.818 --> 00:10:04.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From ancient times until now,

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s faithful servants
have contributed materially

00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:11.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the support of true worship.

00:10:11.594 --> 00:10:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s presenting a gift to God as well,

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:18.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we thank all of you for your support.

00:10:18.734 --> 00:10:22.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body is able to provide so much

00:10:22.071 --> 00:10:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the benefit of the worldwide brotherhood

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of your generosity.

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:30.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much!

00:10:33.349 --> 00:10:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about you Christian parents?

00:10:35.685 --> 00:10:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What gift can you present to Jehovah?

00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:39.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your children!

00:10:39.822 --> 00:10:42.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you do your best to ‘bring your children up

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the discipline and admonition of Jehovah,’

00:10:45.995 --> 00:10:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are preparing a gift to your God.

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the number of brothers

00:10:51.267 --> 00:10:55.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking the lead in the organization at this time.

00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:58.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are Governing Body members, helpers,

00:10:58.974 --> 00:11:02.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Branch Committee members, circuit overseers,

00:11:02.712 --> 00:11:06.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
elders, and ministerial servants.

00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where did so many of these come from?

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:13.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hundreds of thousands
were children of Christian parents.

00:11:13.923 --> 00:11:18.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The parents followed
the admonition of Ephesians 6:4.

00:11:19.628 --> 00:11:22.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are thousands more brothers and sisters

00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:26.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have been raised
in the truth by godly parents

00:11:26.402 --> 00:11:30.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are spearheading
the work in the ministry,

00:11:30.039 --> 00:11:32.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Bethel service,

00:11:32.074 --> 00:11:36.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on construction projects, and in relief work.

00:11:36.212 --> 00:11:39.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank you, parents,
for all that you’ve done

00:11:39.515 --> 00:11:43.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the precious gifts
you have offered up to Jehovah

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his organization.

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the older ones
in our congregations?

00:11:48.491 --> 00:11:53.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m 84 years young with eternity in view.

00:11:53.329 --> 00:11:58.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at some point,
we start to admit that we’re getting old.

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:01.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We start to feel that we’re getting old.

00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We start to look like we’re getting old.

00:12:05.808 --> 00:12:10.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us find ourselves
slipping physically or even mentally.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:15.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we becoming
less and less valuable to Jehovah?

00:12:15.284 --> 00:12:19.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is our gift now tarnished by age?

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:21.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might begin to think so,

00:12:21.857 --> 00:12:25.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s not at all how
Jehovah views older ones

00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:28.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have dedicated themselves to him,

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:31.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
possibly many decades ago.

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A tarnished gold coin

00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has as much value as a shiny new one.

00:12:38.674 --> 00:12:41.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 16:31 instructs us

00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:44.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “gray hair is a crown of beauty

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it is found in the way of righteousness.”

00:12:48.851 --> 00:12:53.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not so much the color
of the hair that Jehovah admires.

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:57.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, it’s the life of self-sacrifice

00:12:57.059 --> 00:12:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that gray hair represents.

00:12:59.428 --> 00:13:01.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah views older ones

00:13:01.797 --> 00:13:05.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are still found in the way of righteousness

00:13:05.201 --> 00:13:08.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as precious gifts to him.

00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:12.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do pieces of antique furniture often cost

00:13:12.074 --> 00:13:15.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much more than a brand new piece of furniture?

00:13:15.778 --> 00:13:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or why is an older bottle of fine wine

00:13:20.249 --> 00:13:25.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often more expensive
than a newer vintage wine?

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Age brings value to a gift.

00:13:29.191 --> 00:13:34.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You older ones have wisdom and experience

00:13:34.196 --> 00:13:37.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that others in the congregation can benefit from.

00:13:38.767 --> 00:13:42.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that you
need to be holding the microphone

00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:46.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and waxing eloquent
on every paragraph at a meeting,

00:13:46.442 --> 00:13:49.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but modestly sharing your experience

00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:52.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wisdom with others on a personal basis

00:13:52.214 --> 00:13:55.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be so helpful and encouraging.

00:13:55.851 --> 00:13:58.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves you older ones.

00:13:58.687 --> 00:14:03.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even if you’re bent with age in your mind,

00:14:03.692 --> 00:14:08.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stand tall as a precious gift
presented to Jehovah.

00:14:09.164 --> 00:14:12.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all of us, young and old,

00:14:12.868 --> 00:14:17.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
consider how we can enhance
our gifts presented to Jehovah.

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:21.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we have not yet dedicated our life to God,

00:14:21.477 --> 00:14:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is it time to seriously consider this gift?

00:14:25.481 --> 00:14:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we enhance our gift

00:14:27.483 --> 00:14:32.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by more closely monitoring
our view of Christian morality?

00:14:32.521 --> 00:14:35.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we look at or think about

00:14:35.324 --> 00:14:38.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could compromise our gift to God.

00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:42.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about our ministry or attendance
and participation at the meetings

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or contributing materially

00:14:45.334 --> 00:14:47.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide work?

00:14:47.736 --> 00:14:49.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You parents,

00:14:49.738 --> 00:14:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do your best to package

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the gift of your children

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:58.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they will be useful to Jehovah.

00:14:58.914 --> 00:15:00.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you older ones,

00:15:00.916 --> 00:15:05.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forget that when it comes
to wisdom and experience,

00:15:05.921 --> 00:15:09.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you only get better with age.

00:15:09.558 --> 00:15:13.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is the best of Jehovah’s servants.

00:15:13.128 --> 00:15:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s been around the longest.
