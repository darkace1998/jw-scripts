My theme is “‘The King of the North’
in the Time of the End.”

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:09.125 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, the Russian government

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:11.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has persecuted our brothers and sisters

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.763 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who live in that country.

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:17.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve heard reports
about the police invading Kingdom Halls

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:19.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and breaking up meetings.

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The government has labeled
Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an “extremist group.”

00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:29.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has seized our properties
and imprisoned our brothers.

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:31.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch a brief video

00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:33.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reviews some of the trials

00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:37.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people in Russia have faced.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On April 20, 2017,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court
of the Russian Federation criminalized

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:46.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of July 4, 2019,

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
authorities have progressively
seized 131 of the properties

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:58.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:01.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an additional 60 properties
subject to confiscation.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:03.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the seized properties

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the former
Russia branch complex in Solnechnoye.

00:01:07.884 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time of filming,
the Russian authorities continue

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:13.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their aggressive attack
on Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:13.656 --> 00:01:16.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of August 17, 2020,

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:19.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were 42 Witnesses
who were in pretrial detention

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:21.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or sentenced to prison,

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
32 who were under house arrest,

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:28.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 169 who were not allowed
to leave their hometown.

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:30.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All have been charged with organizing,

00:01:30.874 --> 00:01:33.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
participating in, or financing the activity

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a so-called “extremist” organization.

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:41.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At least 380 Witnesses were,
at the time, under investigation

00:01:41.251 --> 00:01:45.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old.

00:01:46.156 --> 00:01:48.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has this meant
for the individuals affected?

00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:50.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:52.962 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on June 3, 2018,

00:01:52.962 --> 00:01:56.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sergey Klimov was arrested.

00:01:56.466 --> 00:01:58.434 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Local authorities initiated

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.270 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
criminal charges against him,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
placing him
in pretrial detention for two months.

00:02:03.273 --> 00:02:06.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This detention was extended seven times,

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
separating him from his wife and family

00:02:08.578 --> 00:02:10.747 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for a year and five months,

00:02:10.747 --> 00:02:13.183 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
before he was finally tried and sentenced.

00:02:14.551 --> 00:02:16.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On November 5, 2019,

00:02:16.553 --> 00:02:19.989 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he was sentenced to six years in prison.

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:26.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two of our dear young people in Russia,

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Yegor Baranov
and Sister Darya Dulova,

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:32.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are courageously facing criminal conviction

00:02:32.001 --> 00:02:34.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and potential long-term imprisonment.

00:02:35.638 --> 00:02:38.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Baranov is only 19 years old.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:43.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the authorities raided her home,
Sister Dulova was only 18 years old.

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of the Newsroom on jw.org,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are informed of updated news events.

00:02:50.086 --> 00:02:52.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This page includes links to name lists

00:02:52.088 --> 00:02:54.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Witnesses
currently imprisoned for their faith,

00:02:54.757 --> 00:02:58.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which can help us include
them specifically in our prayers.

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Russia
are resolved to remain loyal to Jehovah

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:04.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any opposition,

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they put their confidence
in him in the assurance

00:03:07.537 --> 00:03:10.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is on their side!

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:24.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shouldn’t surprise us

00:03:24.721 --> 00:03:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this powerful government
has been persecuting

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:32.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our peaceful,
law-abiding brothers and sisters.

00:03:32.028 --> 00:03:33.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:38.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because that government
is fulfilling Bible prophecy!

00:03:38.668 --> 00:03:42.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Daniel chapter 11.

00:03:42.772 --> 00:03:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 40, it refers
to what the Bible calls

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north.”

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of that “king,” Daniel 11:41 says:

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:57.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will also enter
into the land of the Decoration,

00:03:57.887 --> 00:04:02.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many lands will be made to stumble.”

00:04:02.892 --> 00:04:05.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Russia and its allies

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:09.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are filling the role
of the king of the north.

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:12.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel foretold that this king would enter

00:04:12.735 --> 00:04:14.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the land of the Decoration,”

00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning that he would interfere
in a significant way

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the activities of God’s people.

00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:25.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed in the May 2020 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:04:25.248 --> 00:04:28.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia and its allies
are not the first political power

00:04:28.818 --> 00:04:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to act as the king of the north,

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:35.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they may well be the last.

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:38.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this program, we will do three things:

00:04:38.461 --> 00:04:39.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First,

00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:42.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll briefly trace
the fulfillment of the prophecy

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:46.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:49.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we’ll look at how that prophecy

00:04:49.906 --> 00:04:52.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being fulfilled today.

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:56.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, we’ll discuss
how knowing this information

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should affect the decisions that we make.

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:04.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Herman van Selm,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:08.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us review
some of the key points of the prophecy

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:16.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Herman,
for helping me with this presentation.

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:19.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a pleasure to be with you, Ken.

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:21.838 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for inviting me.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:25.108 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s briefly trace

00:05:25.108 --> 00:05:28.811 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how the prophecy has been fulfilled so far.

00:05:29.612 --> 00:05:32.215 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The prophecy in Daniel chapter 11 mentions

00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:35.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north”
and “the king of the south.”

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:37.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why are they described like that?

00:05:37.653 --> 00:05:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, initially,

00:05:39.655 --> 00:05:43.793 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
these powers were located north and south

00:05:43.793 --> 00:05:46.162 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the literal land of Israel,

00:05:46.162 --> 00:05:48.464 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
thus the names king of the north

00:05:48.464 --> 00:05:49.799 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and king of the south.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These powers could be viewed as two thrones.

00:05:54.837 --> 00:05:57.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over time, those thrones have been occupied

00:05:57.707 --> 00:05:59.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by various political powers

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:04.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these rival kings compete
for world domination.

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:06.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about Jehovah’s people?

00:06:06.416 --> 00:06:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are right at the center
of this conflict.

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:14.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s start at the beginning.

00:06:14.824 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ken,

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:20.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is the origin
of the kings of the north and of the south?

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.800 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The kings of the north and of the south

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.035 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
both rose from the empire

00:06:26.035 --> 00:06:29.138 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
established by Alexander the Great.

00:06:29.138 --> 00:06:31.574 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One line of kings ruled over Egypt,

00:06:31.574 --> 00:06:33.709 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which is south of Israel.

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:36.212 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And that dynasty was the first

00:06:36.212 --> 00:06:39.782 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to fill the role of king of the south.

00:06:39.782 --> 00:06:42.418 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
During this period, another line of kings

00:06:42.418 --> 00:06:45.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
ruled an area north of Israel

00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:47.523 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and those kings filled the role

00:06:47.523 --> 00:06:49.525 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of king of the north.

00:06:49.525 --> 00:06:52.895 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Then the Roman Empire took over

00:06:52.895 --> 00:06:55.231 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as king of the north.

00:06:56.299 --> 00:06:59.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed in the May 2020 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:06:59.535 --> 00:07:01.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s people are the focal point

00:07:01.871 --> 00:07:06.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the prophecy
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:07:06.242 --> 00:07:09.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The angel who spoke with Daniel
said that the prophecy

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:14.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would help him
“understand what will befall your people”

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:17.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, the nation of Israel.

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:21.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what, in fact, happened?

00:07:21.624 --> 00:07:26.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Jewish nation
was God’s people until 33 C.E.

00:07:26.596 --> 00:07:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after that, a change occurred.

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:31.701 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah poured out his holy spirit

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.035 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on Christ’s followers.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.704 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And from then on,

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:37.106 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the congregation of true Christians

00:07:37.106 --> 00:07:39.275 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became God’s people.

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:43.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:16 refers to them

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the Israel of God.”

00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:50.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That point is significant

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:54.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the kings of the north and south
can only be identified

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:59.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when there is a clearly defined group
of God’s people on earth.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:02.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that the case?

00:08:02.098 --> 00:08:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because, as we just considered,

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the angel had told Daniel

00:08:06.602 --> 00:08:11.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the prophecy centers on God’s people.

00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:13.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the second century C.E.,

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:16.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true Christians were overgrown

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:19.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by weedlike false Christians.

00:08:19.715 --> 00:08:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his illustration
of the wheat and the weeds,

00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold that this would happen.

00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:27.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That illustration is recorded

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 13:36-43.

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from the second century onward,

00:08:35.498 --> 00:08:39.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can no longer identify
an organized group of true Christians.

00:08:39.702 --> 00:08:42.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as we considered, for that same reason,

00:08:42.705 --> 00:08:44.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also cannot identify

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:48.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north
and the king of the south.

00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the 1870’s, a group of Bible students

00:08:52.515 --> 00:08:55.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began to separate itself
from false Christians.

00:08:55.918 --> 00:08:57.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This group,

00:08:57.186 --> 00:08:59.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included Charles T. Russell,

00:08:59.589 --> 00:09:01.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejected teachings

00:09:01.224 --> 00:09:03.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were not based on the Bible.

00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:06.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the first-century Christians,

00:09:06.395 --> 00:09:08.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they promoted the truths

00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:10.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught in God’s Word.

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:13.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this group underwent a development

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is foretold at Malachi 3:1.

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:20.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the “messenger”

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:24.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would “clear up a way” before Jehovah.

00:09:24.413 --> 00:09:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as events that followed prove,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this group clearly had God’s backing.

00:09:30.486 --> 00:09:33.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from the 1870’s onward,

00:09:33.089 --> 00:09:37.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when true Christians began
to organize themselves as a group,

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can again identify the political powers

00:09:40.563 --> 00:09:43.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that fill the roles of the king of the north

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:45.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and king of the south.

00:09:45.968 --> 00:09:49.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time in history,

00:09:49.071 --> 00:09:52.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Britain was the dominant political force

00:09:52.375 --> 00:09:53.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it filled the role

00:09:53.943 --> 00:09:56.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the south.

00:09:56.178 --> 00:10:00.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazingly, it was also in the 1870’s

00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the German Empire emerged

00:10:02.618 --> 00:10:04.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and soon began to challenge Britain

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:06.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for world domination.

00:10:06.956 --> 00:10:10.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This political power now filled the role

00:10:10.226 --> 00:10:12.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north.

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:17.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 11:25, 26 indicate

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the two kings would clash

00:10:19.568 --> 00:10:23.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the king of the north
would lose many soldiers in the battle.

00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:27.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is exactly what happened

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during World War I.

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was during that war

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Britain and its close ally,

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:35.785 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the United States,

00:10:35.785 --> 00:10:38.354 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
forged a special bond.

00:10:38.354 --> 00:10:40.589 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So from this point on,

00:10:40.589 --> 00:10:42.391 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
during these last days,

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:44.660 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Anglo-American power

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.996 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has been the king of the south.

00:10:48.331 --> 00:10:50.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to our second point:

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:55.204 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How has Daniel chapter 11 been fulfilled

00:10:55.204 --> 00:10:57.440 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from that time onward

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:59.642 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
until recent times?

00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:01.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During World War I,

00:11:01.811 --> 00:11:05.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north
and the king of the south

00:11:05.414 --> 00:11:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecuted those of God’s people
who refused to fight in the war.

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:13.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king of the south even threw into jail

00:11:13.022 --> 00:11:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who were taking the lead
in the preaching work.

00:11:16.192 --> 00:11:20.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s take a closer look
at the king of the north.

00:11:20.262 --> 00:11:22.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has the political power filling that role

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changed during the last days?

00:11:25.701 --> 00:11:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how has it treated God’s people?

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:31.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The identity of the king of the north

00:11:31.474 --> 00:11:35.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has changed three times during the last days.

00:11:35.344 --> 00:11:40.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting in the 1870’s
through to the end of the second world war,

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:42.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the German Empire

00:11:42.118 --> 00:11:45.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filled the role of the king of the north.

00:11:45.287 --> 00:11:49.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the period leading up to
and including World War II,

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:53.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it persecuted God’s people without mercy,

00:11:53.362 --> 00:11:56.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning thousands of our brothers

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:59.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and killing hundreds of them.

00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:03.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who replaced the German Empire
as the king of the north?

00:12:03.272 --> 00:12:06.242 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s an important question, Herman.

00:12:06.242 --> 00:12:07.843 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After World War II,

00:12:07.843 --> 00:12:10.479 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union took on that role.

00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:12.948 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It also attacked God’s people,

00:12:12.948 --> 00:12:16.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning them or sending them into exile.

00:12:17.953 --> 00:12:21.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Ken, Daniel 11:34 says

00:12:21.123 --> 00:12:24.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they—that is, God’s people—

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:27.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be “given a little help.”

00:12:27.029 --> 00:12:29.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the significance of that statement?

00:12:29.799 --> 00:12:32.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This passage points forward to the time

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:35.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the Soviet Union collapsed.

00:12:35.471 --> 00:12:39.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although God’s people suffered terribly
under that government,

00:12:39.341 --> 00:12:42.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were “given a little help.”

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what way?

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the USSR collapsed,

00:12:46.782 --> 00:12:51.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s people there could worship freely
for a number of years.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, though, Russia and its allies

00:12:54.423 --> 00:12:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took on the role of the king of the north.

00:12:58.127 --> 00:13:02.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the other powers
that filled the role of king of the north,

00:13:02.264 --> 00:13:06.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this government has continued to oppress
God’s people.

00:13:07.636 --> 00:13:11.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are our brothers and sisters coping
with the current persecution?

00:13:11.907 --> 00:13:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look.

00:13:13.909 --> 00:13:18.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what you’re going to see
will break your heart

00:13:18.013 --> 00:13:21.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also strengthen your faith.

00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:24.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 6:00 a.m.,

00:13:24.954 --> 00:13:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband and I were woken up

00:13:26.956 --> 00:13:29.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a loud bang on the door.

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:31.360 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As soon as my husband had opened the door,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.429 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
people burst in shouting,

00:13:33.429 --> 00:13:35.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone on the floor!”

00:13:35.297 --> 00:13:37.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen

00:13:37.967 --> 00:13:39.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and heard them

00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very aggressively
ordering him to do something.

00:13:41.537 --> 00:13:43.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I heard some noise, and I realized

00:13:43.939 --> 00:13:46.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was being beaten.

00:13:46.475 --> 00:13:48.644 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband, Feliks, and I

00:13:48.644 --> 00:13:51.447 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were on our way back from the shopping mall

00:13:51.447 --> 00:13:52.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the car park.

00:13:52.948 --> 00:13:54.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A jeep with tinted windows

00:13:54.383 --> 00:13:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blocked our path, and people

00:13:56.118 --> 00:13:58.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with weapons
jumped out, shouting:

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:00.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the ground!
Don’t move!”

00:14:01.323 --> 00:14:03.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were thrown against the vehicle.

00:14:03.726 --> 00:14:06.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks was sent
to a pretrial detention facility,

00:14:06.762 --> 00:14:08.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he spent a year.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:13.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the very first bang on the door,

00:14:13.102 --> 00:14:17.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began praying to Jehovah
for wisdom, calmness,

00:14:17.406 --> 00:14:20.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for holy spirit
so that I could make the right decisions

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and act in the right way.

00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:23.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for the whole day, I was praying.

00:14:23.712 --> 00:14:25.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered all my prayers,

00:14:25.681 --> 00:14:29.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt that he was close at my side.

00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before each court hearing
when I was very afraid

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and felt overwhelmed by emotion
and couldn’t calm myself down,

00:14:38.594 --> 00:14:40.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was prayer

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:42.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped me to settle down.

00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:47.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they took us for interrogation,

00:14:47.036 --> 00:14:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started panicking and, at that moment,

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:53.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to meditate on something positive.

00:14:53.275 --> 00:14:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought,

00:14:55.311 --> 00:14:57.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I need to sing our songs.’

00:14:57.313 --> 00:15:00.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just one song came into my mind:

00:15:00.716 --> 00:15:02.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Will Make You Strong.”

00:15:02.718 --> 00:15:04.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really strengthened me.

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:07.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words
about how Jehovah gave his Son for us

00:15:07.957 --> 00:15:10.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show he loves us and will never leave us.

00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:14.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters

00:15:14.997 --> 00:15:17.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray and tell me

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:19.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are praying for me.

00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:21.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives me the feeling that I am part

00:15:21.904 --> 00:15:23.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a large family.

00:15:25.608 --> 00:15:28.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the interrogation,

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:29.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was sent home.

00:15:29.912 --> 00:15:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband and I

00:15:31.847 --> 00:15:34.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to stick to our spiritual routine.

00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We continue to conduct family worship,
and we are always in the ministry.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:43.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
constantly support us.

00:15:43.926 --> 00:15:45.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They write kind words;

00:15:45.527 --> 00:15:48.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they commend us;

00:15:48.497 --> 00:15:50.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they send us
encouraging scriptures from the Bible.

00:15:52.401 --> 00:15:57.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In September 2019, Feliks was found guilty

00:15:57.039 --> 00:15:59.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sentenced to three years
in a general regime colony.

00:16:02.077 --> 00:16:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he and the other brothers arrived there,

00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:07.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were beaten up by officers
from the colony.

00:16:10.419 --> 00:16:11.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks told me

00:16:11.754 --> 00:16:13.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he prayed
while he was being beaten,

00:16:15.357 --> 00:16:18.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he noticed that at that moment,
he stopped feeling the pain.

00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:24.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While he is behind bars,

00:16:24.533 --> 00:16:27.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks tries to conduct
family worship with me by letters.

00:16:29.338 --> 00:16:32.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He picks certain themes
and some specific questions.

00:16:33.208 --> 00:16:35.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I do research

00:16:35.277 --> 00:16:37.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the publications
and send back what I find.

00:16:40.549 --> 00:16:43.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture at Isaiah chapter 30
really strengthens me,

00:16:43.719 --> 00:16:47.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says that “your strength will be

00:16:47.022 --> 00:16:49.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping calm and showing trust.”

00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:53.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I tend to worry,

00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:56.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that calmness is expressed

00:16:56.498 --> 00:16:58.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fully trusting in Jehovah.

00:17:00.703 --> 00:17:03.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have become stronger
because thanks to Jehovah,

00:17:03.839 --> 00:17:07.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way, I have developed almost a shell

00:17:07.576 --> 00:17:09.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the difficulties

00:17:09.578 --> 00:17:10.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that used to scare me.

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:12.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That confidence and faith help me.

00:17:12.648 --> 00:17:14.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with me,

00:17:14.717 --> 00:17:16.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will remain

00:17:16.251 --> 00:17:17.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close by me,

00:17:17.586 --> 00:17:19.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will be made stronger thanks to him,

00:17:19.955 --> 00:17:23.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will get through these trials.

00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:29.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we develop courage

00:17:29.364 --> 00:17:32.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like our brothers and sisters in Russia?

00:17:32.534 --> 00:17:35.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we must be convinced

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:40.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the prophecies in the Bible
are trustworthy.

00:17:42.077 --> 00:17:44.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve discussed,

00:17:44.079 --> 00:17:48.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each detail of the prophecy
recorded at Daniel chapter 11

00:17:48.450 --> 00:17:50.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has come true so far.

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:52.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have confidence

00:17:52.988 --> 00:17:55.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the remaining events
described in that prophecy

00:17:55.958 --> 00:17:58.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also come true.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are living in the last days
of the time of the end.

00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:06.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, the nations will fulfill the prophecy

00:18:06.735 --> 00:18:09.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 5:3:

00:18:09.671 --> 00:18:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:15.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:18:15.477 --> 00:18:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then sudden destruction
is to be instantly on them,

00:18:19.782 --> 00:18:23.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

00:18:23.285 --> 00:18:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

00:18:27.256 --> 00:18:29.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then “sudden destruction”

00:18:29.458 --> 00:18:33.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes upon all parts of Satan’s system.

00:18:33.162 --> 00:18:35.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see on the screen,

00:18:35.564 --> 00:18:38.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 12:1 says:

00:18:38.233 --> 00:18:41.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During that time Michael will stand up,

00:18:41.804 --> 00:18:45.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the great prince who is standing
in behalf of your people.

00:18:45.874 --> 00:18:50.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there will occur a time of distress
such as has not occurred

00:18:50.579 --> 00:18:54.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since there came to be a nation
until that time.

00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:58.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And during that time
your people will escape,

00:18:58.687 --> 00:19:02.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone who is found written down
in the book.”

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That leads us into our third point:

00:19:07.062 --> 00:19:09.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How should knowing the information

00:19:09.832 --> 00:19:11.567 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we have just discussed

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:15.337 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
affect the decisions that we make?

00:19:15.337 --> 00:19:19.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what we have reviewed
is not just interesting history;

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a dramatic prelude

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what will soon happen here on earth.

00:19:25.214 --> 00:19:28.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given his people this knowledge

00:19:28.617 --> 00:19:30.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can act on it.

00:19:30.619 --> 00:19:34.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should influence the choices we make.
