In this update,

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:05.321 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to talk about how we can make

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.424 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
good use of our time

00:00:07.424 --> 00:00:09.225 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
during the pandemic.

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:13.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But first, we’d like to share a few updates.

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:18.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re sad to report that, as of December 10,

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:22.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have lost 25,658

00:00:22.972 --> 00:00:26.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters to COVID-19.

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:30.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our prayers are certainly with all

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:32.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have lost loved ones.

00:00:33.817 --> 00:00:36.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, the new Omicron variant

00:00:36.553 --> 00:00:39.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has received a lot of news coverage.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:45.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this point, there are still many unknowns.

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:49.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters, we don’t need to panic.

00:00:49.866 --> 00:00:54.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep following the same basic precautions
that have worked well:

00:00:54.637 --> 00:00:56.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wearing masks,

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physical distancing,

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
frequently washing our hands,

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and getting vaccinated, if possible.

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:09.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the <i>2021 Governing Body Update #7,</i>

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lösch mentioned that over 80 percent

00:01:13.423 --> 00:01:16.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the worldwide Bethel family
was vaccinated.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are glad to inform you
that now over 99 percent

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:26.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our worldwide Bethel family is vaccinated,

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:29.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so are over 95 percent of our

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
special full-time servants in the field.

00:01:34.944 --> 00:01:37.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our brothers and sisters have had

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
good results from being vaccinated.

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:45.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in some parts of Bulgaria,

00:01:45.455 --> 00:01:48.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the local clergy say that vaccines

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:50.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are “poison from the Devil.”

00:01:52.128 --> 00:01:54.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there is much pressure in the community

00:01:54.564 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>not </i> to get vaccinated.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite this, one sister and her husband

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:03.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watched the Governing Body updates

00:02:03.506 --> 00:02:08.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made their personal decision
to get vaccinated.

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:11.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, the sister’s employer called her

00:02:11.648 --> 00:02:16.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said that in order
to comply with government regulations,

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:20.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she couldn’t return to work
if she had not been vaccinated.

00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:23.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How surprised the manager was to learn

00:02:23.893 --> 00:02:27.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the sister was already vaccinated!

00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact,

00:02:29.766 --> 00:02:34.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she was the only employee who was vaccinated.

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:37.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone else had to be laid off.

00:02:37.607 --> 00:02:39.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The manager asked our sister

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:43.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if she had any vaccinated friends
who could replace

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:47.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the employees who had been fired.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The manager then called other Witnesses

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:53.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she knew to see if they had any

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:56.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
vaccinated friends who needed employment.

00:02:56.826 --> 00:02:58.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That evening,

00:02:58.828 --> 00:03:02.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nearly all the positions were filled.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:06.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The head of staff asked our sisters,

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:10.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How do you know so many vaccinated women?”

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:13.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A fine witness was given.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the end, 14 sisters

00:03:16.312 --> 00:03:19.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 1 Bible student were employed

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they followed
the good guidance and Bible principles

00:03:24.053 --> 00:03:28.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have been shared
in our various Governing Body updates.

00:03:30.627 --> 00:03:35.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s get back to our topic
of putting our time to good use

00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:37.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the pandemic.

00:03:38.167 --> 00:03:40.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been exciting to hear how many of you

00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have reached out to pioneer,

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:46.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started new study projects,

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:49.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and refined your telephone
and letter-writing skills.

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is time well spent.

00:03:53.816 --> 00:03:56.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this month’s update,

00:03:56.352 --> 00:03:59.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will discuss two additional ways

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:02.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can use our time wisely:

00:04:02.091 --> 00:04:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping inactive ones

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and improving our reading and writing skills.

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:14.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been wonderful to see so many
of our brothers and sisters

00:04:14.404 --> 00:04:17.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were inactive begin associating

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with us again during the pandemic.

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that describes you,

00:04:23.012 --> 00:04:25.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please know

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:28.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body
warmly welcomes you back!

00:04:29.953 --> 00:04:34.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine the joy that Jehovah, Jesus,
and all the angels

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:38.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in heaven have experienced
at seeing you return.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:42.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about those
who have not yet returned?

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might feel like the psalmist,
as recorded

00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:51.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 119:176.

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:56.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we read:
“I have strayed like a lost sheep.

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Search for your servant,

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for I have not forgotten your commandments.”

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:07.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right now, some inactive ones
may be praying to Jehovah,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying: ‘Search for me.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need help to come back.’

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They haven’t forgotten Jehovah,

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:18.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but for various reasons,

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they haven’t been able
to come back on their own.

00:05:22.672 --> 00:05:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah feel about such ones?

00:05:27.143 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel 34:15, 16 says:

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I myself will feed my sheep . . .

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:38.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The lost one I will search for,

00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:40.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the stray I will bring back,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the injured I will bandage,

00:05:43.059 --> 00:05:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the weak I will strengthen.”

00:05:45.995 --> 00:05:50.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can Jehovah use you to find his lost sheep?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely!

00:05:52.935 --> 00:05:56.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of you have
reached out to inactive ones.

00:05:56.606 --> 00:05:58.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how publishers took the initiative

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:04.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help others return to Jehovah.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.017 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what my brother was ever

00:06:08.017 --> 00:06:09.385 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
going to do about the truth.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:12.488 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As a teenager, he was a publisher

00:06:12.488 --> 00:06:14.057 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:17.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time he was 16,
sadly, he decided to leave home,

00:06:17.894 --> 00:06:20.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he no longer served Jehovah.

00:06:20.363 --> 00:06:24.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, when we came back
to Seattle and settled down,

00:06:24.767 --> 00:06:27.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we had more contact with him.

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:30.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My wife and I
had been providing meals for him

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:32.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because his wife had a brain tumor.

00:06:32.208 --> 00:06:34.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the beautiful thing
is that our congregation

00:06:34.744 --> 00:06:36.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
started taking him meals.

00:06:36.612 --> 00:06:39.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my brother’s wife was hospitalized,

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:41.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they even assisted at the hospital

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit him and give him encouragement.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That had a big impact upon him.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could see the closeness
of the congregation,

00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:52.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I think that built a desire
that he would really like to do more.

00:06:52.295 --> 00:06:55.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my brother went to the Kingdom Hall,
he was only able to do that 

00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:58.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for two weeks
and then COVID-19 struck.

00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:02.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But an elder talked to him the first time
he went to the Kingdom Hall,

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:04.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they exchanged phone numbers.

00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:06.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so they were able to communicate.

00:07:06.776 --> 00:07:10.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that elder helped set him up on Zoom,

00:07:10.046 --> 00:07:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was able to attend the meetings then.

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he went to all the meetings.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:17.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I encouraged him
to have a personal study,

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he said, “Well I’m doing my study.”

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:21.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of all things, it was a terminology issue.

00:07:21.424 --> 00:07:25.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t know about having
a personal Bible study with someone.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:29.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had some more encouragement
from a family friend

00:07:29.765 --> 00:07:32.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that found out
that he was coming to meetings,

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:34.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he started to have
his own Bible study.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s when he really started
to make progress.

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:38.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It took 59 years!

00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:43.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had the privilege of actually performing
the baptism for my own brother.

00:07:46.415 --> 00:07:48.017 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the beginning of the pandemic,

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:50.219 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we knew that our ministry

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:51.654 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was going to change.

00:07:51.654 --> 00:07:53.656 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And so we thought about what to do,

00:07:53.656 --> 00:07:56.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we came up with this little project,

00:07:56.092 --> 00:07:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making a list of all the inactive people

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could think of that we’d been
with in other congregations

00:08:01.564 --> 00:08:05.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—lots of young people and others.

00:08:05.234 --> 00:08:08.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when we did that list,
there were about 40 people on that list.

00:08:08.337 --> 00:08:11.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ve emailed, we’ve called,

00:08:11.574 --> 00:08:14.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve texted,
and we’ve written lots of letters.

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:18.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them, we haven’t heard anything from,

00:08:18.347 --> 00:08:21.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nobody has rejected our efforts.

00:08:21.484 --> 00:08:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I contacted one man

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:27.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom I had met almost 40 years ago
when I was 19 years old.

00:08:27.823 --> 00:08:29.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We reestablished contact.

00:08:29.959 --> 00:08:32.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began to attend all the meetings on Zoom,

00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:35.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now we’re studying the Bible
in the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book.

00:08:35.731 --> 00:08:40.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We contacted one brother
who’d been inactive for many years.

00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:43.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now he attends all the meetings on Zoom.

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:46.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has been reactivated,

00:08:46.108 --> 00:08:49.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of this despite
some very serious health problems.

00:08:49.779 --> 00:08:52.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Patience and persistence are required

00:08:52.848 --> 00:08:55.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when reaching out to these dear ones.

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:57.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love them, and so we contact

00:08:57.753 --> 00:09:00.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some on that list every week.

00:09:00.489 --> 00:09:02.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re so happy.

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three of the persons that we’ve contacted

00:09:06.329 --> 00:09:08.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are now regularly attending the meetings.

00:09:08.698 --> 00:09:11.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two of them are studying the Bible.

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really been encouraging
for us to see these ones

00:09:14.637 --> 00:09:17.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we love so much return to Jehovah.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And really, if Jehovah is drawing them,

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:22.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re going to respond.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you agree

00:09:25.848 --> 00:09:28.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah blessed these efforts

00:09:28.117 --> 00:09:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach out to his lost sheep.

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:33.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful way to use our time

00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:36.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the pandemic!

00:09:36.225 --> 00:09:38.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One circuit overseer in the United States

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:42.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recently reported that 76 individuals

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:46.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his circuit have been reactivated.

00:09:46.369 --> 00:09:50.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the equivalent
of an entire congregation!

00:09:51.507 --> 00:09:55.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We encourage you
to prayerfully think of inactive ones

00:09:55.278 --> 00:09:57.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you might know.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be a family member or friend.

00:10:01.751 --> 00:10:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you give them a call

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:08.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or send them a letter or a text message?

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they respond and attend a meeting,

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:14.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make them feel welcome.

00:10:14.497 --> 00:10:17.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope that many more lost sheep

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will return to Jehovah before the end.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another good use of our time

00:10:24.874 --> 00:10:28.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is improving our reading and writing skills.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reading and writing

00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:33.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has always been important
for Jehovah’s people.

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, the kings of Israel were told

00:10:36.652 --> 00:10:39.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “write [out] . . . a copy of [the] Law” 

00:10:39.755 --> 00:10:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “read from it
all the days of [their] life.”

00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was raised by a poor family,

00:10:47.063 --> 00:10:49.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet he was able to read.

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remember the time when he went
into the synagogue in Nazareth.

00:10:53.602 --> 00:10:56.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was able to open the Isaiah scroll

00:10:56.572 --> 00:10:59.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—which had no chapters and verses—

00:10:59.241 --> 00:11:03.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and locate and read the correct scripture.

00:11:04.347 --> 00:11:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let’s not forget what Paul told Timothy.

00:11:07.583 --> 00:11:10.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy was already an elder.

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:12.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Paul said to him:

00:11:12.888 --> 00:11:17.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Continue applying yourself
to public reading.”

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:22.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in view
of the Bible’s emphasis on reading,

00:11:22.898 --> 00:11:26.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is not surprising that God’s organization

00:11:26.569 --> 00:11:30.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a wonderful history of helping people

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:33.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all over the world to learn to read.

00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:36.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the past 70 years,

00:11:36.212 --> 00:11:40.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have taught
thousands of people worldwide

00:11:40.249 --> 00:11:43.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read and write.

00:11:43.352 --> 00:11:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in Mexico,

00:11:45.788 --> 00:11:50.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have helped more than 156,000 people

00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:53.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn to read and write.

00:11:53.095 --> 00:11:58.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve received awards
in several countries for our efforts.

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about today?

00:12:00.102 --> 00:12:02.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that now in many languages

00:12:02.838 --> 00:12:07.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have technology that enables us
to listen to our publications.

00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:10.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we don’t want to be content to rely

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:13.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on audio publications alone.

00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:18.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be able to read
and to study the Bible for ourselves

00:12:18.354 --> 00:12:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to dig into the wonderful information

00:12:21.257 --> 00:12:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provided by “the faithful
and discreet slave.”

00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some other benefits that come

00:12:27.463 --> 00:12:30.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from learning to read well?

00:12:30.332 --> 00:12:32.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A new article was recently published

00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on jw.org entitled

00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:38.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why Reading Is Important for Children.”

00:12:39.942 --> 00:12:43.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was prepared
with you dear parents in mind.

00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:46.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, really, reading is something

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:50.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that <i>all</i>  of us should view as important.

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:52.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:58.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article explained that reading
stirs the imagination.

00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:00.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It builds character 

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:04.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helps us to reason on our problems.

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:08.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helps us develop qualities
such as patience,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
self-control, and empathy.

00:13:11.674 --> 00:13:15.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And reading promotes deep thinking.

00:13:17.213 --> 00:13:19.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the pandemic,

00:13:19.248 --> 00:13:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of our brothers have been making
good use of their time

00:13:23.152 --> 00:13:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by learning to read and write.

00:13:25.855 --> 00:13:28.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s hear how they have benefited.

00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:32.228 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When the coronavirus broke out

00:13:32.228 --> 00:13:34.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
throughout the country, schools were shut down 

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:36.765 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and many parents either couldn’t go to work 

00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:38.334 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or they had to work from home.

00:13:38.334 --> 00:13:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One circuit overseer set a goal

00:13:40.603 --> 00:13:42.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to encourage the parents in his circuit

00:13:42.805 --> 00:13:44.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take advantage of the opportunity

00:13:44.807 --> 00:13:47.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry on teaching
their children to read and write

00:13:47.176 --> 00:13:50.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the objective of assisting them
to become publishers.

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:53.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many parents responded
to the encouragement, and this resulted

00:13:53.983 --> 00:13:57.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 37 young ones becoming proficient
in reading and writing.

00:13:57.953 --> 00:14:00.289 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A sister named Sara

00:14:00.289 --> 00:14:01.924 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had been trying for some time to learn

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:04.260 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to read and write.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:06.896 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At home, her husband tried to help her,

00:14:06.896 --> 00:14:10.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they just couldn’t find enough time

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:14.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their day-to-day activities
and many responsibilities.

00:14:14.203 --> 00:14:16.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when the pandemic

00:14:16.872 --> 00:14:20.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
limited their activities,
her husband, who is an elder,

00:14:20.609 --> 00:14:22.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took advantage of the extra time.

00:14:22.711 --> 00:14:24.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began to help her

00:14:24.747 --> 00:14:27.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several times a week to learn to read.

00:14:27.016 --> 00:14:29.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now she has the joy

00:14:29.084 --> 00:14:33.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of reading the Bible
and other publications on her own.

00:14:33.355 --> 00:14:36.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She also loves to sing the Kingdom songs

00:14:36.492 --> 00:14:39.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using her own songbook.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bible student named Comfort

00:14:41.597 --> 00:14:44.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
earnestly longed
to be able to read the Bible.

00:14:44.199 --> 00:14:47.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She became downhearted
when the pandemic began

00:14:47.236 --> 00:14:49.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wondered who was going
to help her read now

00:14:49.838 --> 00:14:52.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she couldn’t physically attend
a literacy class.

00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:56.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A local congregation elder gave her
some excellent practical suggestions,

00:14:56.579 --> 00:14:59.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he encouraged her
to continue practicing on her own.

00:14:59.582 --> 00:15:01.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With determination and persistence,

00:15:01.984 --> 00:15:03.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Comfort applied the suggestions.

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She made steady progress,
and she now reads well.

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:08.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She conducts five Bible studies.

00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:11.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is also assisting
her own 14-year-old daughter

00:15:11.193 --> 00:15:13.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn how to read and write.

00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:14.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Comfort was baptized

00:15:14.396 --> 00:15:17.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the 2020 “Always Rejoice”!
Regional Convention.

00:15:18.534 --> 00:15:22.037 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Maria is our 69-year-old sister in Nicaragua,

00:15:22.037 --> 00:15:23.472 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and she’s been a regular pioneer

00:15:23.472 --> 00:15:25.674 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for over six years.

00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:27.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She never had formal schooling,

00:15:27.676 --> 00:15:31.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so she learned to read
as she studied the Bible with our sisters,

00:15:31.246 --> 00:15:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she didn’t learn to write.

00:15:33.816 --> 00:15:37.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the pandemic started,
Maria was very discouraged

00:15:37.086 --> 00:15:40.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she didn’t know
how to use her cell phone to preach,

00:15:40.089 --> 00:15:42.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she didn’t know how to write letters.

00:15:42.925 --> 00:15:45.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But some of her fellow pioneers
offered to help.

00:15:46.462 --> 00:15:49.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Maria would dictate her words
to her field service partner

00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:52.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would then write the letter.

00:15:52.568 --> 00:15:55.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her field service partners
would send Maria photographs

00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the letters they wrote in her behalf.

00:15:58.307 --> 00:16:00.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And using the photographs,

00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:04.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maria would then copy them
so as to write her own letters.

00:16:04.446 --> 00:16:08.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This helped Maria
to start developing writing skills.

00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:10.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She now writes her own letters.

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:12.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you could see the letters that she writes,

00:16:12.988 --> 00:16:15.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what neat handwriting she’s learned

00:16:15.891 --> 00:16:18.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have, and how well she expresses herself!

00:16:18.794 --> 00:16:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, she has Jehovah’s blessing,

00:16:21.597 --> 00:16:25.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s certainly an encouragement
to all of us to try to continue to improve.

00:16:27.369 --> 00:16:31.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful way to use
our time during the pandemic!

00:16:33.342 --> 00:16:36.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s not
—even for a minute—

00:16:36.211 --> 00:16:38.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think that literacy is an issue

00:16:38.814 --> 00:16:41.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in only a few parts of the world.

00:16:41.417 --> 00:16:43.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, literacy

00:16:43.552 --> 00:16:46.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an issue <i>everywhere!</i>

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:49.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, if we’re being honest with ourselves,

00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:52.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably most of us would say

00:16:52.194 --> 00:16:56.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could improve
in our reading and writing.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:17:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why not make the effort to do so?

00:17:01.770 --> 00:17:04.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note what the Governing Body said

00:17:04.406 --> 00:17:08.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a recent letter to all Branch Committees:

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We want our brothers and sisters
to progress spiritually

00:17:12.081 --> 00:17:14.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and grow to maturity.

00:17:14.483 --> 00:17:18.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In large measure, this requires
that they be able to read

00:17:18.687 --> 00:17:23.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and study God’s Word
along with our publications.

00:17:23.659 --> 00:17:26.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many of the ways in which we serve God

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:29.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“involve the ability to read.

00:17:29.498 --> 00:17:31.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For example,

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:34.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all Christians have
the weighty responsibility

00:17:34.837 --> 00:17:38.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of teaching vital truths to others.

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And appointed men have many responsibilities

00:17:42.277 --> 00:17:44.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that involve reading. . . .

00:17:44.446 --> 00:17:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In general,

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:50.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christians should be able to read.”

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:55.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how could we learn to read
or improve in our reading?

00:17:55.090 --> 00:17:57.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are two ways:

00:17:57.893 --> 00:18:02.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask a friend, a family member,
or someone in your congregation

00:18:02.231 --> 00:18:04.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help you.

00:18:04.266 --> 00:18:05.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An excellent tool

00:18:05.734 --> 00:18:08.203 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to assist is the <i>Apply Yourself</i>

00:18:08.203 --> 00:18:11.073 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<i>to Reading and Writing</i> brochure.

00:18:11.073 --> 00:18:15.444 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is available in 123 languages.

00:18:15.444 --> 00:18:17.446 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Why not ask your congregation elders

00:18:17.446 --> 00:18:21.150 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about how to obtain this brochure?

00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:25.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you already know the alphabet
and you can recognize words,

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:29.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
audio recordings
of our literature may also help.

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you listen to the recording,

00:18:31.894 --> 00:18:35.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
read along in the written publication.

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work to imitate the pronunciation

00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:41.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you hear each word.

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Improving our reading and writing

00:18:43.972 --> 00:18:48.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a great way to use our time
during the pandemic!

00:18:50.179 --> 00:18:52.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You brothers and sisters have shown

00:18:52.314 --> 00:18:55.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can thrive spiritually

00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and build others up
during a time of adversity.

00:18:58.954 --> 00:19:03.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have made good use of your time.

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:06.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all of us continue to do so

00:19:06.261 --> 00:19:08.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by assisting inactive ones

00:19:08.664 --> 00:19:11.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by improving our reading skills.

00:19:11.934 --> 00:19:14.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be assured

00:19:14.002 --> 00:19:18.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body keeps
all of you in our prayers.

00:19:18.674 --> 00:19:22.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
