00:01.718 --> 00:05.000
My theme for this month’s broadcast is 


00:06.288 --> 00:12.428
“Young Ones
—Build Your Future With Jehovah!”


00:12.428 --> 00:17.266
If you do, 
1 Timothy 6:19 assures 


00:17.267 --> 00:20.604
that you will 
‘safely treasure up for yourself 


00:20.603 --> 00:23.440
a fine foundation for the future,’ 


00:23.440 --> 00:28.000
and you will 
“get a firm hold on the real life.”


00:29.878 --> 00:34.150
Obviously, we will be directing 
many of our comments 


00:34.150 --> 00:37.287
directly to you dear young ones 


00:37.287 --> 00:40.090
in Jehovah’s organization.


00:40.090 --> 00:42.258
Yet, if we think about it, 


00:42.258 --> 00:44.426
all of us figuratively 


00:44.427 --> 00:46.595
are very young ones 


00:46.595 --> 00:49.332
compared to eternity


00:49.332 --> 00:52.069
—how long we hope to live. 


00:52.068 --> 00:56.671
So, in a sense, 
our comments during this broadcast 


00:56.672 --> 01:00.310
have application to all of us.


01:00.310 --> 01:05.182
Personally, I am so thankful to Jehovah 


01:05.182 --> 01:08.952
that positive peer pressure 
was put on me 


01:08.952 --> 01:13.255
to enter the pioneer ministry 
right out of high school. 


01:13.255 --> 01:16.692
What a blessing and a protection 


01:16.692 --> 01:20.597
it was to enter 
the regular pioneer work 


01:20.597 --> 01:22.832
at age 17 


01:22.832 --> 01:26.269
and to be able to go to Bethel at 18. 


01:26.268 --> 01:31.073
Even though there was considerable 
worldly pressure put on me 


01:31.073 --> 01:34.143
to pursue university education, 


01:34.143 --> 01:38.515
I am so happy that with Jehovah’s help, 


01:38.515 --> 01:42.185
I decided to build my future 


01:42.185 --> 01:44.187
with Jehovah. 


01:44.187 --> 01:48.324
Truly, I have no regrets. 


01:48.323 --> 01:52.328
And this is always true of young ones 


01:52.328 --> 01:55.865
who serve Jehovah from their hearts


01:55.865 --> 01:58.333
—they have no regrets. 


01:58.333 --> 02:03.071
In fact, you will enjoy 
these expressions from young ones 


02:03.072 --> 02:07.000
who are building 
their future with Jehovah.


02:11.530 --> 02:13.533
Before I started pioneering, 


02:13.533 --> 02:17.236
I was really nervous that I wouldn’t be able 
to get my time in every month.


02:17.237 --> 02:21.207
It was a bit hard when I started pioneering 
because I didn’t have a car.


02:21.207 --> 02:24.610
My boss, 
he didn’t give me part-time work.


02:24.610 --> 02:26.913
I found it really hard 
to balance schoolwork 


02:26.913 --> 02:28.981
and pioneering 
at the same time.


02:28.982 --> 02:32.319
My biggest struggle was fear of man, 
so that really hindered me 


02:32.318 --> 02:34.620
because I wasn’t very good 
at talking to people.


02:34.620 --> 02:37.523
Having a good routine was a struggle.


02:37.523 --> 02:41.160
My brother and I are 
the only ones in the truth. 


02:41.160 --> 02:43.497
My family didn’t understand 


02:43.497 --> 02:46.332
why we wanted to go preaching.


02:46.332 --> 02:48.569
I didn’t think 
that I’d make a good pioneer.


02:48.568 --> 02:51.470
I’ve had Type 1 diabetes 
since I was five. 


02:51.470 --> 02:54.607
So I was always worried 
about whether or not 


02:54.607 --> 02:57.077
I could balance that health condition 
with pioneering.


02:57.077 --> 03:00.547
The challenges 
don’t seem that big now, 


03:00.547 --> 03:03.282
but back at that time 
they were a really big deal. 


03:03.282 --> 03:05.952
But the coolest thing 
was how Jehovah helped me.


03:05.952 --> 03:08.922
Prayer to Jehovah 
helped me overcome my fears.


03:08.922 --> 03:12.025
My family was 
a massive help from Jehovah. 


03:12.025 --> 03:14.893
Because my dad was the one 
who first encouraged me to pioneer, 


03:14.893 --> 03:18.296
when I did start pioneering, 
he promised that I would have 


03:18.297 --> 03:20.200
the full support of my family.


03:20.200 --> 03:24.170
When I spoke to brothers and sisters 
who spent their youth 


03:24.170 --> 03:26.838
in the full-time service 
that really helped me


03:26.838 --> 03:30.108
because it was really encouraging, 
and it really motivated me 


03:30.108 --> 03:32.711
to want to make my own memories 
and my own experiences 


03:32.712 --> 03:34.614
in the full-time service.


03:34.613 --> 03:36.848
So there were 
practical things I could do. 


03:36.848 --> 03:40.220
I didn’t have a car; 
I just walked or I caught the bus.


03:40.220 --> 03:42.855
I had to work out 
what my priorities were first. 


03:42.855 --> 03:46.993
So I had to find out how many hours 
would I have to go witnessing every week. 


03:46.993 --> 03:49.128
So then I just sat down 
and I looked at every day 


03:49.128 --> 03:51.130
and planned out which days 
I could go witnessing, 


03:51.130 --> 03:53.132
which days I had to go to school, 


03:53.132 --> 03:56.235
and also allocated time 
so that I could do my homework and study.


03:56.235 --> 03:58.003
Having a schedule 
was really good 


03:58.003 --> 04:00.005
because I could see it 
all out in front of me,


04:00.005 --> 04:02.008
and I could see 
that the hour requirement 


04:02.008 --> 04:04.876
was actually attainable, 
so that made it a lot less daunting.


04:04.877 --> 04:09.082
I first set short-term goals of pioneering 
in the special months of activity. 


04:09.082 --> 04:12.685
Then I was able 
to begin continuous auxiliary, 


04:12.685 --> 04:15.455
and then eventually 
I started regular pioneering.


04:15.455 --> 04:18.692
One of the best things I did 
to prepare myself for pioneering 


04:18.692 --> 04:20.794
was to auxiliary pioneer beforehand. 


04:20.793 --> 04:23.428
It really set me up 
to be able to overcome 


04:23.428 --> 04:26.465
any challenges 
that I faced while I was pioneering.


04:26.465 --> 04:29.102
I thought about Malachi 3:10. 


04:29.102 --> 04:31.104
I knew I trusted in Jehovah, 


04:31.103 --> 04:33.640
but this was my chance 
to test him out.


04:33.640 --> 04:36.275
I prayed, 
put my trust in Jehovah, 


04:36.275 --> 04:38.310
and put my application in.


04:38.310 --> 04:40.880
After my form 
was in for pioneering, 


04:40.880 --> 04:44.150
a brother, with time, 
a brother called me and offered me work.


04:44.150 --> 04:47.320
I had unemployment 
for three months, 


04:47.320 --> 04:50.590
which wasn’t a good time. 


04:50.590 --> 04:53.893
But during that time, 
I had Jehovah as my main focus. 


04:53.893 --> 04:57.230
And so he supported me, 
and he didn’t let me down.


04:57.230 --> 04:59.232
Asking brothers and sisters to come 


04:59.232 --> 05:01.300
and work with me, 
maybe on days that I knew 


05:01.300 --> 05:03.568
that I wouldn’t get as much support, 
really helped. 


05:03.568 --> 05:06.605
That helped me to organize 
my hours a little bit more, 


05:06.605 --> 05:09.875
and also I’d get to know 
my brothers and sisters more as well.


05:09.875 --> 05:13.680
One of the greatest joys of pioneering 
has been to pioneer with Mum. 


05:13.680 --> 05:16.248
And we had the privilege of going 


05:16.248 --> 05:18.951
to the pioneer school together, 
which was really special.


05:18.952 --> 05:21.989
Psalm 16:8 reminds me 


05:21.988 --> 05:25.056
that Jehovah is right beside me. 


05:25.057 --> 05:29.262
When I’m preaching, 
it’s like Jehovah is holding my hand.


05:29.262 --> 05:33.365
So with full-time service, 
I love making Jehovah happy. 


05:33.365 --> 05:37.103
With everything that he has given me, 
I’m finally able to give something back.


05:37.103 --> 05:38.971
Looking back
—pioneering—


05:38.972 --> 05:40.807
it was the best decision 
I’ve ever made. 


05:40.807 --> 05:42.842
It’s opened up 
so many different avenues 


05:42.842 --> 05:44.677
of service to Jehovah, 


05:44.677 --> 05:46.679
and it helped me also 
to have that real desire 


05:46.678 --> 05:49.181
to want to stay 
in full-time service.


05:49.182 --> 05:52.752
Helping someone 
on the road to everlasting life, 


05:52.752 --> 05:56.000
it’s the best feeling ever; 
and it’s really irreplaceable.


05:58.758 --> 06:01.160
The only thing I can say, 


06:01.160 --> 06:05.000
“As a young person, start pioneering!”


06:07.683 --> 06:11.000
What a fine attitude 
those young ones have! 


06:12.355 --> 06:17.693
They are clearly following 
in Jesus’ footsteps. 


06:17.693 --> 06:21.330
Jesus was the wisest man 


06:21.330 --> 06:23.332
who ever walked the earth. 


06:23.332 --> 06:26.369
He could’ve pursued any career 


06:26.368 --> 06:29.371
and truly excelled at it. 


06:29.372 --> 06:34.010
He could’ve been 
the greatest carpenter who ever lived. 


06:34.010 --> 06:36.012
Think about it, 


06:36.012 --> 06:39.915
he helped his Father 
build the physical universe. 


06:39.915 --> 06:44.187
Can you imagine 
what kind of houses he could’ve built? 


06:44.187 --> 06:48.825
Or what if he had pursued 
being an inventor? 


06:48.825 --> 06:51.293
With his perfect brain, 


06:51.293 --> 06:55.230
he probably could’ve invented 
the telephone, 


06:55.230 --> 06:57.600
automobile, or computer 


06:57.600 --> 06:59.702
in the first century. 


06:59.702 --> 07:02.839
Or what about becoming 
a businessman? 


07:02.838 --> 07:05.741
With perfect intelligence, 


07:05.742 --> 07:08.677
he likely could’ve come out on top 


07:08.677 --> 07:12.182
of every business transaction 
that he entered, 


07:12.182 --> 07:17.000
becoming the richest businessman 
who ever lived. 


07:18.020 --> 07:20.823
Or have you ever thought about 


07:20.823 --> 07:24.360
if he had pursued becoming 
an athlete? 


07:24.360 --> 07:27.430
And excelling in athletic contests 


07:27.430 --> 07:31.100
was a huge endeavor in Jesus’ day. 


07:31.100 --> 07:33.068
With a little training, 


07:33.068 --> 07:36.038
it is likely that his perfect body 


07:36.038 --> 07:39.708
would have outperformed all people 


07:39.708 --> 07:41.976
with imperfect bodies, 


07:41.977 --> 07:44.447
enabling him to become 


07:44.447 --> 07:48.250
the most famous athlete who ever lived. 


07:48.250 --> 07:50.520
Or one more example, 


07:50.520 --> 07:53.755
what if he had decided to become a doctor? 


07:53.755 --> 07:56.725
He could cure sick people


07:56.725 --> 08:00.028
—even raise the dead. 


08:00.028 --> 08:04.033
Can you imagine how much 
he could’ve charged rich people 


08:04.033 --> 08:07.670
to raise their dead loved ones? 


08:07.670 --> 08:11.107
But Jesus pursued none of these careers. 


08:11.107 --> 08:13.109
Why? 


08:13.108 --> 08:17.480
Because he knew 
that any of such endeavors 


08:17.480 --> 08:20.348
would have only very limited 


08:20.348 --> 08:23.251
and temporary benefits. 


08:23.252 --> 08:26.489
Instead, he pursued something 


08:26.488 --> 08:31.460
he knew would bring far-reaching 
and everlasting benefits: 


08:31.460 --> 08:34.000
the full-time ministry. 


08:35.330 --> 08:39.435
If this is how the wisest man 
who ever walked the earth—


08:39.435 --> 08:41.703
If this is how he reasoned, 


08:41.703 --> 08:46.000
we are wise if we strive to think 
the same way.


08:47.643 --> 08:50.445
That makes me think of the comments 


08:50.445 --> 08:53.548
of a well-adjusted teenage brother 


08:53.548 --> 08:57.486
whom we served 
while in the circuit work many years ago. 


08:57.487 --> 09:02.157
This young brother went straight into 
the regular pioneer work 


09:02.157 --> 09:04.160
out of high school, 


09:04.160 --> 09:07.830
and I asked him why he did so. 


09:07.830 --> 09:10.498
He explained that he knew 


09:10.498 --> 09:13.936
he could’ve gotten a full-time secular job 


09:13.937 --> 09:16.672
and bought a new car for himself, 


09:16.672 --> 09:21.544
but he reasoned that in a few years 


09:21.543 --> 09:26.081
that car would rust out and break down, 


09:26.082 --> 09:28.317
and he would have nothing. 


09:28.317 --> 09:32.389
But he knew that he could go 
into the pioneer work 


09:32.388 --> 09:35.725
and build a close relationship with Jehovah 


09:35.725 --> 09:39.328
and perhaps even find 
an honest-hearted person


09:39.328 --> 09:42.298
and be able to teach that one the truth. 


09:42.298 --> 09:47.570
And he knew that would last forever. 


09:47.570 --> 09:49.805
Now, that is some wise thinking 


09:49.805 --> 09:52.575
on the part of that young brother. 


09:52.575 --> 09:57.045
And today, that brother 
has a beautiful Christian wife 


09:57.045 --> 09:59.515
and several spiritual children, 


09:59.515 --> 10:03.000
and he is serving as a fine elder.


10:04.453 --> 10:08.056
But if you young ones 
are going to think this way 


10:08.057 --> 10:11.494
and continue to pursue spiritual goals, 


10:11.493 --> 10:16.098
it is vital that you wisely choose 


10:16.098 --> 10:18.400
your associates. 


10:18.400 --> 10:21.970
In a sense, our associates 


10:21.970 --> 10:25.440
can be likened to an elevator. 


10:25.440 --> 10:27.410
What do we mean? 


10:27.410 --> 10:30.112
Well, they can take you up 


10:30.112 --> 10:32.849
or they can take you down. 


10:32.848 --> 10:35.116
If you choose wisely, 


10:35.117 --> 10:37.420
they will take you up


10:37.420 --> 10:40.122
—elevate your good qualities 


10:40.122 --> 10:42.290
and make you a better person. 


10:42.290 --> 10:44.627
But if you choose poorly, 


10:44.627 --> 10:47.397
they will take you down. 


10:47.397 --> 10:50.867
Depending on how badly you choose, 


10:50.867 --> 10:53.169
they can take you way down


10:53.168 --> 10:55.336
—to the basement, 


10:55.337 --> 10:59.642
even the subbasement. 


10:59.642 --> 11:02.177
At Proverbs 13:20, 


11:02.177 --> 11:05.014
our loving heavenly Father, 


11:05.013 --> 11:08.583
who made us, 
explains how it works. 


11:08.583 --> 11:11.020
Jehovah tells us there: 


11:11.020 --> 11:14.790
“The one walking with the wise 


11:14.790 --> 11:17.560
“will become wise, 


11:17.560 --> 11:21.797
“but the one 
who has dealings with the stupid 


11:21.797 --> 11:24.000
will fare badly.”


11:25.100 --> 11:27.102
“Walking with” 


11:27.102 --> 11:29.472
and “having dealings with” 


11:29.472 --> 11:31.907
mean “associating with.” 


11:31.907 --> 11:35.110
And who are the “stupid” ones? 


11:35.110 --> 11:38.747
Well, this scripture contrasts 
such a person 


11:38.747 --> 11:40.984
with those who are wise. 


11:40.983 --> 11:44.920
It is not talking about someone 
who lacks mental intellect. 


11:44.920 --> 11:47.355
It is talking about someone 


11:47.355 --> 11:51.227
who does not make 
wise decisions spiritually 


11:51.227 --> 11:53.795
from Jehovah’s standpoint. 


11:53.795 --> 11:55.832
And if we think about it, 


11:55.832 --> 11:59.802
anyone who is not really serving Jehovah


11:59.802 --> 12:01.804
—at least right now—


12:01.803 --> 12:06.708
that one is unwise indeed. 


12:06.708 --> 12:10.746
And if we associate closely with such ones, 


12:10.747 --> 12:15.952
Jehovah says that we “will fare badly.” 


12:15.952 --> 12:18.287
We could use another illustration. 


12:18.287 --> 12:21.757
Think about someone who is physically sick 


12:21.757 --> 12:24.560
and is running a high fever. 


12:24.560 --> 12:28.230
If we spend a lot of time with that person, 


12:28.230 --> 12:32.133
we will probably catch the same sickness. 


12:32.133 --> 12:34.170
Or worse, 


12:34.170 --> 12:38.607
if we spend a lot of time 
near a dead body—a corpse—


12:38.607 --> 12:42.445
we will probably pick up a disease. 


12:42.445 --> 12:44.913
Well, it is similar 


12:44.913 --> 12:47.415
with spending time with a person 


12:47.415 --> 12:49.552
who is spiritually sick, 


12:49.552 --> 12:53.989
or worse, spiritually dead. 


12:53.988 --> 12:56.191
On the other hand, 


12:56.192 --> 12:59.662
if we choose as our associates 


12:59.662 --> 13:01.897
those who love Jehovah 


13:01.897 --> 13:06.969
and who are building 
their everlasting future with Jehovah, 


13:06.968 --> 13:09.000
we will benefit greatly. 


13:10.973 --> 13:15.945
Please observe carefully 
this variety of young ones 


13:15.945 --> 13:20.282
who are busy storing up 
treasures in heaven 


13:20.282 --> 13:23.000
with Jehovah.


15:16.765 --> 15:20.368
How heartwarming it is to us


15:20.368 --> 15:23.071
—and we know it is to Jehovah—


15:23.072 --> 15:26.342
to see these beautiful young people 


15:26.342 --> 15:29.712
doing what Jesus encourages  


15:29.712 --> 15:34.417
at Matthew 6:20, 21. 


15:34.417 --> 15:37.352
There, Jesus encourages: 


15:37.352 --> 15:42.590
“Store up for yourselves 
treasures in heaven,


15:42.590 --> 15:46.662
“where neither moth nor rust consumes, 


15:46.662 --> 15:51.000
“and where thieves do not break in and steal.


15:51.000 --> 15:53.768
“For where your treasure is, 


15:53.768 --> 15:57.000
there your heart will be also.”


15:58.107 --> 16:00.275
And if we think about it, 


16:00.275 --> 16:03.045
in the final analysis, 


16:03.045 --> 16:05.347
after all is said and done, 


16:05.347 --> 16:07.950
whether we are younger or older,


16:07.950 --> 16:11.187
our net worth will be 


16:11.187 --> 16:14.890
what we have stored up 
in heaven with Jehovah. 


16:14.890 --> 16:18.927
We will not be able to take 
material treasures with us 


16:18.927 --> 16:21.164
through the great tribulation. 


16:21.163 --> 16:23.231
And if we die, 


16:23.232 --> 16:27.469
we certainly will not be able to take 
material treasures with us, 


16:27.468 --> 16:30.605
but we can take spiritual treasures 


16:30.605 --> 16:33.775
with us through the great tribulation 


16:33.775 --> 16:37.713
and even through death and resurrection. 


16:37.713 --> 16:41.116
It is true with all of Jehovah’s people, 


16:41.117 --> 16:43.485
as it is with the anointed, 


16:43.485 --> 16:47.723
what is stated at Revelation 14:13. 


16:47.723 --> 16:49.758
It says there: 


16:49.758 --> 16:54.000
“The things they did go right with them.”


16:55.563 --> 16:58.033
And how encouraging it is 


16:58.033 --> 17:02.336
to see young ones getting baptized


17:02.337 --> 17:05.007
—publicly demonstrating 


17:05.007 --> 17:08.344
that they are giving their lives to Jehovah. 


17:08.343 --> 17:10.545
And we sincerely hope 


17:10.545 --> 17:13.815
that you young ones 
who are not yet baptized 


17:13.815 --> 17:17.118
will not hold back from getting baptized 


17:17.118 --> 17:20.155
as soon as you qualify. 


17:20.155 --> 17:22.725
The sooner you can get baptized, 


17:22.725 --> 17:27.395
the sooner you will receive 
greater protection 


17:27.395 --> 17:30.498
and blessings from Jehovah. 


17:30.498 --> 17:34.536
Not long ago, 
it made me very happy 


17:34.537 --> 17:37.439
to observe a little ten-year-old brother 


17:37.438 --> 17:40.441
get baptized!


17:40.442 --> 17:42.477
And young ones, 


17:42.477 --> 17:47.315
never be afraid to identify yourselves 


17:47.315 --> 17:50.485
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


17:50.485 --> 17:54.957
Never allow the fear 
of what others may think 


17:54.957 --> 17:58.027
to cause you to hesitate to do so. 


17:58.027 --> 18:00.029
Jehovah tells us 


18:00.028 --> 18:03.831
at Proverbs 29:25: 


18:03.832 --> 18:09.370
“Trembling at men is a snare, 


18:09.370 --> 18:12.140
“but the one trusting in Jehovah 


18:12.140 --> 18:15.977
will be protected.”


18:15.977 --> 18:19.080
Many years ago when I was in school, 


18:19.080 --> 18:23.985
I can remember being 
at times somewhat worried 


18:23.985 --> 18:28.657
about how my fellow classmates 
would view me. 


18:28.657 --> 18:31.427
But then a little while later, 


18:31.427 --> 18:33.462
I got out of school 


18:33.462 --> 18:36.632
and never ever again even saw 


18:36.632 --> 18:39.569
most of those former classmates. 


18:39.568 --> 18:42.470
Then it dawned on me 


18:42.470 --> 18:46.975
that it doesn’t really matter 
what people think about us. 


18:46.975 --> 18:49.812
It is Jehovah’s rating of us 


18:49.812 --> 18:52.214
that truly counts. 


18:52.213 --> 18:55.316
Humans cannot add 


18:55.317 --> 18:58.654
even five seconds to our lifespan, 


18:58.653 --> 19:01.823
but Jehovah can add 


19:01.823 --> 19:05.460
or subtract eternity. 


19:05.460 --> 19:09.998
And he alone 
can also give us true happiness. 


19:09.998 --> 19:14.201
And as Proverbs 29:25 indicates, 


19:14.202 --> 19:16.339
what a protection 


19:16.338 --> 19:21.176
it is to courageously identify ourselves 


19:21.177 --> 19:23.979
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


19:23.978 --> 19:26.481
fully trusting Jehovah 


19:26.482 --> 19:31.720
and taking our stand solidly with him. 


19:31.720 --> 19:36.558
Never be ashamed of who you are. 


19:36.558 --> 19:41.000
You are one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


19:43.132 --> 19:45.667
And please, dear young ones, 


19:45.667 --> 19:48.404
we warmly encourage you 


19:48.403 --> 19:51.000
to listen to those who love you. 


19:52.173 --> 19:54.910
Jehovah loves you very much; 


19:54.910 --> 19:58.113
the Governing Body loves you very much; 


19:58.113 --> 20:01.250
the elders love you very much; 


20:01.250 --> 20:04.887
your Christian parents love you very much. 


20:04.887 --> 20:08.424
And these ones will tell you the truth, 


20:08.423 --> 20:10.425
even though at times 


20:10.425 --> 20:13.095
it may not be what you want to hear. 


20:13.095 --> 20:16.432
They will not ‘tickle your ears,’ 


20:16.432 --> 20:19.234
perhaps like ones at school 


20:19.233 --> 20:21.270
or in the neighborhood 


20:21.270 --> 20:23.672
who don’t really love you 


20:23.672 --> 20:26.000
or have your best interests at heart. 


20:27.008 --> 20:29.978
But please believe those 


20:29.978 --> 20:32.513
who will tell you the truth 


20:32.513 --> 20:34.883
because they love you. 


20:34.883 --> 20:39.588
And never view 
Jehovah’s laws and principles 


20:39.588 --> 20:43.858
as depriving you of something good. 


20:43.858 --> 20:47.428
View them as protecting you 


20:47.428 --> 20:49.898
from what will hurt you. 


20:49.898 --> 20:52.000
If you recall, 


20:52.000 --> 20:54.568
Satan convinced Eve 


20:54.568 --> 20:57.871
that she was being deprived by Jehovah 


20:57.872 --> 21:00.000
and was missing out on something good. 


21:01.577 --> 21:05.447
Now, it is true that Eve 
was missing out on something. 


21:05.447 --> 21:09.584
But what was she really missing out on? 


21:09.583 --> 21:12.553
A tormented conscience, 


21:12.553 --> 21:15.390
her beautiful hair turning gray, 


21:15.390 --> 21:17.892
her teeth falling out, 


21:17.892 --> 21:22.697
her perfect skin wrinkling up like a prune, 


21:22.697 --> 21:26.602
being bent over from old age, 


21:26.602 --> 21:29.604
hobbling around on a cane, 


21:29.603 --> 21:32.000
and finally dying! 


21:33.642 --> 21:36.479
But Satan convinced her 


21:36.478 --> 21:39.848
that Jehovah was depriving her, 


21:39.848 --> 21:44.720
so foolishly she reached out to get 


21:44.720 --> 21:48.257
what she thought she was missing out on. 


21:48.257 --> 21:51.192
Well, Satan will try to use 


21:51.192 --> 21:54.295
the same kind of strategy on you, 


21:54.295 --> 21:59.000
but please don’t let him do it!


22:00.735 --> 22:05.000
This also makes me think 
of an experience a brother once related. 


22:06.273 --> 22:10.411
He said that he was visiting 
an animal observatory, 


22:10.412 --> 22:14.349
and a large lion lunged toward him 


22:14.348 --> 22:17.051
but was prevented from reaching him 


22:17.052 --> 22:19.789
by a thick glass pane 


22:19.788 --> 22:23.000
separating the animals from the observers. 


22:24.558 --> 22:27.695
As the lion stood on his hind legs, 


22:27.695 --> 22:30.232
clawing the glass 


22:30.232 --> 22:33.000
and baring his massive teeth, 


22:34.368 --> 22:37.971
the brother came to realize in a special way 


22:37.972 --> 22:42.000
the protective value of that barrier. 


22:43.212 --> 22:47.615
Previously, he said 
that he somewhat viewed the glass pane 


22:47.615 --> 22:49.852
as a restriction 


22:49.852 --> 22:52.587
because the smudges on it 


22:52.587 --> 22:55.690
partially blurred his view, 


22:55.690 --> 22:58.693
but now he viewed it 


22:58.693 --> 23:01.896
as a real protection. 


23:01.897 --> 23:03.899
Well, in a similar way, 


23:03.898 --> 23:07.401
Jehovah doesn’t want Satan, 


23:07.402 --> 23:12.174
who is described 
as ‘a roaring, devouring lion’ 


23:12.173 --> 23:14.175
at 1 Peter 5:8— 


23:14.175 --> 23:19.815
He doesn’t want him 
to gobble down you young ones. 


23:19.815 --> 23:22.517
And His laws and principles 


23:22.517 --> 23:25.000
are designed to keep that 
from happening to you. 


23:26.422 --> 23:30.325
So please listen to Jehovah. 


23:30.325 --> 23:39.485
He loves you!
