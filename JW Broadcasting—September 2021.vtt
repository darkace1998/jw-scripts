Welcome to this month’s edition

00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:07.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:10.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are a few highlights from our program.

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:13.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bill lived for music,

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:17.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it left him feeling
as if something was missing.

00:00:17.667 --> 00:00:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn what helped him
to have a truly meaningful life.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good friends are a blessing,

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:27.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially during hard times.

00:00:27.377 --> 00:00:28.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn how to build

00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:32.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strong friendships that endure.

00:00:32.048 --> 00:00:33.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new song

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds us of the many reasons

00:00:36.586 --> 00:00:38.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to be joyful.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will make you smile!

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:44.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting.

00:01:03.713 --> 00:01:08.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt every one of us
at one time or another

00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:11.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has faced a discouraging situation.

00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:15.158 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Really, no one is immune

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:17.026 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from discouragement.

00:01:17.026 --> 00:01:18.595 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This feeling may last

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:21.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a day or two and then subside,

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:24.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or it might last longer.

00:01:24.634 --> 00:01:28.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can cause us to be discouraged?

00:01:28.772 --> 00:01:32.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Watch Tower Publications Index </i>

00:01:32.408 --> 00:01:35.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lists over 20 factors

00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:38.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can contribute to discouragement.

00:01:38.047 --> 00:01:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are these:

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
another’s conduct

00:01:41.684 --> 00:01:43.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what someone did or didn’t do

00:01:43.453 --> 00:01:45.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that disappointed us;

00:01:45.522 --> 00:01:48.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
problems in our congregation;

00:01:48.224 --> 00:01:50.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feeling inadequate;

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our own personal failures

00:01:52.862 --> 00:01:55.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what we’ve done or failed to do;

00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:58.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
health problems; and loss of privileges.

00:01:59.302 --> 00:02:02.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are ever so many things

00:02:02.305 --> 00:02:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can cause us to be downhearted.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even the fact that we are discouraged
can be discouraging.

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:15.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel guilty for being discouraged.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the good news.

00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re in good company.

00:02:20.256 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some very prominent
and faithful servants of Jehovah

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned in the Bible have been discouraged.

00:02:29.165 --> 00:02:32.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses became so discouraged

00:02:32.135 --> 00:02:34.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the complaints of the Israelites

00:02:34.304 --> 00:02:38.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he said to God:
“Please kill me right now.”

00:02:39.175 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rebekah was so distressed

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:45.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because her son Esau married pagan women

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:47.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she told her husband, Isaac:

00:02:47.517 --> 00:02:50.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am disgusted with my life.”

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:54.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, family situations

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:56.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can cause discouragement.

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:01.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was tormented by his sins.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:05.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 51:3, he wrote:

00:03:05.068 --> 00:03:09.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am well-aware of my transgressions,

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my sin is always before me.”

00:03:14.544 --> 00:03:17.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our mistakes can weigh us down.

00:03:19.015 --> 00:03:21.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah felt so discouraged

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:26.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the opposition, ridicule,
and apathy he met up with

00:03:26.222 --> 00:03:28.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he told himself:

00:03:28.224 --> 00:03:31.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am not going to make mention of [Jehovah],

00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will speak no more in his name.”

00:03:34.931 --> 00:03:39.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, poor results in the ministry
can discourage us.

00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:44.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul frankly admitted

00:03:44.307 --> 00:03:47.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 7:24, 25

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he struggled against sinful tendencies.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times,
he felt miserable over this conflict.

00:03:55.985 --> 00:03:59.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Miserable man that I am!

00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:04.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who will rescue me
from the body undergoing this death?”

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:08.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithful men and women

00:04:08.298 --> 00:04:13.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
faced discouraging circumstances in the past,

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so do we.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:20.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discouragement is a part of life
in this system.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should expect it.

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:25.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, it’s important to consider

00:04:25.481 --> 00:04:28.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we view discouragement.

00:04:29.485 --> 00:04:33.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we view ourselves
as helpless victims of discouragement

00:04:33.723 --> 00:04:36.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let ourselves sink into a quagmire

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of despair and self-pity,

00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:43.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or do we view discouragement
as an enemy

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:45.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must fight against?

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We easily recognize that feelings of pride,

00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:55.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
selfishness, envy,
and such things are enemies.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:57.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We battle against these bad feelings.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want them to erode our faith

00:05:00.183 --> 00:05:03.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or gain a foothold in our personality.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, sometimes we may yield all too willingly

00:05:08.825 --> 00:05:10.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discouragement.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is this dangerous?

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:18.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me Proverbs 24:10:

00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you become discouraged

00:05:21.704 --> 00:05:23.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the day of distress,

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your strength will be meager.”

00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:32.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you note the reason why
we must fight discouragement?

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:36.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Proverbs 24:10
tells us will happen

00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we allow a “day of distress”
to discourage us?

00:05:42.191 --> 00:05:44.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll lose our strength.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, discouragement can drain us

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our spiritual, mental, emotional,
and even physical strength.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what can happen if we lose our strength?

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:01.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can lose our enthusiasm for the truth.

00:06:01.344 --> 00:06:06.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may lose interest in prayer
or in personal study.

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:10.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could slack off in attending meetings.

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:13.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could develop coldness
toward our brothers.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our zeal for evangelizing can weaken.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may even want to give up.

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:25.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want any of those things
to happen to us, do we, brothers?

00:06:27.236 --> 00:06:32.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How, then, do we fight
and defeat discouragement?

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:38.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Discouragement is a feeling, an emotion.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:41.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What causes feelings or emotions?

00:06:43.186 --> 00:06:48.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An article entitled “Negative Emotions
—Can You Overcome Them?”

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was published
in the October 8, 1992, <i>Awake!</i>

00:06:54.597 --> 00:06:59.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This article didn’t discuss
serious cases of depression

00:06:59.168 --> 00:07:02.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may have a medical or physical cause,

00:07:02.205 --> 00:07:04.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as a disease,

00:07:04.307 --> 00:07:07.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a reaction to toxins, medications,

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:09.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nutritional deficiencies,

00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:12.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allergens, hormonal problems,

00:07:12.882 --> 00:07:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bipolar disorder.

00:07:15.885 --> 00:07:18.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it discussed how to overcome

00:07:18.754 --> 00:07:20.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moments of discouragement

00:07:20.923 --> 00:07:24.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the temporary “day of distress”

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned at Proverbs 24:10.

00:07:28.197 --> 00:07:32.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the subheading
“We Can Control Our Thinking,”

00:07:32.568 --> 00:07:35.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it stated this:

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:39.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many who work in the field of mental health

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:41.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“maintain that our feelings

00:07:41.744 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are caused by our thoughts.”

00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:49.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said
that ‘you cannot experience a feeling

00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:54.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without first experiencing a thought.’

00:07:54.457 --> 00:07:58.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, feeling discouraged

00:07:58.094 --> 00:08:00.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t always the situation that we face

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the negative thoughts
that we have about the situation.

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:10.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first step, then,
in fighting discouragement

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:13.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to identify the negative thoughts.

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we say
that we have a “train of thought.”

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:23.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means we have a series of thoughts

00:08:23.019 --> 00:08:28.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that lead to a certain conclusion,
or destination, if you will.

00:08:28.024 --> 00:08:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, imagine yourself

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:35.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting on a literal railroad
or subway train.

00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:38.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon you realize
that you’re on the wrong train.

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:42.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s taking you to a place
you do not want to go to.

00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you do?

00:08:43.573 --> 00:08:47.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you stay on the train
all the way to the wrong destination?

00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:50.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course not.

00:08:50.213 --> 00:08:55.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you get off that train
at the very next station.

00:08:55.017 --> 00:08:57.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what do you do next?

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:01.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You switch to the right train.

00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, figuratively speaking,

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:07.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you realize
that your mind is getting on

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:11.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a train of negative thoughts
that are leading to discouragement,

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can you get off that train?

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:14.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:18.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you need to switch
to the right train of thought

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:22.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will lead you
to a peaceful state of mind.

00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:24.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the key.

00:09:25.414 --> 00:09:28.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to replace negative thoughts

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:32.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with positive, upbuilding,
spiritual thoughts.

00:09:33.789 --> 00:09:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keeping our thinking on the right track

00:09:37.026 --> 00:09:39.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an ongoing process.

00:09:39.395 --> 00:09:42.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how the apostle Paul put it

00:09:42.431 --> 00:09:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Ephesians 4:23:

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:50.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:09:50.406 --> 00:09:54.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:09:55.077 --> 00:10:00.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you see how Paul confirms
that we are in control?

00:10:00.082 --> 00:10:03.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can change how we think.

00:10:03.252 --> 00:10:05.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because we’re imperfect,

00:10:05.354 --> 00:10:09.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to make these changes continuously.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:11.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a losing battle.

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:15.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us powerful weapons

00:10:15.064 --> 00:10:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us make our minds
move in the right direction

00:10:17.967 --> 00:10:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his powerful Word,

00:10:19.702 --> 00:10:22.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his mighty holy spirit,

00:10:22.505 --> 00:10:24.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power of prayer,

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and healthful spiritual food
from his organization.

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:33.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some negative thoughts

00:10:33.382 --> 00:10:36.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may lead to discouragement.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:40.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we’ll consider
upbuilding, positive thoughts

00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:42.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help us fight discouragement.

00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:46.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had a bad day.

00:10:46.262 --> 00:10:50.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said or did the wrong thing,
and you regret it.

00:10:50.766 --> 00:10:54.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s become a “day of distress.”

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:59.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought enters your mind,
‘I’m worthless.’

00:10:59.308 --> 00:11:02.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the “discouragement train.”

00:11:02.678 --> 00:11:06.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you continue to stay
on this train of thought,

00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking you to the state of discouragement?

00:11:09.952 --> 00:11:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, you have a choice.

00:11:13.389 --> 00:11:15.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can reject it.

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:18.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of giving in
to that negative thought,

00:11:18.661 --> 00:11:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you could say to yourself:

00:11:20.663 --> 00:11:24.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Wait a minute. Stop!

00:11:24.133 --> 00:11:25.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That’s not right.

00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:28.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Just because I made a mistake

00:11:28.003 --> 00:11:31.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘does not make me worthless
in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:11:31.807 --> 00:11:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s told us that he knows
that “we are dust”

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:38.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and that he’s merciful.

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And Jesus said that “not one sparrow

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:46.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that has fallen to the ground
is forgotten by God,”

00:11:46.088 --> 00:11:50.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and that “[we] are worth more
than many sparrows.”

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:55.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Yes, Jehovah views me as precious.

00:11:55.965 --> 00:11:58.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll pray about this,

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:03.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and I’m sure he’ll help me
not to make that mistake again.

00:12:03.005 --> 00:12:06.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Tomorrow will be a better day.

00:12:06.308 --> 00:12:08.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah.’

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a second example.

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:18.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A brother has said something
quite unkind to you.

00:12:18.387 --> 00:12:22.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has become a “day of distress.”

00:12:22.525 --> 00:12:24.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thought comes to your mind:

00:12:24.593 --> 00:12:27.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can a brother behave like that

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:30.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and still be in good standing?

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:34.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s not a good example.

00:12:34.003 --> 00:12:37.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t the elders do something about it?’

00:12:37.473 --> 00:12:41.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s discouragement speaking,

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calling for us to “get on board.”

00:12:44.013 --> 00:12:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we stay on that negative train of thought,

00:12:47.116 --> 00:12:51.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could lose our spiritual strength.

00:12:51.053 --> 00:12:55.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we still have a choice.

00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:58.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will we replace those negative thoughts

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:00.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with positive ones?

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:04.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could get our mind on a positive track

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by saying to ourselves something like this:

00:13:08.671 --> 00:13:13.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, that was an unkind thing
for him to say.

00:13:13.676 --> 00:13:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘This is not like him.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:20.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe my brother just had a bad day.

00:13:20.483 --> 00:13:23.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s as imperfect as I am.

00:13:23.319 --> 00:13:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve said unkind things too, at times,

00:13:27.256 --> 00:13:29.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘and have regretted it.

00:13:29.291 --> 00:13:32.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s probably feeling the same way.

00:13:32.528 --> 00:13:36.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I remember Colossians 3:13 says

00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:40.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that we must “continue putting up
with one another

00:13:40.135 --> 00:13:43.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“and forgiving one another freely

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:47.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“even if anyone has
a cause for complaint

00:13:47.676 --> 00:13:49.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:13:49.678 --> 00:13:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, he has given me a cause for complaint.

00:13:55.751 --> 00:14:00.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But it says Jehovah
has “freely [forgiven us].”

00:14:01.657 --> 00:14:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He has certainly forgiven me
countless times.

00:14:05.961 --> 00:14:09.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No, I am not going to allow this

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:14.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

‘And I’ll pray for myself

00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:22.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

in my heart.’

00:14:25.247 --> 00:14:28.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a third example.

00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After years of hard work
at your place of employment,

00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:34.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your position has been terminated.

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:36.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve lost your job.

00:14:36.992 --> 00:14:39.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a “day of distress.”

00:14:39.261 --> 00:14:42.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re filled
with anxious, negative thoughts:

00:14:42.631 --> 00:14:45.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How will I care for my family?

‘What will the future bring?

00:14:47.703 --> 00:14:52.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jehovah allow this to happen to me?’

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:59.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where will this train
of dark, negative thoughts lead you?

00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Certainly, discouragement will set in,

00:15:02.952 --> 00:15:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will become
spiritually weak and exhausted.

00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:11.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You still have a choice.

00:15:11.126 --> 00:15:13.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can replace those negative thoughts

00:15:13.963 --> 00:15:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with thoughts such as these:

00:15:15.965 --> 00:15:18.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘OK, I’ve lost my job.

00:15:18.634 --> 00:15:20.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What should I do?

make the right decisions.’

00:16:03.879 --> 00:16:06.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, we’re living

in the last days of this system of things.

00:16:09.485 --> 00:16:13.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll have our days of distress.

00:16:13.255 --> 00:16:16.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes these come
because of our own imperfection

00:16:16.825 --> 00:16:19.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the imperfection of others.

00:16:19.862 --> 00:16:21.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we also realize

00:16:21.997 --> 00:16:26.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Devil wants to discourage us.

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:30.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 12:17 tells us

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:32.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Satan’s great anger is directed

00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:36.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward those
“who observe the commandments of God

00:16:36.912 --> 00:16:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the work
of bearing witness concerning Jesus.”

00:16:41.917 --> 00:16:44.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil will try to take advantage

00:16:44.987 --> 00:16:48.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of situations and problems that we face

00:16:48.524 --> 00:16:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fill us with discouraging thoughts
and drain us of our strength.

00:16:55.164 --> 00:17:00.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we stand
at the very threshold of the new world.

00:17:00.169 --> 00:17:03.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s fight discouragement

00:17:03.172 --> 00:17:06.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the weapons Jehovah gives us.

00:17:06.308 --> 00:17:08.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to study God’s Word,

00:17:08.911 --> 00:17:12.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making it a part of your daily life.

00:17:12.247 --> 00:17:17.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray incessantly to Jehovah
for his powerful spirit.

00:17:17.252 --> 00:17:20.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep close to his organization.

00:17:21.557 --> 00:17:25.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has promised to give us the victory.

00:17:25.394 --> 00:17:29.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fearlessly, we join in repeating Paul’s words

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:33.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:13:

00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:38.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For all things I have the strength

00:17:38.073 --> 00:17:41.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the one who gives me power.”

00:17:42.511 --> 00:17:44.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our first video

00:17:44.546 --> 00:17:47.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the experience of Aino Ehtmaa.

00:17:47.883 --> 00:17:49.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll see,

00:17:49.918 --> 00:17:53.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she endured many “days of distress”

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:55.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for being one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:57.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what she did

00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:01.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain faithful and joyful.

00:18:04.967 --> 00:18:09.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was young,
my father wrote to me the Bible verse:

00:18:09.037 --> 00:18:13.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your word is a lamp to my foot,
and a light for my path.”

00:18:14.209 --> 00:18:18.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said: “Keep that always in mind.

00:18:18.147 --> 00:18:21.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember God’s Word and live by it.”

00:18:25.654 --> 00:18:27.890 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was born in 1929

00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the city of Võru, Estonia.

00:18:30.759 --> 00:18:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family was religious,
and my God-fearing parents

00:18:34.163 --> 00:18:38.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lovingly cared for me and provided everything
that a child would need.

00:18:40.769 --> 00:18:44.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my father learned the truth,
he gave each of us a Bible,

00:18:44.506 --> 00:18:47.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we began to study it together.

00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:55.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father was arrested in the summer of 1948.

00:18:55.184 --> 00:18:58.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Estonia was then under the Soviet regime,

00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:01.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he was still working as a schoolteacher.

00:19:01.456 --> 00:19:05.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The local Department of Education
asked him to come by.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:07.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He went dressed in summer clothes

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wearing sandals,
but he never came back.

00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:23.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At midnight, we heard someone
banging at the door.

00:19:23.245 --> 00:19:26.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We opened it, and soldiers came in

00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:29.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and demanded our passports.

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:33.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We put the passports on the table,
and they just said,

00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:36.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are under arrest.”

00:19:41.129 --> 00:19:46.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pagari Prison in Tallinn
was a place everyone was afraid of,

00:19:46.001 --> 00:19:48.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was afraid too.

00:19:48.637 --> 00:19:50.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that I was taken down the steps

00:19:50.906 --> 00:19:54.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the basement to a long corridor.

00:19:54.643 --> 00:19:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was nothing in the cell
besides a bench.

00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:03.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They slammed the door shut,

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:07.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is when I became a little scared.

00:20:07.022 --> 00:20:10.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I prayed to Jehovah to help me,

00:20:10.826 --> 00:20:13.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a sense of peace came over me.

00:20:13.695 --> 00:20:17.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I laid down on the bench and fell asleep.

00:20:22.304 --> 00:20:25.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was given a ten-year prison sentence

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:29.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an enemy of the State.

00:20:33.282 --> 00:20:37.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A year later, we were transferred
to Russian prison camps.

00:20:38.954 --> 00:20:41.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Spiritual food was hard to get.

00:20:41.356 --> 00:20:44.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It couldn’t be sent by mail.

00:20:44.726 --> 00:20:48.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the angels somehow still provided for us,

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we always had something.

00:20:52.334 --> 00:20:54.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even a single verse

00:20:54.369 --> 00:20:58.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a good thought can help in prison.

00:20:58.206 --> 00:21:02.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In any case, God’s Word
should be in our heart.

00:21:02.244 --> 00:21:04.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should never forget it,

00:21:04.346 --> 00:21:08.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we can only remember one verse.

00:21:13.388 --> 00:21:16.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one point during my sentence,
I was allowed

00:21:16.224 --> 00:21:18.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live outside the prison camp.

00:21:19.561 --> 00:21:21.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Witness family took

00:21:21.563 --> 00:21:24.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
me and two other sisters into their home.

00:21:26.568 --> 00:21:30.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living outside meant that the guard
was not watching us all the time.

00:21:30.839 --> 00:21:35.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to spend time together,
and we could preach a little.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:38.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We even went from house to house.

00:21:39.781 --> 00:21:42.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually, I moved to a dormitory

00:21:42.784 --> 00:21:45.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there was not enough space.

00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:52.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it also meant that the literature
could be stored at my place,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if they arrested me,
it wouldn’t be a big deal,

00:21:55.530 --> 00:22:00.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but if the brother was arrested,
it would be much worse.

00:22:04.039 --> 00:22:07.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They raided my place one night.

00:22:07.142 --> 00:22:09.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They put all the literature on the table

00:22:09.578 --> 00:22:11.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked me where I got it.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “The angels are bringing it to us

00:22:14.449 --> 00:22:17.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feeding us all the time.”

00:22:17.652 --> 00:22:21.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I was sentenced to another two years

00:22:21.623 --> 00:22:24.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for possessing literature.

00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:27.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, for the first time,

00:22:27.562 --> 00:22:30.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard that Jehovah’s Witnesses
were officially banned.

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:32.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a good feeling it was

00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:35.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be recognized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:22:35.971 --> 00:22:38.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That really gave me joy.

00:22:41.343 --> 00:22:45.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw Jehovah’s help
in that things were never too hard

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for me to bear.

00:22:47.182 --> 00:22:49.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If things were getting too difficult,

00:22:49.251 --> 00:22:53.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something would always change
so that I could cope.

00:22:53.588 --> 00:22:57.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was always that feeling
that someone was looking after me.

00:22:57.092 --> 00:23:00.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never felt alone or abandoned.

00:23:03.131 --> 00:23:06.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If only we could be faithful all the time,

00:23:06.501 --> 00:23:08.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we would also be happy.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes we fail, and so we lose joy.

00:23:13.608 --> 00:23:16.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Faithfulness gives joy.

00:23:17.512 --> 00:23:22.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In prison, you can stay faithful
if you don’t leave Jehovah

00:23:22.184 --> 00:23:24.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you don’t forget to pray

00:23:24.553 --> 00:23:28.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you always remember why you are there.

00:23:28.323 --> 00:23:32.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are there because you are
on Jehovah’s side.

00:23:32.127 --> 00:23:36.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not a thief; I was not a killer.

00:23:36.164 --> 00:23:38.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:23:38.867 --> 00:23:42.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is worth being in prison for.

00:23:47.442 --> 00:23:51.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re enduring persecution
or any sort of trial,

00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:56.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll want to remember
what helped Sister Ehtmaa.

00:23:56.084 --> 00:23:58.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She kept herself spiritually nourished

00:23:58.987 --> 00:24:01.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when literature was scarce;

00:24:01.756 --> 00:24:05.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she cherished God’s Word, the Bible;

00:24:05.227 --> 00:24:10.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she fought discouragement
and anxiety with prayer;

00:24:10.232 --> 00:24:13.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she stayed close to fellow believers

00:24:13.635 --> 00:24:17.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something we all need to do.

00:24:17.506 --> 00:24:21.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strengthening relationships
with our brothers and sisters

00:24:21.476 --> 00:24:23.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is especially important

00:24:23.845 --> 00:24:27.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we move deeper into the last days.

00:24:27.916 --> 00:24:30.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our next segment from our series

<i>Lessons From The Watchtower,</i>

00:24:33.088 --> 00:24:37.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll learn how to build strong friendships.

00:24:51.339 --> 00:24:53.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friends give me help

00:24:53.341 --> 00:24:55.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I need them the most.

00:24:55.777 --> 00:24:58.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They make me laugh; they give me

00:24:58.246 --> 00:25:01.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
practical assistance whenever I need them.

00:25:01.683 --> 00:25:04.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re just a real source of joy in my life.

00:25:04.819 --> 00:25:07.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I see my dear friends

00:25:07.455 --> 00:25:09.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
going through difficult times

00:25:09.457 --> 00:25:11.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still serving Jehovah

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that really encourages me with my trials.

00:25:14.796 --> 00:25:17.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendship—it just enhances

00:25:17.032 --> 00:25:19.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enriches a person’s life.

00:25:19.234 --> 00:25:23.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think that friendship is

00:25:23.471 --> 00:25:25.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that I find too natural.

00:25:25.540 --> 00:25:28.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m shy by nature; I’m hesitant by nature;

00:25:28.376 --> 00:25:31.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel inadequate by nature.

00:25:32.113 --> 00:25:36.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my mind, Baruch was simply
Jeremiah’s secretary.

00:25:37.586 --> 00:25:40.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never considered
that after spending so much time together,

00:25:40.522 --> 00:25:43.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would have allowed them
to draw closer as friends.

00:25:44.626 --> 00:25:48.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I studied the article
about Jeremiah and Baruch,

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:52.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it made me reflect
on friendships that I have.

00:25:52.334 --> 00:25:55.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you work together for Jehovah,

00:25:55.103 --> 00:25:57.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it takes your friendship to another level.

00:25:57.939 --> 00:26:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people will have

00:26:00.242 --> 00:26:02.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a depth and a dimension to their friendships

00:26:02.777 --> 00:26:07.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will not be shared
by those who are not serving Jehovah.

00:26:08.850 --> 00:26:12.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the article, I really loved
the point about communication.

00:26:12.787 --> 00:26:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being open with others

00:26:15.090 --> 00:26:17.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
allows them to be open with you,

00:26:17.459 --> 00:26:19.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that just allows

00:26:19.261 --> 00:26:21.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a friendship to flourish.

00:26:22.831 --> 00:26:26.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can have a very bad view of myself.

00:26:26.735 --> 00:26:29.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appreciated the reminder

00:26:29.738 --> 00:26:34.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you will see the bad side of any friend
—that’s just normal.

00:26:34.509 --> 00:26:38.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But good friends
remind you of your good side.

00:26:38.013 --> 00:26:41.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is like Jehovah talking and reminding me

00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:43.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much I’m loved by him.

00:26:45.453 --> 00:26:47.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d heard that Keith, an older brother,

00:26:47.422 --> 00:26:51.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was returning to Britain
for some medical treatment.

00:26:51.293 --> 00:26:54.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was much loved—deeply respected.

00:26:54.829 --> 00:26:57.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You try to picture, to imagine

00:26:57.365 --> 00:26:59.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s going through his mind

00:26:59.334 --> 00:27:01.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—his fears and anxieties.

00:27:01.636 --> 00:27:04.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt very inadequate, but I realized

00:27:04.172 --> 00:27:08.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it would be the loving
and kind thing to do to speak to him.

00:27:08.743 --> 00:27:11.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we spent some time together; we talked.

00:27:11.479 --> 00:27:14.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt honored just to say a prayer
with someone like that.

00:27:15.583 --> 00:27:19.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really touched by Keith’s response.

00:27:19.321 --> 00:27:21.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He clearly and deeply appreciated that,

00:27:21.556 --> 00:27:25.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt thrilled to have done
just a little something

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped and supported him.

00:27:29.431 --> 00:27:31.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve worked with someone

00:27:31.433 --> 00:27:36.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I never expected
to become very close to.

00:27:36.271 --> 00:27:39.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charlotte
—she’s the opposite of me,

00:27:39.941 --> 00:27:42.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I came to realize quite early on

00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:45.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she’s an amazing listener.

00:27:46.715 --> 00:27:48.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Charlotte is more than a friend

00:27:48.817 --> 00:27:51.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—she’s now family.

00:27:53.054 --> 00:27:56.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love my family very, very much.

00:27:56.057 --> 00:27:59.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the moment, I’m the only one in my family

00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:01.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:28:02.764 --> 00:28:06.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’ve never felt that I was truly alone.

00:28:06.234 --> 00:28:09.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has always provided brothers,

00:28:09.137 --> 00:28:12.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sisters, mothers (you know), uncles, aunties.

00:28:12.307 --> 00:28:14.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s always given me everyone that I needed.

00:28:15.477 --> 00:28:18.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel that I’ve had a lesson
powerfully reinforced

00:28:18.413 --> 00:28:21.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the blessings of genuine friendship.

00:28:21.883 --> 00:28:23.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we make an effort

00:28:23.585 --> 00:28:25.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to give Jehovah a little something,

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he can add his blessing.

00:28:28.256 --> 00:28:31.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In my experience, the person you don’t expect

00:28:31.993 --> 00:28:33.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
actually turns out to be

00:28:33.995 --> 00:28:36.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very special friend.

00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:38.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you work
with different brothers and sisters,

00:28:38.767 --> 00:28:41.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you really appreciate
that they are gifts from Jehovah.

00:28:41.903 --> 00:28:45.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will give all of you into our hand.”

00:28:46.908 --> 00:28:50.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working hard for Jehovah and being genuine

00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:53.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that will attract
other brothers and sisters.

00:28:53.548 --> 00:28:57.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will never forget the friendships
that we make right now.

00:28:57.652 --> 00:29:02.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will use those friendships
to help us through the great tribulation.

00:29:18.773 --> 00:29:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those helpful suggestions

00:29:20.809 --> 00:29:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appeared in the November 2019 issue
of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:29.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That article emphasized the importance

00:29:29.250 --> 00:29:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of forging strong friendships now,

00:29:32.821 --> 00:29:36.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the end of this system comes.

00:29:36.057 --> 00:29:38.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the great tribulation,

00:29:38.293 --> 00:29:41.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s enemies may try to disrupt our unity.

00:29:41.796 --> 00:29:44.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can be confident

00:29:44.132 --> 00:29:48.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that nothing will break our bonds of love.

00:29:48.436 --> 00:29:50.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our friendships will last

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:55.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only through the end of this system
but for all eternity.

00:29:57.579 --> 00:30:02.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many years, we’ve published
the life stories of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:30:02.584 --> 00:30:04.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever wondered:

00:30:04.786 --> 00:30:08.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What happened since their stories appeared?

00:30:08.723 --> 00:30:10.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are they today?’

00:30:10.959 --> 00:30:13.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re pleased to introduce

00:30:13.828 --> 00:30:18.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new series: <i>Where Are They Now? </i>

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our first episode,
we’ll hear from Bill Mullane.

00:30:23.438 --> 00:30:26.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His story appeared
in the <i>Awake!</i>  magazine

00:30:26.174 --> 00:30:29.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some 35 years ago.

00:30:29.143 --> 00:30:33.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, Bill had made a major decision

00:30:33.214 --> 00:30:35.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would affect the course of his life.

00:30:35.917 --> 00:30:37.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has it turned out?

00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see.

00:31:01.009 --> 00:31:03.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Music expresses things

00:31:03.444 --> 00:31:05.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you can’t express in any other way.

00:31:09.417 --> 00:31:11.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is so powerful.

00:31:18.526 --> 00:31:21.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just an amazing gift.

00:31:22.931 --> 00:31:26.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before I got the truth, I lived for music.

00:31:26.234 --> 00:31:29.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I played hard and heavy rock and roll

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:33.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in bars and clubs
around the New York City area for many years.

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:36.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To me, I just found it to be
a very depressing atmosphere.

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:40.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I developed
a love for classical music,

00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:44.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I would practice six hours a day.

00:31:44.218 --> 00:31:46.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I applied to The Juilliard School
for the performing arts.

00:31:46.888 --> 00:31:47.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was accepted,

00:31:47.789 --> 00:31:49.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I did not attend.

00:31:50.124 --> 00:31:52.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Deep inside something was missing.

00:31:55.964 --> 00:32:00.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My life changed drastically
on February 16, 1973,

00:32:00.268 --> 00:32:03.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s
when I learned the truth in a taxicab.

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:15.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to Bethel on February 16, 1979.

00:32:17.752 --> 00:32:19.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I first came to Bethel,

00:32:19.721 --> 00:32:21.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to put music aside for a little bit.

00:32:21.756 --> 00:32:23.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started working in the pressroom,

00:32:23.491 --> 00:32:26.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that was
a completely different environment for me.

00:32:26.361 --> 00:32:28.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also worked with landscaping.

00:32:28.763 --> 00:32:30.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked in construction over at Wallkill,

00:32:30.965 --> 00:32:33.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I also worked
with drafting and engineering.

00:32:33.868 --> 00:32:36.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These were things I was not good at,

00:32:36.004 --> 00:32:38.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I really felt I learned so much

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from doing these things
that it really kind of groomed me.

00:32:41.709 --> 00:32:43.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think that when Jehovah looked at me,

00:32:43.845 --> 00:32:46.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said, ‘Well, we got somebody
we have to work with here.’

00:32:49.651 --> 00:32:52.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as you tune your instrument
so it can be played in tune,

00:32:52.887 --> 00:32:54.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tunes you.

00:32:54.522 --> 00:32:57.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He teaches us to keep things in their place

00:32:57.325 --> 00:33:00.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put worship of him first
because that’s where it’s proper.

00:33:00.061 --> 00:33:03.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah became number one,
everything else took its place.

00:33:04.732 --> 00:33:09.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back in 1981, I met my wife
when I was playing music at a wedding.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We fell in love with each other.

00:33:13.141 --> 00:33:15.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our love for Jehovah
grows through the years,

00:33:15.176 --> 00:33:17.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our love for our mates grows.

00:33:17.378 --> 00:33:21.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I didn’t leave music completely,
because I still had a love for it;

00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:25.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still practiced as much as I could
within my Bethel schedule

00:33:25.753 --> 00:33:28.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and within my whole theocratic schedule.

00:33:28.356 --> 00:33:30.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t miss it being number one.

00:33:30.158 --> 00:33:32.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just feel happier now
that it’s in its proper place.

00:33:33.861 --> 00:33:37.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1995, when I first came over to Patterson,

00:33:37.031 --> 00:33:39.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was working with Audio/Video Services.

00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since 2016,

00:33:41.436 --> 00:33:43.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been working with music
—working as a music editor

00:33:43.604 --> 00:33:45.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as a music composer.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:48.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Working with brothers on a piece of music

00:33:48.342 --> 00:33:50.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a real blessing and a privilege.

00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:54.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is letting us take advantage
of a tool that we all like to listen to

00:33:54.048 --> 00:33:56.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now using it in a way that praises him.

00:33:58.953 --> 00:34:01.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our whole motive is not to earn money.

00:34:01.422 --> 00:34:03.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our whole motive in using music

00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:05.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to glorify our heavenly Father, Jehovah.

00:34:05.927 --> 00:34:09.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we get music from all different cultures.

00:34:09.197 --> 00:34:11.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really unites Jehovah’s people.

00:34:13.801 --> 00:34:18.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Music—it has a very special power
in being able to reach the heart.

00:34:18.106 --> 00:34:19.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there are times
when we just sit around

00:34:19.974 --> 00:34:22.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just jam and play,

00:34:22.043 --> 00:34:24.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re really talking
and communicating with each other.

00:34:24.779 --> 00:34:26.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing like it.

00:34:26.781 --> 00:34:29.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m happier now

00:34:29.751 --> 00:34:32.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that I’ve lived a clean life.

00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do I have any regrets?

00:34:41.395 --> 00:34:44.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have no regrets.

00:34:44.632 --> 00:34:48.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I did when I was 22 years old

00:34:48.136 --> 00:34:50.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best thing that ever happened to me

00:34:50.138 --> 00:34:52.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s how I came to know Jehovah

00:34:52.140 --> 00:34:54.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s how I was able
to find a balance in my life.

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:59.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our happiness doesn’t depend on our job.

00:34:59.347 --> 00:35:02.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our happiness really depends
upon our spirituality

00:35:02.583 --> 00:35:04.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our relationship with Jehovah.

00:35:11.492 --> 00:35:13.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what life is all about.

00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:20.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a wonderful life.

00:35:33.514 --> 00:35:38.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bill has no regrets
about the life he’s chosen to live.

00:35:38.152 --> 00:35:42.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By putting his love for Jehovah
ahead of his love for music,

00:35:42.023 --> 00:35:44.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gained many spiritual privileges

00:35:44.792 --> 00:35:48.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a happy, meaningful life.

00:35:48.429 --> 00:35:50.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul wrote

00:35:50.498 --> 00:35:54.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah “loves a cheerful giver.”

00:35:54.635 --> 00:35:58.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the subject
of a recent morning worship

00:35:58.272 --> 00:36:01.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother Anthony Morris
of the Governing Body.

00:36:03.311 --> 00:36:05.346 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to talk about money.

00:36:05.346 --> 00:36:07.348 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, the fact is,

00:36:07.348 --> 00:36:09.350 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we never beg for money.

00:36:09.350 --> 00:36:10.818 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not to say

00:36:10.818 --> 00:36:12.620 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we can’t talk about money

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s organization

00:36:14.222 --> 00:36:15.756 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the earthly part.

00:36:15.756 --> 00:36:18.426 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So it’s long standing;

00:36:18.426 --> 00:36:20.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is a balance here.

00:36:20.561 --> 00:36:25.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Going back to <i>The Watchtower,</i>
a long time ago, it says:

00:36:25.233 --> 00:36:30.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have never considered it proper
to solicit money for the Lord’s cause,

00:36:30.238 --> 00:36:33.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“after the common custom
[referring to Christendom]; . . .

00:36:33.708 --> 00:36:38.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is our judgment that money raised
by the various begging devices

00:36:38.312 --> 00:36:41.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the name of our Lord is offensive,

00:36:41.282 --> 00:36:43.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“unacceptable to him,

00:36:43.417 --> 00:36:45.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and does not bring his blessing

00:36:45.786 --> 00:36:50.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either upon the givers
or the work accomplished.”

00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:54.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we do not need to be coerced into giving.

00:36:54.395 --> 00:36:59.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We gladly use our money
to support Kingdom activities.

00:36:59.133 --> 00:37:02.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that stands to this day.

00:37:02.203 --> 00:37:07.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’d never want to come to the conclusion
that we can’t talk about money.

00:37:07.208 --> 00:37:12.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Money has to be discussed
in these last days in this system.

00:37:12.213 --> 00:37:15.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It “meets a response in all things.”

00:37:15.149 --> 00:37:18.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought we’d take some thoughts
from the <i>Kingdom</i>  book:

00:37:18.452 --> 00:37:23.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three reasons why we’re willing
—so willing to give.

00:37:23.291 --> 00:37:24.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some beautiful thoughts.

00:37:24.725 --> 00:37:27.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the first one is connected

00:37:27.628 --> 00:37:31.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with “doing what is pleasing
in [Jehovah’s] eyes.”

00:37:31.399 --> 00:37:33.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finding

00:37:33.401 --> 00:37:37.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Second Corinthians reference here

00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:41.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is so crucial in helping people understand

00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:43.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t beg for money.

00:37:43.878 --> 00:37:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, nonetheless, we have to talk
about it from time to time.

00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:54.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in the ninth chapter,

00:37:54.188 --> 00:37:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
donations and such were being discussed.

00:37:56.757 --> 00:37:59.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then this profound, inspired thought,

00:37:59.327 --> 00:38:01.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is reflecting Jehovah’s thinking,

00:38:01.762 --> 00:38:04.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in verse 7

00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:06.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Corinthians 9:7:

00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:11.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one do
just as he is resolved in his heart,

00:38:11.205 --> 00:38:15.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not grudgingly or under compulsion,

00:38:15.109 --> 00:38:17.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God loves a cheerful giver.”

00:38:17.578 --> 00:38:19.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there we have it.

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:23.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to give to Jehovah.

00:38:23.284 --> 00:38:25.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When needs arise,

00:38:25.286 --> 00:38:28.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the organization
brings it to our attention

00:38:28.322 --> 00:38:31.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for example, disasters and such

00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:33.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the report we had at the annual meeting

00:38:33.728 --> 00:38:36.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the increase in disasters—

00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:40.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions of dollars of God’s Kingdom money

00:38:40.601 --> 00:38:43.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was used to help our brothers.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when it comes to giving,

00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:47.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s an individual responsibility,
as the verse says,

00:38:47.742 --> 00:38:51.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“resolved in his heart [or her heart],
not grudgingly.”

00:38:51.879 --> 00:38:56.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the footnote
addresses the word “reluctantly.”

00:38:56.450 --> 00:38:59.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s not like we embarrass people

00:38:59.453 --> 00:39:02.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or beg them, saying:
“Look, you’re well-off.

00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:04.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why aren’t you giving more?”

00:39:04.392 --> 00:39:07.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s not their business;
that’s not our business.

00:39:07.328 --> 00:39:10.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to resolve it in our own heart.

00:39:10.064 --> 00:39:12.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we discuss money,

00:39:12.299 --> 00:39:16.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we never come across
like we’re putting people

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:18.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—trying to get them

00:39:18.606 --> 00:39:21.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to even grudgingly give
just so we get the money.

00:39:21.575 --> 00:39:23.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not this organization.

00:39:23.677 --> 00:39:28.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Christendom,
they are experts at begging for money.

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:31.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we love Jehovah.

00:39:31.018 --> 00:39:35.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be
the kind of person that he loves.

00:39:35.656 --> 00:39:39.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice that beautiful expression:
“God loves a cheerful giver.”

00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One translation put it nicely:

00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:45.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God loves people who love to give.”

00:39:45.166 --> 00:39:46.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s true.

00:39:46.767 --> 00:39:48.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we want Jehovah to love us.

00:39:48.803 --> 00:39:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this money we might have

00:39:51.906 --> 00:39:56.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whatever amount, depending
on our own personal circumstances—

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re happy to give to Kingdom interests.

00:39:58.846 --> 00:40:02.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s the first one:
We make these donations

00:40:02.516 --> 00:40:04.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of our love for Jehovah.

00:40:04.518 --> 00:40:06.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this second one, this is interesting

00:40:06.987 --> 00:40:10.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a heart-searching principle
found back in the Mosaic Law.

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:14.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn to Deuteronomy chapter 16,

00:40:14.095 --> 00:40:16.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you would, please.

00:40:16.097 --> 00:40:19.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Deuteronomy 16,

00:40:19.066 --> 00:40:21.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see the connection.

00:40:21.502 --> 00:40:24.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While this applied to the Jews at that time,

00:40:24.538 --> 00:40:27.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll see how it applies to us in our day.

00:40:27.374 --> 00:40:32.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verse 16
and then verse 17 of Deuteronomy 16.

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:34.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Three times a year,

00:40:34.982 --> 00:40:37.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all your males should appear
before Jehovah your God

00:40:37.618 --> 00:40:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the place that he chooses:

00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:42.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the Festival of Unleavened Bread,

00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:44.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Festival of Weeks,

00:40:44.024 --> 00:40:46.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the Festival of Booths,

00:40:46.494 --> 00:40:50.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now notice,] and none of them

00:40:50.231 --> 00:40:54.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“should appear
before Jehovah empty-handed.

00:40:54.001 --> 00:40:57.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The gift that each one brings
should be in proportion

00:40:57.538 --> 00:41:00.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the blessing
that Jehovah your God has given you.”

00:41:00.708 --> 00:41:03.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if you let that sink in,

00:41:03.978 --> 00:41:07.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is what Jehovah wanted to be conveyed

00:41:07.915 --> 00:41:11.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Israelites
who would attend these festivals—“none.”

00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:13.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he didn’t say,

00:41:13.587 --> 00:41:17.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you’re well-off,
if you’ve had a great year

00:41:17.024 --> 00:41:19.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(as opposed to some that were poor).’

00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:22.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They still had issues back at that time,

00:41:22.129 --> 00:41:25.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though it was Jehovah’s nation.

00:41:25.065 --> 00:41:27.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he said: 
‘None should appear empty-handed.’

00:41:27.868 --> 00:41:29.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that takes in all of us,

00:41:29.870 --> 00:41:32.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever our circumstances are,

00:41:32.072 --> 00:41:34.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether at Bethel or in the field.

00:41:34.275 --> 00:41:39.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t approve
of us coming empty-handed.

00:41:40.548 --> 00:41:44.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would help us
not to come empty-handed,

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:48.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this case,
back in Israel or in our time either?

00:41:48.455 --> 00:41:51.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 17,
and this is a lot to think about:

00:41:51.859 --> 00:41:55.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The gift that each one brings
should be in proportion

00:41:55.729 --> 00:41:59.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the blessing
that Jehovah your God has given you.”

00:41:59.066 --> 00:42:01.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there we have it.

00:42:01.068 --> 00:42:04.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You stop and reflect
that they were supposed to do that,

00:42:04.004 --> 00:42:06.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can do the same throughout the year.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reflect on the blessings
that Jehovah God has given us.

00:42:11.045 --> 00:42:15.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to take time to do that;
you have to give that consideration.

00:42:15.516 --> 00:42:18.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The gift that each one brings
should be in proportion to the blessing.”

00:42:18.953 --> 00:42:21.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So adding up these blessings,

00:42:21.121 --> 00:42:25.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’re happy to give
out of our material possessions.

00:42:25.259 --> 00:42:27.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a profound thought there,

00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:32.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and something to reflect on
so that we don’t find ourselves

00:42:32.266 --> 00:42:36.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when it comes to contributions
on a monthly basis or whatever—

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:40.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
empty-handed, perhaps thinking,
‘Well, I’m doing so much here and there.’

00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:44.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, money meets a response in all things,

00:42:44.445 --> 00:42:46.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have to take that into account,

00:42:46.513 --> 00:42:49.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if we’re in the poor range.

00:42:49.917 --> 00:42:54.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the third one
is connected with our love for Jesus.

00:42:54.788 --> 00:42:58.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn to John chapter 14,
if you would, please

00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—John chapter 14.

00:43:01.562 --> 00:43:04.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We give and have voluntary contributions

00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:08.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we love our Lord Jesus.

00:43:08.636 --> 00:43:11.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice what he stated here,

00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:16.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 14:23:

00:43:16.710 --> 00:43:19.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In answer Jesus said to him:

00:43:19.613 --> 00:43:23.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘If anyone loves me,
he will observe my word,

00:43:23.817 --> 00:43:26.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and my Father will love him,

00:43:26.086 --> 00:43:29.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will come to him
and make our dwelling with him.’”

00:43:29.957 --> 00:43:33.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So appreciate how Jesus put it—“if.”

00:43:33.327 --> 00:43:37.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a responsibility
that falls on us individually.

00:43:37.031 --> 00:43:39.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we say we love Jesus

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(we’re not like Christendom

00:43:41.502 --> 00:43:44.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with this proclamation
of their love for Jesus,

00:43:44.171 --> 00:43:47.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they really don’t even know
the real Jesus, frankly,

00:43:47.541 --> 00:43:50.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they get
an accurate knowledge of the truth),

00:43:50.010 --> 00:43:52.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we’re in the truth

00:43:52.046 --> 00:43:55.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—dedicated, baptized servants of him—

00:43:55.049 --> 00:43:57.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we really love him,
we’re going to observe his word.

00:43:57.584 --> 00:44:00.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that means
not just carrying out the Kingdom work,

00:44:00.187 --> 00:44:02.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting our time and energy into it,

00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:05.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it also means money.

00:44:05.092 --> 00:44:10.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are willing to donate money
to support the worldwide work.

00:44:10.097 --> 00:44:12.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not ashamed to admit

00:44:12.866 --> 00:44:15.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it takes money
to have these things operate

00:44:15.869 --> 00:44:20.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—branches, supporting
all of the preaching work,

00:44:20.307 --> 00:44:22.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom work,
and all these other initiatives

00:44:22.376 --> 00:44:24.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve had in recent years.

00:44:24.411 --> 00:44:25.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It takes money.

00:44:25.879 --> 00:44:29.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t go to people
that you buy things from and say,

00:44:29.316 --> 00:44:32.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, look,
this is a non-profit organization,”

00:44:32.252 --> 00:44:34.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to shame them, saying,
“Well, can you give it to me?”

00:44:34.254 --> 00:44:35.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:44:35.255 --> 00:44:39.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want their money
and to be paid for the various things

00:44:39.026 --> 00:44:42.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have to use
to accomplish Jehovah’s work.

00:44:42.429 --> 00:44:46.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So something to keep in mind,
those three things:

00:44:46.066 --> 00:44:50.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our love for Jehovah
—we want to do what’s pleasing to him.

00:44:50.070 --> 00:44:53.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We count our blessings from Jehovah.

00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:56.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, we have our love for Christ Jesus.

00:44:56.543 --> 00:44:59.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we want to do whatever we can.

00:44:59.213 --> 00:45:02.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how you do it
with the financial contributions,

00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:04.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s a personal decision,

00:45:04.551 --> 00:45:06.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah dignifies us with that.

00:45:06.954 --> 00:45:09.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never want to be shaming somebody

00:45:09.723 --> 00:45:12.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we think should be doing thus and so.

00:45:12.526 --> 00:45:14.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a personal matter.

00:45:14.328 --> 00:45:18.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But keep in mind, sometimes, if you are poor

00:45:18.132 --> 00:45:20.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—remember the widow.

00:45:20.701 --> 00:45:23.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she didn’t come there

00:45:23.337 --> 00:45:26.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the temple empty-handed.

00:45:26.807 --> 00:45:29.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She didn’t have much, but Jehovah loved her.

00:45:29.576 --> 00:45:31.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus loved her for giving what she had.

00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:33.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even when we’re poor,

00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:36.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re expected to give monetarily.

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:39.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s because we love Jehovah,
we love Jesus,

00:45:39.486 --> 00:45:43.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we appreciate
all the blessings we receive

00:45:43.056 --> 00:45:46.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the year and are grateful.

00:45:48.262 --> 00:45:52.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve discussed,
we fight discouragement

00:45:52.466 --> 00:45:56.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by replacing negative thoughts
with positive thoughts.

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s do that right now.

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:03.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy our new music video.

00:46:03.343 --> 00:46:07.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s entitled “<i>Always Rejoice.</i>”

00:46:18.125 --> 00:46:32.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the sky; take it in.
Feel the sun on your skin.

00:46:35.542 --> 00:46:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So much our God provides—
blessing our lives, helping us grow.

00:46:44.318 --> 00:46:53.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even more than this, his love is a gift;
we’ll never let go.

00:46:53.393 --> 00:47:02.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sing to Jehovah with all your heart.
Serve him through all your days—

00:47:02.503 --> 00:47:12.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No greater joy could there be than this,
No matter what we face.

00:47:12.212 --> 00:47:20.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:47:21.255 --> 00:47:28.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:47:31.098 --> 00:47:45.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Family and brotherhood—
Unity feels so good.

00:47:49.216 --> 00:47:57.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beautiful gifts from God,
building a bond no one can break.

00:47:57.591 --> 00:48:06.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Freedom may be denied,
but joy deep inside no one can take.

00:48:06.733 --> 00:48:15.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sing to Jehovah with all your heart.
Serve him through all your days—

00:48:15.642 --> 00:48:25.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No greater joy could there be than this,
No matter what we face.

00:48:25.519 --> 00:48:33.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:48:33.794 --> 00:48:41.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:48:44.705 --> 00:49:02.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earth will be a paradise for all eternity.
Jesus’ loving sacrifice truly sets us free.

00:49:02.389 --> 00:49:11.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sing to Jehovah with all your heart.
Serve him through all your days—

00:49:11.131 --> 00:49:21.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No greater joy could there be than this,
No matter what we face.

00:49:21.341 --> 00:49:28.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:49:29.983 --> 00:49:36.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:46.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:49:47.734 --> 00:49:54.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:49:57.010 --> 00:50:04.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:50:06.086 --> 00:50:12.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!
Always rejoice!

00:50:14.728 --> 00:50:17.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always rejoice!

00:50:18.532 --> 00:50:23.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, didn’t that bring a smile to your face?

00:50:23.036 --> 00:50:25.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our program reminded us

00:50:25.205 --> 00:50:28.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can successfully
fight discouragement

00:50:28.642 --> 00:50:30.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain joyful.

00:50:30.744 --> 00:50:32.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite many hardships,

00:50:32.979 --> 00:50:35.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Sister Aino

00:50:35.215 --> 00:50:38.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remained faithful and happy
by staying close to fellow believers

00:50:38.819 --> 00:50:43.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keeping herself spiritually nourished.

00:50:43.223 --> 00:50:46.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned how to build strong friendships,

00:50:46.693 --> 00:50:49.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which are a blessing in times of need

00:50:49.629 --> 00:50:51.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and discouragement.

00:50:51.431 --> 00:50:54.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bill put his love for God

00:50:54.301 --> 00:50:57.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ahead of his love for music
and has enjoyed

00:50:57.404 --> 00:51:00.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a meaningful life serving Jehovah.

00:51:00.774 --> 00:51:02.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this month’s music video

00:51:02.743 --> 00:51:04.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a happy song

00:51:04.878 --> 00:51:06.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll want to sing

Now let’s visit our brothers
and sisters in Quebec, Canada.

00:51:15.155 --> 00:51:19.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quebec is the largest
Canadian province by land area.

00:51:19.426 --> 00:51:21.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is home

00:51:21.762 --> 00:51:25.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to more than
24,000 brothers and sisters.

00:51:25.031 --> 00:51:29.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The province is known
for its natural beauty:

00:51:29.035 --> 00:51:33.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the St. Lawrence River,
thousands of lakes, waterfalls, ski slopes, 

00:51:33.974 --> 00:51:35.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and forests.

00:51:35.976 --> 00:51:37.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quebec is rich with wildlife:

00:51:37.744 --> 00:51:40.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
moose, caribou,

00:51:40.247 --> 00:51:42.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beavers, wolves,

00:51:42.749 --> 00:51:45.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Snowy Owl.

00:51:45.252 --> 00:51:48.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people
began preaching here in the 1920’s.

00:51:48.722 --> 00:51:50.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Government opposition

00:51:50.657 --> 00:51:54.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stirred up by the clergy
began almost immediately.

00:51:54.561 --> 00:51:56.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1946,

00:51:56.563 --> 00:51:59.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers held a 16-day campaign

00:51:59.666 --> 00:52:02.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to publicize the State’s disregard

00:52:02.736 --> 00:52:04.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for freedom of worship.

00:52:04.771 --> 00:52:08.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led to the arrest
of hundreds of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:52:08.909 --> 00:52:10.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first to be tried

00:52:10.944 --> 00:52:14.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were Brother Aimé Boucher
and his two daughters,

00:52:14.815 --> 00:52:18.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of whom was just 11 years of age.

00:52:18.685 --> 00:52:20.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1950,

00:52:20.821 --> 00:52:23.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court
of Canada ruled in their favor,

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:26.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
legally establishing
the right of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:30.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach in Quebec.

00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:34.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, our brothers
are taking full advantage of this freedom.

00:52:34.334 --> 00:52:39.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Montreal is the province’s largest city.

00:52:39.306 --> 00:52:41.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Publishers enjoy public witnessing

00:52:41.308 --> 00:52:45.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Montreal’s popular
tourist areas, subway system,

00:52:45.145 --> 00:52:49.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ports,
where workers come from many countries.

00:52:49.082 --> 00:52:51.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They preach to students

00:52:51.017 --> 00:52:55.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attending the city’s eight universities
and many colleges.

00:52:55.488 --> 00:52:58.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Quebec City, they even preach
in front of the government buildings

00:52:58.992 --> 00:53:03.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where decades ago
laws were written to stop our work.

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:07.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Boucher was
from the small town of Lac-Etchemin.

00:53:07.334 --> 00:53:10.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are 71 publishers

00:53:10.337 --> 00:53:12.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation here.

00:53:12.205 --> 00:53:14.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their vast territory

00:53:14.341 --> 00:53:18.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes a lot of farmland,
but their hard work to reach everyone

00:53:18.411 --> 00:53:21.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has produced several Bible studies.

00:53:22.482 --> 00:53:25.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The average midwinter temperature here

00:53:25.085 --> 00:53:27.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is about minus 12 degrees Celsius,

00:53:27.721 --> 00:53:32.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or about 10 degrees Fahrenheit,
and it often gets much colder.

00:53:32.692 --> 00:53:34.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite the temperature,

00:53:34.928 --> 00:53:38.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers enjoy warm association.

00:53:38.732 --> 00:53:43.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Quebec produces more than 70 percent
of the world’s maple syrup.

00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:47.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A favorite candy is maple taffy

00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:49.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—made by boiling the sap

00:53:49.476 --> 00:53:52.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from maple trees,
pouring it onto snow,

00:53:52.012 --> 00:53:56.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
letting it harden,
and then rolling it onto a stick.

00:53:57.217 --> 00:54:01.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in the Lac-Etchemin Congregation
