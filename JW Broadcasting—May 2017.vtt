00:01.685 --> 00:03.987
Welcome, brothers and sisters! 


00:03.987 --> 00:06.924
Here are some of this month’s highlights: 


00:06.923 --> 00:09.425
How should we view counsel? 


00:09.425 --> 00:11.762
Does it apply to us 
even if we don’t like 


00:11.762 --> 00:14.664
the way it was given? 


00:14.663 --> 00:16.766
In times of crisis, 


00:16.767 --> 00:21.805
how does the organization 
respond to help our brothers and sisters? 


00:21.805 --> 00:25.575
And we will go behind the scenes 
of last year’s convention drama 


00:25.575 --> 00:28.545
about King Hezekiah. 


00:28.545 --> 00:32.000
This is the May program 
of JW Broadcasting!


00:51.033 --> 00:55.171
Let’s begin by visiting a family 
in Stockholm, Sweden. 


00:55.172 --> 00:59.309
The parents, Usama and Kristina, 
have two daughters, 


00:59.308 --> 01:01.878
Talita and Isabella. 


01:01.878 --> 01:03.913
When Talita was born, 


01:03.913 --> 01:07.683
the doctor found cataracts 
in both of her eyes. 


01:07.683 --> 01:11.755
A cataract is a clouding 
of the eye’s natural lens. 


01:11.755 --> 01:13.757
So the doctor had to operate 


01:13.757 --> 01:16.894
so that Talita wouldn’t lose 
her sight completely


01:16.893 --> 01:20.000
—a terrifying situation 
for any parent. 


01:21.030 --> 01:23.467
Today, Talita is seven years old 


01:23.467 --> 01:25.902
and almost blind in one eye 


01:25.902 --> 01:28.000
but completely blind in the other. 


01:29.072 --> 01:31.074
Teaching a child about Jehovah 


01:31.073 --> 01:33.543
in this system of things 
is already a challenge 


01:33.543 --> 01:36.913
even without physical ailments involved. 


01:36.913 --> 01:41.350
But let’s find out how Talita’s parents 
rose to the challenge, 


01:41.350 --> 01:45.288
making sure that she received 
a proper spiritual education 


01:45.288 --> 01:47.000
despite her poor vision.


01:52.862 --> 01:56.465
I look forward to not having 
poor sight anymore 


01:56.465 --> 01:59.468
and that I can play 
with a bear and a lion 


01:59.468 --> 02:02.000
and to sit 
on the back of a tiger.


02:03.773 --> 02:08.611
Jehovah gives us 
a fantastic promise at Isaiah 35:5: 


02:08.612 --> 02:11.000
“The eyes of the blind will be opened.”


02:12.715 --> 02:17.287
It’s been a challenge 
to get to where we are today. 


02:17.287 --> 02:20.000
We thank Jehovah 
for all the help he has given us.


02:21.023 --> 02:25.195
As soon as Talita was able 
to leave the house after the operation, 


02:25.195 --> 02:28.000
we made sure 
to go to the meetings.


02:29.798 --> 02:33.000
It helped us a lot to be able 
to throw our burden on Jehovah. 


02:34.703 --> 02:36.873
We prayed together; 


02:36.873 --> 02:39.000
we cried a lot together 
because it was so hard.


02:44.180 --> 02:46.182
One of the challenges 


02:46.182 --> 02:50.320
is that we have to give 
Talita audio description constantly. 


02:50.320 --> 02:54.000
We have to tell her who is coming in 
and what is happening.


02:55.492 --> 02:59.862
We get so many amazing materials 
on jw.org 


02:59.862 --> 03:02.000
and also through the congregation. 


03:03.600 --> 03:06.000
She really loves to read 
Learn From the Great Teacher. 


03:07.237 --> 03:12.000
It has questions 
which make her a part of the story.


03:14.010 --> 03:15.845
She has a very good memory, 


03:15.845 --> 03:19.115
and therefore she remembers 
a lot of what she reads. 


03:19.115 --> 03:23.000
So when we are with friends, 
she often quizzes them.


03:53.617 --> 03:56.000
I really like to sing 
the songs in my songbook.


03:58.487 --> 04:00.457
Talita’s spiritual goal


04:00.457 --> 04:04.827
is to learn more 
of our Kingdom songs. 


04:04.827 --> 04:06.829
We get so much help 


04:06.828 --> 04:09.965
from the beautiful music 
on the website 


04:09.965 --> 04:13.000
and also 
from the Caleb and Sophia videos.


04:15.838 --> 04:19.041
She knows many of the stories
from My Book of Bible Stories,


04:19.042 --> 04:21.810
so she can answer in her own words. 


04:21.810 --> 04:25.282
We will ask a question like, 
Do you know this about David? 


04:25.282 --> 04:27.150
And if she knows the answer, 


04:27.150 --> 04:30.000
then we encourage her 
to answer at the meeting.


04:36.258 --> 04:38.426
When I give an answer 
at the meetings, 


04:38.427 --> 04:39.795
Jehovah becomes happy 


04:39.795 --> 04:42.965
because he loves children.


04:42.965 --> 04:45.200
She often asks the friends, 


04:45.200 --> 04:46.668
“Do you love Jehovah?” 


04:46.668 --> 04:49.000
So she feels very united with them.


04:53.108 --> 04:55.243
One of the best moments where we saw 


04:55.243 --> 04:57.680
that Talita’s spirituality had grown 


04:57.680 --> 05:00.048
was when she came home from a sleepover 


05:00.048 --> 05:02.051
at her grandparents’ house. 


05:02.052 --> 05:04.687
My parents are not Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


05:04.687 --> 05:06.322
and her grandmother had said 


05:06.322 --> 05:08.257
that God doesn’t exist. 


05:08.257 --> 05:11.127
So when Talita came home, she said, 


05:11.127 --> 05:14.030
“And then when I was going to sleep, 
I prayed to Jehovah,


05:14.030 --> 05:15.998
“‘Would you please help Grandmother 


05:15.998 --> 05:19.000
to realize that you do exist
—that you are real?’”


05:23.472 --> 05:27.077
We try to keep 
our wonderful hope alive, 


05:27.077 --> 05:30.179
so we often talk  about 
what we will do 


05:30.178 --> 05:32.415
in Paradise. 


05:32.415 --> 05:36.218
We really look forward to when Talita 
will be able to see again 


05:36.218 --> 05:39.155
and live in a paradise 
with all our friends. 


05:39.155 --> 05:42.000
It’s going to be wonderful!


05:43.392 --> 05:46.395
I think that Jehovah 
looks forward to looking at me 


05:46.395 --> 05:49.000
when I play with a tiger.


05:52.735 --> 05:56.638
I’ll have to make sure that I remember 
the names of Joseph’s brothers 


05:56.638 --> 06:00.810
in case I meet Talita 
and she decides to quiz me! 


06:00.810 --> 06:05.648
Her parents have done a good job 
in raising such a fine young sister. 


06:05.648 --> 06:07.650
And together with them, 


06:07.650 --> 06:11.420
we eagerly look forward 
to the benefits of the new system. 


06:11.420 --> 06:14.357
Isaiah 35:5 says: 


06:14.357 --> 06:19.000
“At that time the eyes 
of the blind will be opened.”


06:20.262 --> 06:24.067
Such divine reminders 
can truly warm our heart. 


06:24.067 --> 06:27.770
And Jehovah’s reminders 
not only provide us comfort 


06:27.770 --> 06:31.140
but can also help us 
make important decisions 


06:31.140 --> 06:33.142
in our everyday life. 


06:33.142 --> 06:37.647
This brings us to our music video 
which is entitled 


06:37.647 --> 06:40.000
I Keep Your Reminders.


06:56.198 --> 07:07.943
What should I do? 
Who should I look to?


07:07.943 --> 07:12.000
This could just be harmless, 
could be respectable.


07:14.483 --> 07:19.000
There may be no need 
for me to reject it all.


07:20.122 --> 07:29.000
Oh, what is the right course for me? 
Which path will it be?


07:32.067 --> 07:43.947
What should I do? 
Take which point of view?


07:43.947 --> 07:48.000
It could be excessive, 
with many dangers there—


07:50.487 --> 07:56.425
All the kinds of things 
that could prove to be a snare.


07:56.425 --> 08:06.868
Oh, what is the right course for me? 
Jehovah, give ear to my plea.


08:06.868 --> 08:13.441
I keep your reminders, 
and I love them dearly.


08:13.442 --> 08:19.382
I’ll treasure them every day, 
monthly, yearly.


08:19.382 --> 08:28.000
All the things I have heard in accord 
with your Word, help me understand.


08:33.562 --> 08:44.000
I know what’s required. 
I’d better inquire.


08:46.342 --> 08:51.880
I don’t want to act 
in a way to cause offense,


08:51.880 --> 08:58.553
But it sounds like 
there likely would be consequence.


08:58.553 --> 09:08.998
It’s clear what’s the right course for me
—the key, the guarantee.


09:08.998 --> 09:14.603
I keep your reminders, 
and I love them dearly.


09:14.603 --> 09:21.076
They strengthen my heart 
and help me to see clearly.


09:21.077 --> 09:30.000
All the things I have heard in accord
with your Word, help me understand.


09:53.575 --> 10:00.415
I keep your reminders, 
and I love them dearly.


10:00.415 --> 10:06.755
They strengthen my heart 
and help me to see clearly.


10:06.755 --> 10:12.662
As I read day and night, 
my life fills up with light.


10:12.662 --> 10:19.602
I’ve got you by my side 
as I think of your might.


10:19.602 --> 10:27.000
All the things I have heard in accord 
with your Word, help me understand.


10:33.448 --> 10:36.618
Did you notice 
that it was a Bible-trained conscience 


10:36.618 --> 10:39.855
that helped our sister 
make a wise decision? 


10:39.855 --> 10:43.358
She knew what potential danger 
lay ahead. 


10:43.358 --> 10:47.863
Yes, the reminders 
from God’s Word guided her.


10:47.863 --> 10:50.766
The theme for our program this month is 


10:50.767 --> 10:53.869
“Treasure Jehovah’s Reminders.” 


10:53.868 --> 10:58.306
And it’s based on Psalm 19:7, 


10:58.307 --> 11:00.710
where we’re told: 


11:00.710 --> 11:04.613
“The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, 


11:04.613 --> 11:08.000
making the inexperienced one wise.”


11:09.185 --> 11:13.488
In the original language, 
the word here translated as “reminder” 


11:13.488 --> 11:18.000
comes from a root word meaning 
“to go over again, to repeat.” 


11:19.095 --> 11:23.365
Reminders have always been 
an essential part of Jehovah’s teaching. 


11:23.365 --> 11:27.135
In ancient Israel, 
God’s people continually received 


11:27.135 --> 11:31.340
commandments, 
regulations, and reminders. 


11:31.340 --> 11:33.508
In fact, Jehovah tells us 


11:33.508 --> 11:36.611
that he sent 
his prophets “again and again” 


11:36.612 --> 11:41.000
to repeatedly remind his people 
of their responsibilities.


11:42.017 --> 11:45.020
The apostle Peter 
felt the need to give reminders 


11:45.020 --> 11:48.723
even to those 
who were “well-established in the truth.” 


11:48.723 --> 11:50.691
Notice how he describes this 


11:50.692 --> 11:54.864
at 2 Peter 1:12, 13: 


11:54.863 --> 11:58.400
“For this reason I intend always 


11:58.400 --> 12:00.335
“to remind you of these things, 


12:00.335 --> 12:03.238
“although you know them 
and are well-established 


12:03.238 --> 12:05.373
“in the truth that is present in you. 


12:05.373 --> 12:07.543
“But I consider it right, 


12:07.543 --> 12:09.978
“as long as I am in this tabernacle, 


12:09.978 --> 12:12.000
to stir you with reminders.” 


12:13.548 --> 12:16.618
In verse 15, 
he goes on to give the reason 


12:16.618 --> 12:19.621
why he felt the need 
to give the brothers reminders. 


12:19.622 --> 12:21.657
He says: 


12:21.657 --> 12:26.462
“I will always do my utmost 
so that after my departure, 


12:26.462 --> 12:30.000
you may be able to recall 
these things for yourselves.” 


12:31.333 --> 12:34.270
So Peter was determined 
to help the brothers and sisters


12:34.270 --> 12:37.440
in his day to remember, or recall, 


12:37.440 --> 12:40.608
the teachings they had already learned. 


12:40.608 --> 12:42.711
It shouldn’t come as a surprise, then, 


12:42.712 --> 12:46.415
if today a lot of our teaching 
involves reminders. 


12:46.415 --> 12:50.318
It follows the pattern set 
by Jehovah in ancient Israel 


12:50.318 --> 12:53.721
and with the first-century Christians.


12:53.722 --> 12:56.425
But why do we need reminders? 


12:56.425 --> 12:59.362
Let’s consider three reasons. 


12:59.362 --> 13:04.032
First, let’s look at Psalm 103:2. 


13:04.032 --> 13:06.035
There it says: 


13:06.035 --> 13:08.437
“Let me praise Jehovah; 


13:08.437 --> 13:11.000
may I never forget all that he has done.” 


13:12.240 --> 13:14.543
Why, then, do we need reminders? 


13:14.543 --> 13:17.580
Simply put, because we forget. 


13:17.580 --> 13:19.715
If we had perfect memories, 


13:19.715 --> 13:22.217
we wouldn’t need so many reminders. 


13:22.217 --> 13:25.387
Even in everyday life, 
many of us use little notes


13:25.387 --> 13:28.257
to remind ourselves 
of what we need to do. 


13:28.257 --> 13:30.692
And who of us 
hasn’t seen the need 


13:30.692 --> 13:33.562
for a list of reminders 
when going shopping, 


13:33.562 --> 13:36.432
only to realize when we returned 


13:36.432 --> 13:39.235
that we forgot to get one 
of the important items 


13:39.235 --> 13:41.237
we needed to purchase? 


13:41.237 --> 13:44.274
If reminders are important 
in everyday life, 


13:44.273 --> 13:46.275
how much more so in matters 


13:46.275 --> 13:49.912
that involve our relationship 
with Jehovah.


13:49.912 --> 13:54.000
Let’s read Luke 10:39, 40. 


13:55.283 --> 13:57.820
Speaking of Martha, we are told:


13:57.820 --> 14:00.857
“She also had a sister called Mary, 


14:00.857 --> 14:03.225
“who sat down at the feet of the Lord 


14:03.225 --> 14:05.928
“and kept listening to what he was saying. 


14:05.928 --> 14:07.930
“Martha, on the other hand, 


14:07.930 --> 14:11.000
was distracted
with attending to many duties.” 


14:12.735 --> 14:14.637
What was Martha’s problem? 


14:14.637 --> 14:16.672
She was distracted. 


14:16.672 --> 14:19.809
So the second reason 
why we need reminders 


14:19.808 --> 14:24.413
is that, like Martha, 
at times we too become distracted. 


14:24.413 --> 14:27.348
Although we may already know 
a vital fact, 


14:27.348 --> 14:30.318
that fact might get put 
into the back of our mind, 


14:30.318 --> 14:31.820
figuratively speaking, 


14:31.820 --> 14:34.000
because other matters 
are demanding our attention. 


14:36.125 --> 14:39.060
Satan is the great Distracter. 


14:39.060 --> 14:43.565
He tries to turn our attention away 
from the true issues of our day. 


14:43.565 --> 14:47.268
People in general have become 
more and more distracted 


14:47.268 --> 14:51.306
by entertainment 
and other nonessential matters. 


14:51.307 --> 14:55.777
No wonder that Satan 
has succeeded in misleading so many. 


14:55.777 --> 14:58.000
They don’t even realize 
what has happened.


14:59.615 --> 15:03.085
Reason number three 
is alluded to 


15:03.085 --> 15:06.388
at Matthew 24:45: 


15:06.388 --> 15:09.925
“Who really 
is the faithful and discreet slave 


15:09.925 --> 15:12.695
“whom his master appointed 
over his domestics, 


15:12.695 --> 15:16.865
to give them their food 
at the proper time?” 


15:16.865 --> 15:21.570
Notice that the spiritual food 
is given to us “at the proper time.” 


15:21.570 --> 15:25.473
Our circumstances in life 
are continually changing. 


15:25.473 --> 15:27.475
How often do we hear, 


15:27.475 --> 15:29.778
“That was just what I needed?” 


15:29.778 --> 15:32.000
We’ve all experienced that, 
haven’t we?


15:33.148 --> 15:36.685
So, what are three of the reasons 
why we need reminders? 


15:36.685 --> 15:40.255
One, 
because we tend to forget things. 


15:40.255 --> 15:43.825
Two, 
we often become distracted. 


15:43.825 --> 15:47.062
Three, 
our changed circumstances 


15:47.062 --> 15:50.565
may require a reminder 
of something we already knew 


15:50.565 --> 15:53.000
but didn’t fully need at that time.


15:54.135 --> 15:57.038
So that brings us to the next question: 


15:57.038 --> 15:59.541
What will help us to remember? 


15:59.542 --> 16:04.079
It’s interesting to note 
that Jehovah has used many ways 


16:04.078 --> 16:07.015
to remind his people 
of what they should do. 


16:07.015 --> 16:10.652
At Numbers 10:10, we’re told


16:10.652 --> 16:14.022
that the various festivals 
were given as reminders, 


16:14.022 --> 16:17.960
especially the celebration 
of the Passover. 


16:17.960 --> 16:20.362
That means 
that every time the Israelites 


16:20.362 --> 16:23.365
prepared and celebrated 
one of these festivals, 


16:23.365 --> 16:26.202
they were reminded 
of important matters, 


16:26.202 --> 16:29.505
such as how Jehovah 
provides for his people 


16:29.505 --> 16:32.875
and how he has saved them 
in the past. 


16:32.875 --> 16:35.043
Something similar happens today 


16:35.043 --> 16:37.913
at the commemoration 
of the Lord’s Evening Meal. 


16:37.913 --> 16:41.750
Not only do we hear 
the reminders from God’s Word 


16:41.750 --> 16:44.953
but the act of passing 
the bread and wine 


16:44.953 --> 16:47.956
also serves as an action
that reminds us 


16:47.957 --> 16:50.000
of what Jesus did in our behalf.


16:51.427 --> 16:54.830
But what do we need to do
in order for those reminders


16:54.830 --> 16:57.000
to have a beneficial impact 
on our lives? 


16:58.367 --> 17:03.872
Notice what Psalm 119:99 says. 


17:03.872 --> 17:05.007
It tells us: 


17:05.007 --> 17:08.777
“I have more insight than all my teachers, 


17:08.777 --> 17:12.782
because I ponder over your reminders.” 


17:12.782 --> 17:15.784
Yes, we need to ponder 
over these reminders. 


17:15.783 --> 17:19.555
That means not just 
listening to or reading them, 


17:19.555 --> 17:22.725
but it involves thinking deeply 
about them— 


17:22.725 --> 17:24.927
meditating on their value. 


17:24.927 --> 17:28.297
Just to listen or read  without meditating 


17:28.297 --> 17:31.300
is like looking through the lens 
of a movie camera 


17:31.300 --> 17:34.102
without pressing the record button. 


17:34.102 --> 17:36.739
We see things and hear things, 


17:36.738 --> 17:39.775
but nothing is recorded. 


17:39.775 --> 17:43.045
So we need 
to meditate, visualize, 


17:43.045 --> 17:45.413
and review these reminders. 


17:45.413 --> 17:48.750
This will help us 
to remember what we learn.


17:48.750 --> 17:52.353
But, figuratively speaking, 
there is something else 


17:52.353 --> 17:55.523
that we can do 
to press the record button. 


17:55.523 --> 17:58.026
That means we don’t have to wait 


17:58.027 --> 18:00.329
for someone else 
to give us a reminder. 


18:00.328 --> 18:03.198
We can make our own reminder. 


18:03.198 --> 18:05.933
How can we do so? 


18:05.933 --> 18:08.170
The answer to that question 


18:08.170 --> 18:11.640
is highlighted 
in Jehovah’s instructions to Moses 


18:11.640 --> 18:15.143
as found at Exodus 17:14: 


18:15.143 --> 18:17.780
“Jehovah now said to Moses: 


18:17.780 --> 18:20.682
“‘Write this as a memorial 


18:20.682 --> 18:22.852
“‘[or the footnote says: “reminder”] 


18:22.852 --> 18:25.520
in the book and repeat it to Joshua.’” 


18:25.520 --> 18:27.522
What’s the point? 


18:27.522 --> 18:31.927
Write down new things 
we want to remember. 


18:31.927 --> 18:35.097
Some brothers use a notebook, 
or exercise book, 


18:35.097 --> 18:39.034
to write down a list of interesting points 
that they want to remember. 


18:39.033 --> 18:42.003
Then they look through the book 
from time to time 


18:42.003 --> 18:45.040
to remind themselves of those points. 


18:45.040 --> 18:49.645
Many of us do this with our notes 
from conventions and assemblies. 


18:49.645 --> 18:52.280
Of course, to do that successfully, 


18:52.280 --> 18:55.050
you need to remember 
where you put the notebook. 


18:55.050 --> 18:57.352
Additionally, 
we have to be careful 


18:57.352 --> 19:00.622
that we don’t write down 
every little fact. 


19:00.622 --> 19:05.000
Otherwise, we may become overwhelmed 
with all the information.


19:06.162 --> 19:08.630
We can make 
these notes either on paper 


19:08.630 --> 19:13.535
or electronically using computers 
or electronic devices. 


19:13.535 --> 19:17.472
Whatever system we use, 
let’s make lists of things 


19:17.472 --> 19:19.000
that we want to remember. 


19:20.508 --> 19:24.846
Many brothers have found it good 
to have two separate lists. 


19:24.847 --> 19:27.615
One list could be subjects


19:27.615 --> 19:29.652
—perhaps points that we want to use 


19:29.652 --> 19:32.787
in the ministry or in our own lives. 


19:32.787 --> 19:35.124
Another, scriptures


19:35.123 --> 19:39.995
—explanations that clarify 
the meaning of certain verses.


19:39.995 --> 19:42.763
With regard to notes on scriptures, 


19:42.763 --> 19:45.800
let’s ask a very important question: 


19:45.800 --> 19:49.337
Do you have a study Bible? 


19:49.337 --> 19:52.007
What is a study Bible? 


19:52.007 --> 19:54.075
Perhaps it’s a separate Bible 


19:54.075 --> 19:56.345
to the one you take in the ministry. 


19:56.345 --> 19:58.913
It’s a Bible for you to write in 


19:58.913 --> 20:01.000
so that you’re reminded 
of things that you’ve learned. 


20:02.583 --> 20:07.255
These are some of the things 
we can do with a study Bible: 


20:07.255 --> 20:10.692
Highlight or underline some words or verses. 


20:10.692 --> 20:13.562
That will make it easier to find them again. 


20:13.562 --> 20:17.299
But remember not to make 
too many highlights or marks; 


20:17.298 --> 20:20.468
otherwise, nothing will stand out. 


20:20.468 --> 20:23.971
Write a summary of points and scriptures 
you want to remember 


20:23.972 --> 20:28.877
on the blank pages in the front 
or the back of your Bible. 


20:28.877 --> 20:30.979
Write notes in the margin


20:30.978 --> 20:33.681
—that’s what Gilead students often do. 


20:33.682 --> 20:37.019
Of course, you need 
the right type of pen or pencil 


20:37.018 --> 20:40.755
that won’t bleed through 
to the other side of the page. 


20:40.755 --> 20:44.158
What type of things 
could you write in the margin? 


20:44.158 --> 20:47.828
Perhaps new points 
that you learn while reading magazines 


20:47.828 --> 20:50.465
or attending meetings and assemblies. 


20:50.465 --> 20:53.935
If you learn a new point, ask yourself, 


20:53.935 --> 20:56.372
‘What verse is being explained?’ 


20:56.372 --> 21:01.209
And then write a brief comment 
in the margin next to that verse.


21:01.208 --> 21:03.211
Let’s take an example. 


21:03.212 --> 21:06.214
Perhaps you are reading 
the Sermon on the Mount 


21:06.213 --> 21:10.585
and you get to Matthew 7:24-27. 


21:10.585 --> 21:12.587
That’s the illustration 


21:12.587 --> 21:15.257
about the two men who built houses


21:15.257 --> 21:18.194
—one on sand and the other on rock. 


21:18.193 --> 21:21.195
As you research this 
in Watchtower Library 


21:21.195 --> 21:23.198
or the Research Guide, 


21:23.198 --> 21:25.200
you come across the article 


21:25.200 --> 21:27.935
“Are You Building on Sand or on Rock?” 


21:27.935 --> 21:31.000
in the November 1, 2008, Watchtower. 


21:32.540 --> 21:34.677
What points could you write in the margin 


21:34.677 --> 21:37.145
to help you remember the explanation? 


21:37.145 --> 21:39.213
Well, perhaps you could write: 


21:39.213 --> 21:43.685
Sand equals build on the surface. 


21:43.685 --> 21:48.423
Rock equals dig down deep. 


21:48.423 --> 21:52.760
Digging equals doing and applying. 


21:52.760 --> 21:57.132
You might even put Luke 6:46-48 there. 


21:57.132 --> 22:00.569
Now, if you still have room 
and your writing is small, 


22:00.568 --> 22:02.703
you could add something like this: 


22:02.703 --> 22:06.541
Not hearers only, but doers. 


22:06.542 --> 22:09.912
Both houses in same location, 


22:09.912 --> 22:14.549
same tests, foundations different. 


22:14.548 --> 22:17.118
Now every time 
you read those verses, 


22:17.118 --> 22:20.388
you will be reminded 
of what they mean.


22:20.388 --> 22:22.390
Perhaps like me, 


22:22.390 --> 22:25.527
you’ve had several study Bibles 
over the years. 


22:25.527 --> 22:27.895
I think back to the first one I used. 


22:27.895 --> 22:30.498
It was like this big green Bible. 


22:30.498 --> 22:34.501
Then, later that was replaced 
by another Bible


22:34.502 --> 22:36.939
—this black covered Bible. 


22:36.938 --> 22:39.040
And then, further still, 


22:39.040 --> 22:42.777
we had another Bible
—the Reference Bible. 


22:42.777 --> 22:45.480
And, of course, 
now for most of us, 


22:45.480 --> 22:48.650
we have the large-print Bible.


22:48.650 --> 22:51.085
This does, however, 


22:51.085 --> 22:53.488
highlight a challenge 
we might experience. 


22:53.488 --> 22:55.290
It can be frustrating 


22:55.290 --> 22:57.892
when a new edition 
of the Bible comes out. 


22:57.892 --> 23:00.229
How do you transfer all your study notes 


23:00.228 --> 23:02.296
over to the new Bible? 


23:02.297 --> 23:06.835
Additionally, our beloved study Bible 
may wear out 


23:06.835 --> 23:12.000
or, worse still, be lost, stolen, burned, 
ruined, run over, blown away. 


23:14.042 --> 23:18.214
So that’s the advantage 
of using an electronic list; 


23:18.213 --> 23:21.248
it doesn’t matter 
what type of file you use. 


23:21.248 --> 23:25.753
It can be updated very easily, 
and you can even make copies


23:25.753 --> 23:27.755
—not like the printed copy 


23:27.755 --> 23:31.392
that already has 
the old idea written in the margin. 


23:31.392 --> 23:33.829
Even now in English, 


23:33.828 --> 23:36.598
we have the books 
of Matthew, Mark, and Luke 


23:36.598 --> 23:38.866
in our electronic study Bible 


23:38.867 --> 23:42.437
on jw.org and WOL. 


23:42.437 --> 23:46.307
Later in the program, 
we have some exciting news 


23:46.307 --> 23:49.544
about how JW Library 
will help us in this regard. 


23:49.543 --> 23:52.980
But I’ll leave that for later.


23:52.980 --> 23:57.452
Really, having a study Bible 
is not only helpful 


23:57.452 --> 24:01.657
but it also makes our personal study 
far more interesting. 


24:01.657 --> 24:03.659
How so? 


24:03.658 --> 24:07.228
Every time we read 
or study a publication, 


24:07.228 --> 24:10.231
we’ll find ourselves 
searching for new points 


24:10.232 --> 24:13.469
that we can write 
in our study Bible. 


24:13.468 --> 24:16.871
This way, we’ll be doing 
what the psalmist expressed 


24:16.872 --> 24:20.375
at Psalm 119:111: 


24:20.375 --> 24:22.777
‘We will take Jehovah’s reminders 


24:22.777 --> 24:25.947
‘as our permanent possession 
(or heritage), 


24:25.947 --> 24:30.000
for his reminders 
are the joy of our hearts!’


24:31.487 --> 24:35.190
But do you agree that sometimes 
the reminders we get 


24:35.190 --> 24:37.658
may be less than pleasant? 


24:37.658 --> 24:40.195
Maybe they even hurt! 


24:40.195 --> 24:42.563
In this dramatization, 


24:42.563 --> 24:46.000
pay attention to how 
we should respond to counsel.


24:59.848 --> 25:02.000
Today started out well.


25:09.190 --> 25:11.058
But after the meeting tonight, 


25:11.058 --> 25:14.000
my feelings were hurt.


25:22.537 --> 25:25.740
Earlier in the week, we invited 
some friends over to watch a movie.


25:25.740 --> 25:27.808
And apparently, 


25:27.808 --> 25:30.000
this new young elder heard about it, 


25:31.112 --> 25:33.815
so he counseled me about it 
after the meeting, 


25:33.815 --> 25:36.250
saying that I should give 
my movie choices 


25:36.250 --> 25:38.653
some thought.


25:38.653 --> 25:41.656
I just didn’t like 
the way he gave the counsel. 


25:41.657 --> 25:43.725
He’s only 27. 


25:43.725 --> 25:46.000
That’s too young.


25:50.598 --> 25:54.001
The next day, 
we had plans to go out in the ministry 


25:54.002 --> 25:57.939
with Brother Kang and his wife.


25:57.938 --> 25:59.340
But the motivation 


25:59.340 --> 26:02.000
just wasn’t there.


26:13.355 --> 26:16.357
I asked to speak 
with Brother Kang alone. 


26:16.357 --> 26:18.360
I told him what happened 


26:18.360 --> 26:22.197
and how we didn’t feel 
the counsel applied to us.


26:22.197 --> 26:24.699
I can understand 
how you might feel. 


26:24.698 --> 26:26.133
But, Byong Soo, 


26:26.133 --> 26:28.503
be absolutely honest with me. 


26:28.503 --> 26:33.308
Do you feel there is no valid reason 
for that counsel?


26:33.308 --> 26:36.000
Mm. 


26:42.350 --> 26:44.685
Well, maybe there were some scenes 


26:44.685 --> 26:46.988
that could have been less violent. 


26:46.988 --> 26:49.156
But the way he gave the counsel


26:49.157 --> 26:51.359
—he didn’t even ask how we felt.


26:51.358 --> 26:54.295
Byong Soo, what is the only way 


26:54.295 --> 26:56.497
for us to receive perfect counsel?


26:56.497 --> 26:58.734
From a perfect man.


26:58.733 --> 27:00.668
That’s right. 


27:00.668 --> 27:04.905
And is Jesus here on the earth today?


27:04.905 --> 27:07.242
He was right. 


27:07.242 --> 27:09.810
Counsel can only be perfect 


27:09.810 --> 27:12.000
if it’s given from a perfect person.


27:13.482 --> 27:17.352
Still, this counsel 
about our movie choices 


27:17.352 --> 27:19.587
would have been so much easier 


27:19.587 --> 27:23.525
if it came from someone older 
and more experienced, 


27:23.525 --> 27:26.000
like Brother Kang.


27:27.528 --> 27:30.998
Well, he must have sensed 
what I was thinking 


27:30.998 --> 27:33.233
because he helped me to remember 


27:33.233 --> 27:36.000
something from the Bible.


27:37.705 --> 27:40.375
When Job underwent severe trials, 


27:40.375 --> 27:43.545
it was the younger Elihu who helped Job 


27:43.545 --> 27:46.000
adjust his thinking correctly.


27:47.782 --> 27:50.919
It required humility on Job’s part 


27:50.918 --> 27:54.000
to listen to someone younger 
and less experienced.


27:57.025 --> 27:59.927
He then read Proverbs 19:20: 


27:59.927 --> 28:04.199
“Listen to counsel and accept discipline, 


28:04.198 --> 28:09.603
in order to become wise in your future.”


28:09.603 --> 28:11.605
The point was clear: 


28:11.605 --> 28:14.642
Keep our focus on the counsel, 


28:14.642 --> 28:17.000
not the counselor.


28:30.325 --> 28:34.000
I later shared 
Brother Kang’s comments with my wife. 


28:35.097 --> 28:37.999
We both realized that we should welcome 


28:37.998 --> 28:40.735
all counsel from Jehovah. 


28:40.735 --> 28:42.000
It’s for our good.


29:02.623 --> 29:05.760
I’m sure it took courage 


29:05.760 --> 29:09.000
for that young elder 
to approach me about the matter. 


29:10.132 --> 29:13.100
But I’m so glad he did because, 


29:13.100 --> 29:15.637
in the end, his counsel 


29:15.637 --> 29:18.440
was just another example 


29:18.440 --> 29:20.000
of God’s love.


29:23.143 --> 29:25.746
Yes, we all need reminders. 


29:25.747 --> 29:28.349
And did you notice some 
of the main teaching points 


29:28.348 --> 29:30.351
in this dramatization? 


29:30.352 --> 29:32.620
First, 
we need to be humble 


29:32.620 --> 29:34.622
when we receive counsel. 


29:34.622 --> 29:38.727
Second, 
we need to keep our focus on the counsel, 


29:38.727 --> 29:40.762
not the counselor. 


29:40.762 --> 29:44.699
And the young elder likely learned 
from the experience too. 


29:44.698 --> 29:48.603
Perhaps next time, 
after conferring with a seasoned elder, 


29:48.603 --> 29:53.000
he might handle matters 
with a little bit more tact and discretion. 


29:54.242 --> 29:58.514
But we can’t rely solely 
on receiving reminders from others 


29:58.513 --> 30:00.948
to keep our spirituality intact. 


30:00.948 --> 30:03.283
We need to do our part.


30:03.283 --> 30:05.286
One of the tools that can help us 


30:05.287 --> 30:07.722
to actively search out reminders 


30:07.722 --> 30:09.890
is JW Library. 


30:09.890 --> 30:13.027
This amazing app has been installed 


30:13.027 --> 30:16.730
on over 15 million devices. 


30:16.730 --> 30:19.367
But do you know 
how much work it takes 


30:19.367 --> 30:21.735
to develop and maintain this app? 


30:21.735 --> 30:25.807
Well, we are now going  to look 
behind the scenes 


30:25.807 --> 30:29.910
and meet some of the brothers 
who have either worked on this project 


30:29.910 --> 30:32.347
or helped to organize that work. 


30:32.347 --> 30:35.015
This really is an opportunity to visit 


30:35.015 --> 30:39.087
an area in Bethel 
that you don’t get to see on tour. 


30:39.087 --> 30:42.957
Of course, there are many brothers 
associated with the work. 


30:42.957 --> 30:46.227
But we would like you 
to get to know three 


30:46.227 --> 30:48.295
of these very hard-working brothers, 


30:48.295 --> 30:50.998
and let me introduce them to you. 


30:50.998 --> 30:55.536
First of all, Brother Per Christensen, 
the overseer of MEPS Programming. 


30:55.537 --> 30:57.072
Now, Per, you’ve been in this country 


30:57.072 --> 30:59.840
working in the U.S. Bethel 
for a number of years. 


30:59.840 --> 31:01.000
But where are you from originally?


31:02.110 --> 31:04.045
I was born in Denmark 


31:04.045 --> 31:07.248
and served there in the branch for years.


31:07.248 --> 31:11.618
So when did you and your wife, Berit, 
come to the United States?


31:11.618 --> 31:13.153
In 1994. 


31:13.153 --> 31:15.690
And our first year was in Brooklyn. 


31:15.690 --> 31:18.258
And then we had 18 years in Patterson 


31:18.258 --> 31:21.261
and then back to Brooklyn again 
for three and a half years. 


31:21.262 --> 31:25.600
And now we’re in Warwick 
since November last year.


31:25.600 --> 31:28.637
Well, I know you worked 
in Translation Services for a while 


31:28.637 --> 31:30.705
because, in fact, 
the two of us worked together 


31:30.705 --> 31:32.307
in the same department 
there for a while. 


31:32.307 --> 31:35.810
But what type of work 
have you been involved with 


31:35.810 --> 31:37.978
since you’ve come 
to the United States?


31:37.978 --> 31:41.581
Lots of exciting and challenging jobs. 


31:41.582 --> 31:43.819
Working in Translation Services


31:43.818 --> 31:48.790
—that was training and support 
for our translators worldwide. 


31:48.790 --> 31:50.858
Now in MEPS Programming


31:50.858 --> 31:54.195
—that is all about 
distribution of spiritual food 


31:54.195 --> 31:56.497
to all our brothers and sisters. 


31:56.497 --> 32:00.802
So we have a ton of work 
and a lot of challenges. 


32:00.802 --> 32:02.904
But I’m also working with a lot 


32:02.903 --> 32:06.306
of very, very talented 
brothers and sisters. 


32:06.307 --> 32:10.979
So it’s a lot of fun, 
and it’s great going to work every day.


32:10.978 --> 32:12.546
That’s great to hear, Per. 


32:12.547 --> 32:15.717
In fact, I’m even tempted 
to come back and work with you.


32:15.717 --> 32:16.717
Oh, we would love that.


32:16.717 --> 32:18.720
I think I’d love it too.


32:18.720 --> 32:22.390
Well, let’s turn our attention 
to Brother Alfredo Serna. 


32:22.390 --> 32:25.258
Now, you are the assistant overseer 
of MEPS Programming. 


32:25.258 --> 32:29.963
In fact, you and I worked together 
in Mexico back in 2003. 


32:29.963 --> 32:33.433
Could you tell us a little bit 
about what you were doing at that time?


32:33.433 --> 32:35.670
My last work assignment involved overseeing 


32:35.670 --> 32:37.905
the large Translation Department there. 


32:37.905 --> 32:39.973
It was an amazing privilege to work 


32:39.973 --> 32:43.711
with translators in sign language 
and the indigenous languages, 


32:43.712 --> 32:47.749
a true joy to contribute
to preparing publications 


32:47.748 --> 32:49.883
for those in the minority groups.


32:49.883 --> 32:53.486
So when did you and your wife, Gina, 
come to the United States to work here?


32:53.487 --> 32:56.857
We arrived at Patterson in 2007. 


32:56.857 --> 32:58.860
We have fond memories of that time, 


32:58.860 --> 33:01.062
and it’s something we still treasure.


33:01.062 --> 33:01.862
Very good. 


33:01.862 --> 33:04.932
And now, 
Brother Paul Willies, 


33:04.932 --> 33:08.302
where do you originally come from 
along with your wife, Su-lin, 


33:08.302 --> 33:11.139
and when did you come
to the United States?


33:11.138 --> 33:13.540
Well, we’re both originally 
from South Africa, 


33:13.540 --> 33:15.543
and we served there in Bethel 
for a number of years. 


33:15.543 --> 33:18.713
And then in 2010, 
we were transferred to work 


33:18.713 --> 33:21.315
along with MEPS Programming 
here in the U.S.


33:21.315 --> 33:24.085
So, what type of work 
have you been involved with, 


33:24.085 --> 33:26.087
particularly recently?


33:26.087 --> 33:27.455
Well, most of my time in Bethel 


33:27.455 --> 33:29.757
I’ve been working 
on the Watchtower Translation System, 


33:29.757 --> 33:31.259
or WTS. 


33:31.258 --> 33:33.260
Actually, 
I was working along with Per. 


33:33.260 --> 33:35.095
Per was in headquarters, 
and I was working 


33:35.095 --> 33:37.965
on the programming team 
that we had in South Africa. 


33:37.965 --> 33:40.267
WTS is the program 
that the translators use 


33:40.267 --> 33:42.404
to help organize and manage 
their translation work. 


33:42.403 --> 33:46.006
And then, of course, most recently 
I’ve been working on the mobile apps


33:46.007 --> 33:49.710
—the JW Library app 
and the JW Library Sign Language app.


33:49.710 --> 33:50.878
Very good. 


33:50.878 --> 33:53.613
Well, now all of you work 
in MEPS Programming. 


33:53.613 --> 33:56.216
Per, can you just tell us a little bit? 


33:56.217 --> 33:59.454
We’re familiar with the term MEPS, 
but what really is it?


33:59.453 --> 34:01.455
Well, MEPS stands for 


34:01.455 --> 34:05.092
Multilanguage Electronic Publishing System.


34:05.092 --> 34:06.460
That didn’t help me at all. 


34:06.460 --> 34:07.628
Sorry. 


34:07.628 --> 34:10.230
Can you make it a little bit 
more simple so we can understand?


34:10.230 --> 34:14.535
We make the tools, or the programs, 
that the organization needs 


34:14.535 --> 34:17.003
to make publications 


34:17.003 --> 34:21.575
and have them translated 
into hundreds of languages. 


34:21.575 --> 34:24.212
So I can illustrate it this way:


34:24.212 --> 34:26.947
that we are not making 
the spiritual food, 


34:26.947 --> 34:30.785
but we are building 
a conveyor belt for the spiritual food 


34:30.785 --> 34:33.320
from the faithful and discreet slave 


34:33.320 --> 34:35.690
down to the printing presses 


34:35.690 --> 34:38.760
or to our website 
or to Watchtower Library, 


34:38.760 --> 34:42.863
ONLINE LIBRARY 
or, like in this case, JW Library.


34:42.863 --> 34:44.031
Thanks so much. 


34:44.032 --> 34:45.900
Now, at long last, I do understand 
a bit more 


34:45.900 --> 34:47.902
about what MEPS means. 


34:47.902 --> 34:51.439
Now, as I travel around, 
the brothers and sisters, 


34:51.438 --> 34:54.408
they tell me how much 
they love JW Library. 


34:54.408 --> 34:57.076
But there seems to be no end 


34:57.077 --> 35:00.180
to the suggestions 
for improvements and features


35:00.180 --> 35:02.717
—and long lists of suggestions. 


35:02.717 --> 35:06.854
Can you give us a little bit 
of an idea of what’s involved 


35:06.853 --> 35:10.000
with trying to develop 
a new feature for JW Library?


35:11.325 --> 35:14.528
Yes, the brothers and the sisters 
really love using the app, 


35:14.528 --> 35:18.131
and because of that, 
they’re keen to get many new features. 


35:18.132 --> 35:22.270
Of course, we wish we could just add 
all those new features into the app, 


35:22.270 --> 35:25.338
but the truth is we just can’t.


35:25.338 --> 35:28.843
Yes, adding each new feature 
involves a lot of work. 


35:28.843 --> 35:32.078
And we also need to determine 
whether a feature 


35:32.078 --> 35:34.081
that’s requested is just a “nice to have” 


35:34.082 --> 35:37.185
or is it something 
that’s going to address a real need? 


35:37.185 --> 35:40.922
For example, will it really help an elder 
who is out on a shepherding call 


35:40.922 --> 35:44.092
or maybe a pioneer sister 
who is at the public witnessing carts 


35:44.092 --> 35:46.894
or at her Bible study or return visit? 


35:46.893 --> 35:50.765
Also, very important 
to us is trying to make 


35:50.765 --> 35:53.935
each new feature 
very simple to use . . .


35:53.935 --> 35:55.368
Ah, thanks for doing that.


35:55.368 --> 35:59.040
. . . especially for a first-time user, 
someone who’s never used the app before. 


35:59.040 --> 36:01.608
And then, of course, 
before we start working on anything, 


36:01.608 --> 36:03.476
we always get approval 
from the Governing Body.


36:03.477 --> 36:05.312
Ah, that’s a good thing to do too.


36:05.312 --> 36:08.515
Like one feature 
that many have been asking for 


36:08.515 --> 36:12.085
is the ability 
to add notes into the app. 


36:12.085 --> 36:14.755
And, of course, 
before we start programming it, 


36:14.755 --> 36:18.458
we have to make sure 
that it actually does what is wanted. 


36:18.458 --> 36:20.995
We made a video 
that shows how we go about that.


36:20.995 --> 36:21.628
You have?


36:21.628 --> 36:22.263
Would you like to see it?


36:22.263 --> 36:25.331
Well, of course. 
I’d love to see it!


36:25.332 --> 36:26.834
Hello. 
How are you?


36:26.833 --> 36:27.668
Good, good, good.


36:27.668 --> 36:28.870
Welcome! 
Thanks for coming.


36:28.870 --> 36:29.937
How about yourself? 


36:29.937 --> 36:30.672
Fine, thank you. 
Have a seat. 


36:30.672 --> 36:32.674
All right, so glad you could be here! 


36:32.673 --> 36:33.908
Thank you so much.


36:33.908 --> 36:35.108
Oh, so fancy.


36:35.108 --> 36:38.245
Yeah!
So we get to talk about JW Library today. 


36:38.245 --> 36:41.082
So, what are some ways 
that you use JW Library?


36:41.082 --> 36:44.085
I mean, it’s revolutionized 
going to meetings.


36:44.085 --> 36:45.052
Oh, my.


36:45.052 --> 36:47.289
I go to meetings 
and sometimes I just carry my iPad.


36:47.288 --> 36:49.390
So the fact that you can make 
the text larger. . .


36:49.390 --> 36:52.560
It’s easy to listen 
to the readings right in the app now, 


36:52.560 --> 36:54.262
and so I—I find myself doing that.


36:54.262 --> 36:56.297
So if we were 
to make a notes feature, 


36:56.297 --> 36:58.599
what are some things 
that you’d like to be able to do?


36:58.598 --> 37:00.901
I mean, if you could see 
all your notes without tapping on 


37:00.902 --> 37:02.000
each one that would be great.


37:03.370 --> 37:06.873
And even if you make a note in, 
maybe, your phone 


37:06.873 --> 37:09.543
and it can also be saved in your tablet, 
that would be really nice.


37:09.543 --> 37:10.076
Yeah. 


37:10.077 --> 37:13.647
Well, what if I told you 
that in front of you  


37:13.647 --> 37:16.750
is an early version of JW Library?


37:16.750 --> 37:17.252
Whoa! 
Cool!


37:17.252 --> 37:18.152
Oh, fantastic!


37:18.152 --> 37:18.752
This is it?


37:18.752 --> 37:20.154
With notes—yeah.


37:20.153 --> 37:22.188
Ooh.


37:22.188 --> 37:24.425
So a few months ago, 
the Governing Body 


37:24.425 --> 37:26.693
gave us approval to start working 
on the notes feature. 


37:26.693 --> 37:30.030
We got together as a team, 
and we’ll do, like, these rough sketches, 


37:30.030 --> 37:31.565
and programmers write code. 


37:31.565 --> 37:33.000
But before we release an update, 


37:33.000 --> 37:34.135
we have a group of testers. 


37:34.135 --> 37:36.603
And, you know, they’ll find 
little glitches or bugs or things, 


37:36.603 --> 37:38.505
but they’ll try to work it out 
with the programmers. 


37:38.505 --> 37:42.377
After that, we have 
a pretty stable version of JW Library. 


37:42.377 --> 37:44.279
The goal is to show it to you, 


37:44.278 --> 37:47.348
and you can let us know 
what you think.


37:47.348 --> 37:49.783
So now that you’ve seen 
the new notes feature 


37:49.783 --> 37:51.385
in JW Library, what do you think?


37:51.385 --> 37:55.890
I love that I can tag the personal things 
that I need to work on 


37:55.890 --> 37:58.192
or a comment or a scripture 
that I can encourage someone with. 


37:58.192 --> 37:59.194
This is fantastic!


37:59.193 --> 38:00.093
Yeah. 
It’s great. 


38:00.093 --> 38:03.965
I like that I can find my notes, 
especially using the search feature. 


38:03.965 --> 38:04.732
It’s great!


38:04.732 --> 38:07.034
And it’s really neat 
how my comments— 


38:07.033 --> 38:09.536
I can place it right next 
to the paragraph for meetings, 


38:09.537 --> 38:11.739
and it doesn’t cover the actual text.


38:11.738 --> 38:15.508
The ability to back it up 
so you can restore it to another device, 


38:15.508 --> 38:17.511
that’s going to be really helpful.


38:17.512 --> 38:18.545
I love it!


38:18.545 --> 38:19.513
Amazing!


38:19.513 --> 38:20.681
OK. 
Go ahead.


38:20.682 --> 38:22.517
Yeah. 
Go ahead!


38:22.517 --> 38:24.000
So you’re telling us we can proceed.


38:25.185 --> 38:26.453
That’s fantastic! 


38:26.453 --> 38:29.123
But, brothers, you can’t show us 
something like that 


38:29.123 --> 38:32.258
and not tell us when 
we’re going to get it.


38:32.258 --> 38:34.128
Well, we said on the website 
that it was coming soon.


38:34.128 --> 38:36.996
I know you said that on the website, 
but when?


38:36.997 --> 38:38.765
Is it OK to be more specific than that?


38:38.765 --> 38:40.533
I think that’s why they invited us here.


38:40.533 --> 38:42.636
Paul, let’s hear it.


38:42.637 --> 38:44.272
Well, we’re happy to tell you 
that the notes feature 


38:44.272 --> 38:46.607
in JW Library 
will be coming soon, 


38:46.607 --> 38:51.045
and by soon we mean 
during May of 2017—this month! 


38:51.045 --> 38:54.948
So we can go and check 
the app stores for an update.


38:54.948 --> 38:56.783
Oh, that’s wonderful to hear. 


38:56.783 --> 38:59.653
So all of us will be happy 
to be able to put our own reminders 


38:59.653 --> 39:03.023
right there in the JW Library app. 


39:03.023 --> 39:06.726
Well, I’m looking forward 
to being able to do that as well. 


39:06.727 --> 39:08.695
But now, 
while I’ve got you here, 


39:08.695 --> 39:11.998
we’re not going to let you go 
until we ask this big question: 


39:11.998 --> 39:14.635
What are you working on now? 


39:14.635 --> 39:19.673
In other words, what can we expect 
to see soon with JW Library?


39:19.673 --> 39:22.643
We have another brief video showing 
what the team is working on 


39:22.643 --> 39:26.113
to support the Study Bible 
on the JW Library app. 


39:26.113 --> 39:26.913
Would you like to see it?


39:26.913 --> 39:28.000
That’s wonderful. 
Let’s have a look.


39:30.752 --> 39:32.019
Later this year, 


39:32.018 --> 39:34.755
work will begin on adding
the Study Edition


39:34.755 --> 39:37.625
of the New World Translation
to JW Library. 


39:37.625 --> 39:39.427
When this edition becomes available


39:39.427 --> 39:40.660
in your language, 


39:40.660 --> 39:42.262
you will be able to discover


39:42.262 --> 39:44.299
spiritual gems in the study notes.


39:44.298 --> 39:46.100
And the new media gallery 


39:46.100 --> 39:49.103
will help you
to visualize the people, places, 


39:49.103 --> 39:50.703
and things you read about. 


39:50.703 --> 39:53.773
You will also see
the new overviews of each book, 


39:53.773 --> 39:55.441
play the introductory videos, 


39:55.442 --> 39:58.145
and study additional appendix material.


39:58.145 --> 39:59.547
All of this and more


39:59.547 --> 40:02.000
is coming soon to JW Library!


40:03.550 --> 40:06.287
That sounds so exciting. 


40:06.287 --> 40:08.289
So we’ll all look forward 
to getting that feature. 


40:08.288 --> 40:11.258
You said, “coming soon,” didn’t you? 


40:11.258 --> 40:13.660
Anyway, 
we’d like to thank you very much 


40:13.660 --> 40:17.030
for the fact that you’ve come along 
and you’ve explained so much to us 


40:17.030 --> 40:20.133
about what goes on 
with MEPS Programming 


40:20.133 --> 40:22.201
and the JW Library app. 


40:22.202 --> 40:24.037
But before you go, 


40:24.037 --> 40:27.240
we’d like to ask you, 
when you go back to your department, 


40:27.240 --> 40:30.443
please, take an expression 
of our appreciation 


40:30.443 --> 40:32.946
back to the hard-working 
brothers and sisters 


40:32.947 --> 40:36.584
who are working behind the scenes 
in providing this tool for us.


40:36.583 --> 40:37.250
Will do.


40:37.250 --> 40:37.885
Happy to.


40:37.885 --> 40:38.185
Thanks.


40:38.185 --> 40:40.420
Thank you very much.


40:40.420 --> 40:43.123
And speaking of behind the scenes, 


40:43.123 --> 40:45.358
do you remember the beautiful dramas 


40:45.358 --> 40:48.195
we had at the regional convention 
last year? 


40:48.195 --> 40:51.198
One of them was 
about King Hezekiah. 


40:51.198 --> 40:54.935
We saw not only 
the threat Jehovah’s people faced 


40:54.935 --> 40:58.205
but also the protection 
Jehovah provided. 


40:58.205 --> 41:00.307
In producing the drama, 


41:00.307 --> 41:04.912
the Audio/Video Services Department 
used a lot of visual effects. 


41:04.912 --> 41:09.000
Let’s go behind the scenes 
and find out what the work entailed.


41:16.390 --> 41:19.125
The goal of our visual effects team 


41:19.125 --> 41:22.830
is to take the work done 
during film production and expand it. 


41:22.830 --> 41:26.333
Our work was driven by the Bible account.


41:26.333 --> 41:28.435
The audience needed to feel 


41:28.435 --> 41:30.905
the intimidating power of the Assyrian army


41:30.905 --> 41:33.673
while not endangering our actors.


41:33.673 --> 41:36.443
And the use of visual effects 
had the added benefit 


41:36.443 --> 41:39.000
of drastically saving donated funds.


41:40.547 --> 41:45.052
But this meant creating hundreds 
 of digital arrows, war machines, 


41:45.052 --> 41:48.122
cities, tents, soldiers, 


41:48.122 --> 41:50.524
and even an Assyrian palace.


41:50.523 --> 41:52.960
In some cases, the foreground elements 


41:52.960 --> 41:55.062
had to be separated 
from the background 


41:55.062 --> 41:58.899
so digital components could be added.


41:58.898 --> 42:01.668
This was a time-consuming process, 


42:01.668 --> 42:05.973
as many foreground elements 
had to be cut out frame by frame, 


42:05.973 --> 42:09.000
24 times for each second of video.


42:10.110 --> 42:12.647
Our research team ensured 
that the world created 


42:12.647 --> 42:14.682
was as accurate as possible. 


42:14.682 --> 42:15.815
For example, 


42:15.815 --> 42:18.518
having period-correct materials 
for the temple 


42:18.518 --> 42:21.588
as well as accurate stone reliefs.


42:21.588 --> 42:23.256
After filming was complete, 


42:23.257 --> 42:25.927
the research team noted 
some scenes in the treasury 


42:25.927 --> 42:29.000
were accidentally shot 
showing priests wearing sandals. 


42:31.098 --> 42:33.033
As this was inaccurate, 


42:33.033 --> 42:36.770
the issue was corrected 
by generating additional digital treasures 


42:36.770 --> 42:39.000
and placing them in the foreground.


42:40.573 --> 42:44.678
As we didn’t have 
the luxury of 185,000 extras, 


42:44.678 --> 42:48.848
actors were dressed in ancient costumes 
 and their pictures were taken. 


42:48.848 --> 42:52.185
We then used these pictures 
to create digital extras, 


42:52.185 --> 42:54.187
using crowd-simulating software 


42:54.187 --> 42:58.000
to place them in the scenes 
and drive their movements.


42:59.727 --> 43:03.264
The angel shot proved to be 
one of the most challenging. 


43:03.263 --> 43:08.000
The original version didn’t have 
the dramatic feel needed for the scene.


43:09.035 --> 43:11.505
So the entire sequence was recreated 


43:11.505 --> 43:14.073
to more accurately convey 
the immense power 


43:14.073 --> 43:17.000
that those present must have witnessed.


43:19.747 --> 43:23.717
Finishing this project 
on schedule had many challenges. 


43:23.717 --> 43:26.120
After hearing about just a few of them, 


43:26.120 --> 43:27.955
one industry expert said 


43:27.955 --> 43:30.623
what we were attempting was impossible.


43:30.623 --> 43:33.760
But like Hezekiah 
when hearing negative reports, 


43:33.760 --> 43:36.697
we stayed positive 
and relied on Jehovah.


43:36.697 --> 43:40.034
With His help, 
the film was completed on time 


43:40.033 --> 43:45.838
and is now a wonderful tool 
to bring this Bible account to life.


43:45.838 --> 43:47.908
A beautiful drama, 


43:47.908 --> 43:49.943
and how encouraging it was 


43:49.943 --> 43:52.780
to see Jehovah rescue his people! 


43:52.780 --> 43:56.817
The 2016 regional convention 
was excellent, 


43:56.817 --> 43:58.619
don’t you agree? 


43:58.618 --> 44:02.455
But you’ll be happy to know 
that we have prepared a little glimpse 


44:02.455 --> 44:05.458
of what is to come 
at this year’s convention 


44:05.458 --> 44:07.000
to whet your appetite.


44:10.363 --> 44:11.831
Are you OK?


44:11.832 --> 44:13.267
Brian, I’m worried.


44:13.267 --> 44:15.269
You need more money.


44:15.268 --> 44:16.736
Jehovah will take care of us. 


44:16.737 --> 44:18.705
He always has. 


44:18.705 --> 44:20.607
We have enough.


44:20.607 --> 44:22.109
Maybe enough for today, 


44:22.108 --> 44:24.845
but what if you get sick?


44:24.845 --> 44:27.000
Gloria’s mother keeps badgering her 
and me to move up.


44:28.115 --> 44:30.183
I can get a job 
at my uncle’s real estate firm. 


44:30.183 --> 44:33.000
Maybe this is an answer 
to our prayers.


44:34.120 --> 44:36.290
What about your pioneering?


44:36.290 --> 44:38.000
What about it? 
I can do both.


44:39.125 --> 44:41.462
Gloria, I must congratulate you 


44:41.462 --> 44:44.432
on your hard work with my company.


44:44.432 --> 44:47.000
But you must learn 
to keep your religion in its place.


44:48.802 --> 44:53.074
We’re neglecting 
family worship, study, service. 


44:53.073 --> 44:55.308
We’ve even become too busy, 


44:55.308 --> 44:58.000
or maybe too ashamed, 
to even pray together.


44:59.480 --> 45:01.082
I’m concerned about you.


45:01.082 --> 45:03.384
One of the things 
that you always talked to me about 


45:03.383 --> 45:06.086
was Matthew 6:24: 


45:06.087 --> 45:08.822
‘You cannot slave for God and for Riches.’


45:08.822 --> 45:12.000
You’re not the same person 
that I once knew.


45:14.027 --> 45:15.762
Dad, 


45:15.762 --> 45:17.064
where is Mom?


45:17.063 --> 45:21.000
She is coming, right?


45:22.302 --> 45:24.337
Is it really wrong 


45:24.337 --> 45:26.000
to try to improve our life?


45:27.340 --> 45:28.875
Mom. 


45:28.875 --> 45:30.210
“Remember the wife of Lot.”


45:30.210 --> 45:31.043
“Remember the wife of Lot.”


45:31.043 --> 45:34.000
“Remember the wife of Lot.”


45:40.387 --> 45:42.622
If you have yet to make definite plans 


45:42.622 --> 45:45.059
to attend your regional convention this year,


45:45.058 --> 45:46.860
don’t delay. 


45:46.860 --> 45:50.163
Our conventions are a loving provision 
from Jehovah. 


45:50.163 --> 45:52.165
Whatever it takes


45:52.165 --> 45:54.635
—talking to your boss to get time off work 


45:54.635 --> 45:56.470
or making travel plans—


45:56.470 --> 46:00.273
yes, whatever it takes, 
our efforts are worth it 


46:00.273 --> 46:04.210
because we truly treasure 
Jehovah’s reminders.


46:04.210 --> 46:07.013
Jesus’ words 
at Matthew 11:28 


46:07.013 --> 46:09.483
are very appropriate 
considering everything 


46:09.483 --> 46:12.285
we go through 
in this system of things: 


46:12.285 --> 46:16.790
“Come to me, all you who 
are toiling and loaded down, 


46:16.790 --> 46:18.992
and I will refresh you.” 


46:18.992 --> 46:22.629
Yes, conventions 
can be of refreshment to us, 


46:22.628 --> 46:25.065
giving us the boost we need. 


46:25.065 --> 46:28.102
But such refreshment 
is also available 


46:28.102 --> 46:31.439
when the world around us 
seems to be falling apart. 


46:31.438 --> 46:35.075
How does the organization 
help our brothers and sisters  


46:35.075 --> 46:37.510
in times of national crisis? 


46:37.510 --> 46:41.982
We met two Witness couples
who personally experienced 


46:41.982 --> 46:45.000
two of the largest terrorist attacks 
in recent years.


46:52.258 --> 46:54.861
Not a day goes by 
when we don’t think 


46:54.862 --> 46:57.000
about our son, Paulie.


47:06.072 --> 47:08.875
There was horror and suffering, 


47:08.875 --> 47:11.000
things we don’t want to witness anymore.


47:22.155 --> 47:28.000
September 11 
was a very scary, terrifying day.


47:29.062 --> 47:31.365
As for me, 


47:31.365 --> 47:34.535
when I really understood 
what was happening, I got scared. 


47:34.535 --> 47:36.102
I didn’t know what to do. 


47:36.102 --> 47:38.039
I didn’t know what to think. 


47:38.038 --> 47:41.475
I felt helpless.


47:41.475 --> 47:44.377
When the second tower fell, 


47:44.377 --> 47:47.280
Paulie was on the 110th floor 


47:47.280 --> 47:50.617
and everybody was shouting, crying. 


47:50.617 --> 47:53.120
I was praying to Jehovah 


47:53.120 --> 47:56.000
because I was heartbroken.


48:00.093 --> 48:03.663
We live on Voltaire Boulevard; 
 it’s a broad avenue. 


48:03.663 --> 48:06.666
There is a concert hall called the Bataclan. 


48:06.667 --> 48:09.302
When the doors of the Bataclan are open, 


48:09.302 --> 48:13.000
we can hear everything that goes on inside.


48:15.842 --> 48:19.012
That night, three men 
entered the Bataclan concert hall, 


48:19.012 --> 48:22.882
and they started shooting into the crowd. 


48:22.882 --> 48:24.985
We immediately grabbed our “go bag.” 


48:24.985 --> 48:27.787
And then we sat in front of the sofa, 


48:27.787 --> 48:30.457
and we begged Jehovah for his holy spirit 


48:30.457 --> 48:33.000
so we could face the situation.


48:42.202 --> 48:45.872
It was around 10:00 p.m. 
when there was a news flash 


48:45.872 --> 48:48.742
that announced that there was an attack. 


48:48.742 --> 48:51.000
I was in shock when I heard the news, 


48:52.178 --> 48:56.000
and then I immediately thought 
about our brothers and sisters. 


48:58.052 --> 49:01.722
I quickly got in contact 
with the circuit overseer 


49:01.722 --> 49:05.325
in order to get some news 
about our brothers and sisters, 


49:05.325 --> 49:07.693
to know how they were doing. 


49:07.693 --> 49:09.528
Then, 


49:09.528 --> 49:11.263
very early the next morning, 


49:11.263 --> 49:14.701
we set up an emergency committee 
made up of several brothers 


49:14.702 --> 49:16.704
from the Service Department. 


49:16.703 --> 49:20.373
We decided to write a letter 
and make other arrangements 


49:20.373 --> 49:23.276
to assist the friends who, 
in one way or another, 


49:23.277 --> 49:26.580
were affected by this event. 


49:26.580 --> 49:27.747
In turn, 


49:27.747 --> 49:30.217
the circuit overseer 
would make an effort 


49:30.217 --> 49:33.320
to rapidly get in touch 
with the elders 


49:33.320 --> 49:36.000
who oversee 
the affected territory.


49:39.760 --> 49:42.795
One of our challenges, on a personal level, 


49:42.795 --> 49:44.865
was whether we would even be able 


49:44.865 --> 49:46.933
to encourage our brothers and sisters 


49:46.933 --> 49:50.470
because we had never experienced 
such a terrible event. 


49:50.470 --> 49:52.538
We organized ourselves; 


49:52.538 --> 49:55.000
we paired up as elders 
and headed off to do shepherding.


49:56.577 --> 50:00.314
We started calling midmorning 
on Tuesday. 


50:00.313 --> 50:02.048
We received a report back 


50:02.048 --> 50:03.883
from all the traveling overseers 


50:03.883 --> 50:05.118
by the end of Thursday. 


50:05.118 --> 50:07.320
And unfortunately, 


50:07.320 --> 50:10.157
we learned that 14 
of our brothers and sisters 


50:10.157 --> 50:13.694
had lost their lives. 


50:13.693 --> 50:18.798
We knew that we needed 
to encourage the families; 


50:18.798 --> 50:22.968
we knew that we needed 
to shepherd them as soon as possible.


50:22.968 --> 50:26.773
The elders immediately came. 


50:26.773 --> 50:29.108
We went over the book of Job, 


50:29.108 --> 50:31.611
and I just listened. 


50:31.612 --> 50:33.547
You know, I was just listening. 


50:33.547 --> 50:36.450
I’ve heard the same words before, 
but it was different now. 


50:36.450 --> 50:40.000
The things that were being said 
went straight to my heart.


50:42.255 --> 50:45.758
A few days later, we were visited 
by two brothers from Bethel. 


50:45.758 --> 50:48.995
It was very touching 
that they came to see us 


50:48.995 --> 50:51.297
and that they 
were concerned about us. 


50:51.297 --> 50:56.169
It shows us that Jehovah 
was aware of how we felt that night.


50:56.168 --> 50:58.605
Our brothers were there. 


50:58.605 --> 51:01.107
They were ready 
to help one another out. 


51:01.107 --> 51:05.079
Then there was 
so much empathy and love shown.


51:05.078 --> 51:06.913
When we were ultimately granted 


51:06.913 --> 51:08.748
access to ground zero 


51:08.748 --> 51:11.485
and we started encountering 


51:11.485 --> 51:13.420
the first responders, 


51:13.420 --> 51:16.657
we let them know how much 
we appreciated their hard work 


51:16.657 --> 51:18.659
and that they had a skill set 


51:18.658 --> 51:20.560
that we didn’t have. 


51:20.560 --> 51:21.928
But yet our skill set 


51:21.928 --> 51:24.663
was trying 
to offer comfort to them. 


51:24.663 --> 51:27.266
We shared a scripture with them. 


51:27.267 --> 51:30.104
Immediately, we could tell 
that that was something 


51:30.103 --> 51:33.573
that caused emotion 
to rise up in them right away. 


51:33.573 --> 51:35.975
And they expressed 


51:35.975 --> 51:37.377
great appreciation for that. 


51:37.377 --> 51:40.614
It’s one of the beautiful things 
about the Scriptures


51:40.613 --> 51:44.650
—that they’re calming, 
soothing, comforting. 


51:44.650 --> 51:47.520
And the Scriptures 
did not let down the workers 


51:47.520 --> 51:50.000
that were there at ground zero either.


51:51.792 --> 51:54.795
The visit of the brothers 
from Bethel was really 


51:54.795 --> 51:56.830
a gift from Jehovah. 


51:56.830 --> 51:59.532
It showed his genuine interest in us. 


51:59.532 --> 52:02.000
It was really wonderful.


52:03.637 --> 52:05.605
After the brothers visited us, 


52:05.605 --> 52:07.707
we felt so comforted, 


52:07.707 --> 52:09.442
so encouraged, 


52:09.442 --> 52:11.244
that we said to each other: 


52:11.243 --> 52:14.646
“We have to get back in the ministry 


52:14.647 --> 52:16.650
“and comfort people in the territory. 


52:16.650 --> 52:20.000
We have to console 
our brothers and sisters as well.” 


52:21.287 --> 52:23.757
We can only thank and glorify Jehovah, 


52:23.757 --> 52:25.000
who really is a God of love.


52:31.598 --> 52:33.766
I kind of felt 


52:33.767 --> 52:36.269
Jehovah’s hand just reaching out to me, 


52:36.268 --> 52:39.638
which I needed. 


52:39.638 --> 52:43.843
But I cannot wait till the day 
that I’m totally refreshed. 


52:43.843 --> 52:46.813
Where I can see, 
 I can actually see, 


52:46.813 --> 52:48.615
Paulie. 


52:48.615 --> 52:51.217
I can see him just coming back 


52:51.217 --> 52:53.254
into our lives, 


52:53.253 --> 52:56.000
and I want to embrace him so much.


52:59.025 --> 53:03.730
After something like this, 
we are not the same. 


53:03.730 --> 53:05.000
But 


53:06.867 --> 53:09.904
with the help of the organization


53:09.903 --> 53:11.605
—the brothers—


53:11.605 --> 53:13.807
Jehovah is there for us. 


53:13.807 --> 53:15.575
So that— 


53:15.575 --> 53:18.912
That is refreshing.


53:18.912 --> 53:20.914
And I thank Jehovah a lot 


53:20.913 --> 53:24.183
for what he wants to do for me 


53:24.183 --> 53:28.221
and also for the millions of people 


53:28.222 --> 53:31.000
that feel the same way.


53:35.662 --> 53:37.664
What these couples went through 


53:37.663 --> 53:40.700
was a horrible reminder of Satan’s rule, 


53:40.700 --> 53:43.703
but we look forward 
to the relief from Jehovah


53:43.703 --> 53:46.271
—the only true hope we have. 


53:46.272 --> 53:50.644
Reminders of Jehovah’s care, 
such as these interviews, 


53:50.643 --> 53:54.280
can be ‘the joy of our heart,’ 
as the psalmist said. 


53:54.280 --> 53:57.317
Yes, “the reminder 
of Jehovah is trustworthy, 


53:57.317 --> 54:01.287
making the inexperienced one wise.”


54:01.287 --> 54:03.324
Before we conclude, 


54:03.323 --> 54:07.493
let’s visit our brothers 
and sisters in India. 


54:07.493 --> 54:10.663
India is the second-most-populated country
in the world, 


54:10.663 --> 54:15.201
with a population 
of some 1.2 billion people. 


54:15.202 --> 54:18.237
The Kingdom preaching work 
is conducted 


54:18.237 --> 54:21.174
by some 45,000 brothers and sisters 


54:21.173 --> 54:23.810
in 627 congregations, 


54:23.810 --> 54:25.912
and last year, 


54:25.912 --> 54:29.415
close to 125,000 people attended 


54:29.415 --> 54:32.618
the Memorial of Christ’s death.


54:32.618 --> 54:35.055
Our visit brings us to Peermedu, 


54:35.055 --> 54:37.390
which is located in the southern tip 


54:37.390 --> 54:40.993
of the Indian Peninsula, 
in the state of Kerala. 


54:40.993 --> 54:43.296
This town is located 


54:43.297 --> 54:48.000
some 914 meters, 
or almost 3,000 feet, above sea level. 


54:49.035 --> 54:52.472
It is a land of spices and lush greenery, 


54:52.472 --> 54:55.742
with tea and coffee plantations. 


54:55.742 --> 54:59.000
The two congregations 
there have a total of 70 publishers. 


55:01.147 --> 55:03.484
Many of them work in tea estates 


55:03.483 --> 55:06.251
and struggle to make a living. 


55:06.252 --> 55:09.422
They are eager users of the JW Library app, 


55:09.422 --> 55:11.624
which they use to share 
our videos 


55:11.623 --> 55:14.226
and publications 
in the ministry. 


55:14.227 --> 55:17.964
As Peermedu is a hill station, 


55:17.963 --> 55:21.000
their territory consists 
of rugged and uneven terrain. 


55:23.970 --> 55:25.972
Since the congregations there are watching 


55:25.972 --> 55:28.040
this program together with all of us, 


55:28.040 --> 55:30.577
we wanted to take this opportunity 


55:30.577 --> 55:33.447
to convey their warm Christian greetings 


55:33.447 --> 55:36.582
to all of Jehovah’s people 
around the world. 


55:36.582 --> 55:39.019
We love you very much. 


55:39.018 --> 55:41.788
This is JW Broadcasting 


55:41.788 --> 55:52.650
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
