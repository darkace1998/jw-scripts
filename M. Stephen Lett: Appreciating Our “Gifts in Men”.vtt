00:00.684 --> 00:04.554
The theme for this month’s program is

00:04.554 --> 00:09.392
“Appreciating Our ‘Gifts in Men.’”

00:09.392 --> 00:12.962
Who of us does not enjoy being given

00:12.962 --> 00:16.099
a fine, well-chosen gift?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.468
For example, you brothers,

00:18.468 --> 00:21.304
do you not take pleasure in receiving

00:21.304 --> 00:24.140
a colorful but tasteful,

00:24.140 --> 00:27.243
100 percent silk tie?

00:27.243 --> 00:30.613
Or, you sisters, 
do you not delight in being given

00:30.613 --> 00:34.250
an exquisite, charming silk scarf?

00:34.250 --> 00:37.754
But what if you took that silk tie

00:37.754 --> 00:39.823
or silk scarf

00:39.823 --> 00:43.493
and used it to polish your shoes?

00:43.493 --> 00:46.863
How do you think 
the giver of your gift would feel

00:46.863 --> 00:51.367
if he saw you using his gift in that way?

00:51.367 --> 00:54.537
Obviously, it would be misuse

00:54.537 --> 00:59.542
and disrespect for the gift 
and would insult the giver.

00:59.542 --> 01:02.812
What is the point of our illustration?

01:02.812 --> 01:07.050
Well, Jehovah and Jesus have given us

01:07.050 --> 01:12.021
a fine, well-chosen gift 
in the form of the elders.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.991
But as we will discuss,

01:14.991 --> 01:17.727
all of us must make sure

01:17.727 --> 01:21.831
that we always show appreciation and respect

01:21.831 --> 01:24.134
for this divine provision.

01:25.468 --> 01:30.473
Please turn to Ephesians 4:8,

01:30.473 --> 01:34.310
and let’s read about this gift

01:34.310 --> 01:38.248
that Jehovah and Jesus have given us.

01:38.248 --> 01:40.250
It reads:

01:40.250 --> 01:42.318
“For it says:

01:42.318 --> 01:45.155
“‘When he ascended on high

01:45.155 --> 01:47.991
“‘he carried away captives;

01:47.991 --> 01:51.427
he gave gifts in men.’”

01:51.761 --> 01:56.432
You notice, by means 
of Jesus’ perfect integrity,

01:56.432 --> 02:00.336
Jesus conquered Satan and his world.

02:00.336 --> 02:02.438
As a world conqueror,

02:02.438 --> 02:06.309
figuratively He has plundered captives

02:06.309 --> 02:11.214
and has given them 
as gifts to the congregations.

02:11.214 --> 02:14.484
How useful are these “gifts in men”?

02:14.484 --> 02:18.955
Well, please look 
at verses 11 and 12 for the answer:

02:18.955 --> 02:21.724
“And he gave some as apostles,

02:21.724 --> 02:23.893
“some as prophets,

02:23.893 --> 02:26.396
“some as evangelizers,

02:26.396 --> 02:29.499
“some as shepherds and teachers,

02:29.499 --> 02:33.870
“with a view 
to the readjustment of the holy ones,

02:33.870 --> 02:36.072
“for ministerial work,

02:36.072 --> 02:39.542
to build up the body of the Christ.”

02:40.276 --> 02:44.180
Notice, they would be “evangelizers”

02:44.180 --> 02:46.182
—taking the lead

02:46.182 --> 02:49.919
in the all-important preaching 
and disciple-making work.

02:49.919 --> 02:52.689
They do not simply say to the publishers,

02:52.689 --> 02:55.992
“Go in the preaching work.”

02:55.992 --> 03:00.163
They say: “Come. 
Come with us.

03:00.163 --> 03:05.134
Let’s work together 
in this never-to-be-repeated work.”

03:05.134 --> 03:07.737
They’re also “shepherds”

03:07.737 --> 03:10.673
—protecting the flock from Satan

03:10.673 --> 03:14.711
the “murderer,” 
“serpent,” “dragon,” and “lion.”

03:14.711 --> 03:17.747
Additionally, they are “teachers”

03:17.747 --> 03:22.118
—feeding the flock 
with nourishing spiritual food.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.721
But now we ask,

03:24.721 --> 03:26.756
How does Jehovah tell us

03:26.756 --> 03:30.660
that we should feel 
about these hardworking “gifts in men”?

03:30.660 --> 03:34.597
Let’s go to 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,

03:34.597 --> 03:37.267
and let’s get the answer.

03:37.267 --> 03:39.269
At 1 Thessalonians chapter 5,

03:39.269 --> 03:42.805
beginning in verse number 12,

03:42.805 --> 03:45.074
notice what Jehovah says:

03:45.074 --> 03:47.877
“Now we request you, brothers,

03:47.877 --> 03:50.847
“to show respect

03:50.847 --> 03:54.284
“for those who are working hard among you

03:54.284 --> 03:57.520
“and presiding over you in the Lord

03:57.520 --> 03:59.956
“and admonishing you;

03:59.956 --> 04:04.527
“and to give them extraordinary consideration

04:04.527 --> 04:07.530
“in love because of their work.

04:07.530 --> 04:11.601
Be peaceable with one another.”

04:12.068 --> 04:16.572
Notice, we’re told to “show respect”

04:16.572 --> 04:18.641
for these dear brothers.

04:18.641 --> 04:22.478
But now, let’s move to a vital question,

04:22.478 --> 04:26.482
How can we show, demonstrate,

04:26.482 --> 04:29.018
that we do deeply respect

04:29.018 --> 04:31.788
and appreciate these dear brothers?

04:31.788 --> 04:33.790
The first way:

04:33.790 --> 04:38.061
by wholeheartedly cooperating with them.

04:38.061 --> 04:43.232
Please turn to Hebrews 13:17,

04:44.400 --> 04:47.670
and this scripture describes how deep

04:47.670 --> 04:51.975
our cooperation should be, verse 17:

04:51.975 --> 04:54.610
“Be obedient

04:54.610 --> 04:57.847
“to those who are taking the lead among you

04:57.847 --> 05:00.950
“and be submissive,

05:00.950 --> 05:04.053
“for they are keeping watch over you

05:04.053 --> 05:07.357
“as those who will render an account,

05:07.357 --> 05:11.127
“so that they may do this 
with joy and not with sighing,

05:11.127 --> 05:15.264
for this would be damaging to you.”

05:15.631 --> 05:20.103
Notice, we are told to “be obedient.”

05:20.103 --> 05:23.373
Clearly, this means 
that we’re supposed to comply with,

05:23.373 --> 05:26.142
or obey, what they tell us.

05:26.142 --> 05:29.045
Of course, that would be with the proviso:

05:29.045 --> 05:32.682
unless they tell us to do 
something that is unscriptural.

05:32.682 --> 05:36.119
And, of course, that would be extremely rare.

05:36.119 --> 05:40.323
We’re also told to “be submissive.”

05:40.323 --> 05:42.892
This includes the attitude

05:42.892 --> 05:45.628
with which we’re to be obedient

05:45.628 --> 05:50.333
—doing so with a yielding, positive attitude.

05:51.367 --> 05:54.137
Would it be possible to be obedient

05:54.137 --> 05:56.606
but not submissive?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.674
Well, what if we said:

05:58.674 --> 06:03.579
“OK. I’ll do what the elders suggest.

06:03.579 --> 06:08.518
I don’t want to do it, but I’ll do it.”

06:08.518 --> 06:12.522
We would be obedient but not submissive.

06:12.522 --> 06:14.791
However, Jehovah tells us

06:14.791 --> 06:18.227
to display both of these qualities.

06:18.227 --> 06:21.531
We should be obedient and submissive

06:21.531 --> 06:24.967
even if what the elders are asking us to do

06:24.967 --> 06:29.439
is not the best, 
most efficient way to do something.

06:29.439 --> 06:32.742
Permit me to illustrate this point.

06:32.742 --> 06:37.513
Admittedly, the illustration 
is somewhat exaggerated,

06:37.513 --> 06:40.316
but hopefully it will make the point.

06:40.316 --> 06:43.786
Please imagine that the elders decide

06:43.786 --> 06:46.522
that the outside of the Kingdom Hall

06:46.522 --> 06:50.493
needs to be painted 
and that all the publishers

06:50.493 --> 06:53.896
will be given 
a small two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush

06:53.896 --> 06:56.032
with which to paint.

06:56.032 --> 06:58.201
Now, what could happen?

06:58.201 --> 07:01.003
The publishers could get all upset

07:01.003 --> 07:03.506
concerning this request of the elders,

07:03.506 --> 07:08.010
saying, “It is ridiculous 
that the elders want us

07:08.010 --> 07:11.314
to paint 
with a small two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush!”

07:11.314 --> 07:15.585
Consequently, some could start campaigning

07:15.585 --> 07:20.523
for the right for everyone 
to use a six-inch (15 cm) paintbrush.

07:20.523 --> 07:25.528
Others might campaign for using paint rollers

07:25.528 --> 07:28.498
to roll the paint on the Kingdom Hall.

07:28.498 --> 07:32.301
Still others 
might start trying to build support

07:32.301 --> 07:36.506
for renting and using a paint sprayer

07:36.506 --> 07:39.342
to spray the paint on the Kingdom Hall.

07:39.342 --> 07:42.912
In another camp, 
ones might champion the idea

07:42.912 --> 07:45.414
of hiring out to a contractor

07:45.414 --> 07:47.884
the painting of the Kingdom Hall,

07:47.884 --> 07:51.787
while another group is promoting the idea

07:51.787 --> 07:55.892
that the Kingdom Hall 
doesn’t even need to be painted.

07:55.892 --> 07:59.162
Now, what would be the outcome?

07:59.162 --> 08:02.231
The congregation would be divided,

08:02.231 --> 08:05.134
the Kingdom Hall would never get painted,

08:05.134 --> 08:09.105
publishers could end up 
stumbled right out of the truth,

08:09.105 --> 08:12.241
the elders would be very discouraged,

08:12.241 --> 08:14.777
Jehovah would be sad,

08:14.777 --> 08:19.515
and Satan would be made very happy.

08:19.515 --> 08:21.517
On the other hand,

08:21.517 --> 08:26.522
what if everyone humbly supported 
the elders, perhaps thinking:

08:26.522 --> 08:28.724
‘There’s no scripture

08:28.724 --> 08:32.295
‘that says we can’t paint 
with a two-inch (5 cm) paintbrush.

08:32.295 --> 08:35.865
‘In fact, Hebrews 13:17 tells us

08:35.865 --> 08:40.336
‘to “be obedient” 
and “submissive” to the elders.

08:40.336 --> 08:43.739
So why don’t we go ahead 
and support the elders?’

08:43.739 --> 08:46.976
Now what would be the outcome?

08:46.976 --> 08:49.812
The Kingdom Hall would get painted,

08:49.812 --> 08:52.648
the publishers would get to enjoy

08:52.648 --> 08:54.750
a lot of good association

08:54.750 --> 08:59.088
because they’d be working together 
for a long time,

08:59.088 --> 09:02.558
the elders would be very encouraged,

09:02.558 --> 09:05.094
Satan would be sad,

09:05.094 --> 09:09.298
and Jehovah’s heart would be made glad.

09:10.666 --> 09:15.605
Well, what is the point 
of this hyperbole illustration?

09:15.605 --> 09:19.976
Being obedient and submissive 
to those taking the lead

09:19.976 --> 09:23.813
is much more important 
than how something is done.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.848
That is the attitude

09:25.848 --> 09:29.652
that Jehovah will richly bless.

09:29.652 --> 09:33.089
But, now, a second way we can demonstrate

09:33.089 --> 09:35.825
that we deeply appreciate these dear brothers

09:35.825 --> 09:39.595
is to pray for them.

09:39.595 --> 09:43.099
Please note what the elder Paul urged

09:43.099 --> 09:45.201
the brothers to do for him

09:45.201 --> 09:49.739
at Romans 15:30.

09:50.706 --> 09:52.775
Here Paul said:

09:52.775 --> 09:56.312
“Now I urge you, brothers,

09:56.312 --> 09:59.515
“through our Lord Jesus Christ

09:59.515 --> 10:02.451
“and through the love of the spirit,

10:02.451 --> 10:05.454
“that you exert yourselves with me

10:05.454 --> 10:10.126
in prayers to God for me.”

10:10.760 --> 10:12.795
Paul recognized

10:12.795 --> 10:15.598
the power that he would derive

10:15.598 --> 10:19.001
as a result of others praying for him,

10:19.001 --> 10:23.472
and your local elders feel the same way.

10:23.472 --> 10:25.474
But the question is,

10:25.474 --> 10:28.644
In your personal, private prayers,

10:28.644 --> 10:31.047
do you regularly thank Jehovah

10:31.047 --> 10:33.516
for your “gifts in men” and entreat Jehovah

10:33.516 --> 10:38.287
to richly supply them 
with his powerful holy spirit?

10:38.287 --> 10:42.825
Our answer to that question can reveal much

10:42.825 --> 10:47.363
about our appreciation 
for these hardworking elders.

10:48.597 --> 10:51.567
Now let’s move to a third way

10:51.567 --> 10:54.970
that we can demonstrate deep appreciation:

10:54.970 --> 10:59.508
We can do so by commending the elders.

11:00.443 --> 11:03.346
Here is a soul-searching question:

11:03.346 --> 11:05.381
Do you periodically go up

11:05.381 --> 11:08.818
to various elders and say something like,

11:08.818 --> 11:10.820
“Brother Elder,

11:10.820 --> 11:13.956
“we just want 
to thank you for your hard work.

11:13.956 --> 11:18.027
Please be assured that we appreciate it”?

11:18.027 --> 11:21.030
However, it seems

11:21.030 --> 11:25.434
that some publishers 
never ever commend the elders

11:25.434 --> 11:28.371
or express appreciation.

11:28.371 --> 11:31.807
Might this not indicate 
that we are taking them

11:31.807 --> 11:34.543
and their hard work for granted?

11:34.543 --> 11:38.781
Of course, they will not quit 
if you do not give them commendation;

11:38.781 --> 11:42.485
they primarily do their work for Jehovah.

11:42.485 --> 11:45.321
But if you do express appreciation,

11:45.321 --> 11:50.292
believe me,
it will be most encouraging to them.

11:50.292 --> 11:53.829
And even though 
it may really surprise the elder

11:53.829 --> 11:56.132
the very first time you do this,

11:56.132 --> 11:58.601
please do not hold back

11:58.601 --> 12:03.606
this “good from those to whom it is owing.”

12:03.606 --> 12:05.608
Appropriately,

12:05.608 --> 12:09.612
Jehovah tells us at Proverbs 3:27:

12:09.612 --> 12:14.116
“Do not withhold good 
from those to whom you should give it

12:14.116 --> 12:18.888
if it is within your power to help.”

12:18.888 --> 12:22.358
And one thing 
that will move us to be more aware

12:22.358 --> 12:27.229
of commending the elders is to remember 
all the good work they are doing.

12:27.229 --> 12:29.865
Many elders are family men

12:29.865 --> 12:34.570
who must work secularly 
to provide for their families.

12:34.570 --> 12:36.739
If he has children,

12:36.739 --> 12:41.076
these young ones need time 
and attention from their father.

12:41.076 --> 12:44.146
He may need to help 
them with their schoolwork

12:44.146 --> 12:46.582
as well as schedule time for them

12:46.582 --> 12:49.418
to enjoy wholesome recreation.

12:50.519 --> 12:55.291
Most important, he cares 
for the spiritual needs of his family

12:55.291 --> 12:58.060
—regularly conducting family worship,

12:58.060 --> 13:00.329
working with them in the ministry,

13:00.329 --> 13:02.865
and taking them to meetings.

13:02.865 --> 13:06.535
But in addition 
to these numerous responsibilities

13:06.535 --> 13:09.238
common to many of us,

13:09.238 --> 13:12.208
they have voluminous additional responsibilities

13:12.208 --> 13:14.243
as elders.

13:14.243 --> 13:16.278
And much of the elders’ hard work

13:16.278 --> 13:21.116
in our behalf 
is not seen by the congregation.

13:21.116 --> 13:23.118
For example, you may see

13:23.118 --> 13:25.554
an elder giving a part on the meeting.

13:25.554 --> 13:27.556
What you didn’t see

13:27.556 --> 13:31.627
are the hours he spent preparing that part.

13:31.627 --> 13:34.430
How long does it take you

13:34.430 --> 13:37.099
to prepare a student assignment

13:37.099 --> 13:39.702
on the midweek meeting?

13:39.702 --> 13:42.204
Some elders have a part every week,

13:42.204 --> 13:44.673
sometimes more than one.

13:44.673 --> 13:49.044
While gaining experience 
in speaking is certainly helpful,

13:49.044 --> 13:51.247
the fact remains

13:51.247 --> 13:56.252
that good talks require hard work.

13:56.252 --> 13:59.188
But that is not all that the elders do.

13:59.188 --> 14:01.790
They have shepherding calls to make

14:01.790 --> 14:04.860
and judicial cases to handle.

14:04.860 --> 14:09.298
Some elders are also busy 
helping to build Kingdom Halls

14:09.298 --> 14:11.467
and branch facilities,

14:11.467 --> 14:14.370
serving on Hospital Liaison Committees,

14:14.370 --> 14:17.273
volunteering at assemblies and conventions

14:17.273 --> 14:20.576
—and elders do many other things

14:20.576 --> 14:24.246
that are too numerous to recount.

14:24.246 --> 14:29.251
What we see 
is often only the tip of the iceberg

14:29.251 --> 14:31.820
—90 percent of an iceberg

14:31.820 --> 14:35.457
is unseen underwater.

14:35.457 --> 14:39.428
At 2 Timothy 4:6,

14:39.428 --> 14:42.598
the apostle Paul referred to himself

14:42.598 --> 14:46.802
as “being poured out like a drink offering.”

14:46.802 --> 14:48.804
A drink offering

14:48.804 --> 14:53.676
was poured on the altar 
and went up in smoke.

14:53.676 --> 14:57.413
That well describes how the elders likewise

14:57.413 --> 15:00.215
expend themselves.

15:00.215 --> 15:04.486
Remembering all of this should move us

15:04.486 --> 15:08.123
to regularly offer sincere commendation

15:08.123 --> 15:10.926
to our hardworking elders.

15:10.926 --> 15:14.229
Now we have discussed ways

15:14.229 --> 15:16.231
that we can demonstrate

15:16.231 --> 15:20.970
that we deeply appreciate our “gifts in men.”

15:20.970 --> 15:25.975
We should 
(1) wholeheartedly cooperate with them,

15:27.009 --> 15:29.211
(2) pray for them,

15:29.912 --> 15:32.114
and (3) commend them.

15:32.881 --> 15:34.984
Thereby we will prove

15:34.984 --> 15:37.953
that we are not even slightly like

15:37.953 --> 15:42.992
an unappreciative recipient 
of a silk tie or a silk scarf,

15:42.992 --> 15:47.329
who uses that gift to polish his shoes.

15:47.329 --> 15:49.331
To the contrary,

15:49.331 --> 15:52.501
we will prove to Jehovah and Jesus

15:52.501 --> 15:55.604
that we love, respect,

15:55.604 --> 15:57.606
and appreciate

15:57.606 --> 16:00.609
the divine gifts
—our “gifts in men”—

16:00.609 --> 16:11.781
that they have so generously given to us!
