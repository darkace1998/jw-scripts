00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:04.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, brothers and sisters!

00:00:04.817 --> 00:00:07.653 line:10% position:50% align:center
To begin, we have an encouraging update

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:09.947 line:10% position:50% align:center
about Eritrea.

00:00:09.947 --> 00:00:13.159 line:10% position:50% align:center
You might recall that in April 2014,

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eritrean authorities arrested 31
of our brothers and sisters

00:00:17.747 --> 00:00:20.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
during a peaceful congregation meeting.

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:25.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Mikal Taddesse and her siblings
were among those detained.

00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:27.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her siblings were later released,

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:30.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Sister Mikal remained imprisoned
for her faith.

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:33.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we’re pleased to announce

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:36.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
that on February 25, 2025,

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:39.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
after almost 11 years in prison,

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:43.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Mikal was released
and reunited with her family.

00:00:43.357 --> 00:00:45.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s in good spirits

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is receiving the medical care
that she needs.

00:00:48.988 --> 00:00:53.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray for the 251
brothers and sisters

00:00:53.618 --> 00:00:57.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
around the world
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:00:57.705 --> 00:01:01.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this includes 65 in Eritrea.

00:01:01.543 --> 00:01:03.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our last update,

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:05.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
we reported on various disasters

00:01:05.672 --> 00:01:09.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have affected
our brothers and sisters around the world.

00:01:09.384 --> 00:01:13.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
In just the first six months
of the 2025 service year,

00:01:13.722 --> 00:01:17.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters
have been affected by over 100 disasters.

00:01:19.061 --> 00:01:23.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because of your generous donations
to the worldwide work,

00:01:23.148 --> 00:01:25.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
so far for this service year,

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:29.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve been able to spend
 over six million dollars to provide relief.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank all of you for your loving support.

00:01:34.577 --> 00:01:37.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
material assistance is just one way

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we provide relief
to our brothers and sisters.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:45.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also provide spiritual encouragement
and emotional support.

00:01:45.588 --> 00:01:47.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is highlighted in the following video

00:01:47.757 --> 00:01:50.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our relief efforts
in the state of California

00:01:50.635 --> 00:01:52.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States.

00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:55.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll recall that devastating wildfires

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:58.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
erupted there in January of this year.

00:02:03.315 --> 00:02:07.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you go through something like this,
it just, it—

00:02:07.987 --> 00:02:10.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know how to express it.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
It changes you.

00:02:14.702 --> 00:02:16.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
When someone loses everything,

00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:24.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
the process is overwhelming.

00:02:24.921 --> 00:02:28.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they don’t know how to recover;
they don’t know how to walk through it.

00:02:28.717 --> 00:02:32.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when their recovery effort changes
from a load 

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
for them that they can handle themselves
to a burden for them,

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s when the relief organization
can help them carry that burden.

00:02:43.482 --> 00:02:47.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
The thought at Isaiah 41:10
—it says there that Jehovah

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘really holds on to us.’

00:02:50.156 --> 00:02:53.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is something
that we’ve been able to see come to life.

00:02:53.743 --> 00:02:56.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a single sister, single mama.

00:02:56.662 --> 00:02:59.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I saw the relief team

00:02:59.332 --> 00:03:03.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
come in, that was Jehovah’s hand to me

00:03:03.586 --> 00:03:06.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to say, “My people, I’ve got you.”

00:03:07.715 --> 00:03:11.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters
have gone through great loss,

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:12.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
including even their own homes.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:16.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, while the physical needs
are handled and helped with

00:03:16.183 --> 00:03:18.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of the disaster relief arrangement,

00:03:18.393 --> 00:03:22.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s the spiritual needs
that also need to be given attention to.

00:03:23.565 --> 00:03:27.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has protected you
in the most important way

00:03:27.528 --> 00:03:30.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you have
not lost your faith and you have

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:33.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
not lost your relationship with God.

00:03:33.743 --> 00:03:36.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is Jehovah’s

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:39.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
physical evidence that he loves you.

00:03:42.752 --> 00:03:45.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
We sent messages out to friends
in the congregation,

00:03:45.088 --> 00:03:48.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We need blankets;
we need pillows; we need supplies.”

00:03:48.216 --> 00:03:51.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
And within probably an hour,
things started showing up.

00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:54.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
I appreciate the friends who have 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
taken us in and provided for us.

00:03:57.392 --> 00:04:00.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was so encouraging, so loving.

00:04:00.354 --> 00:04:04.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, you know, it brings you to tears.

00:04:08.028 --> 00:04:11.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t know exactly how
it’s going to work out,

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:14.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
like you can’t pinpoint everything,
but you just know that Jehovah is

00:04:14.368 --> 00:04:16.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
going to take care of you.

00:04:21.334 --> 00:04:24.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just get the sense
that Jehovah is guiding us.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a unique privilege

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cry with the friends,
to hug them, to reassure them

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:36.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when Jehovah says, ‘Throw your burden 
on me,’ he really means it.

00:04:37.851 --> 00:04:39.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s always been real,

00:04:39.478 --> 00:04:42.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
but anytime you see his hand

00:04:42.564 --> 00:04:46.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very real way,
you just naturally draw closer to him.

00:04:46.026 --> 00:04:49.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s a shame
that we go through these kinds of events.

00:04:50.447 --> 00:04:52.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in every single case

00:04:52.157 --> 00:04:55.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
—every single person
from the victim to the person

00:04:55.911 --> 00:04:59.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
who provides relief
—all draw closer to Jehovah.

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:13.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
We deeply appreciate
the hard work and unselfish efforts

00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:16.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all those at the branch offices,

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:19.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
the circuit overseers,
the Disaster Relief Committee members,

00:05:19.853 --> 00:05:23.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many other volunteers worldwide.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, all of us who contribute funds

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:29.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
are also essential to this work.

00:05:29.321 --> 00:05:31.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we all have a share in what

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:34.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Corinthians 8:4

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:36.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
calls “the relief ministry.”

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we support this ministry,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also become “fellow workers” with Jehovah.

00:05:44.837 --> 00:05:48.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 94:17-19,

00:05:48.758 --> 00:05:51.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see what Jehovah is busy doing

00:05:51.386 --> 00:05:54.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our brothers and sisters
in times of distress.

00:05:54.681 --> 00:05:58.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “If Jehovah had not been my helper,

00:05:58.768 --> 00:06:00.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I would soon have perished.

00:06:00.812 --> 00:06:03.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I said: ‘My foot is slipping,’

00:06:03.815 --> 00:06:07.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your loyal love, O Jehovah, 
kept supporting me.

00:06:07.819 --> 00:06:10.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:06:10.239 --> 00:06:13.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
you comforted and soothed me.”

00:06:14.076 --> 00:06:18.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way that Jehovah
uses his organization to provide support

00:06:18.914 --> 00:06:22.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by means of our efforts
to promote literacy.

00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:25.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
For decades,
we’ve organized literacy classes.

00:06:25.921 --> 00:06:29.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve also prepared publications,
such as the brochure

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Apply Yourself to Reading and Writing.</i>

00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:36.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brochure is currently available
in 136 languages,

00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:40.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more than ten million copies
have been produced.

00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:41.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few years ago,

00:06:41.771 --> 00:06:45.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a previous Governing Body update,
we talked about the importance

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
of reading and writing well.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since that update,

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:52.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>Apply Yourself to Reading</i>
<i>and Writing </i> brochure

00:06:52.908 --> 00:06:55.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
was made available on jw.org

00:06:55.327 --> 00:06:58.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that more could easily have access to it.

00:06:58.247 --> 00:07:00.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, in recent times,

00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:05.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve been working to simplify
and speed up the translation and production

00:07:05.546 --> 00:07:08.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
of an updated version of the brochure.

00:07:08.925 --> 00:07:13.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called
<i>Lessons in Reading and Writing.</i>

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:16.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Currently,
selected branches have been invited

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:20.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pilot this new tool
in three different languages.

00:07:21.354 --> 00:07:24.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
These branches
are also organizing literacy classes

00:07:24.858 --> 00:07:27.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that as many as possible can benefit.

00:07:28.737 --> 00:07:31.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why is this so important?

00:07:31.948 --> 00:07:35.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear from two Branch Committee
brothers who serve in Mozambique.

00:07:36.662 --> 00:07:38.080 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our branch territory

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.748 line:10% position:50% align:center
is blessed with exciting growth.

00:07:39.748 --> 00:07:40.958 line:10% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:07:40.958 --> 00:07:42.960 line:10% position:50% align:center
the average number of Bible studies

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
is about two per publisher.

00:07:44.795 --> 00:07:47.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, there’s much potential
for further increase.

00:07:47.423 --> 00:07:48.924 line:10% position:50% align:center
While examining the needs

00:07:48.924 --> 00:07:50.134 line:10% position:50% align:center
of our branch territory

00:07:50.134 --> 00:07:51.510 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the goal of improving,

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.595 line:10% position:50% align:center
we realized that quite 

00:07:52.595 --> 00:07:54.222 line:10% position:50% align:center
a number of our publishers

00:07:54.222 --> 00:07:56.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not read and write well.

00:07:56.682 --> 00:08:00.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
And realistically,
that could limit their participation,

00:08:00.019 --> 00:08:02.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially in the Bible study work.

00:08:02.272 --> 00:08:05.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to address this concern, 
we’ve been encouraging 

00:08:05.316 --> 00:08:08.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
the publishers to attend literacy classes,

00:08:08.028 --> 00:08:10.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the results have been incredible.

00:08:11.072 --> 00:08:14.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, one couple in Mozambique,
Maliko and Jilda,

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:17.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
never had the opportunity to go to school

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:21.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there were no schools in their area
and they had to work a lot.

00:08:21.166 --> 00:08:25.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because they could not read,
they could not conduct any Bible studies.

00:08:25.754 --> 00:08:29.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the circuit overseer
visited their congregation in 2022,

00:08:29.884 --> 00:08:34.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
he encouraged everyone
to enroll in literacy classes.

00:08:34.138 --> 00:08:38.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maliko and Jilda attended a literacy class
and learned to read.

00:08:38.893 --> 00:08:41.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Maliko has four Bible studies

00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:44.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jilda has three and all of their students

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
are attending the meetings regularly.

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:50.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Maliko also has become a regular pioneer.

00:08:50.947 --> 00:08:55.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
In another example,
we have a sister named Ana.

00:08:55.077 --> 00:08:57.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
She did not have access to school

00:08:57.079 --> 00:09:00.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she was raised
in a remote area of the country.

00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:05.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
At almost 50 years of age,
she still could not read,

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:08.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was very difficult for her
to conduct Bible studies.

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:13.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
She tried to start Bible studies by only
showing the pictures and the illustrations

00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:15.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our study publications,

00:09:15.681 --> 00:09:19.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of these limitations,
those studies would soon end.

00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:23.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2024, she attended a literacy class.

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:27.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today, she reads very well.

00:09:27.694 --> 00:09:31.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s conducting
three progressive Bible studies,

00:09:31.323 --> 00:09:34.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible students
regularly attend meetings.

00:09:34.534 --> 00:09:37.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ana says that she is happy and grateful

00:09:37.788 --> 00:09:40.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah and the organization 

00:09:40.582 --> 00:09:42.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
for helping her to learn how to read.

00:09:45.462 --> 00:09:49.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very excited about this pilot program

00:09:49.258 --> 00:09:54.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use the updated tool
<i>Lessons in Reading and Writing.</i>

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we pray that this initiative
will help our brothers and sisters

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
learn to read and write well,
to continue growing spiritually,

00:10:02.605 --> 00:10:06.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to expand in their ministry
—all to Jehovah’s praise.

00:10:08.319 --> 00:10:11.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, at this time of year,

00:10:11.698 --> 00:10:16.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
our minds and hearts are focused
on the upcoming Memorial of Jesus’ death.

00:10:17.078 --> 00:10:21.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year’s Memorial
will be held on Saturday, April 12.

00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:25.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the special talk entitled
“Can Truth Be Found?”

00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:29.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be given in most congregations
during the week of March 31.

00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we do every year,

00:10:33.804 --> 00:10:38.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to invite as many as possible
to attend the special talk and the Memorial.

00:10:38.809 --> 00:10:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes family members, Bible students,

00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:45.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
return visits,
and any others that we might know.

00:10:46.943 --> 00:10:49.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we invite them,

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:53.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s make good use of the jw.org home page,

00:10:53.158 --> 00:10:56.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will feature content
related to these two events.

00:10:58.371 --> 00:11:01.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, have you thought
about auxiliary pioneering?

00:11:02.751 --> 00:11:07.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, all publishers
may do so with a 15-hour requirement

00:11:07.214 --> 00:11:10.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the months of March and April.

00:11:11.385 --> 00:11:12.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not pray about it?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reflecting on Jesus’ ransom sacrifice

00:11:17.975 --> 00:11:21.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us peace
and fills our hearts with gratitude.

00:11:22.897 --> 00:11:26.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’d agree that we need that peace 

00:11:26.234 --> 00:11:29.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
now more than ever before!

00:11:29.278 --> 00:11:32.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all,
this system of things is so volatile.

00:11:32.907 --> 00:11:34.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like a restless sea.

00:11:34.909 --> 00:11:38.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on top of that,
we face stormy tests of our own faith.

00:11:40.123 --> 00:11:43.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite these stressful circumstances,

00:11:43.043 --> 00:11:45.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah’s people,

00:11:45.253 --> 00:11:48.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have true peace.

00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how is that possible?

00:11:50.634 --> 00:11:53.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because of a special gift

00:11:53.303 --> 00:11:56.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus promised to give his disciples.

00:11:56.932 --> 00:11:59.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that gift?

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:01.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s read his encouraging words

00:12:01.312 --> 00:12:04.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
at John 14:27

00:12:04.649 --> 00:12:07.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were spoken on the night
just before his death.

00:12:07.944 --> 00:12:09.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said to them:

00:12:09.987 --> 00:12:12.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I leave you peace;

00:12:12.615 --> 00:12:15.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I give you my peace.

00:12:15.493 --> 00:12:18.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I do not give it to you
the way that the world gives it.

00:12:18.788 --> 00:12:21.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not let your hearts be troubled

00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:24.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor let them shrink out of fear.”

00:12:24.169 --> 00:12:28.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jesus gave his disciples
a wonderful gift.

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it?

00:12:30.968 --> 00:12:32.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peace.”

00:12:33.011 --> 00:12:35.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this wasn’t simply a lack of conflict.

00:12:35.764 --> 00:12:38.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!
Jesus said: “I give you my peace.”

00:12:39.685 --> 00:12:44.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the peace that Jesus had
didn’t depend on his circumstances.

00:12:44.065 --> 00:12:46.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
He experienced inner peace because he knew

00:12:46.943 --> 00:12:50.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah loved and approved of him.

00:12:50.404 --> 00:12:53.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus promised his disciples

00:12:53.074 --> 00:12:57.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they too
would have this same kind of peace.

00:12:57.036 --> 00:13:01.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how this 
must have comforted their anxious hearts!

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:05.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the same is true for us

00:13:05.503 --> 00:13:09.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we face the uncertainties
of the last days.

00:13:09.383 --> 00:13:13.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re blessed to have
a peaceful relationship with Jehovah

00:13:13.011 --> 00:13:15.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on our faith in the ransom.

00:13:15.597 --> 00:13:17.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that gives us hope.

00:13:17.641 --> 00:13:19.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows us to keep calm

00:13:19.643 --> 00:13:23.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the uncertain times we’re living in.

00:13:23.063 --> 00:13:25.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
It stabilizes us.

00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the poetic way
that Psalm 46:2 expresses it.

00:13:31.614 --> 00:13:35.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “That is why we will not fear,

00:13:35.952 --> 00:13:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“though the earth undergoes change,

00:13:37.954 --> 00:13:41.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
though the mountains topple
into the depths of the sea.”

00:13:41.958 --> 00:13:45.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t this verse remind us
of the turbulent times we live in?

00:13:47.047 --> 00:13:49.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the last days, we may see

00:13:49.508 --> 00:13:52.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
long-standing,
mountainlike institutions crumble,

00:13:52.928 --> 00:13:55.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if they were toppling into the sea.

00:13:56.890 --> 00:13:59.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, how will we respond?

00:14:00.728 --> 00:14:04.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the verse says: “We will not fear.”

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:06.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not?

00:14:06.233 --> 00:14:09.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, verses 5-7 tell us the answer.

00:14:09.779 --> 00:14:13.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “God is in the city;

00:14:13.032 --> 00:14:15.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it cannot be overthrown.

00:14:15.451 --> 00:14:19.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God will come to its aid
at the break of dawn.

00:14:19.372 --> 00:14:22.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The nations were in an uproar,
the kingdoms were overthrown;

00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:27.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he raised his voice, and the earth melted.

00:14:27.505 --> 00:14:30.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah of armies is with us;

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the God of Jacob is our secure refuge.”

00:14:35.514 --> 00:14:39.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the uncertainty of this system increases,

00:14:39.059 --> 00:14:41.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not need to be in fear.

00:14:42.604 --> 00:14:47.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, God is in full control

00:14:47.026 --> 00:14:50.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“Jehovah of armies is with us”!

00:14:50.196 --> 00:14:52.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will come to the aid of his people.

00:14:52.698 --> 00:14:55.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is “our secure refuge.”

00:14:56.494 --> 00:15:00.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at times, we may still feel anxiety

00:15:00.039 --> 00:15:02.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the events
that are happening around us.

00:15:04.419 --> 00:15:06.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does the Bible encourage us to do?

00:15:08.131 --> 00:15:11.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 4:6, 7,

00:15:11.843 --> 00:15:16.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re encouraged to pour out
our hearts to Jehovah.

00:15:16.139 --> 00:15:19.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we do that, what will happen?

00:15:19.685 --> 00:15:21.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to verse 7,

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:26.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll experience something
beyond “all understanding”

00:15:26.108 --> 00:15:28.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“the peace of God.”

00:15:28.903 --> 00:15:32.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that peace will keep us calm and stable

00:15:32.615 --> 00:15:35.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the disturbing things taking place.

00:15:37.119 --> 00:15:41.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, doesn’t this motivate us
to show our appreciation

00:15:41.207 --> 00:15:45.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what God and Christ have done for us
by means of the ransom?

00:15:45.712 --> 00:15:48.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the ways we can show our gratitude

00:15:48.757 --> 00:15:51.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
is through the preaching work.

00:15:51.051 --> 00:15:53.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we preach,

00:15:53.094 --> 00:15:56.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
we search for ‘friends of peace’

00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those who also want to have peace with God.

00:16:01.144 --> 00:16:03.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
So during this Memorial season,

00:16:03.605 --> 00:16:08.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s invite as many as we can
to learn about and to appreciate

00:16:08.319 --> 00:16:13.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah and Christ Jesus
have done for us by means of the ransom.

00:16:15.826 --> 00:16:18.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we conclude,

00:16:18.079 --> 00:16:20.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re happy to announce the release
