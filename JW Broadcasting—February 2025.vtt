Welcome to JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:05.943 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month we’ll explore
the appealing quality of humility

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:12.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the many ways it enriches our life

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brings joy to Jehovah.

00:00:16.161 --> 00:00:18.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how husbands and wives

00:00:18.747 --> 00:00:22.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
can work together with humility
to resolve disagreements

00:00:22.877 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
and restore peace in their marriage.

00:00:27.131 --> 00:00:32.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you find it difficult to navigate
this increasingly polarized world?

00:00:32.177 --> 00:00:34.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll hear from young publishers

00:00:34.263 --> 00:00:38.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have learned
to imitate humbly Jehovah’s reasonableness.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:43.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you sometimes discouraged by your flaws?

00:00:43.522 --> 00:00:45.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video

00:00:45.941 --> 00:00:48.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
invites us to be like soft clay

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah molds
into a beautiful spiritual person.

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for February 2025!

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:22.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever considered
who is the greatest example of humility?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.482 line:10% position:50% align:center
If your answer is Jehovah, you’re correct.

00:01:26.482 --> 00:01:27.983 line:10% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:32.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because every living, intelligent creation
is inferior to him;

00:01:32.947 --> 00:01:37.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet, he chose to
and continues to include others

00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:39.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his activities.

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility can be described
as ‘lowliness of mind

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:48.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being free from pride and arrogance.’

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:51.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person finds happiness

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:55.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
in including others
in his life and endeavors.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:58.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of its many benefits,

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
our theme for discussion this month is

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:06.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Humility—A Quality
That Will Enrich Our Life Eternally.”

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s great measure of humility
became apparent

00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:15.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he collaborated
with his only-begotten Son

00:02:15.614 --> 00:02:19.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and included him
as his “master worker” in creation.

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:23.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, as angels were created,

00:02:23.872 --> 00:02:26.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
these mighty spirit creatures

00:02:26.125 --> 00:02:30.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
imitated the humility
already being shown by Jehovah.

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
These faithful angels

00:02:33.048 --> 00:02:37.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
were free from pride and arrogance.

00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:42.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
This resulted in everyone in heaven
enjoying peace for eons of time.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility in heaven is like oil to an engine;

00:02:47.438 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
it keeps things running smoothly.

00:02:51.483 --> 00:02:53.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan was the first one to succumb

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:56.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the temptation of pride and arrogance,

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejecting the godlike quality of humility.

00:03:00.826 --> 00:03:05.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he did so,
rebellion and turmoil soon followed.

00:03:06.665 --> 00:03:08.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s important for us to note

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the need for humility didn’t arise

00:03:12.796 --> 00:03:17.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of sin,
rebellion, and imperfection.

00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:21.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility existed before these ugly traits.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also vital for us to understand

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that while Jehovah is inferior to no one,

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s not the case with us.

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows that the quality of humility

00:03:34.943 --> 00:03:37.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us in our imperfect condition.

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:41.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
it will help us to imitate him,

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:43.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
to faithfully serve him,

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to survive the end
of this system of things.

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:48.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah knows

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:52.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humility will enrich our lives today

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:54.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eternally.

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:59.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see how important
this endearing quality is to Jehovah

00:03:59.593 --> 00:04:04.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we read Psalm 45:3, 4.

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave these prophetic instructions
to his kingly Son

00:04:08.227 --> 00:04:10.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the great battle in heaven:

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Strap your sword on your side, O mighty one,

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:18.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in your dignity and your splendor.

00:04:18.987 --> 00:04:21.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And in your splendor go on to victory;

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:24.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ride in the cause of truth and humility

00:04:24.952 --> 00:04:26.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
and righteousness.”

00:04:27.287 --> 00:04:30.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
These verses describe Jesus Christ

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:33.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a king riding in battle

00:04:33.627 --> 00:04:37.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
to defend truth, humility, and righteousness.

00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:41.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest truth he defends

00:04:41.051 --> 00:04:43.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the sanctification
of Jehovah’s great name.

00:04:44.847 --> 00:04:47.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
In connection with righteousness,

00:04:47.182 --> 00:04:50.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
he supports Jehovah’s standards
of right and wrong.

00:04:50.853 --> 00:04:53.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the case of humility,

00:04:53.021 --> 00:04:55.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
he restores it to its rightful place

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:58.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
among all intelligent creation.

00:05:00.195 --> 00:05:04.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus has already reaffirmed
these timeless standards in heaven.

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:07.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon he’ll do the same for the earth,

00:05:07.452 --> 00:05:09.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the commission to save only those

00:05:09.746 --> 00:05:13.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are humble and obedient.

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:16.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our developing and displaying humility, then,

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
is essential to our survival.

00:05:20.424 --> 00:05:23.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you want to know
if you are truly humble at heart,

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask yourself,
‘How do others view me?’

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:30.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you serve as a congregation elder,

00:05:30.893 --> 00:05:35.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
do your fellow elders
feel comfortable giving you counsel?

00:05:36.231 --> 00:05:38.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was the last time they did so?

00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:41.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you react?

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:43.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re serving as a pioneer,

00:05:43.572 --> 00:05:47.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you endeavor to learn
from those with less experience?

00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:51.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do our loved ones in our family

00:05:51.455 --> 00:05:55.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel that we really consider
their opinion on matters?

00:05:57.336 --> 00:06:00.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are questions like these important?

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:03.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because a truly humble person

00:06:03.091 --> 00:06:07.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
will make a realistic assessment of himself
with such questions.

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:06:09.306 --> 00:06:13.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because humility
is directly related to honesty.

00:06:14.686 --> 00:06:17.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
True humility enables us

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:20.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see ourselves as we really are

00:06:20.067 --> 00:06:25.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to honestly admit
all of our weaknesses and failures.

00:06:26.406 --> 00:06:29.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,
pride and arrogance

00:06:29.243 --> 00:06:32.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
are directly related to deception.

00:06:32.788 --> 00:06:37.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
An arrogant person
covers up his weaknesses and failures.

00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:39.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that can only last so long

00:06:39.628 --> 00:06:43.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
because eventually ‘pride leads to a crash,’

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:47.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Proverbs 16:18 warns us.

00:06:48.762 --> 00:06:53.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider five ways
that humility enriches our life.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the Bible clearly teaches

00:06:57.479 --> 00:07:01.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humble people receive God’s help.

00:07:01.566 --> 00:07:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
One example is David.

00:07:04.152 --> 00:07:07.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
He became a powerful king in Israel.

00:07:07.281 --> 00:07:10.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, notice whom
he attributed his greatness to

00:07:10.742 --> 00:07:13.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 18:35:

00:07:14.538 --> 00:07:17.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You give me your shield of salvation,

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:19.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your right hand supports me,

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:22.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your humility makes me great.”

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:28.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah is humble,
he lowered himself to assist David,

00:07:28.343 --> 00:07:32.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
enabling this humble man
to become a mighty king.

00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:36.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Down to our day, Jehovah delights

00:07:36.518 --> 00:07:39.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to the aid of his humble servants.

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:44.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you not felt him ‘stoop down,’
as it were, to help you?

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:49.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second benefit
is that having a humble disposition

00:07:49.573 --> 00:07:51.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
will protect us

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:55.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just as a heavy coat
can protect us from harsh elements.

00:07:56.413 --> 00:08:01.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also makes our personality
more attractive to Jehovah and to others.

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:05.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the word picture Peter used

00:08:05.464 --> 00:08:08.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 5:5b:

00:08:09.426 --> 00:08:13.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But all of you clothe yourselves
with humility toward one another,

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:17.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because God opposes the haughty ones,

00:08:17.476 --> 00:08:20.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he gives undeserved kindness
to the humble ones.”

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:26.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clothing both protects and dignifies.

00:08:26.026 --> 00:08:30.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re missing an item of clothing
or our clothing is frayed,

00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:32.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
others can surely see it.

00:08:32.783 --> 00:08:36.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, others can usually see

00:08:36.244 --> 00:08:40.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re not fully clothed with humility.

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:44.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,
the more humility we display,

00:08:44.628 --> 00:08:48.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more attractive we are
to Jehovah and to others.

00:08:48.673 --> 00:08:51.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like a favorite garment,

00:08:51.176 --> 00:08:54.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility should be our go-to quality

00:08:54.596 --> 00:08:57.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s perfect for any occasion.

00:08:58.934 --> 00:09:01.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
A third benefit of humility

00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:04.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that it fosters teamwork.

00:09:05.148 --> 00:09:09.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
When coworkers apply Philippians 2:3,

00:09:09.736 --> 00:09:12.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re able to enjoy
productive collaboration.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
That verse says:

00:09:16.743 --> 00:09:20.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:09:20.789 --> 00:09:25.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with humility
consider others superior to you.”

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:31.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we appreciate that everyone
is superior to us in some way,

00:09:31.174 --> 00:09:35.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be more inclined
to listen to their suggestions.

00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:40.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility promotes cooperation,
not competition.

00:09:40.142 --> 00:09:44.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humble people see others
as resources and contributors,

00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:46.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
not rivals.

00:09:46.648 --> 00:09:49.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider a single musician.

00:09:50.026 --> 00:09:55.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
By himself, he can generally only produce
the sound from one instrument.

00:09:55.031 --> 00:09:58.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as a member of an orchestra,

00:09:58.034 --> 00:10:01.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire musical performance is enriched.

00:10:02.247 --> 00:10:07.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble musician
finds contentment in collaboration,

00:10:07.002 --> 00:10:10.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if that places him in the background.

00:10:10.755 --> 00:10:15.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t aspire to receive
all of the attention of a solo performance

00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:20.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to play so loud
that he drowns out his fellow performers.

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:24.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
One translation renders “humility”

00:10:24.144 --> 00:10:26.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 2:3

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:29.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be “self-effacing.”

00:10:30.025 --> 00:10:33.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means
to make ourselves inconspicuous,

00:10:33.862 --> 00:10:37.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
working in the background
and avoiding the limelight.

00:10:38.992 --> 00:10:42.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s like a photographer
who takes portraits of others

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:44.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of himself.

00:10:44.539 --> 00:10:47.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as he focuses on others,

00:10:47.250 --> 00:10:52.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
the photographer endeavors
to capture their features in the best light

00:10:52.214 --> 00:10:55.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they look their best.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:10:58.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same principle applies
to our sacred service.

00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:01.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
In all aspects of our worship,

00:11:01.598 --> 00:11:05.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s remember
that we’re part of Jehovah’s team.

00:11:05.644 --> 00:11:09.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
By all of us humbly cooperating together,

00:11:09.105 --> 00:11:12.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be useful to Jehovah
in accomplishing his will.

00:11:13.735 --> 00:11:16.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our humility will put others

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:20.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a favorable light
with God and with others.

00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:24.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
A fourth benefit of humility

00:11:24.788 --> 00:11:27.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that a humble person genuinely enjoys

00:11:27.958 --> 00:11:31.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing others make advancement
or receive privileges.

00:11:32.587 --> 00:11:35.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
John the Baptist
is a good example in this regard.

00:11:35.966 --> 00:11:37.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbly acknowledged

00:11:37.968 --> 00:11:41.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus’ ministry
would “keep on increasing”

00:11:41.429 --> 00:11:46.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
as his own work
would “keep on decreasing.”

00:11:46.226 --> 00:11:49.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did John feel about that?

00:11:49.104 --> 00:11:51.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing the advancement of Jesus

00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:55.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
moved John to say at John 3:29:

00:11:55.402 --> 00:11:58.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My joy has been made complete.”

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like John,

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:05.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility allows a brother
to be an overseer at one time

00:12:05.745 --> 00:12:09.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one being overseen at another time.

00:12:10.166 --> 00:12:13.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have the privilege
to serve as a congregation elder,

00:12:13.753 --> 00:12:18.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you see how this spirit
would benefit your entire elder body?

00:12:18.758 --> 00:12:21.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
A fifth benefit is that humility helps us

00:12:21.803 --> 00:12:24.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
to endure opposition.

00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:28.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person doesn’t feel
he’s above being reproached.

00:12:28.893 --> 00:12:33.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s able to endure unpleasant situations
and not retaliate

00:12:33.565 --> 00:12:36.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Jehovah permits him to suffer adversity.

00:12:37.777 --> 00:12:40.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the example of Jesus as highlighted

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 2:23.

00:12:44.034 --> 00:12:46.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says:

00:12:46.036 --> 00:12:50.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he was being insulted,
he did not insult in return.

00:12:50.457 --> 00:12:54.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he was suffering,
he did not threaten,

00:12:54.169 --> 00:12:58.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he entrusted himself
to the One who judges righteously.”

00:13:00.467 --> 00:13:02.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped Jesus to endure?

00:13:02.927 --> 00:13:04.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility.

00:13:04.929 --> 00:13:08.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t think: ‘Do you know who I am?

00:13:08.475 --> 00:13:10.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have to suffer like this!’

00:13:12.312 --> 00:13:15.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise,
our maintaining a humble demeanor

00:13:15.607 --> 00:13:19.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
may well serve as a protection for us,

00:13:19.194 --> 00:13:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even moving observers
to come to our aid

00:13:22.739 --> 00:13:24.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
when others oppose us.

00:13:25.617 --> 00:13:29.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve just talked
about five benefits of humility,

00:13:29.954 --> 00:13:32.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there are many others.

00:13:32.499 --> 00:13:36.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if we find
that our background or culture

00:13:36.294 --> 00:13:40.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes cultivating humility
especially challenging for us?

00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:43.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this is how you feel,

00:13:43.885 --> 00:13:45.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may be encouraged by the example

00:13:45.887 --> 00:13:48.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a Roman army officer introduced to us

00:13:48.723 --> 00:13:50.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Matthew chapter 8.

00:13:52.102 --> 00:13:54.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Roman centurion

00:13:54.104 --> 00:13:57.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
had direct command of about 100 soldiers.

00:13:57.607 --> 00:13:59.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
He likely had a past littered

00:13:59.776 --> 00:14:03.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
with many acts of violence and bloodshed.

00:14:03.196 --> 00:14:06.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility was likely not a quality associated

00:14:06.658 --> 00:14:08.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
with many officers of this rank.

00:14:09.369 --> 00:14:13.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the account at Matthew 8:5-8:

00:14:14.874 --> 00:14:18.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he [Jesus] entered Capernaum,

00:14:18.128 --> 00:14:21.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“an army officer came to him,
pleading with him and saying:

00:14:21.923 --> 00:14:26.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Sir, my servant
is laid up in the house with paralysis,

00:14:26.344 --> 00:14:29.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he is suffering terribly.’

00:14:29.264 --> 00:14:33.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to him:
‘When I get there, I will cure him.’

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The army officer replied:

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Sir, I am not worthy
to have you come under my roof,

00:14:40.275 --> 00:14:44.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just say the word
and my servant will be healed.’”

00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:50.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
The officer’s addressing Jesus twice as “Sir”
was significant,

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:54.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
since Romans generally despised Jews.

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:57.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
This army officer also said in verse 8:

00:14:57.834 --> 00:14:59.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am not worthy.”

00:14:59.878 --> 00:15:04.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, “I’m not important enough
for you to come under my roof.”

00:15:05.967 --> 00:15:08.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though unnamed in the Scriptures,

00:15:08.261 --> 00:15:12.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
he proved himself
to be an outstanding example of humility.

00:15:13.641 --> 00:15:16.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what Jesus said about this officer

00:15:16.227 --> 00:15:18.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 8:10:

00:15:19.564 --> 00:15:21.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Jesus heard that,

00:15:21.357 --> 00:15:24.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was amazed
and said to those following him:

00:15:24.527 --> 00:15:26.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I tell you the truth,

00:15:26.571 --> 00:15:30.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
with no one in Israel
have I found so great a faith.’”

00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:34.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does this account encourage us?

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:38.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite our past, like the army officer,

00:15:38.333 --> 00:15:41.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us can develop humility.

00:15:41.669 --> 00:15:43.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we do so?

00:15:44.464 --> 00:15:48.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cultivate a desire
to be humble to your very core.

00:15:49.677 --> 00:15:53.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frequently remind yourself
that to please God,

00:15:53.223 --> 00:15:55.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must be humble.

00:15:55.558 --> 00:15:59.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also remember that pride and arrogance

00:15:59.145 --> 00:16:01.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
are traits of Satan.

00:16:01.773 --> 00:16:04.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep the correct perspective

00:16:04.317 --> 00:16:07.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
by meditating on your insignificance

00:16:07.111 --> 00:16:09.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
compared to Jehovah.

00:16:09.531 --> 00:16:11.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
And pray to Jehovah for help

00:16:11.574 --> 00:16:14.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
to display humility as he does.

00:16:15.495 --> 00:16:18.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Happiness in marriage requires humility,

00:16:18.498 --> 00:16:22.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when husbands and wives
don’t see eye to eye.

00:16:23.336 --> 00:16:26.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a disagreement leads to hurt feelings,

00:16:26.339 --> 00:16:28.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
do we find it hard to apologize?

00:16:29.717 --> 00:16:32.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what can help in this episode

00:16:32.262 --> 00:16:35.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>For a Happy Marriage.</i>

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
A strong marriage

00:16:47.861 --> 00:16:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be an oasis of peace
in a difficult world.

00:16:52.532 --> 00:16:55.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no matter how strong the bond,

00:16:55.243 --> 00:16:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
every marriage consists

00:16:57.745 --> 00:17:01.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
of an imperfect man

00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:07.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an imperfect woman
living in a confined space.

00:17:23.771 --> 00:17:26.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in a happy marriage,

00:17:26.357 --> 00:17:29.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
disagreements can arise
that lead loving spouses

00:17:29.694 --> 00:17:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use hurtful words.

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:39.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
At a certain point, you may not even remember
how the disagreement started.

00:17:39.871 --> 00:17:43.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, the conflict escalates.

00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has this ever happened to you?

00:17:51.883 --> 00:17:54.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you apologize and make things right?

00:17:57.472 --> 00:18:01.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
The mere passing of time
won’t make the hurt disappear.

00:18:04.562 --> 00:18:05.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
The real triumph

00:18:05.730 --> 00:18:10.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
—peace—can only come about
with a sincere apology.

00:18:13.112 --> 00:18:17.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:18:17.158 --> 00:18:21.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with humility
consider others superior to you.”

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:27.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try to see things
from your spouse’s viewpoint.

00:19:15.883 --> 00:19:19.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would a sincere apology make you feel?

00:19:25.435 --> 00:19:28.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let your ego get in the way.

00:19:32.358 --> 00:19:36.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take responsibility
for your part in the dispute

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:39.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if you don’t think
you’ve done anything wrong.

00:19:40.658 --> 00:19:43.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acknowledge the hurt
you’ve caused your spouse,

00:19:44.996 --> 00:19:48.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be quick to accept
each other’s sincere apologies.

00:19:49.584 --> 00:19:52.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peaceful relationships are worth much more

00:19:52.837 --> 00:19:54.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
than pride or victory.

00:20:00.636 --> 00:20:02.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
But peace 

00:20:02.263 --> 00:20:05.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the family must be maintained.

00:20:32.502 --> 00:20:34.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be easy

00:20:34.045 --> 00:20:36.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
to focus on your mate’s flaws.

00:20:36.798 --> 00:20:40.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you feel like
you’re being pushed to your limit,

00:20:41.427 --> 00:20:42.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember

00:20:43.513 --> 00:20:47.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 3:2 says:

00:20:47.475 --> 00:20:50.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We all stumble many times.”

00:20:57.735 --> 00:21:01.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
The quicker you apologize,
no matter who is to blame,

00:21:01.656 --> 00:21:06.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
the faster you restore
the peace and happiness in your family.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:11.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you sincerely apologize

00:21:11.415 --> 00:21:14.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
and accept your mate’s apology,

00:21:14.585 --> 00:21:17.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
you put your marriage ahead of yourself

00:21:17.421 --> 00:21:20.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue to strengthen your bond of love.

00:21:24.804 --> 00:21:27.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every couple will have disagreements.

00:21:27.348 --> 00:21:29.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take the time now

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prepare together
for a peaceful resolution.

00:21:35.815 --> 00:21:39.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier we noted that humility
is linked to honesty.

00:21:40.736 --> 00:21:43.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being honest with ourselves

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:46.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our own weaknesses and faults

00:21:46.117 --> 00:21:48.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
cultivates empathy for our spouse

00:21:48.911 --> 00:21:53.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and makes it easier to offer
and accept a sincere apology.

00:21:54.417 --> 00:21:56.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Promoting peace outside the home

00:21:56.961 --> 00:22:00.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be even more challenging
in this deeply divided world.

00:22:01.674 --> 00:22:05.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are ideologically polarized.

00:22:05.178 --> 00:22:07.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some argue that we should accept

00:22:07.221 --> 00:22:11.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
every lifestyle and belief without exception.

00:22:11.142 --> 00:22:14.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others view those
who are different with hatred.

00:22:15.354 --> 00:22:19.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible reveals,
from Jehovah’s perspective,

00:22:19.108 --> 00:22:21.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we should treat others.

00:22:21.611 --> 00:22:23.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next segment,

00:22:23.613 --> 00:22:28.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
see how learning about this strengthened
the faith of two young ones.

00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:39.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what ways have you seen people
treat others who are different from them?

00:22:40.713 --> 00:22:42.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was at school,

00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:45.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
a common viewpoint of my schoolmates
was that you should be accepting

00:22:45.968 --> 00:22:48.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
of whatever lifestyle
someone chooses to lead.

00:22:49.263 --> 00:22:53.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Teachers would encourage us to support
those with different sexual orientations.

00:22:56.896 --> 00:23:00.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my final year of high school,
a new teacher arrived.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:02.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was different.

00:23:02.902 --> 00:23:05.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
He came from the capital,
and I lived in a small town.

00:23:09.867 --> 00:23:12.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had spent many years at university

00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:14.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and didn’t believe in God.

00:23:14.372 --> 00:23:17.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
On social media, it was very common

00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see extreme viewpoints
about different lifestyles.

00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:26.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
I often saw comments
attacking others for their lifestyles.

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:32.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
The teacher had a very different personality.

00:23:32.014 --> 00:23:34.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
He seemed to like attacking the students

00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:36.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and putting them on the spot.

00:23:36.435 --> 00:23:40.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would ask probing questions
about controversial topics in class

00:23:40.564 --> 00:23:42.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even made comments to the class like,

00:23:42.566 --> 00:23:45.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The people from here
aren’t made for learning.”

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the students
didn’t react very well.

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:51.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of them refused to attend his classes,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if they did, they refused to speak to him
during the class.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember them saying,

00:23:56.414 --> 00:23:58.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m not going to talk with that atheist.”

00:23:58.833 --> 00:24:01.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember that some classmates
would say to me,

00:24:01.377 --> 00:24:04.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t Jehovah’s Witnesses
hate gay people?”

00:24:05.881 --> 00:24:10.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seemed like many students assumed
that we must have an extreme viewpoint

00:24:10.177 --> 00:24:14.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we would completely reject those
who don’t conform to our beliefs.

00:24:17.435 --> 00:24:19.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped you get the Bible’s viewpoint?

00:24:20.938 --> 00:24:24.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents always helped me
to have a balanced viewpoint.

00:24:26.152 --> 00:24:28.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was growing up,

00:24:28.237 --> 00:24:32.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
they helped me understand that even though
we completely reject certain conduct,

00:24:32.825 --> 00:24:35.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t hate the person who practices it.

00:24:35.619 --> 00:24:37.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned a lot from my mom’s example.

00:24:37.955 --> 00:24:40.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
She used to work at a beauty salon,

00:24:40.124 --> 00:24:43.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I saw how she
was always kind to others she worked with,

00:24:43.794 --> 00:24:46.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of their sexual orientation.

00:24:46.714 --> 00:24:48.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought of Jesus’ example

00:24:48.632 --> 00:24:52.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how he shared the message with everyone
no matter their thinking or background.

00:24:53.971 --> 00:24:56.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus took the time to talk with them,

00:24:56.015 --> 00:24:58.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter who they were
or what others thought of them.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love the scripture at Matthew 5:45,

00:25:02.563 --> 00:25:04.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says that Jehovah
makes the sun shine

00:25:04.774 --> 00:25:07.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the rain fall on all people.

00:25:07.902 --> 00:25:10.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is an expression of his love,

00:25:10.112 --> 00:25:12.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide what each person needs

00:25:12.239 --> 00:25:14.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter who they are.

00:25:14.658 --> 00:25:16.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I was thinking about Jesus’ example,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remembered his words recorded at Matthew,

00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he tells us
that what “you want men to do to you,

00:25:22.458 --> 00:25:24.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
you also must do to them.”

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
This helped me to think about
how I should act around my teacher.

00:25:27.922 --> 00:25:30.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made me treat him differently.

00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:35.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, if Jehovah, the Almighty God,

00:25:35.638 --> 00:25:40.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
is kind, good, and respectful toward all,

00:25:40.184 --> 00:25:42.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
why shouldn’t I be?

00:25:42.186 --> 00:25:45.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that would include those
whose conduct I don’t agree with.

00:25:45.606 --> 00:25:49.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has given us the best way
to show our love for our neighbor,

00:25:49.443 --> 00:25:51.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
by helping them to come to know him.

00:25:55.616 --> 00:25:58.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has been the outcome
of applying Bible principles?

00:26:00.287 --> 00:26:04.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
At my previous job, I worked at a hotel
where there was a waiter who was gay.

00:26:04.667 --> 00:26:07.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of his coworkers would treat him poorly.

00:26:08.587 --> 00:26:10.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I made sure I didn’t join in with them

00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:14.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and treated him like I would anyone else.

00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:16.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to have conversations
with my teacher about the Bible

00:26:16.971 --> 00:26:18.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and share scriptures with him.

00:26:18.848 --> 00:26:22.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was impressed by what the Bible
had to say on scientific matters

00:26:22.184 --> 00:26:24.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said he wanted to find out more.

00:26:24.937 --> 00:26:28.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, the waiter came up to me
and thanked me for being different

00:26:28.566 --> 00:26:30.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the others in the way I treated him.

00:26:30.818 --> 00:26:34.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even some of the other waiters
asked me why I was like that.

00:26:34.572 --> 00:26:36.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
This opened up the opportunity

00:26:36.782 --> 00:26:40.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
to explain that I try
to apply Bible principles in my life,

00:26:40.035 --> 00:26:42.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
including how I treat others.

00:26:43.539 --> 00:26:47.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a noticeable change in the teacher
as the school year went on.

00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:50.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told me that he was impressed
by my conduct

00:26:50.087 --> 00:26:53.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because I had spoken with him
when none of the other students would.

00:26:53.924 --> 00:26:55.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
His classes became so much better

00:26:55.593 --> 00:26:57.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he started
to be nicer to his students.

00:26:59.138 --> 00:27:01.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little by little,
the students returned to class,

00:27:01.724 --> 00:27:03.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by the end of the year,

00:27:03.726 --> 00:27:06.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
it had become one of the classes
that we enjoyed the most.

00:27:07.813 --> 00:27:10.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I think about the way
that Jehovah treats people

00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:13.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he gives everyone a chance
to learn about him,

00:27:13.611 --> 00:27:16.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m drawn to him even more.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:28.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living by Bible standards doesn’t mean

00:27:28.459 --> 00:27:33.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we agree with every belief
or opinion that others have.

00:27:33.005 --> 00:27:37.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does mean treating everyone
with dignity and respect,

00:27:37.635 --> 00:27:40.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of the choices they make.

00:27:41.889 --> 00:27:46.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants all people
to have an opportunity to know him.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:50.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Public witnessing
has long been a powerful way

00:27:50.231 --> 00:27:52.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish this.

00:27:52.358 --> 00:27:56.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, many aspects of this work
have changed over time,

00:27:56.445 --> 00:27:58.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ll see in this episode

00:27:58.572 --> 00:28:01.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:28:05.621 --> 00:28:09.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we preach to people wherever we find them.

00:28:11.168 --> 00:28:14.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, our literature carts and displays
are a common sight all over the world.

00:28:16.715 --> 00:28:18.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did public witnessing get started?

00:28:20.135 --> 00:28:22.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll explore this story
of courage and innovation

00:28:22.638 --> 00:28:25.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this episode of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:28:30.104 --> 00:28:32.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus set the precedent
for public witnessing.

00:28:32.565 --> 00:28:35.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
He taught in the “main streets”
and “along the road.”

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:38.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul
and other first-century Christians

00:28:38.988 --> 00:28:40.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed that courageous pattern.

00:28:42.241 --> 00:28:45.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s modern-day people
follow a similar example.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the late 1800’s, the Bible Students,
as we were called back then,

00:28:51.584 --> 00:28:54.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
published a booklet called
<i>The Bible vs. Evolution.</i>

00:28:56.088 --> 00:28:57.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
The goal?

00:28:57.131 --> 00:29:00.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
To distribute over 300,000 copies.

00:29:00.384 --> 00:29:04.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there was only
a small group of Bible Students at the time.

00:29:04.305 --> 00:29:06.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could they distribute
that much literature?

00:29:09.184 --> 00:29:12.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
The April 15, 1899,
issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:29:12.521 --> 00:29:14.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
sent out a call:

00:29:14.315 --> 00:29:16.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Volunteers Wanted!”

00:29:17.526 --> 00:29:18.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
The plan?

00:29:18.736 --> 00:29:21.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
To stand at street corners
outside of churches,

00:29:21.155 --> 00:29:23.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
distributing the tract to anyone interested.

00:29:25.284 --> 00:29:27.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clergy members were not happy with this.

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:31.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
They even tried to have the publishers
arrested for distributing free tracts.

00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:36.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nonetheless, the Bible Students
courageously did not give up.

00:29:37.713 --> 00:29:40.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
In just one year, over 900,000 tracts

00:29:40.466 --> 00:29:42.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
were distributed at street corners

00:29:42.509 --> 00:29:44.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
all across North America and Europe.

00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:48.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our public witnessing work
was just getting started.

00:29:50.684 --> 00:29:54.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1920’s,
we launched a massive preaching campaign

00:29:54.063 --> 00:29:57.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
around the publication and public talk series 

00:29:57.024 --> 00:29:59.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Millions Now Living Will Never Die.”

00:30:00.319 --> 00:30:03.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought outside the box
and tried numerous methods

00:30:03.197 --> 00:30:05.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
to draw the public’s attention.

00:30:05.366 --> 00:30:06.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it worked!

00:30:09.328 --> 00:30:10.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the next several years,

00:30:10.954 --> 00:30:14.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
we developed even more methods
of reaching people.

00:30:17.753 --> 00:30:20.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters
even wore their public witnessing

00:30:20.673 --> 00:30:22.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the form of placards
—known as sandwich boards—

00:30:25.761 --> 00:30:27.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and magazine bags.

00:30:29.139 --> 00:30:31.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were information marches.

00:30:31.183 --> 00:30:33.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine being part of one!

00:30:34.687 --> 00:30:36.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Rutherford, of course,

00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:37.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a shorthand expert,

00:30:37.815 --> 00:30:39.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and whenever you would talk to him,

00:30:39.233 --> 00:30:42.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’d always be busy writing.

00:30:42.277 --> 00:30:43.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would be making notes,

00:30:43.445 --> 00:30:44.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
filing them away.

00:30:44.488 --> 00:30:46.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he was doing that this day.

00:30:46.073 --> 00:30:48.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
He ripped it off, and he gave it to me,

00:30:48.117 --> 00:30:50.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he said, “What do you think of it?”

00:30:50.035 --> 00:30:50.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it said:

00:30:50.994 --> 00:30:52.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Religion Is a Snare and a Racket.”

00:30:52.871 --> 00:30:56.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said, “My, that’s pretty strong.”

00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a matter of fact, I said, “That’s hot!”

00:31:00.754 --> 00:31:02.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he said,
“That’s what I meant it to be.”

00:31:02.798 --> 00:31:05.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now he said:
“Don’t you think this is a good idea?

00:31:05.634 --> 00:31:09.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We’re going to have
a big information march two days from now.

00:31:09.096 --> 00:31:11.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Couldn’t Brother Clay in the Printing
Department make up some signs

00:31:11.932 --> 00:31:14.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Religion Is a Snare and a Racket,’
put them on poles,

00:31:14.977 --> 00:31:17.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll have them for the parade?”

00:31:17.187 --> 00:31:19.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, all right, then that’s what we did.

00:31:19.982 --> 00:31:22.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Knorr
was also in London at that time,

00:31:22.401 --> 00:31:24.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he and I led this parade.

00:31:24.236 --> 00:31:27.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
The parade was six miles (10 km) long;
a thousand brothers showed up for the parade.

00:31:27.823 --> 00:31:29.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really was a spectacle.

00:31:30.909 --> 00:31:32.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the years that followed,

00:31:32.411 --> 00:31:34.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
information marches such as these

00:31:34.538 --> 00:31:36.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
took place across the world.

00:31:42.588 --> 00:31:44.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
In January of 1940,

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:48.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>Informant</i>  announced
the beginning of magazine street work,

00:31:48.177 --> 00:31:52.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a focus on working
the busiest parts of cities.

00:31:52.264 --> 00:31:55.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, many became familiar
with Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:31:55.559 --> 00:32:00.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
by seeing us offering magazines on streets
all over the world.

00:32:00.522 --> 00:32:04.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
not everyone appreciated our efforts.

00:32:04.109 --> 00:32:07.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases, entire mobs of people

00:32:07.112 --> 00:32:09.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
would attack our brothers and sisters.

00:32:09.615 --> 00:32:12.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they courageously pressed forward
in the preaching work

00:32:12.618 --> 00:32:15.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the constant threat of violence.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their faithful presence and personal interest

00:32:19.708 --> 00:32:23.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
even led some to change their opinion
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:32:24.922 --> 00:32:28.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might even know
a brother or sister who found the truth

00:32:28.133 --> 00:32:30.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
by stopping at a literature display

00:32:30.219 --> 00:32:33.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a university, shopping center, or airport.

00:32:34.473 --> 00:32:37.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
A major milestone occurred
at the dawn of the 21st century

00:32:37.935 --> 00:32:40.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Governing Body
approved our brothers in France

00:32:40.854 --> 00:32:43.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
to begin testing
different methods of public witnessing,

00:32:44.858 --> 00:32:47.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the use of literature carts,

00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:49.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
which looked much different
from what we use today.

00:32:51.031 --> 00:32:52.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
After years of success,

00:32:52.866 --> 00:32:56.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body continued
to make refinements to public witnessing,

00:32:56.662 --> 00:33:00.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the development
of special metropolitan public witnessing.

00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:03.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
These changes put us in contact with people

00:33:03.544 --> 00:33:06.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t have found
when working from house to house.

00:33:08.257 --> 00:33:10.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brings us to today,

00:33:10.634 --> 00:33:14.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
where public witnessing
is a key part of our ministry.

00:33:14.555 --> 00:33:16.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Literature carts are so familiar

00:33:16.473 --> 00:33:18.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve even written a song about them.

00:33:20.435 --> 00:33:23.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whether you’re one of thousands
in an information march

00:33:23.522 --> 00:33:26.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just one publisher on a street corner,

00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:27.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
the goal is the same

00:33:29.278 --> 00:33:33.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to demonstrate our love for Jehovah
and to reach people’s hearts.

00:33:34.032 --> 00:33:37.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you next time on <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:33:39.329 --> 00:33:42.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you picture yourself
among the thousand Witnesses

00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:46.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that six-mile-long (10 km)
information march?

00:33:46.253 --> 00:33:48.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes courage and humility

00:33:48.797 --> 00:33:52.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
to step out into the public eye
and proclaim the good news.

00:33:53.552 --> 00:33:58.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through public witnessing,
we’ve scattered countless seeds of truth.

00:33:59.850 --> 00:34:03.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can take some time
to see the positive impact

00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:06.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our decisions to serve others and Jehovah.

00:34:06.773 --> 00:34:10.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the case
with Michael and Linda DiGregorio.

00:34:10.861 --> 00:34:12.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s their experience.

00:34:14.615 --> 00:34:19.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love spending time with people
who want to do more in Jehovah’s service.

00:34:19.411 --> 00:34:20.871 line:10% position:50% align:center
Being willing to serve others

00:34:20.871 --> 00:34:22.581 line:10% position:50% align:center
leads to a life full of blessings.

00:34:23.081 --> 00:34:25.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the late 1970’s,
Linda and I were both assigned

00:34:25.709 --> 00:34:28.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
as special pioneers in Minnesota.

00:34:28.253 --> 00:34:29.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where we first met.

00:34:29.671 --> 00:34:32.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I was invited to Gilead
and was assigned to the Dominican Republic,

00:34:32.382 --> 00:34:33.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving at the branch.

00:34:33.717 --> 00:34:36.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s when we got married,
and Linda joined me there.

00:34:37.054 --> 00:34:40.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Dominican Republic branch
was still quite small in those years.

00:34:40.557 --> 00:34:44.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
So right after we got married,
our assigned room was the Bethel library.

00:34:44.519 --> 00:34:46.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were told,
“This is the library,

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so the door needs to be open
until nine o’clock at night

00:34:49.733 --> 00:34:51.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
—every night.”

00:34:51.401 --> 00:34:54.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that presented some unique challenges.

00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:56.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was really a life lesson for us.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:57.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
You really needed to keep
a good sense of humor.

00:34:59.201 --> 00:35:01.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
By nature, I’m pretty shy,

00:35:01.244 --> 00:35:05.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Dominicans are fun
and open and very lighthearted.

00:35:06.166 --> 00:35:09.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a huge help to me
because I learned a lot

00:35:09.002 --> 00:35:11.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how not to take things so seriously.

00:35:11.546 --> 00:35:13.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I also learned

00:35:13.131 --> 00:35:16.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
that things we considered essentials
were not essentials.

00:35:16.468 --> 00:35:20.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could live very happily with a lot less.

00:35:20.055 --> 00:35:22.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was really good training for me.

00:35:23.392 --> 00:35:25.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after being in the Dominican Republic
for a few years,

00:35:25.143 --> 00:35:26.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work was moving forward.

00:35:26.979 --> 00:35:28.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a new branch under construction.

00:35:28.605 --> 00:35:30.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
It even looked like we
were going to have the possibility

00:35:30.607 --> 00:35:32.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
of having a room with an ocean view.

00:35:32.442 --> 00:35:34.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
But all of that was about to change.

00:35:34.778 --> 00:35:36.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly was.

00:35:38.615 --> 00:35:42.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell,
and that started a ripple effect.

00:35:43.161 --> 00:35:45.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of the small countries
in Eastern Europe were starting

00:35:45.330 --> 00:35:46.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain independence,

00:35:46.581 --> 00:35:48.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now they were able
to have more religious freedom

00:35:48.458 --> 00:35:49.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
than they ever had before.

00:35:49.793 --> 00:35:54.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very interesting to us
because Mike had family in Albania,

00:35:54.006 --> 00:35:57.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was one of those countries
that had been under ban for many years.

00:35:57.509 --> 00:36:02.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought maybe it might be possible
to visit Albania if it wasn’t too dangerous

00:36:02.431 --> 00:36:06.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
for two or three days
to meet the family and to reconnect.

00:36:06.309 --> 00:36:08.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t long after that
that we unexpectedly got

00:36:08.603 --> 00:36:10.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
a letter from the Governing Body.

00:36:10.605 --> 00:36:12.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the letter said:
“We understand you’re going

00:36:12.607 --> 00:36:14.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to Albania for two or three days.

00:36:14.776 --> 00:36:18.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We’re wondering if you’d be willing
to stay for two or three months

00:36:18.155 --> 00:36:20.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help with the Kingdom work.”

00:36:20.115 --> 00:36:23.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
We weren’t really sure what that meant,
but we were willing to try.

00:36:23.076 --> 00:36:25.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reality was that the Governing Body
had very limited information

00:36:25.829 --> 00:36:27.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what was happening in Albania.

00:36:27.873 --> 00:36:29.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work was under ban.

00:36:29.124 --> 00:36:30.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t have a branch.

00:36:30.125 --> 00:36:31.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t have a congregation.

00:36:31.752 --> 00:36:33.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of them didn’t even know
if each other were still around.

00:36:33.962 --> 00:36:37.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t know
if we could find housing there

00:36:37.257 --> 00:36:38.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if we could find food.

00:36:38.925 --> 00:36:42.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
The country was in a total economic crisis.

00:36:42.554 --> 00:36:45.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even with all the unknowns,
we were still thrilled to go.

00:36:45.307 --> 00:36:47.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we knew, well,
it’s going to be two or three months,

00:36:47.934 --> 00:36:50.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can do pretty much anything
for two or three months.

00:36:50.062 --> 00:36:51.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to give it our best shot.

00:36:52.439 --> 00:36:53.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, once we arrived,

00:36:53.899 --> 00:36:56.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
we got a better picture
of what was really happening.

00:36:56.902 --> 00:36:59.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
The infrastructure had actually collapsed.

00:36:59.196 --> 00:37:01.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
People were scrambling
to get a new government up and going.

00:37:01.448 --> 00:37:03.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was quite difficult.

00:37:03.366 --> 00:37:07.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
But each assignment that we had
prepared us for the next assignment.

00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:12.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having lived in the Dominican Republic
where there were already limited resources

00:37:12.417 --> 00:37:14.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t make it quite as scary.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made that bridge
a little easier for us to cross.

00:37:19.257 --> 00:37:22.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the first things that we had to do
was try to see if we could find

00:37:22.219 --> 00:37:24.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
the old brothers and sisters.

00:37:24.096 --> 00:37:25.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were just a handful of them.

00:37:26.890 --> 00:37:29.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at the same time,
we had to try to do what we could

00:37:29.101 --> 00:37:31.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet with officials
and see what could be done

00:37:31.269 --> 00:37:33.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help move the work forward legally.

00:37:34.481 --> 00:37:37.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the process
of trying to get the work legalized,

00:37:37.067 --> 00:37:40.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
unexpectedly we found out
that a brother from the United States

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had an Albanian background
was coming to visit his relatives.

00:37:44.783 --> 00:37:46.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said to him one day:
“Tomorrow I have a meeting

00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:49.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with the ministry
who’s responsible to give us legalization.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to come with me?”

00:37:51.248 --> 00:37:52.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, I’d be delighted,” he said.

00:37:52.916 --> 00:37:54.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we went to the office.

00:37:54.417 --> 00:37:56.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got to the office,
the minister wasn’t there,

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he sent his legal adviser out.

00:37:58.797 --> 00:38:00.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
She made introductions.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:03.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then she looked at the brother,
and she said, “Where are you from?”

00:38:03.593 --> 00:38:05.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, “Such and such a village.”

00:38:05.929 --> 00:38:08.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she said, “That’s my village.”

00:38:08.974 --> 00:38:12.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
It turned out to be that they were cousins.

00:38:12.018 --> 00:38:14.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, she looked at everybody,
and she said:

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My goodness,
I was already willing to help you

00:38:17.732 --> 00:38:20.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because there was
never a charter that I’ve read

00:38:20.152 --> 00:38:22.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that’s better written than yours.

00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:25.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now I have a family obligation.”

00:38:25.866 --> 00:38:28.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just a few days later
that we got a call

00:38:28.243 --> 00:38:30.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we had the document in our hands.

00:38:30.579 --> 00:38:33.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Albania
were finally legalized.

00:38:33.874 --> 00:38:37.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ban was lifted after 50 years.

00:38:38.044 --> 00:38:40.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the work was legalized,

00:38:40.172 --> 00:38:42.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
we just saw Jehovah’s spirit
work so mightily.

00:38:42.090 --> 00:38:44.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things were just moving forward
in a way that we never expected.

00:38:44.718 --> 00:38:46.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were flooding into the meetings.

00:38:46.178 --> 00:38:50.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young people and older people
were really hungry for the truth.

00:38:52.601 --> 00:38:54.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the three-month assignment,

00:38:54.811 --> 00:38:57.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body kindly asked us,

00:38:57.105 --> 00:39:00.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Would you now be willing to stay
since the work is legalized?”

00:39:00.692 --> 00:39:04.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, at this point,
those folks had become so dear to our hearts;

00:39:04.029 --> 00:39:05.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was no way that we could leave.

00:39:05.614 --> 00:39:07.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
We couldn’t leave our family.

00:39:07.115 --> 00:39:09.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were thrilled
to be able to stay with them.

00:39:11.494 --> 00:39:14.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
We ended up serving in Albania
just about 30 years.

00:39:14.873 --> 00:39:18.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those 30 years went by very quickly.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who knew that a three-day trip would turn
into an assignment of a lifetime?

00:39:23.924 --> 00:39:27.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you allow yourself
to go outside your comfort zone,

00:39:27.385 --> 00:39:29.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
you learn a lot about yourself.

00:39:29.054 --> 00:39:30.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’re also more useful to Jehovah.

00:39:30.889 --> 00:39:33.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re also in a better position
to help other people.

00:39:33.808 --> 00:39:36.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s an opportunity
you never want to miss.

00:39:36.978 --> 00:39:38.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, really, never say no to an assignment

00:39:38.897 --> 00:39:41.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
just because we might be fearful
of what the unknown is.

00:39:41.483 --> 00:39:43.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we put ourself in Jehovah’s hands,

00:39:43.652 --> 00:39:47.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s the one that will take on
the responsibility to help us.

00:39:47.072 --> 00:39:49.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
So put him to the test.

00:39:49.282 --> 00:39:50.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let him help us.

00:39:50.533 --> 00:39:52.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows where to put us at the right time.

00:39:52.661 --> 00:39:54.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in reality,

00:39:54.579 --> 00:39:57.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re just a pencil in Jehovah’s hands,

00:39:57.582 --> 00:39:59.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
letting him do the writing.

00:40:04.839 --> 00:40:09.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Michael and Linda
chose to serve in Albania for decades,

00:40:09.135 --> 00:40:11.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when it was hard.

00:40:11.346 --> 00:40:16.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, over 5,000 Witnesses
serve Jehovah in that land.

00:40:18.228 --> 00:40:22.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’ll examine
the contrasting examples of humility

00:40:22.315 --> 00:40:25.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
of two men named Saul.

00:40:25.068 --> 00:40:27.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy this Morning Worship talk

00:40:27.529 --> 00:40:30.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Brother Geoffrey Jackson
of the Governing Body.

00:40:31.992 --> 00:40:35.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we think of the matter of humility,

00:40:35.245 --> 00:40:37.372 line:10% position:50% align:center
we realize there are many examples

00:40:37.372 --> 00:40:39.291 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the Bible to help us

00:40:39.291 --> 00:40:42.669 line:10% position:50% align:center
—some positive, some negative.

00:40:42.669 --> 00:40:44.379 line:10% position:50% align:center
Perhaps now we could just think

00:40:44.379 --> 00:40:45.422 line:10% position:50% align:center
for a few moments

00:40:45.422 --> 00:40:47.674 line:10% position:50% align:center
about one negative example

00:40:47.674 --> 00:40:49.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one positive example

00:40:49.676 --> 00:40:53.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
of two men
who both had the name Saul.

00:40:53.722 --> 00:40:56.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first one we’ll think about is the man

00:40:56.141 --> 00:40:59.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
who became known as King Saul of Israel.

00:40:59.853 --> 00:41:01.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’d like to take your Bibles, please,

00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:05.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and turn with me
to the beginning of the book of 1 Samuel,

00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:08.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll notice the outline of contents there

00:41:08.069 --> 00:41:12.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us an overview
of what happened at that particular time.

00:41:12.866 --> 00:41:14.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in the outline of contents,

00:41:14.951 --> 00:41:18.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
we notice there in chapter 10 it says:

00:41:18.288 --> 00:41:21.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Saul anointed to be king.”

00:41:21.166 --> 00:41:24.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember
the circumstances at that point?

00:41:24.586 --> 00:41:27.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Saul proud?

00:41:27.172 --> 00:41:29.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he presenting himself as “the man,”

00:41:29.841 --> 00:41:33.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one who would lead the nation
into a new era?

00:41:33.595 --> 00:41:34.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:41:34.679 --> 00:41:39.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember how the Scriptures describe
that he was ‘hiding in the luggage.’

00:41:39.434 --> 00:41:42.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he didn’t want a prominent position.

00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:45.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was hesitant to take that role.

00:41:45.398 --> 00:41:48.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah blessed him,
and he was anointed.

00:41:48.902 --> 00:41:50.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we look on a little further,

00:41:50.612 --> 00:41:54.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see in chapter 11
that he “defeats the Ammonites.”

00:41:54.824 --> 00:41:57.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that point, it does specifically say

00:41:57.285 --> 00:41:59.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s spirit was with him.

00:41:59.412 --> 00:42:02.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also there’s mention
of the fact that humbly

00:42:02.707 --> 00:42:07.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did not retaliate
against those who opposed him.

00:42:07.212 --> 00:42:10.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we look down to chapter 13,

00:42:10.715 --> 00:42:12.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does it say there?

00:42:12.759 --> 00:42:15.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Saul acts presumptuously,”

00:42:15.595 --> 00:42:18.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he had lost his humility

00:42:18.598 --> 00:42:21.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lost Jehovah’s favor.

00:42:21.518 --> 00:42:24.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long into his rulership was this?

00:42:24.437 --> 00:42:27.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we look at chapter 13, verse 1,

00:42:27.732 --> 00:42:30.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
it tells us
that it was right at the beginning,

00:42:30.485 --> 00:42:33.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe just two or three years had passed

00:42:33.571 --> 00:42:35.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
at this point.

00:42:35.615 --> 00:42:37.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does that tell us?

00:42:37.742 --> 00:42:39.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lost his humility very quickly

00:42:39.786 --> 00:42:42.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
after being anointed as king.

00:42:42.789 --> 00:42:47.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only that but Jehovah allowed him
to continue on in that position

00:42:47.335 --> 00:42:50.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
for perhaps over 35 years.

00:42:51.589 --> 00:42:56.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what lessons do we learn from that
with regard to ourselves?

00:42:56.136 --> 00:42:58.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the first lesson is:

00:42:58.138 --> 00:43:00.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps before being appointed to be an elder

00:43:00.765 --> 00:43:04.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
or some other service privilege,
we may have been hesitant.

00:43:04.811 --> 00:43:05.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may have been humble.

00:43:05.854 --> 00:43:09.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may not have wanted
that particular position.

00:43:09.023 --> 00:43:11.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may have felt we weren’t qualified.

00:43:11.734 --> 00:43:15.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we were very humble in our viewpoint.

00:43:15.029 --> 00:43:17.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember the case of King Saul.

00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:21.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
How quickly
once he got appointed in that position—

00:43:21.035 --> 00:43:23.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
How quickly he lost humility!

00:43:23.997 --> 00:43:25.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second lesson is

00:43:25.999 --> 00:43:29.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
that just because we remain in a certain role

00:43:29.878 --> 00:43:31.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
or position of authority

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:36.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not in itself prove
that Jehovah approves of us

00:43:36.176 --> 00:43:38.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that we are remaining humble.

00:43:38.761 --> 00:43:43.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s why it’s so important for us
to continually analyze ourselves

00:43:43.683 --> 00:43:47.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see if we are remaining humble

00:43:47.103 --> 00:43:49.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we do still have that humility

00:43:49.397 --> 00:43:52.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we perhaps exhibited many years ago.

00:43:53.568 --> 00:43:56.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second example
we’d like to discuss

00:43:56.779 --> 00:44:01.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that of Saul,
who became well-known as the apostle Paul.

00:44:01.993 --> 00:44:05.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how was Saul’s start?

00:44:05.121 --> 00:44:07.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he a humble man?

00:44:07.207 --> 00:44:09.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he like the man who became King Saul?

00:44:09.792 --> 00:44:11.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he ‘hiding in the luggage’?

00:44:11.085 --> 00:44:11.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:44:11.669 --> 00:44:13.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was right there in the front.

00:44:13.087 --> 00:44:16.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in 1 Timothy 1:13,

00:44:16.716 --> 00:44:21.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul describes himself
in those days as “an insolent man,”

00:44:21.429 --> 00:44:24.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that expression
can indicate someone

00:44:24.724 --> 00:44:28.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
who speaks
in a very downgrading way to others.

00:44:28.603 --> 00:44:30.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humiliates them,

00:44:30.438 --> 00:44:35.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and certainly that would show
a very proud, arrogant man.

00:44:35.944 --> 00:44:39.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, what happened to this man, Saul?

00:44:39.906 --> 00:44:42.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he progressed, became a Christian,

00:44:42.951 --> 00:44:47.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s spirit helped him
to become a very humble person.

00:44:48.248 --> 00:44:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how do we know
that the apostle Paul really was very humble?

00:44:53.461 --> 00:44:56.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are many things
that we could mention.

00:44:56.047 --> 00:44:59.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
But perhaps let’s just talk
about one particular aspect.

00:44:59.801 --> 00:45:03.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’m going to ask a question
for you to answer yourself.

00:45:03.429 --> 00:45:06.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think the apostle Paul
was an eloquent speaker?

00:45:06.516 --> 00:45:10.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he very good at speaking to others?

00:45:10.728 --> 00:45:14.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your initial reaction might be to say no.

00:45:14.232 --> 00:45:18.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s think a little bit more
before we give a definite answer.

00:45:18.695 --> 00:45:22.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we look at the book of Acts,
what do we see?

00:45:22.407 --> 00:45:27.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see recorded there many of the speeches
that the apostle Paul gave.

00:45:27.328 --> 00:45:32.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Antioch,
he gave a very, very effective witness.

00:45:32.041 --> 00:45:35.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Lystra,
remember when he and Barnabas were there?

00:45:35.628 --> 00:45:37.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people thought that he was Hermes

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:40.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he was taking the lead

00:45:40.133 --> 00:45:42.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
in speaking at that time.

00:45:42.677 --> 00:45:46.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often have we referred to Acts 17,

00:45:46.306 --> 00:45:49.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Paul in a very skillful manner

00:45:49.183 --> 00:45:51.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very difficult circumstance

00:45:51.477 --> 00:45:53.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
was able to preach to people

00:45:53.479 --> 00:45:56.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
using this altar
“To an Unknown God.”

00:45:56.899 --> 00:45:59.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even quoted
from some of the local prophets,

00:45:59.902 --> 00:46:01.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
or their poets.

00:46:01.946 --> 00:46:03.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this helps us to see

00:46:03.948 --> 00:46:08.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was a very effective person
when he spoke to others.

00:46:08.953 --> 00:46:11.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the steps,
when he was taken from the temple

00:46:11.748 --> 00:46:14.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the crowd wanted to kill him,

00:46:14.459 --> 00:46:17.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
he again gave a very effective speech,

00:46:17.920 --> 00:46:21.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to mention, of course,
the number of times that he spoke

00:46:21.174 --> 00:46:23.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
before many of the Gentile rulers

00:46:23.718 --> 00:46:26.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave a very effective witness.

00:46:26.429 --> 00:46:31.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, now, how are we feeling
about the apostle Paul’s ability to speak?

00:46:31.392 --> 00:46:33.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, probably we’re thinking:

00:46:33.394 --> 00:46:35.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He must have been a very eloquent speaker.

00:46:35.647 --> 00:46:40.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
He could really project the message
and persuade others.’

00:46:40.485 --> 00:46:43.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now, why was there
a little hesitancy on our part

00:46:43.905 --> 00:46:47.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say Paul was an excellent speaker?

00:46:47.158 --> 00:46:49.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe it comes from one scripture.

00:46:49.035 --> 00:46:53.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at 2 Corinthians 11:6.

00:46:54.957 --> 00:46:59.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here the apostle Paul,
speaking to the brothers in Corinth, says:

00:46:59.921 --> 00:47:04.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But even if I am unskilled in speech,

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
I certainly am not in knowledge.”

00:47:07.845 --> 00:47:11.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was Paul saying here
he didn’t know how to speak?

00:47:11.808 --> 00:47:12.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:47:12.684 --> 00:47:17.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was answering
the “superfine apostles” who criticized him,

00:47:17.271 --> 00:47:20.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
who spoke in a very disparaging manner
with regard to him.

00:47:20.483 --> 00:47:23.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, they even said
that his speech was “contemptible.”

00:47:23.903 --> 00:47:28.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when Paul says here
“but even if I am unskilled,”

00:47:28.908 --> 00:47:33.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
is he really saying
he wasn’t skilled in speaking?

00:47:33.246 --> 00:47:36.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, he was answering them
according to their own standards

00:47:36.833 --> 00:47:38.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they had set up.

00:47:38.918 --> 00:47:42.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with that in mind,
we might ask a question:

00:47:42.588 --> 00:47:47.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it the brothers in Corinth
perhaps had this impression

00:47:47.051 --> 00:47:51.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
after what we’ve just considered
with regard to Paul’s background?

00:47:51.681 --> 00:47:53.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s have a look at 1 Corinthians,

00:47:53.683 --> 00:47:57.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this brings us back
to the matter of humility.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:00.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
So 1 Corinthians chapter 2

00:48:00.773 --> 00:48:03.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and we’re going to read together
verses 1-5:

00:48:05.945 --> 00:48:08.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So when I came to you, brothers,

00:48:08.865 --> 00:48:13.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I did not come
with extravagant speech or wisdom

00:48:13.369 --> 00:48:16.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
declaring the sacred secret of God to you.”

00:48:17.165 --> 00:48:21.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul deliberately did not come to them

00:48:21.419 --> 00:48:26.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
using all the debating methods
that the Corinthians were used to.

00:48:26.424 --> 00:48:29.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in verse 2 what it tells us:

00:48:29.635 --> 00:48:34.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I decided not to know
anything among you

00:48:34.182 --> 00:48:38.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
except Jesus Christ,
and him executed on the stake.”

00:48:38.519 --> 00:48:43.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a deliberate decision
on the part of the apostle Paul

00:48:43.483 --> 00:48:46.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to use this extravagant speech,

00:48:46.486 --> 00:48:49.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
this wisdom,
that he could have used.

00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:52.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice in verses 3-5 how he continues on:

00:48:52.992 --> 00:48:57.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I came to you in weakness
and in fear and with much trembling;

00:48:57.246 --> 00:48:59.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and my speech and what I preached

00:48:59.457 --> 00:49:02.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were not with persuasive words of wisdom

00:49:02.585 --> 00:49:06.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but with a demonstration
of spirit and power,

00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:11.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that your faith might be,
not in men’s wisdom,

00:49:11.427 --> 00:49:13.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in God’s power.”

00:49:14.138 --> 00:49:16.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is Paul saying here?

00:49:16.182 --> 00:49:19.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
He realized the brothers in Corinth
had a problem.

00:49:19.977 --> 00:49:23.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
They put too much emphasis on worldly wisdom

00:49:23.606 --> 00:49:25.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the way that people
presented themselves.

00:49:25.942 --> 00:49:28.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt that was part
of why they had divisions

00:49:28.986 --> 00:49:30.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation.

00:49:30.905 --> 00:49:33.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Paul,
trying to avoid that situation

00:49:33.449 --> 00:49:37.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and putting emphasis
truly on Jehovah’s holy spirit

00:49:37.286 --> 00:49:39.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the power of the message,

00:49:39.372 --> 00:49:42.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
decided not to use this so-called wisdom

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he could have used.

00:49:44.544 --> 00:49:47.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a very humble action on his part?

00:49:47.755 --> 00:49:50.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was willing to be thought of badly.

00:49:50.591 --> 00:49:54.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was willing to have people say
that he couldn’t speak properly

00:49:54.262 --> 00:49:58.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he wanted
to focus the glory on Jehovah.

00:49:58.182 --> 00:50:00.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we learn from this example?

00:50:00.434 --> 00:50:05.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we see that an arrogant person
can become humble.

00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:10.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
But also we see that at times we may decide,
if we’re humble,

00:50:10.111 --> 00:50:15.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to display
the wisdom and talents that we have,

00:50:15.074 --> 00:50:17.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps to downplay them,

00:50:17.118 --> 00:50:20.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the glory goes to Jehovah.

00:50:20.538 --> 00:50:24.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what an interesting set
of examples for us!

00:50:24.250 --> 00:50:28.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never be like King Saul,
who lost his humility,

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:31.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may we be like the apostle Paul,

00:50:31.299 --> 00:50:35.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
who continued to be humble,
willing to put himself down,

00:50:35.428 --> 00:50:38.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order for Jehovah’s glory
to be in the fore.

00:50:39.724 --> 00:50:42.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person can become proud.

00:50:42.727 --> 00:50:45.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Paul is inspiring proof

00:50:45.146 --> 00:50:49.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a proud and arrogant person
can become humble.

00:50:49.942 --> 00:50:53.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbly allowed Jehovah to mold him.

00:50:54.572 --> 00:50:58.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly placing ourselves
in Jehovah’s loving hands

00:50:58.242 --> 00:51:00.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the theme of the new music video,

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:05.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
which tells the story of a person
who learns the truth while imprisoned.

00:51:05.750 --> 00:51:15.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, my God, your eyes can see
An imperfect heart inside of me.

00:51:15.051 --> 00:51:21.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, I try to serve you loyally.

00:51:21.682 --> 00:51:31.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
When my words get away without restraint
Or things that I do don’t bring you praise,

00:51:31.651 --> 00:51:38.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
I beg you, “Please keep working with me.”

00:51:38.407 --> 00:51:48.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look to you, my Father.
I am the clay; you are my Potter,

00:51:48.834 --> 00:51:58.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shaping me into something new,
Something that brings praise to you,

00:51:58.177 --> 00:52:05.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone who brings
a smile to your face.

00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:14.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mold me with your loving care.
Help me to draw close in prayer.

00:52:14.193 --> 00:52:23.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
My Father, here I am!
I am in your hands.

00:52:23.869 --> 00:52:28.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am in your hands.

00:52:37.258 --> 00:52:47.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am making the time to read your Word
And calling to mind the things I’ve heard.

00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:54.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
How I love the way you refine me!

00:52:54.108 --> 00:53:03.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please put within me a humble heart
That helps me each day to make a new start.

00:53:03.951 --> 00:53:10.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
I won’t let my mistakes define me.

00:53:10.458 --> 00:53:20.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look to you, my Father.
I am the clay; you are my Potter,

00:53:20.968 --> 00:53:30.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shaping me into something new,
Something that brings praise to you,

00:53:30.227 --> 00:53:36.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone who brings
a smile to your face.

00:53:36.859 --> 00:53:46.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mold me with your loving care.
Help me to draw close in prayer.

00:53:46.494 --> 00:53:55.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
My Father, here I am!
I am in your hands.

00:53:55.753 --> 00:54:00.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am in your hands.

00:54:22.279 --> 00:54:31.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help me be like soft clay.
Work with me ev’ry day.

00:54:31.372 --> 00:54:40.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
My Father, here I am.
I am in your hands.

00:54:40.673 --> 00:54:45.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am in your hands.

00:54:51.767 --> 00:54:54.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
If at times you’re discouraged by your flaws

00:54:54.770 --> 00:54:57.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
or struggle to make changes in your life,

00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:00.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
be assured that Jehovah helps those

00:55:00.693 --> 00:55:02.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
who approach him with a humble heart.

00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve explored in our program,

00:55:07.408 --> 00:55:12.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility is an endearing quality
that enriches our lives.

00:55:13.455 --> 00:55:16.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us lovingly
resolve conflicts in marriage,

00:55:17.418 --> 00:55:21.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
it moves us to treat others
in a way acceptable to Jehovah,

00:55:22.548 --> 00:55:26.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it opens our minds
to other methods of preaching.

00:55:29.388 --> 00:55:32.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s postcard comes to us
from Myanmar

00:55:32.933 --> 00:55:34.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Southeast Asia,

00:55:34.935 --> 00:55:37.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
also called Burma.

00:55:37.313 --> 00:55:41.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some describe Myanmar
as being shaped like a kite

00:55:41.066 --> 00:55:44.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its tail
running along the Malay Peninsula.

00:55:44.528 --> 00:55:48.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earliest settlers
called Myanmar the “Golden Land.”

00:55:49.491 --> 00:55:52.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a land of vast natural resources.

00:55:53.871 --> 00:55:57.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Myanmar’s forests produce valued timbers,

00:55:57.708 --> 00:56:00.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
like teak and rosewood.

00:56:00.461 --> 00:56:02.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
The land is rich in silver,

00:56:02.463 --> 00:56:06.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
copper, sapphires, and rubies.

00:56:06.342 --> 00:56:09.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people are known to be gentle,

00:56:09.094 --> 00:56:11.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
considerate, and hospitable.

00:56:12.514 --> 00:56:15.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eight major ethnic groups live in Myanmar,

00:56:15.559 --> 00:56:18.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
each with its own language and culture.

00:56:19.772 --> 00:56:24.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personal names are usually composed
of several descriptive words.

00:56:24.777 --> 00:56:27.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the name Cho Sandar Myint

00:56:27.905 --> 00:56:30.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
means “Sweet Moon Above.”

00:56:31.492 --> 00:56:35.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Visitors to Myanmar
quickly notice the yellow paste

00:56:35.621 --> 00:56:39.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
that adorns the faces
of most women and children.

00:56:39.166 --> 00:56:41.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called <i>thanaka,</i>

00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:45.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
made from the bark of the <i>thanaka</i>  tree.

00:56:45.422 --> 00:56:48.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
This natural cosmetic cools

00:56:48.133 --> 00:56:51.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and protects the skin from the tropical sun,

00:56:51.929 --> 00:56:55.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s been used for over 2,000 years.

00:56:56.892 --> 00:57:00.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
The preaching work began here in 1914

00:57:00.187 --> 00:57:03.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the arrival of two Bible Students.

00:57:03.399 --> 00:57:07.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Missionaries followed, and by 1939,

00:57:07.278 --> 00:57:11.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
three congregations totaling 28 Witnesses

00:57:11.156 --> 00:57:13.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
had been established.

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:15.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1940’s,

00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:17.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
a pioneer sister contacted members

00:57:17.496 --> 00:57:21.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the ethnic group known as the Karen.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:24.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hnin May, also known as Lily,

00:57:24.378 --> 00:57:28.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
and her sister Chu May, or Daisy,

00:57:28.007 --> 00:57:30.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
learned the truth from her.

00:57:30.259 --> 00:57:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lily became the first Karen
to be baptized as a Witness of Jehovah.

00:57:35.973 --> 00:57:38.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daisy was also baptized,

00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:41.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and both became zealous pioneers.

00:57:41.478 --> 00:57:45.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hundreds of their descendants
and Bible students

00:57:45.274 --> 00:57:49.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
are among the thousands
who serve Jehovah in Myanmar today.

00:57:49.945 --> 00:57:52.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve persevered despite poverty,

00:57:52.781 --> 00:57:57.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
political upheaval,
religious persecution, and war.

00:57:58.078 --> 00:58:01.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers preach in over 20 languages.

00:58:02.207 --> 00:58:05.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2024, Myanmar reported

00:58:05.294 --> 00:58:07.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
an all-time peak of publishers.

00:58:07.796 --> 00:58:12.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nearly 12,000 people attended the Memorial.

00:58:12.217 --> 00:58:16.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Hpado Congregation
is located in a small village

00:58:16.221 --> 00:58:18.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bago Region.

00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:22.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eighty-six publishers
and four special pioneers serve here.

00:58:23.812 --> 00:58:27.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in the Hpado Congregation

00:58:27.524 --> 00:58:31.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Hlaing Remote Translation Office
send you their love.

00:58:32.613 --> 00:58:35.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:58:35.532 --> 00:58:38.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
