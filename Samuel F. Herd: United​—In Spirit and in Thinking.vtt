00:02.252 --> 00:05.189
Unity—it is often so elusive 


00:05.188 --> 00:08.056
in political, religious, social, 


00:08.057 --> 00:10.560
racial, and financial circles. 


00:10.560 --> 00:13.397
We love the amazing unity 
that we experience 


00:13.397 --> 00:15.399
as a global brotherhood. 


00:15.398 --> 00:19.535
No matter the country, 
one’s background, or former beliefs, 


00:19.535 --> 00:22.472
it is amazing 
that around the world 


00:22.472 --> 00:25.007
we have unity of thought. 


00:25.007 --> 00:27.610
Though speaking 
hundreds of languages, 


00:27.610 --> 00:30.280
there is one singular sound, 


00:30.280 --> 00:34.183
or unified message, 
that is being preached. 


00:34.183 --> 00:39.000
In fact, 
Romans 10:17, 18 says: 


00:40.223 --> 00:42.291
“So faith follows the thing heard. 


00:42.292 --> 00:44.294
“In turn, what is heard 


00:44.293 --> 00:47.030
“is through the word about Christ. 


00:47.030 --> 00:50.833
“But I ask, 
They did not fail to hear, did they? 


00:50.833 --> 00:53.101
“Why, in fact, 
‘into all the earth 


00:53.102 --> 00:56.372
“‘their sound went out, 
and to the ends 


00:56.372 --> 00:59.175
of the inhabited earth 
their message.’” 


00:59.175 --> 01:01.210
That is amazing! 


01:01.210 --> 01:04.280
Millions believing exactly the same 


01:04.280 --> 01:06.950
based on “the word about Christ.” 


01:06.950 --> 01:09.552
One singular sound goes out. 


01:09.552 --> 01:13.457
That is unity of belief.


01:13.457 --> 01:16.259
Some may say: “Unity of belief? 


01:16.258 --> 01:18.060
You’re brainwashed.” 


01:18.060 --> 01:21.397
Well, we do agree that our thinking 


01:21.397 --> 01:23.399
has been washed clean 


01:23.398 --> 01:25.601
from the complicated doctrines 


01:25.602 --> 01:29.405
that have evolved 
since Jesus walked the earth. 


01:29.405 --> 01:32.408
However, the unity of mind 


01:32.408 --> 01:35.878
results from a thorough study 
of the Scriptures. 


01:35.878 --> 01:39.015
It is a matter 
of learning God’s Word 


01:39.015 --> 01:43.018
and separating its teachings 
out from the many doctrines 


01:43.018 --> 01:46.355
that have been introduced 
by human thinking. 


01:46.355 --> 01:48.825
When a classroom 
full of students 


01:48.825 --> 01:52.728
take a math course, 
like algebra, 


01:52.728 --> 01:55.798
at the end of the class, 
no one accuses them 


01:55.798 --> 01:59.168
of being brainwashed 
when they all end up 


01:59.168 --> 02:01.370
united in their understanding. 


02:01.370 --> 02:04.573
They simply learned 
the math accurately 


02:04.573 --> 02:06.575
and put it to use.


02:06.575 --> 02:10.313
But it is one thing 
to be united in thinking 


02:10.313 --> 02:12.781
and yet another 
to be united in spirit 


02:12.782 --> 02:14.784
as a brotherhood. 


02:14.783 --> 02:16.920
Going back to a math class: 


02:16.920 --> 02:20.590
At the end of the course, 
all are united in thought. 


02:20.590 --> 02:22.592
They learned algebra. 


02:22.592 --> 02:26.595
But that does not mean 
they all like each other. 


02:26.595 --> 02:28.732
They may have petty rivalry 


02:28.732 --> 02:30.734
or outright prejudice 


02:30.733 --> 02:33.468
against some of their classmates. 


02:33.468 --> 02:35.938
When we learn the truth 
from God’s Word, 


02:35.938 --> 02:39.475
we become united 
not only in thinking 


02:39.475 --> 02:41.543
but also in spirit 


02:41.543 --> 02:43.646
with our brothers around the world. 


02:43.647 --> 02:47.117
Even if we had deep-seated prejudice 
in our hearts 


02:47.117 --> 02:49.719
before studying 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


02:49.718 --> 02:52.521
it begins to melt away 


02:52.522 --> 02:54.590
when learning the truth. 


02:54.590 --> 02:56.000
Why is that?


02:57.727 --> 03:00.129
You will notice as we read 


03:00.128 --> 03:02.198
in Ephesians chapter 4 


03:02.198 --> 03:04.666
that godly qualities are learned 


03:04.667 --> 03:06.669
and perceived. 


03:06.668 --> 03:09.671
The bad traits 
we might have had before 


03:09.672 --> 03:11.807
have to be unlearned. 


03:11.807 --> 03:13.810
And Jehovah’s holy spirit helps 


03:13.810 --> 03:15.812
mold our personality 


03:15.812 --> 03:18.014
to match more closely 


03:18.013 --> 03:20.015
the beautiful qualities 


03:20.015 --> 03:22.618
mentioned here in Ephesians 4. 


03:22.618 --> 03:24.786
Starting with verse 1, 


03:24.787 --> 03:27.000
the apostle Paul says: 


03:28.490 --> 03:31.427
“Therefore I, 


03:31.427 --> 03:33.764
“the prisoner in the Lord, 


03:33.763 --> 03:36.465
“appeal to you to walk worthily 


03:36.465 --> 03:38.668
“of the calling 
with which you were called, 


03:38.668 --> 03:41.503
“with all humility and mildness, 


03:41.503 --> 03:44.173
“[and] patience, 
putting up with one another in love, 


03:44.173 --> 03:46.708
“earnestly endeavoring to maintain 


03:46.708 --> 03:50.480
“the oneness of the spirit 
in the uniting bond of peace. 


03:50.480 --> 03:53.182
“One body there is, 
and one spirit, 


03:53.182 --> 03:56.719
“just as you were called 
to the one hope of your calling; 


03:56.718 --> 04:00.556
“one Lord, 
one faith, one baptism; 


04:00.557 --> 04:03.092
“one God and Father of all, 


04:03.092 --> 04:06.229
“who is over all and through all 


04:06.228 --> 04:08.898
and in all.” 


04:08.898 --> 04:12.135
My, that is unity, isn’t it? 


04:12.135 --> 04:14.670
All of those fine qualities 


04:14.670 --> 04:17.140
reflect the personality of Jesus


04:17.140 --> 04:19.142
—perfect. 


04:19.142 --> 04:21.144
He was unspoiled 


04:21.143 --> 04:24.080
by the ingrained hatred 
and prejudices 


04:24.080 --> 04:27.750
that he 
may have been exposed to. 


04:27.750 --> 04:31.020
So is it easy to curb 


04:31.020 --> 04:33.022
ingrained prejudices? 


04:33.022 --> 04:36.292
No. 
It is not that easy. 


04:36.292 --> 04:40.364
It would be good if it was, 
but it isn’t.


04:40.363 --> 04:42.631
It is a process. 


04:42.632 --> 04:44.900
Sometimes we show 
the right spirit 


04:44.900 --> 04:47.370
on the outside, but inside 


04:47.370 --> 04:50.840
we are still struggling 
to cultivate 


04:50.840 --> 04:54.343
that true unity 
deep in our heart. 


04:54.343 --> 04:57.013
Do we have a Bible example 
that makes clear 


04:57.013 --> 04:59.081
that this is a process 


04:59.082 --> 05:01.817
that we must work 
our way through? 


05:01.817 --> 05:03.820
Yes, there is one 


05:03.820 --> 05:06.088
in Galatians chapter 2. 


05:06.088 --> 05:09.958
Here, Cephas, 
who was usually called Peter, 


05:09.958 --> 05:12.228
though Jewish by birth, 
had to learn 


05:12.228 --> 05:14.496
from Jesus not to be partial. 


05:14.497 --> 05:17.034
For many years, he had accepted 


05:17.033 --> 05:19.035
non-Jewish fellow worshippers. 


05:19.035 --> 05:21.037
He associated with them. 


05:21.037 --> 05:23.039
He ate meals 
together with them. 


05:23.038 --> 05:25.708
But was there still a residue 


05:25.708 --> 05:27.710
of prejudice within him? 


05:27.710 --> 05:29.712
It seemed so. 


05:29.712 --> 05:32.949
His reactions 
may have even come as a surprise 


05:32.948 --> 05:34.950
to Peter himself. 


05:34.950 --> 05:37.287
Read Galatians chapter 2, 


05:37.287 --> 05:41.000
verses 11 through 14, 


05:45.762 --> 05:49.299
and it says: 
“However, when Cephas 


05:49.298 --> 05:53.501
“came to Antioch, 
I resisted him face-to-face, 


05:53.502 --> 05:56.805
“because he 
was clearly in the wrong. 


05:56.805 --> 06:00.543
“For before certain men 
from James arrived, 


06:00.543 --> 06:02.978
“he used to eat 
with people of the nations; 


06:02.978 --> 06:04.980
“but when they arrived, 


06:04.980 --> 06:08.117
“he stopped doing this 
and separated himself, 


06:08.117 --> 06:11.887
“fearing those 
of the circumcised class. 


06:11.887 --> 06:14.524
“The rest of the Jews 
also joined him 


06:14.523 --> 06:16.625
“in putting on this pretense,


06:16.625 --> 06:18.627
“so that even Barnabas 


06:18.627 --> 06:22.165
“was led along with them 
in their pretense. 


06:22.165 --> 06:25.702
“But when I saw 
that they were not walking 


06:25.702 --> 06:28.137
“in step with the truth 
of the good news, 


06:28.137 --> 06:30.540
“I said to Cephas 
before them all: 


06:30.540 --> 06:33.108
“‘If you, though you are a Jew, 


06:33.108 --> 06:36.411
“‘live as the nations do 
and not as Jews do, 


06:36.412 --> 06:39.682
“‘how can you compel 
people of the nations 


06:39.682 --> 06:42.752
to live according
to Jewish practice?’” 


06:42.752 --> 06:44.854
What happened to Peter? 


06:44.853 --> 06:48.623
Fear of man 
caused his former traits 


06:48.623 --> 06:50.693
of prejudice to resurface. 


06:50.693 --> 06:52.695
And it was contagious, 


06:52.695 --> 06:55.097
affecting other Jewish men 
around him. 


06:55.097 --> 06:57.100
In fact, the verse said: 


06:57.100 --> 07:00.637
“Even Barnabas 
was led along with them.” 


07:00.637 --> 07:04.307
Barnabas was a very warmhearted, 
generous person. 


07:04.307 --> 07:07.910
His name even means 
“Son of Comfort.” 


07:07.910 --> 07:10.813
If Peter and Barnabas 
could succumb 


07:10.813 --> 07:14.750
to this kind of behavior 
based on their childhood training, 


07:14.750 --> 07:18.353
we need to be very careful. 


07:18.353 --> 07:20.355
For a period of time, 


07:20.355 --> 07:23.192
it may take 
a conscious effort on our part 


07:23.192 --> 07:26.329
to maintain unity 
with our brothers and sisters 


07:26.328 --> 07:29.998
of varying cultures or races.


07:29.998 --> 07:32.000
Was Peter able 


07:32.000 --> 07:34.270
to fully eradicate 


07:34.270 --> 07:36.272
any residual form 


07:36.272 --> 07:38.809
of prejudice from his being? 


07:38.808 --> 07:40.810
It seems he was. 


07:40.810 --> 07:44.480
Turn now 
to 1 Peter chapter 1. 


07:44.480 --> 07:46.882
About ten years 
after he shunned 


07:46.882 --> 07:49.019
the non-Jewish Christians, 


07:49.018 --> 07:52.455
Peter was inspired 
to write these words, 


07:52.455 --> 07:55.000
verse 22: 


07:57.593 --> 08:00.261
“Now that you 
have purified yourselves 


08:00.262 --> 08:02.332
“by your obedience to the truth 


08:02.332 --> 08:04.600
“with unhypocritical brotherly affection 


08:04.600 --> 08:07.470
“as the result, love one another 


08:07.470 --> 08:10.000
intensely from the heart.” 


08:11.573 --> 08:15.376
Learning what is right 
and then consistently doing what is right 


08:15.377 --> 08:17.380
is a process. 


08:17.380 --> 08:19.382
We learn the truth gradually. 


08:19.382 --> 08:23.085
We soon have unity 
of mind and thinking. 


08:23.085 --> 08:27.155
However, in time, 
we purify ourselves. 


08:27.155 --> 08:28.490
How? 


08:28.490 --> 08:32.562
The verse said 
by our “obedience to the truth.” 


08:32.562 --> 08:35.164
And did you notice that Peter says, 


08:35.163 --> 08:39.501
“with unhypocritical brotherly affection”? 


08:39.502 --> 08:41.504
Not the way he acted 


08:41.503 --> 08:43.571
ten years or so earlier. 


08:43.572 --> 08:46.475
He even said 
to “love one another 


08:46.475 --> 08:49.012
intensely from the heart.” 


08:49.012 --> 08:51.147
Deep inside, 


08:51.147 --> 08:54.684
we would have love for all 
in our brotherhood 


08:54.683 --> 08:57.853
without even a twinge 
of prejudice. 


08:57.853 --> 09:00.956
Please turn back 
to Ephesians chapter 4. 


09:00.957 --> 09:04.160
How does this process 
of changing work? 


09:04.160 --> 09:07.000
Look at verse 17: 


09:11.700 --> 09:13.835
“So this is what I say 


09:13.835 --> 09:16.438
“and bear witness to 
in the Lord, 


09:16.438 --> 09:19.841
“that you should no longer 
go on walking 


09:19.842 --> 09:22.245
“just as the nations also walk, 


09:22.245 --> 09:25.547
in the futility of their minds.” 


09:25.547 --> 09:28.750
It makes clear 
that we need to change 


09:28.750 --> 09:31.420
our thinking—our minds. 


09:31.420 --> 09:35.023
And what follows 
this unity of thinking? 


09:35.023 --> 09:38.000
Verses 22-24: 


09:39.328 --> 09:42.931
“You were taught to put away 
the old personality that conforms 


09:42.932 --> 09:46.335
“to your former course of conduct 
and that is being corrupted 


09:46.335 --> 09:50.305
“according to its deceptive desires. 


09:50.305 --> 09:53.208
“And you should continue 
to be made new 


09:53.208 --> 09:56.411
“in your dominant mental attitude, 


09:56.412 --> 09:58.780
“and should put on 
the new personality 


09:58.780 --> 10:01.517
“that was created 
according to God’s will 


10:01.517 --> 10:05.254
in true righteousness 
and loyalty.” 


10:05.253 --> 10:07.856
Our very personality changes 


10:07.857 --> 10:12.000
because of our new 
dominant mental attitude. 


10:13.395 --> 10:16.932
The beautiful thing 
is that this process 


10:16.932 --> 10:19.135
is at work in millions 


10:19.135 --> 10:22.405
of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide. 


10:22.405 --> 10:24.440
And even though some of us 


10:24.440 --> 10:27.142
may still be working 


10:27.142 --> 10:29.145
on this kind of unity 


10:29.145 --> 10:31.147
deep inside, 


10:31.147 --> 10:33.849
this love already shows 


10:33.848 --> 10:36.451
on the outside as we mingle 


10:36.452 --> 10:40.055
with our brothers 
from all over the world. 


10:40.055 --> 10:42.792
Psalm 133:1 


10:42.792 --> 10:44.794
says it right: 


10:44.793 --> 10:48.330
“How good and how pleasant 


10:48.330 --> 10:51.667
“it is for brothers 
to dwell together 


10:51.667 --> 11:05.899
in unity!”
