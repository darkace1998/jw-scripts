WEBVTT

00:02.018 --> 00:04.886
We would like to welcome all of you 


00:04.887 --> 00:07.757
to a special broadcast 


00:07.757 --> 00:10.060
from the world headquarters 


00:10.060 --> 00:12.462
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


00:12.462 --> 00:14.897
As you may have already heard, 


00:14.897 --> 00:17.900
yesterday, April 20, 


00:17.900 --> 00:21.905
the Supreme Court 
of the Russian Federation 


00:21.905 --> 00:25.342
ruled against Jehovah’s Witnesses 


00:25.342 --> 00:27.844
and decided to liquidate 


00:27.843 --> 00:31.680
the Administrative Center 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia 


00:31.680 --> 00:36.685
and all 395 Local Religious Organizations. 


00:36.685 --> 00:40.423
In essence, this means 


00:40.423 --> 00:44.393
that the properties 
owned by the organization, 


00:44.393 --> 00:49.398
such as our Kingdom Halls 
and our beautiful branch office, 


00:49.398 --> 00:53.736
have been unjustly confiscated 


00:53.737 --> 00:56.639
by the Russian government. 


00:56.638 --> 01:01.043
The ruling goes into effect immediately.


01:01.043 --> 01:06.048
Our hearts go out to you 
dear brothers and sisters in Russia, 


01:06.048 --> 01:11.053
but we know that you 
deeply appreciate the support given to you 


01:11.053 --> 01:13.890
by the worldwide brotherhood. 


01:13.890 --> 01:18.127
Just think of how many letters 
were sent to Russian officials 


01:18.127 --> 01:21.899
by your fellow worshippers 
around the world! 


01:21.898 --> 01:24.800
Contemplate how many prayers 


01:24.800 --> 01:28.103
and supplications 
were offered up to Jehovah 


01:28.103 --> 01:32.908
and will continue 
to be made in your behalf! 


01:32.908 --> 01:38.000
Your confidence in Jehovah 
warms our heart.


01:39.348 --> 01:41.350
In just a moment, 


01:41.350 --> 01:45.288
we will be speaking 
with Brother Mark Sanderson, 


01:45.288 --> 01:48.190
who was present in the courtroom 


01:48.190 --> 01:51.327
when the decision was announced. 


01:51.327 --> 01:54.664
However, before speaking with him, 


01:54.663 --> 01:57.733
we know you will be very interested 


01:57.733 --> 02:01.805
in this account 
of the six days of proceedings 


02:01.805 --> 02:06.008
that led up 
to this very disappointing decision. 


02:06.008 --> 02:11.013
The report includes comments 
from a delegation of brothers 


02:11.013 --> 02:15.116
sent by the Governing Body 
to meet with officials 


02:15.117 --> 02:17.320
and to be present 


02:17.320 --> 02:21.000
for portions of the trial.


02:24.827 --> 02:27.464
The Governing Body 
assigned me to come here, 


02:27.463 --> 02:29.465
not only for the trial 


02:29.465 --> 02:31.467
that’s to take place today, 


02:31.467 --> 02:33.235
but also to try 


02:33.235 --> 02:35.003
and see if we could do something 


02:35.003 --> 02:38.006
to encourage our brothers here 
on a small scale. 


02:38.007 --> 02:43.012
When we arrived at the airport, 
there was a large group of brothers. 


02:43.012 --> 02:46.549
Many of them 
were of considerable size; 


02:46.548 --> 02:49.151
they just kind of shepherded us 
through the airport. 


02:49.152 --> 02:51.989
We were standing there 
with them for a few minutes, 


02:51.988 --> 02:54.890
and then one of the brothers 
suddenly smiled, 


02:54.890 --> 02:59.000
and he said to me in Russian, 
“Thank you so much for coming.”


03:23.687 --> 03:25.922
The fundamental question in this case 


03:25.922 --> 03:27.590
is whether Jehovah’s Witnesses 


03:27.590 --> 03:30.227
are engaged in extremist activity 


03:30.227 --> 03:33.162
and whether the Administrative Center 


03:33.162 --> 03:36.599
is guilty of having organized 
this extremist activity. 


03:36.598 --> 03:38.701
When it became known 


03:38.702 --> 03:41.704
that the Supreme Court of Russia 
was considering a ban 


03:41.703 --> 03:45.040
on the worship of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


03:45.040 --> 03:47.577
embassies from around the world requested 


03:47.577 --> 03:50.580
information as to what led up to this.


03:50.580 --> 03:53.415
We were successful 
in getting high-level meetings 


03:53.415 --> 03:57.387
with a number of different officials 
at embassies here in Moscow, 


03:57.387 --> 03:59.555
and it’s really been quite impressive 


03:59.555 --> 04:02.958
to see the reaction 
of these people in high station. 


04:02.958 --> 04:07.296
It impressed me 
that so many of them were eager 


04:07.297 --> 04:12.235
to want to do something 
within the limited sphere that they have.


04:12.235 --> 04:13.502
And uniformly, 


04:13.502 --> 04:15.805
they are just amazed 


04:15.805 --> 04:17.607
that Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
of all people, 


04:17.607 --> 04:20.477
are subject to criticism 


04:20.477 --> 04:24.347
or ban on the basis of being extremists. 


04:24.347 --> 04:26.615
Now, that comes across to them 


04:26.615 --> 04:29.352
as completely absurd 
because if there’s one group 


04:29.352 --> 04:31.787
of people that’s known 
for their neutrality, 


04:31.787 --> 04:34.657
it is Jehovah’s people.


04:34.657 --> 04:36.659
Really, 


04:36.658 --> 04:38.326
now our eyes are poised toward the trial. 


04:38.327 --> 04:40.464
We’re getting ready to go to the court, 


04:40.463 --> 04:43.000
and we’ll wait and see 
what’s going to happen.


04:45.902 --> 04:49.339
As we were going to the court, 
there were about 200 


04:49.338 --> 04:53.608
waiting to get into the courtroom, 
mostly our brothers, 


04:53.608 --> 04:57.113
but then some who 
were just interested in the hearing. 


04:57.113 --> 04:59.381
We could see the cameramen, 
the microphones, 


04:59.382 --> 05:02.685
and the many reporters 
who were there. 


05:02.685 --> 05:06.322
It was clear that this was now 
an international event.


05:06.322 --> 05:08.390
Just when we were 
in the entranceway, 


05:08.390 --> 05:12.528
we stepped in 
and here was a couple 


05:12.528 --> 05:15.565
that I had met 
many years ago in Siberia. 


05:15.565 --> 05:17.833
And here they had come 
all the way from Siberia 


05:17.833 --> 05:20.000
to testify in the hearing, 
to be witnesses.


05:23.538 --> 05:27.510
We had four different brothers 
representing the Administrative Center. 


05:27.510 --> 05:30.580
Each one would take the lead 
in arguing one motion. 


05:30.580 --> 05:33.850
The judge would listen 
to what the brothers had to say, 


05:33.850 --> 05:35.852
turn to the Ministry of Justice, 
and ask, 


05:35.852 --> 05:38.000
“Does the Ministry of Justice 
have any input on this?” 


05:39.088 --> 05:41.190
The prosecutor would stand, 


05:41.190 --> 05:44.660
literally say two or three sentences, 
sit down, 


05:44.660 --> 05:46.000
and the judge would say:


05:52.835 --> 05:56.438
The brothers raised 20 motions 


05:56.438 --> 05:58.440
that they wanted the court to hear. 


05:58.440 --> 05:59.942
Of those 20 motions, 


05:59.942 --> 06:04.014
the court granted 
only two of them to see how 


06:04.013 --> 06:06.348
evidence that would exonerate us 


06:06.348 --> 06:09.351
was not going 
to be allowed in the hearing.


06:09.352 --> 06:11.387
After seeing so many of them be dismissed, 


06:11.387 --> 06:12.789
then you began to say, 


06:12.788 --> 06:14.223
“Well, they really weren’t going 


06:14.223 --> 06:16.558
to take any of them seriously.”


06:16.558 --> 06:20.128
For example, 
the brothers were able to show clearly 


06:20.128 --> 06:23.565
that the congregations 
that had been liquidated 


06:23.565 --> 06:24.933
were the result 


06:24.933 --> 06:28.738
of the planting of literature, 
and that this was on video, 


06:28.738 --> 06:31.206
and that the Supreme Court 
would refuse 


06:31.207 --> 06:32.209
to even see the video.


06:32.208 --> 06:35.611
And that was really a lasting impression 


06:35.612 --> 06:37.647
that this was a little bit of a sham, 


06:37.647 --> 06:39.615
and it was designed 


06:39.615 --> 06:42.252
to go through the formalities, 


06:42.252 --> 06:44.887
but you got the sense that the decision 


06:44.887 --> 06:47.490
had already been taken.


06:47.490 --> 06:51.260
At the hearing, representatives 
from many embassies were there, 


06:51.260 --> 06:56.265
and as they listened to the court 
hear whether local congregations 


06:56.265 --> 06:58.733
would be allowed to defend themselves 


06:58.733 --> 07:02.705
and to hear that the court said “no,” 
they were not going to be heard, 


07:02.705 --> 07:06.175
these embassy representatives were appalled.


07:06.175 --> 07:10.513
And I thought it was 
quite interesting that when they saw 


07:10.513 --> 07:15.518
how ridiculous some of the rejections 
of the motions were at the trial, 


07:15.518 --> 07:18.855
there was a murmur of laughter 
in the audience, 


07:18.855 --> 07:21.857
particularly when the judge 
cut off our lawyers 


07:21.857 --> 07:26.000
when they were presenting 
the evidence of the planted publications. 


07:27.297 --> 07:31.367
This to them is evidence that it’s so absurd 


07:31.367 --> 07:33.635
that you haven’t got the real evidence 


07:33.635 --> 07:37.840
to bring a charge of extremism 
so you plant evidence.


07:37.840 --> 07:40.610
Although we were in the Supreme Court, 


07:40.610 --> 07:43.445
they don’t have 
so many formalities in the court 


07:43.445 --> 07:45.882
as perhaps they have in other lands, 


07:45.882 --> 07:49.285
and so the brothers were allowed 
to stand up and walk around. 


07:49.285 --> 07:52.788
To me it had more 
the atmosphere of a circuit assembly 


07:52.788 --> 07:55.156
than being in a courtroom. 


07:55.157 --> 07:56.725
I think it made the charge 


07:56.725 --> 07:58.828
that’s been brought upon us 


07:58.828 --> 08:01.463
all the more absurd and ridiculous. 


08:01.463 --> 08:05.466
You know, just so many came up 
and said how grateful they were 


08:05.467 --> 08:08.170
to feel the support from the Governing Body, 


08:08.170 --> 08:10.873
that they were not facing 
this situation alone. 


08:10.873 --> 08:14.043
It occurred to me 
that it was really a small thing 


08:14.043 --> 08:16.078
to travel here, 


08:16.078 --> 08:19.081
but for them, 
it was symbolic. 


08:19.082 --> 08:23.000
They felt that the Governing Body 
was there with them.


08:40.903 --> 08:42.938
The decision has not been made. 


08:42.938 --> 08:44.940
We’ll have to wait and see. 


08:44.940 --> 08:48.443
The government 
had only given us a six-day visa, 


08:48.443 --> 08:51.780
and so it was impossible 
for us to stay any longer. 


08:51.780 --> 08:54.150
So our entire delegation, 
of course, 


08:54.150 --> 08:56.185
with the exception of Brother Kalin, 


08:56.185 --> 08:59.022
we all had to leave the next day.


08:59.022 --> 09:02.959
We had in our mind that we were going 
to go and strengthen them, 


09:02.958 --> 09:04.993
but as is always the case, 
I think we were the ones 


09:04.993 --> 09:06.961
who came away 
even more strengthened 


09:06.962 --> 09:09.165
in our own faith.


09:09.165 --> 09:14.070
One ten-year-old wrote this note 
to the visiting delegation, 


09:14.070 --> 09:16.072
“Thank you for coming to support us 


09:16.072 --> 09:18.074
and for your ministry.”


09:18.073 --> 09:22.711
—Sascha, ten years old, Moscow.


09:22.712 --> 09:24.714
As we were leaving 


09:24.713 --> 09:27.081
and saying good-bye to these brothers, 


09:27.082 --> 09:30.920
there was not a dry eye among us. 


09:30.920 --> 09:33.488
They were hugging Brother Sanderson 
and telling him, 


09:33.488 --> 09:39.000
“This is the spiritual high point 
of my life.”


09:42.398 --> 09:45.400
Something occurred in day two 


09:45.400 --> 09:47.937
that was unexpected and surprising to us.


09:47.937 --> 09:50.840
Interestingly, the judge became very active, 


09:50.840 --> 09:53.408
and he began to really question 


09:53.408 --> 09:55.343
the Ministry of Justice.


09:55.343 --> 09:57.446
Why are you bringing this case? 


09:57.447 --> 09:59.515
What evidence do you have 


09:59.515 --> 10:02.000
that they are engaged 
in extremist activities?


10:51.500 --> 10:54.403
The third day of the hearing reminded us 


10:54.403 --> 10:55.570
of Matthew 10:18.


10:55.570 --> 10:59.508
“And you will be brought 
before governors and kings for my sake.” 


10:59.508 --> 11:01.843
But then, what’s the reason? 


11:01.843 --> 11:06.815
It says, 
“for a witness to them and the nations.”


11:06.815 --> 11:08.950
The international community, worldwide, 


11:08.950 --> 11:11.153
has now heard the testimony 


11:11.153 --> 11:14.890
of six Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
clearly, cogently, 


11:14.890 --> 11:17.393
convincingly explaining to the court 


11:17.393 --> 11:21.163
that we are law-abiding, 
peaceful citizens


11:21.163 --> 11:22.831
—the farthest thing from extremists. 


11:22.832 --> 11:27.169
For example, one longtime member 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


11:27.168 --> 11:29.271
Vasiliy Kalin, 
explained to the judge 


11:29.272 --> 11:33.442
that as a child, he had been forced 
into exile with his parents 


11:33.442 --> 11:37.000
and was forced 
to live in Siberia for years.


12:19.053 --> 12:23.758
Decades later, he was exonerated 


12:23.758 --> 12:25.761
and cleared of all charges against him. 


12:25.762 --> 12:30.199
In Russia, he’s considered 
or referred to as a rehabilitated person, 


12:30.198 --> 12:34.836
meaning that the charges 
against him have now been expunged.


12:34.837 --> 12:39.509
And now at this point in his life, 
they’re saying he’s an extremist. 


12:39.508 --> 12:43.045
Anyone could see that the same efforts 


12:43.045 --> 12:46.315
that had been made 
so long ago to try to hunt down 


12:46.315 --> 12:48.417
and wipe out Jehovah’s Witnesses 


12:48.417 --> 12:53.000
were just reappearing now 
at this particular time.


12:57.058 --> 13:00.830
I was texting with one 
of the brothers at the Russia branch 


13:00.830 --> 13:02.965
asking how things were going. 


13:02.965 --> 13:05.467
He says: “Wow! 


13:05.467 --> 13:08.604
“They just announced that the court 


13:08.603 --> 13:11.306
“has been suspended 
until Wednesday, April 12, 


13:11.307 --> 13:13.375
the day after the Memorial.” 


13:13.375 --> 13:14.777
And we were all just— 


13:14.777 --> 13:18.347
We could hardly believe it 
that the court is ending on a Friday 


13:18.347 --> 13:21.517
but being postponed until Wednesday. 


13:21.517 --> 13:23.000
How wonderful!


14:22.077 --> 14:26.282
We had an adjournment up until April 19. 


14:26.282 --> 14:29.552
That gives the brotherhood 
in Russia the opportunity 


14:29.552 --> 14:31.687
to attend the special talk. 


14:31.687 --> 14:34.790
And that special talk is all about peace


14:34.790 --> 14:38.793
—“How to Cultivate Peace in an Angry World.”


14:38.793 --> 14:41.763
So we really hope to be 
in the courtroom with our brothers 


14:41.763 --> 14:44.533
at the time 
when the decision is issued, 


14:44.533 --> 14:46.868
even though it 
would seem almost impossible 


14:46.868 --> 14:49.305
that we could get a visa 
to return to Russia. 


14:49.305 --> 14:50.907
Basically, 


14:50.907 --> 14:53.442
we would have to make 
application from Kazakhstan. 


14:53.442 --> 14:56.912
If Jehovah wills 
and we are able to get the visa, 


14:56.912 --> 14:59.582
then Tuesday evening, 
I’ll return to Russia 


14:59.582 --> 15:04.000
and then on Wednesday morning, 
we will be in the court.


15:09.458 --> 15:11.793
Brothers were hugging each other; 


15:11.793 --> 15:14.930
at lunchtime everybody was sharing 
their sandwiches with each other. 


15:14.930 --> 15:19.000
The atmosphere of joy 
and love was unforgettable. 


15:20.835 --> 15:23.838
The judge began 
to go through all of the evidence, 


15:23.838 --> 15:28.076
and so there were 
43 volumes of evidence 


15:28.077 --> 15:30.079
that had been brought forth 
in the trial 


15:30.078 --> 15:33.681
either by the Ministry of Justice 
or by our attorneys. 


15:33.682 --> 15:35.850
And so every one of those volumes 


15:35.850 --> 15:38.353
had to be reviewed. 


15:38.353 --> 15:41.323
And so it was kind of a long process. 


15:41.323 --> 15:43.325
Our attorneys were able 


15:43.325 --> 15:45.560
to ask the Ministry of Justice, 


15:45.560 --> 15:47.562
“Where is the evidence 


15:47.562 --> 15:50.065
“that funding from the Administrative Center 


15:50.065 --> 15:53.000
was used for any improper activities?”


15:56.738 --> 15:57.673
And so the brothers came back: 


15:57.673 --> 16:00.408
“Well, tell me how much money? 
how many rubles? 


16:00.408 --> 16:04.780
how many kopecks were spent 
to fund this improper activity?” 


16:04.780 --> 16:05.780
And the ministry: 


16:05.780 --> 16:09.000
“Well we don’t have any; 
we don’t have any information like that.”


17:18.920 --> 17:21.390
I thought it was quite a surprise 
to me that one single judge 


17:21.390 --> 17:24.993
could deliberate on six days of evidence 


17:24.993 --> 17:27.228
and within an hour come back and ban 


17:27.228 --> 17:30.431
a religion from practicing its faith.


17:30.432 --> 17:34.335
When one part of the body suffers, 
we all suffer, 


17:34.335 --> 17:37.338
and that will be the feeling 
throughout the world, I’m sure. 


17:37.338 --> 17:41.643
We will allow Jehovah our God 
to correct the injustices. 


17:41.643 --> 17:44.378
We will continue to be 
peaceable with all men. 


17:44.378 --> 17:48.000
We will never 
‘return evil for evil to anybody.’


17:51.387 --> 17:53.989
We have Brother Mark Sanderson 


17:53.988 --> 17:57.591
of the Governing Body tied in with us. 


17:57.592 --> 18:00.362
We’re so happy to have you with us, Mark. 


18:00.362 --> 18:03.999
And first, 
we’d just like to thank you very much 


18:03.998 --> 18:08.203
for making the trip to Russia, Moscow, 


18:08.203 --> 18:11.606
to be with the brothers 
during this critical time. 


18:11.607 --> 18:14.042
And we heard so many comments 


18:14.042 --> 18:16.779
about how much the brothers appreciated 


18:16.778 --> 18:19.000
having you there with them.


18:21.117 --> 18:23.285
Oh, thank you so much, Steve. 


18:23.285 --> 18:26.455
You know, to stand unitedly 
with our brothers in Russia 


18:26.455 --> 18:29.223
in that courtroom when they were facing 


18:29.223 --> 18:31.893
such a vicious attack on their worship 
from the Devil 


18:31.893 --> 18:33.895
was a tremendous privilege. 


18:33.895 --> 18:37.665
I have to say, you know, 
in all my years in serving Jehovah, 


18:37.665 --> 18:41.603
I don’t think I ever felt so proud 
to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


18:41.603 --> 18:43.638
as when I was standing in that courtroom.


18:43.638 --> 18:46.375
Very encouraging, Mark. 


18:46.375 --> 18:49.043
But tell us, please, a little more 


18:49.043 --> 18:52.480
about what was 
the reaction of the brothers 


18:52.480 --> 18:55.000
when they heard this negative decision?


18:57.853 --> 18:59.020
Well, you know, Steve, 


18:59.020 --> 19:01.022
to understand their reaction, 


19:01.022 --> 19:03.725
I think we have to just kind of recap 
with what’s been happening 


19:03.725 --> 19:06.228
because for the last couple of days, 


19:06.228 --> 19:09.698
there has been 
such a joyful spirit in the courtroom. 


19:09.698 --> 19:12.935
The brothers and sisters 
have been walking around, 


19:12.935 --> 19:14.035
greeting one another, 


19:14.035 --> 19:16.938
taking photographs, you know, 


19:16.938 --> 19:20.975
hugging one another, there’s just been 
this tremendous, joyful feeling 


19:20.975 --> 19:23.012
within this courtroom. 


19:23.012 --> 19:25.647
And so then, 
just before the decision was given, 


19:25.647 --> 19:28.984
we heard the closing statements 
from our four attorneys 


19:28.983 --> 19:31.920
and also from Brother Sergey Cherepanov 


19:31.920 --> 19:33.588
and Brother Vasiliy Kalin 


19:33.588 --> 19:36.023
who are both 
on the Branch Committee in Russia. 


19:36.023 --> 19:40.728
And, you know, these brothers 
made such powerful statements; 


19:40.728 --> 19:43.831
their arguments were so compelling 


19:43.832 --> 19:47.569
that we all felt 
just very pumped up by what they said. 


19:47.568 --> 19:51.240
And then, one of the statements 
that several of these brothers made 


19:51.240 --> 19:55.043
was that really we’re not really standing 


19:55.043 --> 19:57.145
before the Russian Supreme Court 


19:57.145 --> 20:00.648
but really the Great Judge 
of the universe, Jehovah, 


20:00.648 --> 20:02.951
is the one who’s judging all matters. 


20:02.952 --> 20:05.954
And they reminded everyone in that courtroom 


20:05.953 --> 20:08.656
that everyone is going to have to stand


20:08.657 --> 20:10.692
before the judgment seat of God. 


20:10.692 --> 20:12.694
And when we heard that, 


20:12.693 --> 20:15.863
we all just felt 
so inspired by those comments. 


20:15.863 --> 20:18.000
Well, then after a few moments 


20:18.000 --> 20:21.102
when the judge 
actually issued his decision 


20:21.102 --> 20:24.405
and the brothers and sisters 
heard that it was negative, 


20:24.405 --> 20:29.143
it was just totally silent 
in the courtroom. 


20:29.143 --> 20:32.948
There was no outcry; 
there was no comment. 


20:32.948 --> 20:35.250
Some of the brothers shook their head. 


20:35.250 --> 20:38.920
I think we were just all in total disbelief 


20:38.920 --> 20:43.025
that the judge could issue 
such an unjust decision, 


20:43.025 --> 20:47.262
after hearing these tremendous arguments 
from our brothers. 


20:47.262 --> 20:49.030
But I have to say, 


20:49.030 --> 20:52.467
although we were stunned 
by the unjust decision 


20:52.467 --> 20:54.369
there was no hint in that courtroom 


20:54.368 --> 20:57.005
that our brothers are backing down, 


20:57.005 --> 20:58.673
that they’re cowering, 


20:58.673 --> 21:01.175
or that they’re going to give up 
their service to Jehovah. 


21:01.175 --> 21:03.245
In fact, 
you could see that they 


21:03.245 --> 21:06.013
were even strengthened by this decision 


21:06.013 --> 21:08.683
to go on serving Jehovah faithfully 


21:08.683 --> 21:10.851
under their new circumstances.


21:10.852 --> 21:12.187
Those comments, Mark, 


21:12.187 --> 21:15.624
are so heartening to us to hear. 


21:15.623 --> 21:19.995
But even though 
there was a negative decision, 


21:19.995 --> 21:22.430
how would you say 


21:22.430 --> 21:24.432
that a great shout of praise 


21:24.432 --> 21:27.000
has gone up to Jehovah’s name?


21:29.203 --> 21:31.205
You know, Steve, 
I just keep coming back 


21:31.205 --> 21:35.243
to what Jesus said at Matthew 10:18. 


21:35.243 --> 21:39.246
He said that we would 
‘be brought before kings and governors, 


21:39.247 --> 21:42.850
for a witness to them and to the nations.’ 


21:42.850 --> 21:45.653
Well, that’s exactly what’s happened here. 


21:45.653 --> 21:48.590
We have been brought 
before kings and governors. 


21:48.590 --> 21:51.427
But what a tremendous witness 


21:51.427 --> 21:53.462
has been given to them and to the nations! 


21:53.462 --> 21:54.462
For example, 


21:54.462 --> 21:56.499
we did this letter-writing campaign. 


21:56.498 --> 21:59.400
Our brothers participated 
all around the world, 


21:59.400 --> 22:02.603
and then the news media 
caught on to that, 


22:02.603 --> 22:06.375
and many newspapers 
and other media outlets reported 


22:06.375 --> 22:08.410
on this tremendous effort 


22:08.410 --> 22:11.380
to write letters to the officials 
of the Russian government. 


22:11.380 --> 22:15.517
Then the delegation that was sent 
by the Governing Body to Moscow, 


22:15.517 --> 22:18.887
we were able to meet 
with three different ambassadors 


22:18.887 --> 22:22.890
from the largest countries on this earth. 


22:22.890 --> 22:25.893
And these ambassadors 
who are so difficult to meet with 


22:25.893 --> 22:27.928
welcomed us in; 


22:27.928 --> 22:29.931
they listened to us patiently; 


22:29.932 --> 22:31.934
and they showed that they had 


22:31.933 --> 22:34.135
a very deep respect for Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


22:34.135 --> 22:36.372
being very familiar with our work 


22:36.372 --> 22:39.540
and really wanting to do things 
to help Jehovah’s people. 


22:39.540 --> 22:41.543
It was wonderful! 


22:41.543 --> 22:43.745
And then, 
consider all the media coverage 


22:43.745 --> 22:45.747
that’s been taking place 


22:45.747 --> 22:49.250
on the court case 
day after day after day. 


22:49.250 --> 22:51.920
And now, 
we have a decision. 


22:51.920 --> 22:55.223
And so now this court decision 
is going to be publicized 


22:55.223 --> 22:58.126
by the media 
all over the world again. 


22:58.127 --> 23:00.129
And still to come, 


23:00.128 --> 23:03.698
we have our appeals that are going 
to be made in the Russian Supreme Court, 


23:03.698 --> 23:08.570
in the European Court of Human Rights, 
with the Human Rights Commission. 


23:08.570 --> 23:12.073
All of this is going 
to result in more publicity. 


23:12.073 --> 23:15.110
And in the end, 
really, what can we say? 


23:15.110 --> 23:18.447
Well, people who know Jehovah’s Witnesses


23:18.447 --> 23:21.282
—people who have 
Jehovah’s Witnesses as their neighbors, 


23:21.282 --> 23:23.719
as their workmates, as their schoolmates, 


23:23.718 --> 23:25.886
who really know who we are—


23:25.887 --> 23:30.025
when they hear these reports, 
they are going to immediately recognize 


23:30.025 --> 23:33.328
that these charges are ridiculous and absurd. 


23:33.328 --> 23:36.998
And they are perhaps even going 
to want to ask questions 


23:36.998 --> 23:39.366
and perhaps even become interested 
in the truth. 


23:39.367 --> 23:43.272
So even through this negative decision, 


23:43.272 --> 23:47.342
Jehovah’s name is being exalted 
and glorified in all the earth.


23:47.342 --> 23:50.545
That is so wonderful, Brother Sanderson, 


23:50.545 --> 23:52.547
what you’ve expressed. 


23:52.547 --> 23:56.084
And one thing 
that we’re just so happy about 


23:56.083 --> 23:58.920
is that the brothers were able to celebrate 


23:58.920 --> 24:02.423
the Memorial of Christ’s death 


24:02.423 --> 24:05.626
before the negative decision was rendered. 


24:05.627 --> 24:08.730
I know many of us
—I was praying and others—


24:08.730 --> 24:11.767
were praying that if it be Jehovah’s will


24:11.767 --> 24:14.002
—now of course, 
we always want his will to take place—


24:14.002 --> 24:15.504
but if it was his will, 


24:15.503 --> 24:19.306
that at least they 
could celebrate the Memorial in peace. 


24:19.307 --> 24:22.000
And so that happened, 
and we’re so happy.


24:23.645 --> 24:25.847
Yes, that was my prayer too. 


24:25.847 --> 24:27.849
And, really, 
when the decision was made 


24:27.848 --> 24:30.751
to adjourn the court 
until the day after the Memorial, 


24:30.752 --> 24:33.189
you know, we really had 
to see Jehovah’s hand in it 


24:33.188 --> 24:37.291
because across Russia now that 
all of the reports have come in, 


24:37.292 --> 24:39.862
we understand that only in three cases 


24:39.862 --> 24:42.297
did the police come to a location 


24:42.297 --> 24:44.299
where the Memorial was being celebrated. 


24:44.298 --> 24:46.000
But even in those cases, 


24:46.000 --> 24:48.603
they did not attempt to disturb the occasion. 


24:48.603 --> 24:50.738
So we can say that our brothers 


24:50.738 --> 24:53.208
were able to celebrate the Memorial 


24:53.208 --> 24:55.210
all across Russia in peace. 


24:55.210 --> 24:58.180
And, of course, 
even with the special talk, 


24:58.180 --> 24:59.948
because again the court adjourned, 


24:59.948 --> 25:03.518
the special talk was also held 
across Russia in peace. 


25:03.518 --> 25:05.520
And so in a mighty way, 


25:05.520 --> 25:08.690
Jehovah stood by his people
and allowed them to have 


25:08.690 --> 25:11.793
these two very important spiritual occasions 


25:11.793 --> 25:13.328
before this decision.


25:13.328 --> 25:16.798
We thank Jehovah for that blessing. 


25:16.798 --> 25:19.033
We thank you, Mark, 


25:19.033 --> 25:21.703
for those very encouraging comments, 


25:21.703 --> 25:26.106
and we thank you again 
for representing the Governing Body 


25:26.107 --> 25:29.677
there in Russia 
and supporting the brothers. 


25:29.677 --> 25:31.680
We really appreciate it. 


25:31.680 --> 25:35.000
And please, 
travel home safely.


25:37.085 --> 25:38.853
Thank you so much, Steve. 


25:38.853 --> 25:41.088
It was such a wonderful privilege 


25:41.088 --> 25:43.090
to be able to be in Russia 
with our dear brothers 


25:43.090 --> 25:45.127
at this historic moment. 


25:45.127 --> 25:48.000
I look forward to seeing you when I return.


25:50.332 --> 25:52.667
And we would like to thank 


25:52.667 --> 25:56.404
all of you for your support. 


25:56.403 --> 26:00.708
You dear brothers and sisters 
gave heartfelt prayers; 


26:00.708 --> 26:04.345
you willingly supported 
the letter-writing campaign. 


26:04.345 --> 26:06.547
For some of you, 
sending a letter 


26:06.547 --> 26:09.784
to one or more 
of the six Russian officials 


26:09.783 --> 26:12.186
came at a great expense. 


26:12.187 --> 26:14.255
We commend you 


26:14.255 --> 26:17.758
for your strong love 
for your brothers in Russia 


26:17.758 --> 26:22.596
and for your loyalty 
to Jehovah’s organization.


26:22.597 --> 26:26.702
But does the Supreme Court’s decision 
against us 


26:26.702 --> 26:29.770
mean that the letter-writing campaign failed 


26:29.770 --> 26:33.775
or that Jehovah did not hear our prayers? 


26:33.775 --> 26:36.277
Absolutely not! 


26:36.277 --> 26:40.615
It simply means 
that we have yet to see 


26:40.615 --> 26:45.220
how Jehovah will maneuver events 
in harmony with his will.


26:45.220 --> 26:48.790
In the meantime, 
we are confident 


26:48.790 --> 26:52.127
that our dear brothers and sisters in Russia 


26:52.127 --> 26:54.762
will remain steadfast 


26:54.762 --> 26:58.099
and that Psalm 112:7, 8 


26:58.098 --> 27:00.168
will be true of them. 


27:00.168 --> 27:04.238
There it says of Jehovah’s righteous one: 


27:04.238 --> 27:08.810
“He will not fear bad news. 


27:08.810 --> 27:13.000
“His heart is steadfast, trusting in Jehovah. 


27:14.348 --> 27:20.321
“His heart is unshakable; he is not afraid; 


27:20.322 --> 27:22.957
“in the end 


27:22.957 --> 27:28.000
he will look in triumph on his adversaries.”


27:29.763 --> 27:33.568
As long as we’re still living 
in this old system, 


27:33.568 --> 27:37.905
as we have seen in Russia 
and many other lands, 


27:37.905 --> 27:40.508
we can expect persecution 


27:40.508 --> 27:45.713
for simply wanting 
to worship Jehovah in peace. 


27:45.713 --> 27:48.816
But do we need to fear such persecution? 


27:48.817 --> 27:50.819
No! 


27:50.818 --> 27:53.921
Jesus Christ and the heavenly armies 


27:53.922 --> 27:58.000
are ready to take the lead 
in defending Jehovah’s people. 


27:59.227 --> 28:01.495
We can rest assured 


28:01.495 --> 28:04.898
that according to Isaiah 54:17: 


28:04.898 --> 28:07.868
“No weapon formed against [us] 


28:07.868 --> 28:10.671
will have any success.” 


28:10.672 --> 28:12.674
And why? 


28:12.673 --> 28:17.000
Because Jehovah is on our side. 


28:18.547 --> 28:21.015
May we all continue to pray 


28:21.015 --> 28:25.018
for our dear brothers and sisters in Russia 


28:25.018 --> 28:29.856
whom we love very much.


28:29.857 --> 28:34.529
This is JW Broadcasting 


28:34.528 --> 28:48.726
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
