To set the stage, we’d like to begin

00:00:03.653 --> 00:00:05.755 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with a few thoughts about the subject

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:08.792 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing.”

00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:12.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what we are told at Psalm 100:2.

00:00:12.462 --> 00:00:17.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you serve Jehovah
with rejoicing all the time?

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess we all will agree

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at times it
can be difficult to be happy.

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:26.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, is it really important

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve Jehovah with rejoicing?

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:31.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what does it really mean?

00:00:31.181 --> 00:00:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, what is this joyful attitude

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:36.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah expects from us?

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:40.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what can we do to serve Jehovah

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with rejoicing and maintain a joyful spirit?

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:50.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we prove that it is important
to serve Jehovah with rejoicing?

00:00:50.967 --> 00:00:55.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might think of our goal,
which is to reflect his personality.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:01:00.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Timothy 1:11,
he’s called “the happy God.”

00:01:00.977 --> 00:01:04.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So isn’t it logical that Jehovah expects us

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:07.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be happy in his service?

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:10.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Deuteronomy chapter 28,

00:01:10.386 --> 00:01:14.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find a report
of God’s dealings with the Israelites.

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:18.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here Jehovah warned them
of what would take place

00:01:18.261 --> 00:01:20.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they became disobedient

00:01:20.463 --> 00:01:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lost their joy in serving him.

00:01:25.235 --> 00:01:29.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read at Deuteronomy chapter 28,
beginning in verse 45:

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All these curses
will certainly come upon you

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:38.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . because you did not listen
to the voice of Jehovah your God

00:01:38.615 --> 00:01:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by keeping his commandments and . . .

00:01:41.384 --> 00:01:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you did not serve Jehovah your God

00:01:45.121 --> 00:01:48.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with rejoicing and joy of heart

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:50.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you had
such an abundance of everything.”

00:01:52.162 --> 00:01:55.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah took such good care
of the Israelites,

00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:58.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet they were not happy.

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:02.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This attitude was something
he did not like at all.

00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:06.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see that serving Jehovah joyfully

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is very important.

00:02:09.512 --> 00:02:13.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was emphasized by what Jesus taught.

00:02:13.082 --> 00:02:15.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in the Sermon on the Mount,

00:02:15.518 --> 00:02:18.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helped his audience to understand

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:21.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to be happy.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:23.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, this part in Matthew chapter 5

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is referred to as the nine happinesses.

00:02:28.097 --> 00:02:33.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, the apostle Paul
wrote about “the fruitage of the spirit.”

00:02:33.002 --> 00:02:38.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy is counted among the aspects
of the fruitage of the spirit.

00:02:38.007 --> 00:02:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being joyful is important,

00:02:41.644 --> 00:02:44.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by means of his spirit,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helps us to rejoice in his service.

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:52.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it realistic to expect

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will smile all the time

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:58.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cheerfully sing songs the whole day?

00:02:58.628 --> 00:03:02.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, this is not what Jehovah expects.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:07.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have different personalities
and express our happiness differently.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, there are moments in life

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are sad and disappointed.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is fully aware
that some of us are not healthy.

00:03:18.915 --> 00:03:21.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others might fight depression

00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:26.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are therefore at times
just not able to express joy in this way.

00:03:26.723 --> 00:03:30.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet he loves all of us

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:33.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appreciates us very much.

00:03:34.697 --> 00:03:39.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what is the joy
that Jehovah expects from us?

00:03:39.702 --> 00:03:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What exactly is
this joyful spirit, or attitude?

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:49.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in Deuteronomy,
the term “rejoicing” means

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:54.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the inner feeling
and the outward manifestation of joy.”

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:58.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also read about the “joy of heart.”

00:03:58.855 --> 00:04:02.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The heart stands for
what we are on the inside.

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:05.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the interior man and is displayed

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:10.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all his various activities,
desires, affections, emotions, 

00:04:10.934 --> 00:04:15.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
passions, thoughts, and so on.

00:04:15.171 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we see that joy comes from within us.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:24.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, does the joy we are talking about

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:27.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depend on circumstances?

00:04:28.618 --> 00:04:33.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s illustrate: I think it’s safe to say
that we all like sunshine.

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:36.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, how does the farmer feel

00:04:36.726 --> 00:04:39.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he urgently needs it to rain

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:43.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s waiting and waiting?

00:04:43.766 --> 00:04:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He probably would be happier if he had rain.

00:04:47.937 --> 00:04:52.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these last days, we rarely, if ever,

00:04:52.275 --> 00:04:55.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have perfect circumstances with no problems.

00:04:55.845 --> 00:04:59.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I think we can all agree
that our joy in Jehovah’s service

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not based on circumstances.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:07.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve had here
on this program and in our publications

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many examples of ones
who have maintained their joy

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:14.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s service
despite challenging circumstances,

00:05:14.797 --> 00:05:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like poor health or opposition.

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:24.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what is it
that makes us a happy person?

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:29.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us to open up
the scope of the answer,

00:05:29.178 --> 00:05:32.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you be willing to join me
for a little experiment?

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please close your eyes for a moment.

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:38.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have your eyes closed?

00:05:38.921 --> 00:05:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now think about an apple.

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:46.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you can open your eyes again.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me ask you a question:

00:05:49.832 --> 00:05:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you think about a red apple,

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:56.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a green apple,

00:05:56.939 --> 00:05:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a yellow apple?

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:01.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you able to answer this question?

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I asked you to do
was to think about an apple.

00:06:06.382 --> 00:06:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is, we think in pictures.

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:15.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we think
of countless pictures every day.

00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:17.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after we think about it,

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like we put
all of the pictures in a stack.

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then when we think
the same thought a second time,

00:06:24.734 --> 00:06:27.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like we pull the picture out from below

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put it on top of the stack.

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:34.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The longer that we do not think the thought,

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:37.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the deeper the picture gets in the stack

00:06:37.947 --> 00:06:40.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it becomes more difficult to remember.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this stack of pictures
representing our thoughts

00:06:45.521 --> 00:06:48.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our subconscious.

00:06:48.791 --> 00:06:51.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This stack of pictures makes up

00:06:51.527 --> 00:06:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our emotional state, or state of mind.

00:06:54.864 --> 00:06:59.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It determines whether we are sad or happy,

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:03.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether we are bored
or excited, and so forth.

00:07:06.576 --> 00:07:10.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah our Creator
is aware of this powerful connection

00:07:10.913 --> 00:07:14.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between our thoughts  and pictures.

00:07:14.250 --> 00:07:18.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s please turn to 2 Kings chapter 6

00:07:18.054 --> 00:07:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find one example
of how Jehovah made use of this.

00:07:22.892 --> 00:07:27.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we find the report
about the king of Syria

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wanted to capture Elisha.

00:07:30.366 --> 00:07:33.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did his attendant feel?

00:07:33.936 --> 00:07:38.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see at 2 Kings chapter 6,
beginning with verse 15:

00:07:40.143 --> 00:07:42.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the attendant of the man

00:07:42.311 --> 00:07:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the true God rose early and went outside,

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:51.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw that an army with horses
and war chariots was surrounding the city.

00:07:51.287 --> 00:07:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At once the attendant said to him:

00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:55.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Alas, my master!

00:07:55.591 --> 00:07:57.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we to do?’”

00:07:57.593 --> 00:08:00.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The attendant was in fear.

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:03.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He probably thought
about their defenseless position

00:08:03.299 --> 00:08:07.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saw himself
already captured by the Syrian army.

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:11.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would Elisha be able to help his attendant?

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 16:

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:18.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he [Elisha] said: ‘Do not be afraid!

00:08:18.147 --> 00:08:22.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For there are more who are with us
than those who are with them.’”

00:08:23.452 --> 00:08:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, Elisha said:
‘Think of something else.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:30.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the many that are with us.’

00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:32.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did this work?

00:08:32.895 --> 00:08:37.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that the attendant was not able
to focus on these reassuring thoughts.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could not envision Jehovah rescuing them.

00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:45.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jehovah help the attendant?

00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:49.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Kings 6:17, we read:

00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:54.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Elisha began to pray and say:

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:59.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O Jehovah, open his eyes,
please, that he may see.’

00:08:59.155 --> 00:09:04.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Immediately Jehovah
opened the attendant’s eyes and he saw,

00:09:04.026 --> 00:09:06.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and look! the mountainous region

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:09.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was full of horses and war chariots of fire

00:09:09.865 --> 00:09:12.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all around Elisha.”

00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:16.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped the attendant with pictures.

00:09:16.505 --> 00:09:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The horses and chariots
captured his attention.

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:21.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His thoughts now focused on the fact

00:09:21.911 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
was with them and in full control.

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:30.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in his mind,
he already saw Jehovah’s victory,

00:09:30.586 --> 00:09:34.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was not concerned anymore.

00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:36.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was happy.

00:09:36.259 --> 00:09:40.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he saw influenced his thoughts

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and changed his state of mind.

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:46.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thoughts are so powerful!

00:09:46.435 --> 00:09:49.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how considerate Jehovah is!

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:51.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, in the end,
Jehovah did not need

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:54.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any of these horses and chariots.

00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:56.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saved Elisha and his attendant

00:09:56.479 --> 00:09:59.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by striking the Syrian army with blindness.

00:10:02.218 --> 00:10:05.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we compare the emotions of Elisha

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:08.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his attendant, what made the difference?

00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The circumstances were exactly the same.

00:10:11.294 --> 00:10:15.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their thoughts made the difference.

00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:20.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what
does this have to do with our subject

00:10:20.102 --> 00:10:23.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing”?

00:10:23.406 --> 00:10:28.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So far, we have established
that Jehovah expects us to be happy, right?

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have seen that our thoughts

00:10:30.579 --> 00:10:33.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be pictures that influence

00:10:33.115 --> 00:10:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who we are and how we feel.

00:10:36.352 --> 00:10:39.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pictures and thoughts are closely connected.

00:10:39.422 --> 00:10:43.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why the apostle Paul at Romans 12:2

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:46.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlights the importance
of our thoughts when he says:

00:10:46.295 --> 00:10:50.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be transformed by making your mind over,”

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at Ephesians 4:23,
he emphasizes this by saying:

00:10:55.204 --> 00:10:57.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:11:02.044 --> 00:11:05.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both scriptures highlight that our thoughts

00:11:05.614 --> 00:11:09.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are critical and have a bearing
on our whole being.

00:11:09.518 --> 00:11:14.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, the apostle Paul knew
that we can change our thinking.

00:11:14.523 --> 00:11:18.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me
to 2 Corinthians chapter 10,

00:11:18.494 --> 00:11:22.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what he recommends that we do.

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:26.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at 2 Corinthians 10:5, he says:

00:11:26.535 --> 00:11:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are bringing every thought into captivity

00:11:30.206 --> 00:11:33.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it obedient to the Christ.”

00:11:33.442 --> 00:11:36.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t this exactly what we should do?

00:11:36.545 --> 00:11:39.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We control what we think.

00:11:39.715 --> 00:11:43.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We avoid occupying our mind
with thoughts that weaken our faith

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:48.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or thoughts that undermine
our determination to serve Jehovah.

00:11:48.124 --> 00:11:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we said that thoughts

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are like pictures that stay within us.

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:59.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot delete them,
and they will have an effect on how we feel.

00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:04.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is there something else we can do?

00:12:04.039 --> 00:12:07.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready for a second experiment?

00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:10.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please close your eyes again,

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:14.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not think of an apple.

00:12:14.049 --> 00:12:17.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can open your eyes again.

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:21.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you successful
in not thinking of an apple?

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:26.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you probably had to force yourself
to think of something else.

00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:29.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are made to think.

00:12:29.298 --> 00:12:33.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the key to serving Jehovah with rejoicing

00:12:33.636 --> 00:12:36.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lies not just in avoiding negative thoughts

00:12:36.605 --> 00:12:40.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in thinking healthy thoughts.

00:12:40.209 --> 00:12:44.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians chapter 4 lists a few of them.

00:12:44.413 --> 00:12:47.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read in verse 8:

00:12:47.716 --> 00:12:51.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, brothers, whatever things are true,

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:54.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are of serious concern,

00:12:54.857 --> 00:12:56.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are righteous,

00:12:56.859 --> 00:13:01.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are chaste,
whatever things are lovable,

00:13:01.397 --> 00:13:05.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are well-spoken-of,
whatever things are virtuous,

00:13:05.901 --> 00:13:08.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and whatever things are praiseworthy,

00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continue considering

00:13:10.473 --> 00:13:15.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[or “thinking about;
meditating on”] these things.”

00:13:16.846 --> 00:13:20.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By considering and meditating on
these healthy subjects,

00:13:20.716 --> 00:13:23.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we create pictures in our mind
that make it easier for us

00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:27.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to display our joy in Jehovah’s service.

00:13:27.323 --> 00:13:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Serving Jehovah with rejoicing
really depends on us.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happiness does not depend
on our circumstances;

00:13:35.498 --> 00:13:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happiness comes
from doing things Jehovah’s way.

00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:42.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we actively control our thoughts,

00:13:42.371 --> 00:13:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we add more pleasant pictures.

00:13:44.907 --> 00:13:47.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even if in the past

00:13:47.009 --> 00:13:48.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve experienced things
that make it difficult

00:13:48.978 --> 00:13:50.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to express happiness,

00:13:50.679 --> 00:13:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in time,

00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:56.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these unpleasant pictures
will be buried under thoughts

00:13:56.118 --> 00:13:59.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like those listed in Philippians chapter 4.

00:13:59.054 --> 00:14:00.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And gradually

00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:04.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our inner peace, contentment,

00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:08.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and happiness grows
and can be seen by others.

00:14:08.531 --> 00:14:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, our happy God,

00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:13.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appreciates every little step
in this direction

00:14:13.769 --> 00:14:18.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s important to him
that we serve him with rejoicing.
