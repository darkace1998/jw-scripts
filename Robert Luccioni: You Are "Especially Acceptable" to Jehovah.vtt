00:00:01.217 --> 00:00:03.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme for this month is

00:00:03.753 --> 00:00:08.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You Are ‘Especially Acceptable’ to Jehovah.”

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.126 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We love Jehovah,

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:12.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we want to give him our best.

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:14.864 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But we want our sacrifices

00:00:14.864 --> 00:00:17.167 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to be acceptable to him.

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we may strive to be involved
as much as possible

00:00:21.337 --> 00:00:25.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all the exciting things going on
in the organization.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you ever feel discouraged,
perhaps even guilty or frustrated

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding your sacrifices to Jehovah?

00:00:35.151 --> 00:00:38.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some cases, it may be
that you’re so involved

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:41.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in so many different aspects of the work

00:00:41.991 --> 00:00:44.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that perhaps you’re not giving
adequate attention

00:00:44.561 --> 00:00:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your spiritual, personal, or family needs.

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:53.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, on the other hand,
it may be the opposite situation.

00:00:53.503 --> 00:00:56.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have those feelings
because you cannot do

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as much as you’d like to

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:01.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as much as others are doing.

00:01:01.878 --> 00:01:05.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may have been
very involved in the work,

00:01:05.882 --> 00:01:10.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but unexpectedly your circumstances changed
because of your health

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:14.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some other calamity
that came along and shut things down.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:19.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such feelings may cause us to ask ourselves,

00:01:19.763 --> 00:01:24.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What does Jehovah really expect of us?’

00:01:24.768 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re going to consider
three points in our discussion.

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first is this,

00:01:30.106 --> 00:01:32.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to set the right priorities.

00:01:32.842 --> 00:01:34.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second,

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:37.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not compare yourselves unfavorably

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with others.

00:01:38.782 --> 00:01:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third,

00:01:40.483 --> 00:01:44.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember what is important to Jehovah.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with our first point:

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah expects us to set

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:51.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right priorities.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we do that?

00:01:53.596 --> 00:01:55.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a scripture that’s helped me is found

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:00.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 8:12.

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:02.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at the time of this letter,

00:02:02.138 --> 00:02:05.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christians in Judea
were facing many trials.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:09.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these trials included
famine, persecution,

00:02:09.012 --> 00:02:11.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the plundering of their belongings.

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:13.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They needed relief.

00:02:13.783 --> 00:02:16.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, previously, in his first letter,

00:02:16.586 --> 00:02:20.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had encouraged the Corinthians
to set aside funds

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help the brothers in Judea.

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly thereafter, when Paul wrote

00:02:25.261 --> 00:02:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second inspired letter
to the Corinthians,

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:32.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he urged them to get their gifts ready.

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:34.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, with this context of giving,

00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sacrificing, and helping others in mind,

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:42.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read 2 Corinthians 8:12:

00:02:42.812 --> 00:02:46.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For if the readiness is there first,

00:02:46.216 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is especially acceptable

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:50.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to what a person has,

00:02:50.653 --> 00:02:52.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not according to what a person

00:02:52.655 --> 00:02:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does not have.”

00:02:54.457 --> 00:02:59.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul here is discussing sacrifices
that are acceptable

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sacrifices
that are unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:05.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the difference?

00:03:05.835 --> 00:03:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, picture it this way.

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:10.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Picture a young family in Corinth

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a father, mother, and children.

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:18.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The father hears the letter from Paul
being read to the congregation,

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:20.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the father is very excited.

00:03:20.316 --> 00:03:24.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to help his brothers in Judea.

00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:28.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when the family gets home,
he discusses the matter with his wife.

00:03:28.324 --> 00:03:30.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “We have a little money

00:03:30.793 --> 00:03:34.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we’ve set aside
to do some work on the house,

00:03:34.063 --> 00:03:38.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and we were saving
to purchase another donkey.

00:03:38.134 --> 00:03:40.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, I’d like to take that money

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute it
to our needy brothers in Jerusalem.”

00:03:44.874 --> 00:03:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:51.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say
that is an acceptable sacrifice?

00:03:51.214 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:53.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a sacrifice

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—he and his family
are donating money to help others—

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:01.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s according to what the family has.

00:04:01.224 --> 00:04:05.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sacrifice would no doubt
be very precious to Jehovah.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:08.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can picture how excited
the family would be

00:04:08.998 --> 00:04:11.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support that decision.

00:04:11.935 --> 00:04:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s imagine a different family
in the same congregation.

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:20.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This time, the husband comes home and says,

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:22.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I know we do not have any extra money,

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but I’d like to use the money
that we’ve set aside

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:29.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to feed our family for the next two weeks

00:04:29.452 --> 00:04:32.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and donate it to the brothers
that are in need in Jerusalem.”

00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:35.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think now?

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:40.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say
that is an acceptable sacrifice?

00:04:40.096 --> 00:04:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the same good motive,
the same good cause,

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it may even be the same amount of money.

00:04:46.135 --> 00:04:47.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it acceptable?

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:51.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:04:51.074 --> 00:04:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not according to what he has.

00:04:54.477 --> 00:04:57.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not want him
to take food away from his children.

00:04:57.914 --> 00:05:02.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine him explaining
that decision to his family?

00:05:02.485 --> 00:05:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The father has a God-given responsibility
to feed his family.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says,
‘Just give according to what you have.’

00:05:12.962 --> 00:05:15.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:05:15.198 --> 00:05:18.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can this help us to maintain balance

00:05:18.935 --> 00:05:22.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and set the right priorities?

00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:26.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our sacrifices
are acceptable to Jehovah

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we give according to what we have.

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:32.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our sacrifice would be unacceptable

00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:35.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we try to give beyond what we have.

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:38.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we apply that?

00:05:38.955 --> 00:05:43.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there are certain areas
that Jehovah says are nonnegotiable.

00:05:43.593 --> 00:05:45.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of those areas?

00:05:46.396 --> 00:05:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One is our relationship with Jehovah.

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He expects us to keep
that relationship strong

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making time for such important activities

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as lingering in prayer,
reading and meditating on God’s Word,

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attending and participating in our meetings,

00:06:04.147 --> 00:06:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and having a meaningful share
in the ministry.

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:12.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what we do in the way of work
for the organization

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:15.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must never crowd out the spiritual activities

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:18.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that keep us close to God.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:22.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, that would be unacceptable
to Jehovah.

00:06:22.965 --> 00:06:26.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example
is our family responsibilities.

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah expects us to care for our family,

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only materially and physically

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:35.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also spiritually and emotionally.

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must spend time together

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:40.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in family worship, in the field ministry,

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in recreation.

00:06:43.753 --> 00:06:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means that we must not allow
our work for the organization

00:06:48.357 --> 00:06:51.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to interfere with the necessary time we need

00:06:51.227 --> 00:06:53.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for our family.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another example is our health.

00:07:01.270 --> 00:07:04.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah expects us to serve him whole-souled.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That involves doing all

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:08.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our health allows us to do.

00:07:08.878 --> 00:07:11.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we do all that we can
to maintain our health

00:07:11.848 --> 00:07:14.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by eating well, getting enough sleep,

00:07:14.984 --> 00:07:17.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exercising regularly.

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, we must not allow
our work for the organization

00:07:22.291 --> 00:07:24.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cause us to neglect our health.

00:07:24.894 --> 00:07:29.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be unacceptable to Jehovah.

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:31.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do you see the point?

00:07:31.367 --> 00:07:34.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can help us to set the right priorities?

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:39.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, again, remember the principle
here at 2 Corinthians 8:12.

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:42.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, in effect, says:

00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Give to me according to what you have,

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:48.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘not according to what you do not have.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:53.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that will be
especially acceptable to me.’

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that even though
we have set the right priorities,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s still a challenge to maintain balance.

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:03.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Balance is not something
that once you have it

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can just lock it in.

00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:07.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it’s like a tightrope walker

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:11.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who must constantly recalibrate and adjust

00:08:11.207 --> 00:08:13.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to maintain balance.

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:17.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true
with maintaining balance in our lives.

00:08:17.613 --> 00:08:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know it’s a constant process for me,

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:24.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’d guess it’s just as challenging
for you as well.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had excellent articles
in our publications

00:08:27.623 --> 00:08:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help with managing our time.

00:08:30.693 --> 00:08:33.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are two of them:

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The April 2010 <i>Awake!,</i> page 7,

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has an article entitled

00:08:39.368 --> 00:08:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“20 Ways to Create More Time,”

00:08:44.106 --> 00:08:47.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the February 2014 <i>Awake!</i>, page 6,

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:51.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How to Invest Your Time Wisely.”

00:08:51.647 --> 00:08:54.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may find these helpful
to do further research

00:08:54.483 --> 00:08:59.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to set the right priorities
and maintain balance.

00:09:00.923 --> 00:09:03.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second point to help us maintain balance

00:09:03.726 --> 00:09:07.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is this: Do not compare yourselves

00:09:07.496 --> 00:09:09.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unfavorably with others.

00:09:10.433 --> 00:09:12.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will always be ones

00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doing more in their service
to Jehovah than we are.

00:09:16.305 --> 00:09:19.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we start comparing ourselves to them

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:23.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or feel that they are
more acceptable to Jehovah,

00:09:23.913 --> 00:09:27.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this can cause us to lose
not just our balance

00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:29.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but our joy as well.

00:09:29.919 --> 00:09:33.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When considering this aspect
of not comparing,

00:09:33.556 --> 00:09:37.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think of the prophets
Daniel, Ezekiel, and Jeremiah.

00:09:37.693 --> 00:09:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you remember, these men
were contemporaries of one another,

00:09:42.164 --> 00:09:45.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but each had very different circumstances.

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:50.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel was in the court
of the king in Babylon.

00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:53.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he had times of persecution

00:09:53.309 --> 00:09:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and challenges.

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:58.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But overall, he was an official for the king.

00:09:58.414 --> 00:10:01.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He received special training
for his position.

00:10:01.717 --> 00:10:05.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he may have had it relatively easy.

00:10:06.222 --> 00:10:09.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel was living among his fellow exiles

00:10:09.925 --> 00:10:13.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a community “by the river Chebar.”

00:10:13.462 --> 00:10:17.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overall, things were fairly stable there.

00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:19.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, the Jews in exile
had a measure of freedom.

00:10:19.969 --> 00:10:23.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They built houses, they had children,
they settled down,

00:10:23.205 --> 00:10:26.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they developed skills in various trades.

00:10:26.776 --> 00:10:31.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it seems that perhaps they had
a relatively stable life.

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:34.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you have Jeremiah.

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:35.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was in Jerusalem.

00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:38.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that somebody
was always trying to kill him.

00:10:38.487 --> 00:10:42.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much of the time,
he was either hiding or in confinement.

00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:46.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s the question,
Did the differing circumstances

00:10:46.862 --> 00:10:48.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of their assignments

00:10:48.864 --> 00:10:53.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mean that Jehovah loved or favored
one more than the other?

00:10:53.402 --> 00:10:55.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:10:55.404 --> 00:10:57.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just an assignment.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wanted a prophet in Jerusalem.

00:11:00.643 --> 00:11:03.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted one with the exiles in Babylon,

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wanted another
in the court of the king.

00:11:06.649 --> 00:11:10.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just the way the assignments fell.

00:11:10.252 --> 00:11:14.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you can imagine
how counterproductive it would’ve been

00:11:14.824 --> 00:11:18.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each of these three men
to judge his value

00:11:18.994 --> 00:11:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on his assignment

00:11:20.996 --> 00:11:24.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to compare himself to the other two.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could happen.

00:11:25.468 --> 00:11:26.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:29.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel and Jeremiah

00:11:29.638 --> 00:11:32.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have looked at Daniel and thought:

00:11:32.241 --> 00:11:35.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Ah, he has direct access to the king.

00:11:35.644 --> 00:11:38.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s living where all the big decisions
are being made.

00:11:38.514 --> 00:11:40.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s right in the center of it all.

00:11:40.616 --> 00:11:44.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He can use his influence
to help Jehovah’s people.

00:11:44.253 --> 00:11:46.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What a privilege that would be!

00:11:46.322 --> 00:11:48.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I was there!’

00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:52.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or Daniel and Jeremiah

00:11:52.094 --> 00:11:54.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could’ve looked at Ezekiel

00:11:54.363 --> 00:11:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and felt that’s where they wished they were:

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We would have at least relative freedom
with the exiles.

00:12:01.837 --> 00:12:05.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We’d be able to encourage
our fellow worshippers of Jehovah.

00:12:05.674 --> 00:12:08.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could help others learn about Jehovah.’

00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:12.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, believe it or not, Daniel and Ezekiel

00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:15.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could’ve looked at Jeremiah and thought:

00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:19.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We know things are tough,
but that’s where we want to be.

00:12:19.789 --> 00:12:24.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He’s on the front lines, risking his life
for Jehovah and the nation.

00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:26.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s where the action is.’

00:12:27.763 --> 00:12:31.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Different assignments,
different circumstances,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
different locations

00:12:33.602 --> 00:12:37.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but they were all special to Jehovah.

00:12:37.373 --> 00:12:39.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:41.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The lesson is

00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:43.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we must be careful

00:12:43.412 --> 00:12:47.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not compare ourselves
unfavorably with others.

00:12:47.483 --> 00:12:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is good to see
if we can imitate and benefit

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the example of others,

00:12:53.155 --> 00:12:55.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we need to be careful

00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:58.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not begin determining the value

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what we’re doing for Jehovah

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:02.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on what others are doing.

00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:05.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That could cause us to lose our joy,

00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:07.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lose our balance,

00:13:07.636 --> 00:13:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fall into the trap
of doing things for the wrong reasons.

00:13:12.475 --> 00:13:14.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to our last point:

00:13:14.477 --> 00:13:18.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what is important to Jehovah.

00:13:18.981 --> 00:13:22.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Circumstances change in life.

00:13:22.318 --> 00:13:25.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As mentioned, in the past we may have been

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
extremely busy in Jehovah’s service.

00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:32.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But because of the world’s situation,
that may have changed.

00:13:32.294 --> 00:13:36.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or other circumstances in our life
may have changed.

00:13:36.465 --> 00:13:40.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does that somehow change
how Jehovah feels about us?

00:13:40.769 --> 00:13:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:13:41.871 --> 00:13:43.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

00:13:43.205 --> 00:13:45.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is important to Jehovah?

00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What makes you
“especially acceptable” to Jehovah?

00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:52.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s read together

00:13:52.281 --> 00:13:56.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 10:34, 35:

00:13:56.719 --> 00:14:01.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Peter began to speak, and he said:

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:03.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now I truly understand

00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘that God is not partial,

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:08.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but in every nation the man who fears him

00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:10.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and does what is right

00:14:10.065 --> 00:14:12.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is acceptable to him.’”

00:14:12.201 --> 00:14:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear Jehovah.

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:15.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do what is right.

00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:17.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obey his commandments.

00:14:17.907 --> 00:14:19.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s it.

00:14:19.341 --> 00:14:23.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what makes us acceptable to Jehovah.

00:14:23.412 --> 00:14:28.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We complicate things at times
and equate our responsibilities

00:14:28.417 --> 00:14:31.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how we’re used,
where we’re asked to serve—

00:14:31.954 --> 00:14:34.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as things that define our value.

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:38.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not how Jehovah sees things.

00:14:38.027 --> 00:14:40.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that has helped me

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:44.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found at Ecclesiastes 3:10:

00:14:45.534 --> 00:14:49.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have seen the occupation

00:14:49.271 --> 00:14:52.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that God has given to the sons of men

00:14:52.207 --> 00:14:55.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep them occupied.”

00:14:55.644 --> 00:15:00.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The occupation” refers
to our activities, the things we do.

00:15:00.082 --> 00:15:04.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has given us work
to keep us occupied.

00:15:04.887 --> 00:15:07.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whenever I read that,
I think of parents with their children.

00:15:07.756 --> 00:15:12.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps they take them to the beach
for the afternoon, and what do they do?

00:15:12.027 --> 00:15:14.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They give them some toys,
and they let them play.

00:15:14.763 --> 00:15:16.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:19.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To keep them occupied.

00:15:19.668 --> 00:15:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that, in a way,
is what Jehovah does with us.

00:15:22.905 --> 00:15:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think about it,
Jehovah does not need us to do the work.

00:15:27.209 --> 00:15:30.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can accomplish his work without us,

00:15:30.346 --> 00:15:34.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he dignifies us and allows us
to have a share.

00:15:34.316 --> 00:15:37.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He provides us with meaningful work.

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:40.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note what it goes on to say in verse 13

00:15:40.322 --> 00:15:43.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Ecclesiastes chapter 3:

00:15:43.092 --> 00:15:46.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also that everyone should eat and drink

00:15:46.428 --> 00:15:50.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:15:50.232 --> 00:15:52.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the gift of God.”

00:15:53.235 --> 00:15:56.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work is a gift from Jehovah.

00:15:56.505 --> 00:16:00.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it reasonable to think
that Jehovah would give a gift

00:16:00.409 --> 00:16:04.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that stresses us out
or creates hardship for us?

00:16:04.546 --> 00:16:05.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:16:05.614 --> 00:16:08.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants us to find enjoyment in our work.

00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:13.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are the ones that may get too concerned
with assigning rank and priority

00:16:13.822 --> 00:16:17.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to various privileges
and locations of service

00:16:17.092 --> 00:16:21.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—where we are in the sand
and what toys we have to play with.

00:16:22.464 --> 00:16:26.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is important to Jehovah?

00:16:26.101 --> 00:16:28.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice our final scripture

00:16:28.103 --> 00:16:32.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ecclesiastes 12:13:

00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:35.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The conclusion of the matter,

00:16:35.978 --> 00:16:38.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“everything having been heard, is:

00:16:38.514 --> 00:16:40.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Fear the true God

00:16:40.516 --> 00:16:42.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and keep his commandments,

00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this is the whole obligation of man.”

00:16:46.655 --> 00:16:48.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear Jehovah.

00:16:48.657 --> 00:16:50.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep his commandments.

00:16:50.659 --> 00:16:53.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just serve Jehovah.

00:16:53.028 --> 00:16:55.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do the best that you can.

00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:57.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay balanced.

00:16:57.032 --> 00:17:00.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give according to what you have.

00:17:00.402 --> 00:17:02.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the important things.

00:17:02.638 --> 00:17:07.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you do them, no matter what
your personal circumstances,

00:17:07.009 --> 00:17:12.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will remain
“especially acceptable” to Jehovah.
