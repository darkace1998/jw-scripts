The theme for this program is

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:06.456 line:10% position:50% align:center
“As Jehovah’s Sheep,

00:00:06.456 --> 00:00:10.493 line:10% position:50% align:center
Reject ‘the Voice of Strangers’!”

00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:12.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s estimated that there may be

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:17.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
15 million animal species on earth today.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
But of all these animals,

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:24.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
which one is most often used in the Bible
to represent good people?

00:00:24.007 --> 00:00:25.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sheep!

00:00:25.675 --> 00:00:28.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus often used this illustration.

00:00:28.478 --> 00:00:30.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are three examples.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, to his 12 apostles, he said

00:00:33.116 --> 00:00:35.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 10:16:

00:00:35.585 --> 00:00:38.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am sending you out as sheep

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
among wolves.”

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:44.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, regarding what he’ll do
shortly before Armageddon,

00:00:44.794 --> 00:00:47.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said at Matthew 25:32, 33

00:00:47.731 --> 00:00:52.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “he will separate people
one from another,

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:55.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as a shepherd separates the sheep

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:57.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the goats.”

00:00:57.407 --> 00:01:01.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
In subsequent verses,
he describes how the sheep

00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:03.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
will inherit everlasting life

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:07.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the goats will depart
into everlasting destruction.

00:01:08.551 --> 00:01:12.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our third example: Jesus said

00:01:12.021 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
at John 10:16:

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:18.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have other sheep,
which are not of this fold;

00:01:18.728 --> 00:01:21.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
“those too I must bring in,

00:01:21.264 --> 00:01:24.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will listen to my voice,

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:28.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will become one flock,
one shepherd.”

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:31.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
But a question arises:

00:01:31.441 --> 00:01:34.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did Jesus use a sheep illustration

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:38.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
to represent people
who will gain everlasting life?

00:01:38.948 --> 00:01:42.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Undoubtedly, it was
because of the desirable qualities

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:44.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
literal sheep have.

00:01:44.888 --> 00:01:49.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re gregarious,
having a liking for companionship.

00:01:49.793 --> 00:01:51.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t like to be alone.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a good thing
because without the flock

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:56.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the protection of the shepherd,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re defenseless
if a lion or a bear approaches.

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
About all they can do is bleat, “Baa.”

00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:08.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Goodbye, little sheep.

00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:12.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another good quality is that sheep as a whole

00:02:12.816 --> 00:02:16.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
tend to be peaceful, inoffensive

00:02:16.286 --> 00:02:18.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
—very different from goats.

00:02:18.922 --> 00:02:23.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
As little boys, my brother and I would pet
the goats that my grandfather had,

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if we turned our backs on them,

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
one would often sneak up behind us

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:32.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and butt us for no reason.

00:02:33.203 --> 00:02:36.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are some
of the desirable characteristics

00:02:36.039 --> 00:02:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make sheep an appropriate illustration
for good people.

00:02:41.211 --> 00:02:44.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the quality
we especially want to focus on

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:48.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
is identified at John chapter 10,

00:02:48.284 --> 00:02:50.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 4 and 5.

00:02:50.887 --> 00:02:53.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he [that is, the shepherd]

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:55.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has brought all his own out,

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he goes ahead of them,

00:02:58.061 --> 00:03:02.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the sheep follow him,
because they know his voice.

00:03:02.432 --> 00:03:06.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will by no means follow a stranger

00:03:06.202 --> 00:03:08.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but will flee from him,

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:13.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they do not know
the voice of strangers.”

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:17.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the desirable quality?

00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:19.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sheep listen to the voice of their shepherd

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:23.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reject the voice of strangers.

00:03:23.353 --> 00:03:25.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding this quality of sheep,

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
the September 1, 2004, <i>Watchtower </i> said this:

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:34.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A book on Bible lands relates
that a visitor once claimed

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:39.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that sheep recognize their shepherd
by his dress, not his voice.

00:03:39.602 --> 00:03:42.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A shepherd answered
that it was the voice they knew.

00:03:42.906 --> 00:03:46.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To prove this, he exchanged clothing
with the stranger.

00:03:46.943 --> 00:03:51.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dressed in the shepherd’s garb,
the stranger called the sheep,

00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:54.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they did not respond.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They did not know his voice.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet, when the shepherd called them,

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:04.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
though he was disguised,
the sheep came at once.”

00:04:04.761 --> 00:04:06.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please ask yourself,

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘As one of Jehovah’s figurative sheep,

00:04:09.666 --> 00:04:13.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘do I obediently respond
to the voice of the Fine Shepherd

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
and flee from the voice of strangers?’

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s talk about this.

00:04:18.942 --> 00:04:23.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
The original stranger was Satan the Devil.

00:04:23.146 --> 00:04:27.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a ventriloquist,
he made a serpent appear to talk,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the words were Satan’s words.

00:04:30.653 --> 00:04:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan thereby used his voice
to slander Jehovah

00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deceive Eve.

00:04:38.895 --> 00:04:43.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Satan continues his work
as an evil ventriloquist

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:47.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
using, not serpents, but human puppets

00:04:47.136 --> 00:04:49.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enunciate his voice

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:52.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these acting as his agents

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:55.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
either wittingly or unwittingly.

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:59.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s discuss three examples

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how our Fine Shepherd tells us one thing

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Satan’s underlings, or strangers,

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell us something opposite.

00:05:09.592 --> 00:05:13.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must be vigilant to listen

00:05:13.096 --> 00:05:15.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the right voice.

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:20.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Fine Shepherd tells us,
as our first example,

00:05:20.269 --> 00:05:24.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
these words at Matthew chapter 24,

00:05:24.807 --> 00:05:27.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 45-47:

00:05:28.211 --> 00:05:32.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who really is the faithful
and discreet slave

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:36.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whom his master appointed
over his domestics,

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to give them their food at the proper time?

00:05:38.855 --> 00:05:43.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Happy is that slave if his master on coming

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:45.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“finds him doing so!

00:05:45.628 --> 00:05:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Truly I say to you, he will appoint him

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:51.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
over all his belongings.”

00:05:51.934 --> 00:05:54.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know the Master, Jesus,

00:05:54.504 --> 00:05:57.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
found “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:05:57.173 --> 00:06:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
spiritually feeding
righthearted ones in 1919,

00:06:01.711 --> 00:06:04.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at a future time

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:08.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will appoint him over all his belongings.”

00:06:08.317 --> 00:06:10.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the implication?

00:06:10.353 --> 00:06:12.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, even now,

00:06:12.622 --> 00:06:17.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus fully trusts the faithful slave.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:19.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of us,

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:22.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
even individual members
of the Governing Body,

00:06:22.031 --> 00:06:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
should do the same.

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:28.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does the voice of strangers
say on this subject?

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:31.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t trust the faithful slave.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will mislead you!”

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:37.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who often have the loudest voice

00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:39.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
promoting this false message?

00:06:39.882 --> 00:06:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apostates.

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:46.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 13:9 labels false messages

00:06:46.355 --> 00:06:48.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “strange teachings.”

00:06:48.925 --> 00:06:52.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they are the teachings of strangers.

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:56.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some examples of their strange teachings

00:06:56.032 --> 00:07:00.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
are that the faithful slave
protects pedophiles

00:07:00.636 --> 00:07:03.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that the slave will exploit you

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can live lives of luxury.

00:07:07.477 --> 00:07:12.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are both bald-faced lies.

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:17.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 20:30 says that apostates

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:20.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“speak twisted things.”

00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:24.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
They do this
in order to draw God’s sheep away

00:07:24.227 --> 00:07:27.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make them followers of themselves.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that’s twisted
is bent out of shape,

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:33.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
or distorted.

00:07:33.269 --> 00:07:37.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
They speak twisted things
by leaving out vital details,

00:07:37.974 --> 00:07:40.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
taking things out of context,

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:43.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in some other way manipulating a truth

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:48.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a lie or into a misleading half-truth.

00:07:50.086 --> 00:07:52.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 2:3 says:

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:56.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will greedily exploit you

00:07:56.125 --> 00:07:58.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
with counterfeit words.”

00:07:59.028 --> 00:08:01.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
A counterfeit is something

00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:04.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s carefully designed
to look like the real thing.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take, for example, counterfeit money:

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:08.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might look genuine,

00:08:08.804 --> 00:08:11.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s fake and thus worthless.

00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:16.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re deceived into accepting it,
we’ll lose money.

00:08:16.746 --> 00:08:21.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we’re deceived into accepting
the counterfeit words of apostates,

00:08:21.617 --> 00:08:24.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll lose our life.

00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:30.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
And apostates will give us
absolutely nothing of value in exchange.

00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:34.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine really needing

00:08:34.864 --> 00:08:37.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
a loving shepherding visit

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:40.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asking apostates to give you one?

00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:44.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, we must be careful

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
about believing everything
presented in the media

00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:50.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s organization.

00:08:50.546 --> 00:08:55.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the media is commonly motivated
by prejudice, hatred,

00:08:55.484 --> 00:08:57.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a desire for profit.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
False and exaggerated news reports

00:09:01.457 --> 00:09:04.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
are very common.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in one European country,

00:09:06.862 --> 00:09:11.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people were indignant
when an emotional press report stated

00:09:11.434 --> 00:09:14.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a young female Witness died

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:18.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she refused a blood transfusion.

00:09:18.507 --> 00:09:20.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were those the complete facts?

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:26.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
The patient refused a blood transfusion
on religious grounds,

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:28.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she did agree

00:09:28.784 --> 00:09:33.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
to alternative nonblood medical management.

00:09:33.022 --> 00:09:36.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
This could have been implemented immediately

00:09:36.025 --> 00:09:38.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
and likely would have saved her life.

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:40.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,

00:09:40.229 --> 00:09:44.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
the hospital delayed matters unnecessarily

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
until it was too late.

00:09:46.802 --> 00:09:50.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
The press report didn’t mention these facts.

00:09:52.475 --> 00:09:55.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it’s unreasonable to distrust

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:58.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
all secular sources of information,

00:09:58.481 --> 00:10:00.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must be wary.

00:10:00.883 --> 00:10:03.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
First John 5:19 says:

00:10:03.753 --> 00:10:06.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The whole world is lying

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:10.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the power of the wicked one.”

00:10:11.927 --> 00:10:14.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s discuss a second example

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the voice of our Fine Shepherd, Jesus.

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:20.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew chapter 5,

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:24.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 27 and 28, Jesus said:

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:27.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You heard that it was said:

00:10:27.576 --> 00:10:30.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You must not commit adultery.’

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I say to you that everyone
who keeps on looking at a woman

00:10:35.518 --> 00:10:37.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so as to have a passion for her

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:42.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
has already committed adultery with her
in his heart.”

00:10:43.025 --> 00:10:45.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Fine Shepherd is telling us

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:49.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to avoid sexual immorality

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:51.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to flee from anything

00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:52.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could lead to it,

00:10:52.802 --> 00:10:55.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as immoral thoughts.

00:10:55.571 --> 00:11:00.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at Matthew 19:9,
our Fine Shepherd tells us:

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:05.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I say to you that whoever divorces his wife,

00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:10.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“except on the grounds of sexual immorality,
and marries another

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:12.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
commits adultery.”

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:15.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here Jesus makes clear

00:11:15.224 --> 00:11:18.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the only valid basis
for divorce and remarriage

00:11:18.728 --> 00:11:20.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s eyes

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
is if a disloyal mate
commits sexual immorality.

00:11:26.435 --> 00:11:30.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s the voice of strangers
of Satan’s world telling us

00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:32.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding divorce, adultery,

00:11:32.975 --> 00:11:36.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other forms of sexual immorality?

00:11:36.812 --> 00:11:40.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No problem.
It’s your choice.

00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:45.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have the freedom to do what you want.”

00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:50.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in order to make sexual immorality
appear more innocent,

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:53.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s often euphemized.

00:11:53.028 --> 00:11:56.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sexual perversion, such as homosexuality,

00:11:56.766 --> 00:12:01.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
is called an alternative lifestyle.

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:04.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
One so-called expert said

00:12:04.373 --> 00:12:07.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it’s simply like being left-handed!

00:12:07.710 --> 00:12:12.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pornography is called adult entertainment.

00:12:12.681 --> 00:12:16.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adulterous betrayal of one’s marriage mate

00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:21.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
is called having an affair.

00:12:21.223 --> 00:12:24.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many call getting married old-fashioned

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see nothing wrong with living together

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:29.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
without marriage.

00:12:29.498 --> 00:12:32.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this world’s media is very skillful

00:12:32.668 --> 00:12:37.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
at presenting something bad as good.

00:12:37.239 --> 00:12:41.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in a movie,
a female character might be portrayed

00:12:41.444 --> 00:12:44.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
as having a husband who is abusive.

00:12:44.713 --> 00:12:48.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
You like the woman,
and you want her to find happiness.

00:12:48.884 --> 00:12:53.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a handsome man
starts working in her office,

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s so nice to her.

00:12:55.658 --> 00:12:58.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s an attraction between them,

00:12:58.394 --> 00:13:01.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the budding romance is presented

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
as something good.

00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soft background music makes it hard

00:13:06.602 --> 00:13:09.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
to consider her course to be bad.

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:12.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s easy to keep watching

00:13:12.908 --> 00:13:16.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hope she leaves her marriage mate

00:13:16.078 --> 00:13:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and runs off with her workmate.

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:21.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
And usually that’s what happens.

00:13:21.951 --> 00:13:25.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
So easily we can forget

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:27.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah and Jesus hate adultery

00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unscriptural divorce.

00:13:30.726 --> 00:13:35.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we reject the voice of this world

00:13:35.164 --> 00:13:39.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
and listen to the voice of Jehovah and Jesus,

00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:42.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
we bring protection and blessings

00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:46.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ourselves and others.

00:13:46.308 --> 00:13:51.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now our third example
of the voice of our Fine Shepherd

00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:54.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
is at Matthew chapter 6,

00:13:54.083 --> 00:13:57.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read verses 19 and 20:

00:13:58.554 --> 00:14:03.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop storing up for yourselves
treasures on the earth,

00:14:03.359 --> 00:14:06.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where moth and rust consume

00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:08.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and where thieves break in and steal.

00:14:08.797 --> 00:14:11.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rather, store up for yourselves

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:14.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“treasures in heaven,

00:14:14.036 --> 00:14:17.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where neither moth nor rust consumes,

00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:21.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where thieves do not break in and steal.”

00:14:21.911 --> 00:14:23.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re told that our focus

00:14:24.547 --> 00:14:26.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be on spiritual things

00:14:26.515 --> 00:14:28.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not on physical things.

00:14:28.851 --> 00:14:31.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is especially true

00:14:31.053 --> 00:14:33.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
when thinking about where we are

00:14:33.055 --> 00:14:35.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the stream of time

00:14:35.257 --> 00:14:38.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in the final part of the final part

00:14:38.694 --> 00:14:41.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the last days.

00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:43.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what’s the voice of strangers

00:14:43.599 --> 00:14:46.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this world on this subject?

00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:51.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Exert yourself vigorously to acquire

00:14:51.173 --> 00:14:53.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“material possessions.

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:55.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pursue things

00:14:55.444 --> 00:14:57.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that will make your life comfortable

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:02.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that is
what will bring you happiness.”

00:15:03.218 --> 00:15:07.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question is, To whom are we listening?

00:15:07.523 --> 00:15:11.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and Jesus tell us to be content now

00:15:11.226 --> 00:15:13.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a spiritual paradise,

00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:17.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
to concentrate on our lifesaving
preaching work,

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:22.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they will provide
a physical paradise later.

00:15:23.038 --> 00:15:25.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:11 indicates

00:15:25.574 --> 00:15:27.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should view ourselves

00:15:27.810 --> 00:15:30.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “temporary residents”

00:15:30.779 --> 00:15:33.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are just passing through this old system

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:37.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and headed for “the real life”
in the new world.

00:15:37.786 --> 00:15:41.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean by “temporary resident”?

00:15:41.757 --> 00:15:45.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, imagine that you rent
an old house to live in

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:49.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
while a new beautiful house
is being built for you.

00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:52.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll live there only a few months.

00:15:52.267 --> 00:15:55.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you install a new concrete driveway?

00:15:55.871 --> 00:15:59.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you put in new electrical wiring
and plumbing?

00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:03.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you install brand new vinyl siding?

00:16:03.612 --> 00:16:05.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:16:05.314 --> 00:16:10.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might do a few cosmetic things
to make your stay a little more comfortable,

00:16:10.152 --> 00:16:12.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you wouldn’t do anything major.

00:16:12.721 --> 00:16:13.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:16:13.856 --> 00:16:18.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because you know you’re
just a temporary resident and that soon

00:16:18.861 --> 00:16:23.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll move into your beautiful new home.

00:16:23.298 --> 00:16:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we think of ourselves

00:16:25.401 --> 00:16:29.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as temporary residents
in this old system,

00:16:29.138 --> 00:16:33.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’ll be a real protection
against the materialism

00:16:33.909 --> 00:16:38.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is promoted by the voice of strangers.

00:16:39.381 --> 00:16:42.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve now discussed three examples

00:16:42.351 --> 00:16:45.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ voice:

00:16:45.688 --> 00:16:50.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Trust “the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) Reject sexual immorality

00:16:53.729 --> 00:16:56.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unscriptural divorce.

00:16:56.632 --> 00:17:00.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) Focus on storing up spiritual treasures

00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:03.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than material treasures.

00:17:04.506 --> 00:17:08.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, there are many other examples
of these two different voices,

00:17:08.977 --> 00:17:11.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
but may we all be vigilant

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:15.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen to the right voice!

00:17:15.784 --> 00:17:20.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of Jesus, Jehovah himself said:

00:17:20.022 --> 00:17:24.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my Son, the beloved,
whom I have approved.

00:17:24.993 --> 00:17:28.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to him.”

00:17:28.297 --> 00:17:33.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in order to do so obediently
as Jehovah’s sheep,

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:37.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must reject the voice of strangers.
