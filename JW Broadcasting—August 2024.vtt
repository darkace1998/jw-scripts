Greetings, and welcome to JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:05.901 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have an exciting program in store for you.

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:13.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how Jehovah
has revealed his “sacred secret”

00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what it means for each of us.

00:00:16.954 --> 00:00:20.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see a dramatization
that will help us stay focused

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
on serving Jehovah

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:26.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoid becoming overly concerned
with when the end will come.

00:00:27.381 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this new episode of <i>Our History in Motion,</i>

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:32.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll learn how Jehovah’s organization

00:00:32.428 --> 00:00:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
has harnessed motion-picture technology

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:36.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach and teach.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:41.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll enjoy a thought-provoking
music video with a timely message:

00:00:41.896 --> 00:00:44.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happier when we keep it simple.

00:00:45.357 --> 00:00:49.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for August 2024!

00:01:09.298 --> 00:01:11.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you like mysteries or puzzles?

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about secrets?

00:01:13.844 --> 00:01:15.012 line:10% position:50% align:center
Are you good at keeping

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:17.473 line:10% position:50% align:center
honorable secrets confidential?

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.808 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had a secret

00:01:19.808 --> 00:01:22.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he kept for about 4,000 years!

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike human secrets,
which often are difficult to keep confidential,

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:33.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s sacred secret
would be revealed only by divine revelation.

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:38.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, Jehovah would reveal
the details only in his due time.

00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:42.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 25:2 says:

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:46.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is the glory of God to keep a matter secret.”

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:49.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the secret we’re talking about?

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s related to the first prophecy
recorded in the Bible,

00:01:53.217 --> 00:01:56.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Genesis 3:15.

00:01:57.262 --> 00:02:00.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would Jehovah fix the damage caused

00:02:00.265 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the rebellion in the garden of Eden?

00:02:02.893 --> 00:02:05.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said to the serpent who deceived Eve:

00:02:07.314 --> 00:02:10.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I will put enmity
between you and the woman

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and between your offspring and her offspring.

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:17.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will crush your head,
and you will strike him in the heel.”

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:21.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an intriguing prophecy!

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was spoken some 6,000 years ago,

00:02:24.748 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
but its meaning affects each one of us

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:30.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every person who has ever lived.

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:33.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was behind the voice of the serpent?

00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:36.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was “the woman”?

00:02:36.385 --> 00:02:38.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eve might have thought that she was,

00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
because when she later gave birth to Cain,

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
she said at Genesis 4:1:

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:47.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have produced a male child
with the help of Jehovah.”

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Eve was not “the woman” of the prophecy.

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s secret was still a secret.

00:02:55.946 --> 00:02:58.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was the ‘offspring of the woman’?

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Eve thought it was Cain,
she was sadly disappointed.

00:03:02.911 --> 00:03:07.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would reveal these details
according to his timetable,

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
long after Adam and Eve died.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:15.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might compare the revealing
of Jehovah’s sacred secret to this puzzle box.

00:03:16.884 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s locked and seems impossible to open.

00:03:21.013 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, a series of steps
leads to opening the box

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and revealing the treasure inside.

00:03:29.146 --> 00:03:31.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those steps are like the details

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led to identifying
the promised ‘offspring of the woman.’

00:03:36.445 --> 00:03:38.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of those details?

00:03:39.656 --> 00:03:44.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 2,000 years after the prophecy in Eden,

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made a promise
to the faithful man Abraham

00:03:47.956 --> 00:03:50.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
that provided a piece of the puzzle.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah say?

00:03:52.795 --> 00:03:57.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find his words at Genesis 22:17, 18:

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will surely bless you

00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:04.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will surely multiply your offspring
like the stars of the heavens

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:07.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and like the grains of sand on the seashore,

00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:11.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your offspring will take possession
of the gate of his enemies.

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And by means of your offspring

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:18.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
all nations of the earth
will obtain a blessing for themselves.”

00:04:18.403 --> 00:04:20.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah revealed the first detail

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
to unlock his sacred secret.

00:04:27.955 --> 00:04:31.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham must have been amazed
when he looked up to the heavens

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saw thousands of stars.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although Abraham would not see

00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:38.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
the complete fulfillment of the promise

00:04:38.715 --> 00:04:40.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his lifetime,

00:04:40.592 --> 00:04:43.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
it certainly would be fulfilled at a future time

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the God who does not lie.

00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:51.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah repeated the promise
to Abraham’s son Isaac

00:04:51.228 --> 00:04:53.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to Isaac’s son Jacob.

00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:58.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob, in his deathbed prophecy,
said at Genesis 49:10

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the scepter [would] not
depart from Judah.”

00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:06.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we learn that kingship is involved

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the promised offspring
would come through Judah’s line.

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:14.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, Jehovah provided the Mosaic Law

00:05:14.084 --> 00:05:17.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help protect the nation of Israel

00:05:17.045 --> 00:05:19.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the promised offspring.

00:05:20.507 --> 00:05:24.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the next significant detail
to be revealed?

00:05:25.345 --> 00:05:27.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1070 B.C.E.,

00:05:27.723 --> 00:05:29.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judah’s descendant David

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:31.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
became king over all Israel.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
David was “a man agreeable

00:05:34.521 --> 00:05:35.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
to [Jehovah’s] heart,”

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:39.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah promised to raise up
someone in David’s royal line

00:05:39.985 --> 00:05:42.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would rule forever.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
The promise is recorded
at 2 Samuel chapter 7,

00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:48.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 12 and 13:

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will raise up your offspring after you,

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:56.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your own son,
and I will firmly establish his kingdom. . . .

00:05:56.084 --> 00:06:00.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will firmly establish the throne
of his kingdom forever.”

00:06:01.173 --> 00:06:05.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re one step closer to identifying
the promised offspring.

00:06:11.058 --> 00:06:14.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
The offspring
would come through David’s line.

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:17.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although David’s son Solomon
had a peaceful reign,

00:06:17.397 --> 00:06:20.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was not the King who would rule forever.

00:06:20.943 --> 00:06:24.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
That King would appear in the future
at Jehovah’s appointed time.

00:06:25.864 --> 00:06:30.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the Devil didn’t want
the promised offspring of the woman to appear,

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he repeatedly tried to eliminate

00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:36.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
or contaminate the lineage to the offspring.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jehovah made sure
that the Devil failed in his attempts.

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:46.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Down through the centuries,
Jehovah, through his prophets,

00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:50.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided specific details
regarding the promised offspring.

00:06:50.597 --> 00:06:53.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, the prophet Micah foretold

00:06:53.016 --> 00:06:56.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:59.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel’s prophecy of the 70 weeks of years

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:03.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicated the exact year
when the Messiah would appear.

00:07:04.236 --> 00:07:06.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, Isaiah’s prophecy revealed

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:10.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the offspring would die a sacrificial death.

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:13.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was progressively revealing details

00:07:13.954 --> 00:07:15.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
about his sacred secret.

00:07:17.332 --> 00:07:20.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Centuries later, in the year 2 B.C.E.,

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:24.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angel Gabriel appeared
to a Jewish virgin named Mary

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:26.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made a startling declaration to her.

00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:29.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to know what it is?

00:07:29.261 --> 00:07:33.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found at Luke 1:31-33:

00:07:34.641 --> 00:07:39.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! you will become pregnant
and give birth to a son,

00:07:39.813 --> 00:07:42.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you are to name him Jesus.

00:07:42.858 --> 00:07:45.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This one will be great

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and will be called Son of the Most High,

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:52.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Jehovah God will give him
the throne of David his father,

00:07:53.201 --> 00:07:57.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will rule as King
over the house of Jacob forever,

00:07:57.622 --> 00:08:01.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there will be no end to his Kingdom.”

00:08:01.501 --> 00:08:05.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both Mary and Jesus’ adoptive father, Joseph,

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:08.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
were descendants of David,

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
so Jesus received both the natural

00:08:10.927 --> 00:08:14.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the legal rights of an heir of David.

00:08:15.223 --> 00:08:18.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what might have been
going through Mary’s mind

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
after hearing those words?

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:24.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did she perhaps remember
hearing similar details

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:27.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the book of Moses
about the promised offspring?

00:08:28.362 --> 00:08:33.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, about nine months later,
when Jesus was born,

00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:35.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s angel appeared to shepherds

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were tending their flocks near Bethlehem.

00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:39.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
The angel announced,

00:08:39.748 --> 00:08:42.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded in Luke chapter 2:

00:08:42.167 --> 00:08:45.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Today there was born to you
in David’s city a savior,

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:48.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is Christ the Lord.”

00:08:48.131 --> 00:08:50.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
After thousands of years,

00:08:50.842 --> 00:08:55.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was giving notice
that his sacred secret would soon be revealed.

00:08:56.598 --> 00:09:01.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
The shepherds went and told Mary
and Joseph about this divine message.

00:09:01.478 --> 00:09:04.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word about the Christ was spreading.

00:09:05.232 --> 00:09:08.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
About 30 years later,
in the days of John the Baptizer,

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the people were in expectation

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:14.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all of them were reasoning
in their hearts about John,

00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:17.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘May he perhaps be the Christ?’”

00:09:18.203 --> 00:09:23.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
A short time later, Jesus the Nazarene
came to John to be baptized.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Jesus came up out of the water,

00:09:26.628 --> 00:09:29.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah anointed him with holy spirit and said:

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:33.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my Son, the beloved.”

00:09:33.552 --> 00:09:35.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
At long last,

00:09:35.595 --> 00:09:40.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
the promised offspring
of Genesis 3:15 had arrived!

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:58.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humble Jews readily responded
to Jesus’ teachings and ministry.

00:09:58.827 --> 00:10:03.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there were many more details
about the sacred secret yet to be revealed,

00:10:03.832 --> 00:10:06.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the many facets

00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:08.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a beautiful crystal.

00:10:12.632 --> 00:10:17.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his ministry, 
Jesus himself identified the serpent

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:20.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Satan and the serpent’s offspring

00:10:20.515 --> 00:10:23.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
as those who display
the Devil’s characteristics.

00:10:24.978 --> 00:10:29.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus also revealed,
as recorded at Luke 22:28-30,

00:10:29.983 --> 00:10:34.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there would be a secondary part
of the woman’s offspring:

00:10:34.154 --> 00:10:38.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
spirit-anointed Christians
who will rule with Christ in heaven.

00:10:39.534 --> 00:10:43.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, the apostle Paul identified
the woman of the prophecy

00:10:43.663 --> 00:10:46.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the heavenly part of Jehovah’s organization,

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:49.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
made up of faithful spirit creatures.

00:10:50.587 --> 00:10:54.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the enmity foretold at Genesis 3:15

00:10:54.758 --> 00:10:57.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
continues into our day.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil and his offspring
continue “to wage war

00:11:00.138 --> 00:11:03.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the remaining ones
of [the woman’s] offspring” on earth.

00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:08.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did the Messiah accomplish
while he was on the earth?

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:14.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews were hoping that he would bring
liberation from Roman oppression.

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:18.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Daniel’s prophecy indicated
that the Messiah would be “cut off,”

00:11:18.782 --> 00:11:20.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “put to death.”

00:11:20.617 --> 00:11:23.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
This corresponded to the ‘striking in the heel,’

00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:25.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at Genesis 3:15.

00:11:26.915 --> 00:11:30.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, Jehovah also revealed at Psalm 16:10

00:11:30.877 --> 00:11:34.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his Son would not be left “in the Grave.”

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:37.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
True to his promise,
Jehovah resurrected Jesus

00:11:37.801 --> 00:11:40.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
less than three days after his death.

00:11:41.513 --> 00:11:45.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, a principal part
of Jehovah’s sacred secret

00:11:45.267 --> 00:11:50.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
involved the Messianic Kingdom,
of which Christ would be King.

00:11:50.188 --> 00:11:53.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
While Jesus was on earth, 
he cured the sick,

00:11:53.817 --> 00:11:57.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
he fed the hungry,
and he resurrected the dead

00:11:57.445 --> 00:12:01.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
—things that he’ll do on a far greater scale
as King of God’s Kingdom.

00:12:03.368 --> 00:12:05.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Jesus ascended to heaven,

00:12:05.453 --> 00:12:08.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
many additional details
about God’s sacred secret

00:12:08.707 --> 00:12:12.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
were revealed in the writings we now know
as the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:12:13.753 --> 00:12:16.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 2:3 says:

00:12:16.089 --> 00:12:19.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Carefully concealed in him [or, Christ]

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
are all the treasures of wisdom
and of knowledge.”

00:12:23.388 --> 00:12:27.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
When did the sacred secret come to its finish?

00:12:27.767 --> 00:12:30.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 10:7 says that it would occur

00:12:30.729 --> 00:12:34.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the days when the seventh angel
is about to blow his trumpet.”

00:12:35.358 --> 00:12:37.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
When did that take place?

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s note the answer at Revelation 11:15:

00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:44.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The seventh angel blew his trumpet.

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:48.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And there were loud voices in heaven, saying:

00:12:48.163 --> 00:12:49.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The kingdom of the world

00:12:49.706 --> 00:12:52.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘has become the Kingdom of our Lord
and of his Christ,

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will rule as king forever and ever.’”

00:12:56.588 --> 00:12:59.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
This occurred in 1914

00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:02.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Christ Jesus became
King of God’s Kingdom.

00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:06.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is that the end?

00:13:06.139 --> 00:13:07.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:13:07.682 --> 00:13:12.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
The revelation provides additional details
regarding God’s Kingdom

00:13:12.062 --> 00:13:16.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
and future events
that most people would consider shocking.

00:13:17.484 --> 00:13:21.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Revelation 19:11-16

00:13:21.363 --> 00:13:25.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
reveals that Christ Jesus,
“the King of kings and Lord of lords,”

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:27.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
will “strike the nations”

00:13:27.577 --> 00:13:31.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “shepherd them with a rod of iron.”

00:13:31.539 --> 00:13:36.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
As King of God’s Kingdom,
Jesus will soon crush all human governments

00:13:36.544 --> 00:13:40.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hurl the Devil into an abyss of inactivity.

00:13:40.924 --> 00:13:45.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will lead to 1,000 years of peace.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the thousand years,

00:13:48.973 --> 00:13:53.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Devil will be released from the abyss
for a short time,

00:13:53.019 --> 00:13:58.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the final fulfillment
of Genesis 3:15 will occur:

00:13:58.066 --> 00:14:02.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
The offspring of the woman
will crush the head of the Devil.

00:14:04.698 --> 00:14:07.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does all of this affect us?

00:14:08.868 --> 00:14:12.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re privileged to know
about God’s sacred secret,

00:14:12.205 --> 00:14:17.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
which he kept secret for some 4,000 years.

00:14:17.043 --> 00:14:19.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the details Jehovah
has helped his people

00:14:19.504 --> 00:14:22.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand only in recent decades!

00:14:22.757 --> 00:14:25.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah has made “known to us

00:14:25.719 --> 00:14:28.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sacred secret of his will.”

00:14:30.014 --> 00:14:33.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this broadcast,
we have considered only a few facets

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:36.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s sacred secret.

00:14:36.312 --> 00:14:39.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not make it a project
for personal or family worship?

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:44.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s thrilling to think about Kingdom realities

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:48.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah will completely undo
the effects of Satan’s rebellion.

00:14:49.492 --> 00:14:52.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christ Jesus now rules as King in the heavens,

00:14:52.746 --> 00:14:55.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the days for this evil system of things

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
under Satan’s domination are numbered.

00:14:58.418 --> 00:15:02.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will soon strike the nations
with a rod of iron

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then transform the earth
into a beautiful paradise.

00:15:08.094 --> 00:15:12.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah want us to do
with his sacred secret?

00:15:12.182 --> 00:15:15.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we put it back into the box?

00:15:15.435 --> 00:15:17.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
bury it in the ground?

00:15:17.896 --> 00:15:19.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:15:19.314 --> 00:15:22.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to make it known!

00:15:22.358 --> 00:15:27.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sacred secret is now being proclaimed
in over 1,000 languages.

00:15:27.363 --> 00:15:29.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you having a full share?

00:15:30.784 --> 00:15:33.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deep appreciation for this sacred secret

00:15:33.787 --> 00:15:36.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all that it means for the future will impel us

00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:38.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share it with as many people as possible.

00:15:40.543 --> 00:15:43.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostle Paul wrote
to Christians in Ephesus,

00:15:43.922 --> 00:15:48.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
he requested of them,
as recorded at Ephesians 6:19:

00:15:48.802 --> 00:15:51.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pray also for me,

00:15:51.679 --> 00:15:55.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that the words may be given to me
when I open my mouth,

00:15:55.183 --> 00:15:57.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that I may be able to speak boldly

00:15:57.685 --> 00:16:01.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
in making known the sacred secret
of the good news.”

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:06.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s our prayer for you,
dear brothers and sisters,

00:16:06.194 --> 00:16:08.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we all may continue to declare

00:16:08.696 --> 00:16:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s sacred secret with boldness.

00:16:13.618 --> 00:16:16.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way we reach
many people with the good news

00:16:16.454 --> 00:16:20.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
is through special preaching campaigns
organized by the branch office.

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:25.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following report,
we’ll see how Jehovah has blessed this work.

00:16:27.757 --> 00:16:30.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love to preach;
I love to talk about Jehovah.

00:16:31.594 --> 00:16:34.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever I’d read the experiences of pioneers

00:16:34.931 --> 00:16:36.766 line:10% position:50% align:center
and missionaries in the yearbooks,

00:16:36.766 --> 00:16:38.518 line:10% position:50% align:center
I wanted to feel that same joy

00:16:38.518 --> 00:16:40.228 line:10% position:50% align:center
and same feeling that they had.

00:16:40.728 --> 00:16:43.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I heard about the announcement
about the campaign,

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:46.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that that was my chance.

00:16:47.652 --> 00:16:49.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first challenge
was the pressure I got from others.

00:16:49.821 --> 00:16:51.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why go somewhere so far?”

00:16:51.656 --> 00:16:55.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You could use that money
to travel somewhere more beautiful.

00:16:55.034 --> 00:16:57.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could even travel to another country.”

00:16:58.121 --> 00:17:01.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
These types of comments did affect me a bit.

00:17:01.124 --> 00:17:04.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other times
it was more a question of finances.

00:17:04.294 --> 00:17:07.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
I once had to decide
whether I would accept an opportunity

00:17:07.463 --> 00:17:10.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work at a good job in a public sector

00:17:10.383 --> 00:17:12.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
or whether to turn that opportunity down.

00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:21.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
But participating in that campaign
was my chance to do more for Jehovah.

00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:24.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew this experience
would be life-changing.

00:17:24.606 --> 00:17:26.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout the campaign,

00:17:26.608 --> 00:17:29.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
we met so many sincere people

00:17:29.152 --> 00:17:32.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some who had never heard Jehovah’s name

00:17:32.155 --> 00:17:34.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
or who didn’t even know what a Bible was.

00:17:34.949 --> 00:17:36.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
One experience that stuck with me

00:17:36.951 --> 00:17:40.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
was when I tried explaining to someone
what the Bible was,

00:17:40.288 --> 00:17:42.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then her eyes just beamed

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
when she understood that it was
a message from God to her personally.

00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:04.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a Bible student who is indigenous,

00:18:05.104 --> 00:18:06.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
and whenever you talk about Jehovah,

00:18:06.731 --> 00:18:09.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
her eyes always light up.

00:18:09.192 --> 00:18:12.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always asks to learn more about Jehovah.

00:18:13.821 --> 00:18:16.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would study over the public telephone

00:18:16.032 --> 00:18:19.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she lives in a village
that’s about a five-day journey away.

00:18:19.369 --> 00:18:22.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even though it was challenging,
she made it to the meetings.

00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
She would bring the whole family.

00:18:24.707 --> 00:18:28.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes up to 20 people
would walk into the Kingdom Hall.

00:18:28.628 --> 00:18:31.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would bring a Bible,
a phone, and a tablet,

00:18:31.756 --> 00:18:34.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would pass them around
and try to help them.

00:18:35.009 --> 00:18:35.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no doubt

00:18:35.927 --> 00:18:37.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
that having these experiences
was well worth it.

00:18:38.471 --> 00:18:41.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that participating in this campaign

00:18:41.057 --> 00:18:43.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the best decision.

00:18:43.393 --> 00:18:46.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to truly see Jehovah
as a real friend.

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:51.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was also wonderful to spend time
with a variety of brothers and sisters

00:18:51.484 --> 00:18:52.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the campaign.

00:18:52.986 --> 00:18:55.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped me mature spiritually.

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
I planned to go for a month

00:18:58.074 --> 00:19:00.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ended up staying there for five years.

00:19:00.493 --> 00:19:02.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I could, I’d do all over again.

00:19:08.584 --> 00:19:10.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family owns a guest house,

00:19:10.461 --> 00:19:14.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my father said that we were going
to host a group for a campaign,

00:19:18.553 --> 00:19:21.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I never had contact
with Jehovah’s Witnesses before.

00:19:22.849 --> 00:19:24.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the group arrived,

00:19:24.559 --> 00:19:27.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pastor of my church said
that I should be

00:19:27.603 --> 00:19:31.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
very careful about having contact
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.445 line:10% position:50% align:center
So I was.

00:19:35.445 --> 00:19:37.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
I did everything I could

00:19:37.697 --> 00:19:39.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
to avoid contact with them.

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:42.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would see them leaving early
for the ministry.

00:19:42.618 --> 00:19:45.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
But one day,
there was a sister that didn’t go out,

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:51.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I thought,
‘She’s going to try to preach to me.’

00:19:54.172 --> 00:19:56.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what she did.

00:19:56.007 --> 00:19:59.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
So since she was already staying at the inn,

00:19:59.719 --> 00:20:00.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started studying with her.

00:20:00.887 --> 00:20:03.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at first, it was just to prove her wrong.

00:20:05.308 --> 00:20:07.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I kept studying, though,

00:20:07.351 --> 00:20:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could see that what I was learning
was really making sense.

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I couldn’t say that
that wasn’t the truth.

00:20:17.904 --> 00:20:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would also notice the brothers and sisters

00:20:22.158 --> 00:20:24.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
playing guitar, singing,

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I thought it was so beautiful
to see how joyful they always were.

00:20:29.916 --> 00:20:32.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
I met the Witnesses in April 2016,

00:20:32.752 --> 00:20:36.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in October,
I became an unbaptized publisher.

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:39.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
In January 2017, I was baptized,

00:20:39.467 --> 00:20:41.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ve been regular pioneering
for two years.

00:20:42.887 --> 00:20:46.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am sure that all of this happened
because Jehovah

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
heard what I prayed for
a few days before.

00:20:49.352 --> 00:20:52.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to go to the hospital,
and I had asked,

00:20:52.146 --> 00:20:57.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God, help me survive
so that I can get to know you

00:20:57.068 --> 00:21:00.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I know
I don’t know the truth about you yet.”

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:02.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave me what I asked for.

00:21:02.782 --> 00:21:05.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sent the brothers
just at the right time with the campaign.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure it was Jehovah who sent them.

00:21:08.079 --> 00:21:13.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone could be praying for help
to learn about Jehovah.

00:21:13.084 --> 00:21:15.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he would direct a preaching campaign

00:21:15.878 --> 00:21:20.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
with brothers from many places
to help honesthearted people.

00:21:24.929 --> 00:21:29.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some seeds of truth we plant
may take root unexpectedly.

00:21:29.976 --> 00:21:32.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
By sharing zealously in the preaching work,

00:21:32.979 --> 00:21:37.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could be the one who helps someone
hear the truth for the very first time.

00:21:38.693 --> 00:21:43.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Learning about Jehovah
can be the turning point in a person’s life.

00:21:43.614 --> 00:21:47.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see an example of this
in the following interview.

00:21:50.163 --> 00:21:52.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hated the world’s situation;

00:21:52.206 --> 00:21:54.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was so much suffering.

00:21:54.375 --> 00:21:56.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I always had so many questions:

00:21:56.502 --> 00:21:57.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are we here?

00:21:57.962 --> 00:21:59.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it all about?

00:21:59.422 --> 00:22:01.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the purpose?

00:22:01.632 --> 00:22:03.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there really a God?
Is there?

00:22:03.926 --> 00:22:06.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could he allow all of this?

00:22:06.429 --> 00:22:08.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I opened the window,

00:22:08.347 --> 00:22:10.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I stuck my head out, and I said,

00:22:10.808 --> 00:22:14.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you’re there,
I want you to know how I feel about you.”

00:22:15.605 --> 00:22:18.191 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was raised in a religious Jewish family

00:22:18.191 --> 00:22:19.817 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the Bronx.

00:22:19.817 --> 00:22:22.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
My parents viewed money as security,

00:22:22.862 --> 00:22:24.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they worked seven days a week.

00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:28.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really affected us as children a lot.

00:22:28.201 --> 00:22:30.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a child let on the loose;

00:22:30.244 --> 00:22:32.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was running the streets.

00:22:32.622 --> 00:22:34.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I started using drugs,

00:22:34.874 --> 00:22:36.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I started selling drugs,

00:22:36.292 --> 00:22:40.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was getting in every kind of trouble.

00:22:40.379 --> 00:22:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so they moved us out to Long Island,

00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:44.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
hoping things would be better.

00:22:46.052 --> 00:22:47.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I would take a taxi

00:22:47.595 --> 00:22:49.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
back into New York City every day.

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:54.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the drivers was named Joe,

00:22:54.393 --> 00:22:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we hit it off,
and I wound up marrying him.

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father was so, so upset.

00:23:01.484 --> 00:23:03.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m married; I’m pregnant.

00:23:03.402 --> 00:23:05.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said to him, “I’m moving out.”

00:23:05.112 --> 00:23:06.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said to me,

00:23:06.656 --> 00:23:08.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t look back because this is final.”

00:23:10.284 --> 00:23:12.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my family had disowned me.

00:23:12.745 --> 00:23:16.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a new mother with a baby,
and I was really hurting.

00:23:18.167 --> 00:23:20.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I remember one day

00:23:20.169 --> 00:23:22.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking out the window

00:23:22.004 --> 00:23:25.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing this little old man
come up my stairs,

00:23:25.174 --> 00:23:27.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was carrying a little blue book.

00:23:27.593 --> 00:23:30.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he came to my door,
and he wanted 25 cents for that book, 

00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life</i>.

00:23:33.933 --> 00:23:36.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t really care about the book,

00:23:36.185 --> 00:23:38.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
but something made me want
to give that little old man that quarter.

00:23:38.854 --> 00:23:43.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right away, chapter 4 caught my attention,
“Why We Grow Old and Die.”

00:23:43.067 --> 00:23:45.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I read the entire chapter,
and I thought:

00:23:45.736 --> 00:23:47.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It just made sense.

00:23:47.697 --> 00:23:50.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t wait to share this with Joe
when he comes home.’

00:23:51.367 --> 00:23:55.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just lost his temper;
he went out of control.

00:23:55.162 --> 00:23:57.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not want to hear
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:23:57.748 --> 00:23:59.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was not that important.

00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:00.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
This book was really not that important.

00:24:00.751 --> 00:24:02.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want it to begin with.

00:24:02.295 --> 00:24:03.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I just dropped it in the trash can

00:24:03.921 --> 00:24:05.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thought: ‘That’s the end of that.

00:24:05.631 --> 00:24:06.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s gone.’

00:24:07.258 --> 00:24:10.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that little old man came back
with a young sister.

00:24:10.886 --> 00:24:13.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Joe was there
cutting an orange with a knife,

00:24:13.431 --> 00:24:15.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was not happy
to see those people again.

00:24:15.975 --> 00:24:17.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took that knife,

00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he waved it
in front of the sister’s face.

00:24:20.604 --> 00:24:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said,
“I don’t want you here at the house.”

00:24:22.398 --> 00:24:24.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
She ran to the door, and she said,

00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:27.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No problem, I will definitely not be back.”

00:24:27.903 --> 00:24:32.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they left, and I thought,
‘I really don’t think they’ll be back.’

00:24:33.492 --> 00:24:34.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they did come back,

00:24:34.785 --> 00:24:37.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
now an elderly sister
who had a Jewish background.

00:24:37.913 --> 00:24:39.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said to her,

00:24:39.457 --> 00:24:41.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Can you not take a hint

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:43.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I am not interested
in speaking with you?”

00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:46.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she said:
“I get that; I get that.

00:24:46.672 --> 00:24:51.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I really would love to ask you
just one question.”

00:24:51.052 --> 00:24:55.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought, ‘OK, there’s no harm
in letting her ask me one question.’

00:24:57.016 --> 00:24:59.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
She opened up the green Bible

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:02.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the cover page
where it has the Tetragrammaton,

00:25:02.688 --> 00:25:04.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s name in Hebrew.

00:25:06.025 --> 00:25:08.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she said,
“Will you just say this name for me?”

00:25:08.652 --> 00:25:11.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought to myself:
‘I’m not gonna say that name.

00:25:11.822 --> 00:25:13.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jewish people don’t say that name.

00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:15.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have never ever said that name.’

00:25:16.452 --> 00:25:19.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
But finally, I did;

00:25:19.038 --> 00:25:21.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Yehovah.”

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:25.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the very first time,
I said the name Jehovah.

00:25:25.002 --> 00:25:27.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was like, so shocked.

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, I was just waiting
for something terrible to happen.

00:25:31.133 --> 00:25:34.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then she told me
that the name Jehovah

00:25:34.804 --> 00:25:38.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
was in the Bible about 7,000 times.

00:25:38.057 --> 00:25:39.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
As soon as she left,

00:25:39.809 --> 00:25:42.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went and got out my Hebrew Bible.

00:25:42.895 --> 00:25:45.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I was gonna look for that name, Jehovah,

00:25:45.523 --> 00:25:47.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and circle it if it was there.

00:25:47.525 --> 00:25:49.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started to do that.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went through the first page
and the second page.

00:25:52.154 --> 00:25:54.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I realized,
as I flipped through the Bible,

00:25:54.698 --> 00:25:55.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s everywhere.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name Jehovah was everywhere.

00:25:58.411 --> 00:26:01.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought,
‘I have got to share this with Joe.’

00:26:01.205 --> 00:26:03.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Joe was really impressed;

00:26:03.332 --> 00:26:04.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was really softening.

00:26:04.792 --> 00:26:06.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made a difference.

00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:09.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
A week later, she comes back

00:26:09.672 --> 00:26:12.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she wanted to show me a prophecy

00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:15.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Hebrew Scriptures
in Daniel chapter 9.

00:26:15.386 --> 00:26:18.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
She called it the 70-weeks-of-years prophecy.

00:26:18.764 --> 00:26:21.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for the first time,
I could see that there was a real answer

00:26:21.976 --> 00:26:24.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
to when the Messiah would come

00:26:24.103 --> 00:26:27.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what would be the results on the earth.

00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:33.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing those prophecies
really motivated me to want to know more.

00:26:33.446 --> 00:26:35.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought to myself:

00:26:35.781 --> 00:26:38.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If all of these prophecies are from God

00:26:38.409 --> 00:26:41.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and he’s fulfilling all of them,

00:26:41.036 --> 00:26:42.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘what other prophecies are there?

00:26:42.788 --> 00:26:46.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
What other wonderful things
do we have to look forward to?’

00:26:48.335 --> 00:26:53.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
My relationship with Jehovah
just got better and better.

00:26:53.215 --> 00:26:55.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were baptized together

00:26:55.718 --> 00:26:59.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
on December 2, 1972.

00:26:59.972 --> 00:27:03.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
I came to really appreciate
and love Bible prophecy.

00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:06.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started doing a lot of research
and a lot of study on my own.

00:27:06.854 --> 00:27:10.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved getting to know Jehovah as a Person

00:27:10.024 --> 00:27:13.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
who wants such good things for us.

00:27:13.527 --> 00:27:16.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything he wants,
everything he asks of us,

00:27:16.989 --> 00:27:19.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
is for our benefit.

00:27:19.116 --> 00:27:21.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just really touched me to the core.

00:27:23.787 --> 00:27:25.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life is so full now

00:27:25.873 --> 00:27:28.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
with blessings from Jehovah.

00:27:29.543 --> 00:27:31.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love that name.

00:27:31.212 --> 00:27:35.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no more beautiful name in the world
than Jehovah.

00:27:39.428 --> 00:27:41.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
In these distressing times,

00:27:41.639 --> 00:27:45.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
people often look to money
or human organizations

00:27:45.601 --> 00:27:48.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
—almost anywhere—
for security.

00:27:48.521 --> 00:27:52.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Colon’s experience
reassures us that Jehovah

00:27:52.733 --> 00:27:55.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the only secure refuge.

00:27:55.444 --> 00:27:59.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
He continues to stabilize
and protect her spiritually.

00:28:00.699 --> 00:28:03.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
have helped millions of people

00:28:03.327 --> 00:28:06.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn the truth
through a variety of methods,

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:10.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
including, of course, this channel:
JW Broadcasting.

00:28:11.293 --> 00:28:13.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today we use videos in our preaching,

00:28:13.671 --> 00:28:17.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
meetings, schools, and conventions.

00:28:17.091 --> 00:28:19.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you know that Jehovah’s organization

00:28:19.301 --> 00:28:23.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
first used motion pictures
more than 100 years ago?

00:28:23.681 --> 00:28:28.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
This episode of <i>Our History in Motion</i>
 traces that rich history.

00:28:28.352 --> 00:28:29.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:28:33.983 --> 00:28:36.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today we use videos

00:28:36.026 --> 00:28:39.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
just about everywhere
in our worship and ministry.

00:28:41.448 --> 00:28:44.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you know that Jehovah’s people
started using 

00:28:44.118 --> 00:28:48.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
film and video to preach and teach
more than a hundred years ago?

00:28:50.291 --> 00:28:52.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how and why

00:28:52.334 --> 00:28:56.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this episode of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:28:59.967 --> 00:29:04.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the early Bible Students
first began preaching in the late 1800’s,

00:29:04.763 --> 00:29:07.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
the motion picture industry
was in its infancy.

00:29:08.475 --> 00:29:12.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even then,
C. T. Russell and his associates

00:29:12.187 --> 00:29:15.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
recognized the power of this new medium.

00:29:15.482 --> 00:29:19.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Film could be used
not only to reach wider audiences

00:29:19.695 --> 00:29:22.698 line:10% position:50% align:center
but to touch hearts with Bible truth.

00:29:25.951 --> 00:29:28.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
At a convention in June 1913,

00:29:28.662 --> 00:29:32.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students passed a bold resolution

00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:35.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
supporting the use of motion pictures

00:29:35.419 --> 00:29:38.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a new tool for preaching and teaching.

00:29:39.506 --> 00:29:42.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Less than a year later, in January 1914,

00:29:42.968 --> 00:29:47.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers debuted
the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”

00:29:47.765 --> 00:29:49.099 line:10% position:50% align:center
The eight-hour production

00:29:49.099 --> 00:29:51.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
included color slides

00:29:51.393 --> 00:29:53.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and motion picture film,

00:29:53.395 --> 00:29:57.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
most of it footage
that Russell purchased from other studios.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine sitting in a packed auditorium

00:30:02.488 --> 00:30:05.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing, possibly for the first time,

00:30:05.491 --> 00:30:08.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
moving pictures of events
described in the Bible.

00:30:12.623 --> 00:30:14.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was something else
in the “Photo-Drama”

00:30:14.708 --> 00:30:17.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really took audiences by surprise.

00:30:17.670 --> 00:30:21.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The Photo-Drama of Creation’ is presented

00:30:21.465 --> 00:30:25.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the I.B.S.A.,

00:30:25.010 --> 00:30:28.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
the International
Bible Students Association.”

00:30:29.014 --> 00:30:31.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Synchronized dialogue!

00:30:32.226 --> 00:30:36.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “Photo-Drama” played
in theaters and auditoriums around the world.

00:30:37.523 --> 00:30:40.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if film
could be used to teach the truth

00:30:40.901 --> 00:30:43.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just in big theaters

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:46.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
but right in a person’s own living room?

00:30:47.074 --> 00:30:50.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the idea behind
a series of short films

00:30:50.202 --> 00:30:52.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
released in the 1920’s.

00:30:52.246 --> 00:30:54.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
These silent films,

00:30:54.123 --> 00:30:58.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
chronicling the travels
of J. F. Rutherford in the Bible lands,

00:30:58.001 --> 00:31:00.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
were designed to be shown at home.

00:31:02.047 --> 00:31:05.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
They required the use
of the Kinemo Projection Machine,

00:31:05.843 --> 00:31:10.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
a portable, low-cost movie projector
made just for this purpose.

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:14.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interested ones who viewed these films
were given a glimpse

00:31:14.601 --> 00:31:18.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Bible lands
and were introduced to many prophecies.

00:31:19.815 --> 00:31:22.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the next two decades,

00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:25.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
the organization
used radio and the phonograph

00:31:25.404 --> 00:31:29.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than film to reach more people
with the Kingdom message.

00:31:30.117 --> 00:31:31.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the 1950’s,

00:31:31.827 --> 00:31:34.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body recognized the need

00:31:34.037 --> 00:31:36.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
for interested ones to see for themselves

00:31:36.707 --> 00:31:39.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
the international scope of the organization.

00:31:40.377 --> 00:31:42.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
So they again turned to film

00:31:42.421 --> 00:31:43.964 line:10% position:50% align:center
with the release of

00:31:43.964 --> 00:31:46.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The New World Society in Action.</i>

00:31:47.634 --> 00:31:49.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one-hour-and-twenty-minute film

00:31:49.678 --> 00:31:53.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
transported viewers to our Bethel facilities

00:31:53.056 --> 00:31:54.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and international conventions.

00:31:55.976 --> 00:31:58.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gave them a taste of what it’s like

00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:01.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach in some of the remotest parts
of the world.

00:32:03.734 --> 00:32:07.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additional films
released over the next several years

00:32:07.488 --> 00:32:09.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
further highlighted the work of God’s people

00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:12.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fulfillment of Bible prophecies.

00:32:13.869 --> 00:32:15.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, in 1966,

00:32:15.871 --> 00:32:18.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
we released <i>Heritage.</i>

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:22.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
This 28-minute feature was unflinching

00:32:22.878 --> 00:32:27.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
in its portrayal of the real-world problems
young people face.

00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:33.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within the next sixty seconds,

00:32:33.263 --> 00:32:35.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
another family somewhere in the United States

00:32:35.182 --> 00:32:37.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be strained to the breaking point.

00:32:39.394 --> 00:32:40.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s this?

00:32:40.437 --> 00:32:42.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just a family quarrel?

00:32:42.523 --> 00:32:46.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.
It is far more serious than that.

00:32:46.151 --> 00:32:48.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it doing to this family?

00:32:48.779 --> 00:32:53.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Following Bible principles
builds a solid family foundation.

00:32:53.659 --> 00:32:57.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Heritage was presented at circuit assemblies
and other large gatherings.

00:32:58.747 --> 00:33:00.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was also shown on more than

00:33:00.749 --> 00:33:04.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
150 television stations in the United States.

00:33:05.921 --> 00:33:07.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
After 1966,

00:33:07.923 --> 00:33:10.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
the organization shifted away from film

00:33:10.801 --> 00:33:13.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began presenting modern
and Biblical dramas

00:33:13.679 --> 00:33:15.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
live on stage at conventions.

00:33:15.681 --> 00:33:18.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
These dramas brought Bible accounts to life

00:33:18.767 --> 00:33:21.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
for young and old
and were one of the highlights

00:33:21.562 --> 00:33:24.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
of large conventions for many years.

00:33:25.399 --> 00:33:27.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as the 1990’s approached,

00:33:27.526 --> 00:33:30.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
new technologies emerged
that prompted our brothers

00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:33.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
to revisit motion pictures yet again.

00:33:33.156 --> 00:33:37.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Videocassette players
could be found in more and more homes.

00:33:38.328 --> 00:33:40.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so in 1990,

00:33:40.497 --> 00:33:43.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
we released our very first video,

00:33:43.584 --> 00:33:47.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>
<i>—The Organization Behind the Name.</i>

00:33:48.672 --> 00:33:52.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took viewers behind the scenes
and built appreciation

00:33:52.092 --> 00:33:54.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
for how our literature is produced

00:33:54.553 --> 00:33:57.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and used in the global preaching work.

00:33:59.808 --> 00:34:01.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The faithful and discreet slave”

00:34:01.268 --> 00:34:04.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
has made extensive use of video ever since.

00:34:06.815 --> 00:34:08.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Motion picture technology

00:34:08.525 --> 00:34:12.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
has changed dramatically in 100 years,

00:34:12.362 --> 00:34:15.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the objective of Jehovah’s organization

00:34:15.449 --> 00:34:18.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
in using it has always been the same:

00:34:18.285 --> 00:34:21.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
to touch the hearts of people everywhere

00:34:21.496 --> 00:34:23.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Bible truth.

00:34:30.923 --> 00:34:34.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has always understood
the power of visuals.

00:34:35.802 --> 00:34:38.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave the prophets visions.

00:34:38.513 --> 00:34:42.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we have the technology
that combines visual power

00:34:42.351 --> 00:34:45.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and emotional impact.

00:34:45.062 --> 00:34:48.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Digital technology continues to change,

00:34:48.231 --> 00:34:52.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our goal has not
—to reach the heart.

00:34:53.737 --> 00:34:58.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
True Christians cherish the truth
that this wicked world will soon end.

00:34:59.368 --> 00:35:03.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what are the pitfalls
of serving Jehovah with a date in mind?

00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:06.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:35:06.792 --> 00:35:11.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s see how a Christian couple
is lovingly helped to adjust their mindset.

00:41:29.924 --> 00:41:34.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you eager to see
what unfolds for James and Linda?

00:41:34.012 --> 00:41:37.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Watch for Part 2 of our video
in a future broadcast.

00:41:38.641 --> 00:41:41.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we learn from this first episode?

00:41:41.978 --> 00:41:45.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Thabo observed,
serving Jehovah with a date in mind

00:41:45.982 --> 00:41:49.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
can lead to spiritual disaster.

00:41:49.569 --> 00:41:52.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than fixate on when the end comes,

00:41:52.989 --> 00:41:56.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s focus on who
we are now before it arrives.

00:41:58.203 --> 00:42:02.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thabo also said:
“The truth is the truth.”

00:42:02.248 --> 00:42:05.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know
that we are practicing true Christianity?

00:42:05.794 --> 00:42:08.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the intriguing topic
of this morning worship

00:42:08.671 --> 00:42:10.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
presented by Brother John Ekrann.

00:42:12.425 --> 00:42:14.761 line:10% position:50% align:center
Many years ago, a brother in my congregation

00:42:14.761 --> 00:42:16.554 line:10% position:50% align:center
asked me to go with him in field service

00:42:16.554 --> 00:42:18.932 line:10% position:50% align:center
and return on a man who had asked him

00:42:18.932 --> 00:42:20.934 line:10% position:50% align:center
to come back.

00:42:20.934 --> 00:42:22.394 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, it wasn’t too long

00:42:22.394 --> 00:42:25.522 line:10% position:50% align:center
after we were there in his house

00:42:25.522 --> 00:42:26.731 line:10% position:50% align:center
that it became clear to us

00:42:26.731 --> 00:42:29.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he wasn’t so much interested
in listening to us

00:42:29.776 --> 00:42:32.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he was in convincing us
that Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:42:32.862 --> 00:42:34.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the wrong religion.

00:42:34.906 --> 00:42:37.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he went on to attack Brother Russell.

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:40.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Charles Taze Russell
started your organization.”

00:42:40.203 --> 00:42:42.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he made accusations about Brother Russell

00:42:42.539 --> 00:42:44.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he did this and that, etcetera.

00:42:44.666 --> 00:42:47.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his reasoning was
that since Brother Russell

00:42:47.085 --> 00:42:49.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
was flawed in these ways,

00:42:49.379 --> 00:42:52.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
God could not have used him
to start the right religion.

00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:56.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we took the opportunity to point out

00:42:56.428 --> 00:42:58.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
his wrong reasoning.

00:42:58.847 --> 00:43:01.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Basically, he was saying that God

00:43:01.015 --> 00:43:04.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
cannot use imperfect men to do his will.

00:43:04.185 --> 00:43:07.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think if we applied that to the Bible.

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:09.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses failed

00:43:09.399 --> 00:43:12.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
to credit Jehovah God
for the miracle with the water.

00:43:12.402 --> 00:43:15.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we going to do?
Take out the first five books of the Bible?

00:43:15.363 --> 00:43:17.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
David sinned with Bath-sheba.

00:43:17.574 --> 00:43:20.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to take out most of the Psalms?

00:43:20.034 --> 00:43:21.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter denied Christ.

00:43:21.286 --> 00:43:22.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there goes 1 and 2 Peter.

00:43:22.912 --> 00:43:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, that reasoning
really doesn’t make sense.

00:43:27.292 --> 00:43:31.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God does use
imperfect people to do his will.

00:43:31.463 --> 00:43:34.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
But putting aside
his flawed reasoning for a moment,

00:43:34.591 --> 00:43:36.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe you’ve heard others say

00:43:36.676 --> 00:43:39.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s Witnesses
are a breakaway Christian sect

00:43:39.804 --> 00:43:43.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that we’re a new American religion.

00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:45.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that really true?

00:43:45.518 --> 00:43:49.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Brother Russell start a new religion?

00:43:49.564 --> 00:43:51.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, absolutely not.

00:43:51.858 --> 00:43:56.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
What he did do is rediscover
the true religion of the Bible

00:43:56.863 --> 00:44:01.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way it was practiced
by Jesus and the apostles.

00:44:01.075 --> 00:44:04.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Russell and the early Bible students did

00:44:04.287 --> 00:44:08.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
was exactly what Jehovah
told the nation of Israel to do

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:11.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they had lost their way spiritually.

00:44:11.377 --> 00:44:15.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like you to look at Jeremiah 6:16

00:44:15.131 --> 00:44:18.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice the advice that Jehovah gave them.

00:44:20.053 --> 00:44:23.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 6:16:

00:44:25.016 --> 00:44:29.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah says:
‘Stand at the crossroads and see.

00:44:29.562 --> 00:44:32.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Ask about the ancient roadways,

00:44:32.815 --> 00:44:36.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘ask where the good way is, and walk in it,

00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:39.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find rest for yourselves.’”

00:44:39.447 --> 00:44:42.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you look at the <i>Research Guide </i>
on this verse,

00:44:42.992 --> 00:44:45.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the first <i>Watchtower</i>  references says:

00:44:45.703 --> 00:44:50.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah exhorts his rebellious people
to pause,

00:44:50.041 --> 00:44:53.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“examine themselves, and find their way back

00:44:53.878 --> 00:44:58.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘the roadways’
of their faithful ancestors.”

00:44:59.842 --> 00:45:02.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s exactly
what those early Bible students did.

00:45:02.512 --> 00:45:06.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
They asked about the ancient roadways
that Jesus walked.

00:45:06.599 --> 00:45:08.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can you imagine an explorer

00:45:08.601 --> 00:45:12.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to locate in a jungle

00:45:12.105 --> 00:45:14.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
an ancient path that was there?

00:45:14.816 --> 00:45:16.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in a jungle,

00:45:16.818 --> 00:45:19.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
the path could have been covered over 

00:45:19.487 --> 00:45:23.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
by years of growth and it would be difficult.

00:45:23.992 --> 00:45:26.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
But maybe he saw a stone or two.

00:45:26.869 --> 00:45:29.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
And eventually, by cutting away

00:45:29.539 --> 00:45:31.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
the jungle around it,

00:45:31.666 --> 00:45:33.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
imagine his excitement

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
at finding that ancient path!

00:45:38.298 --> 00:45:42.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you get a chance to read
some of the early writings

00:45:42.093 --> 00:45:44.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Brother Russell
and the early Bible students,

00:45:44.846 --> 00:45:48.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
you get a real sense of discovery,

00:45:48.057 --> 00:45:51.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they are excited
to have found the truths

00:45:51.227 --> 00:45:54.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were there in the Bible all along.

00:45:54.188 --> 00:45:57.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’d just been covered over with hundreds
—thousands—

00:45:57.609 --> 00:46:02.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
of years of lies and twisted doctrines
taught by false Christianity.

00:46:04.115 --> 00:46:08.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah’s Witnesses
are not a breakaway religion.

00:46:08.536 --> 00:46:11.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
We practice Christianity by following closely

00:46:11.873 --> 00:46:14.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
the model set out in the Bible

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Jesus and the apostles.

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:21.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could really say that the early Bible
students, led by holy spirit,

00:46:21.841 --> 00:46:25.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
found the ancient path of true Christianity

00:46:25.261 --> 00:46:28.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that they cleared away
thousands of years of pagan philosophies

00:46:28.806 --> 00:46:31.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
and man-made doctrines.

00:46:32.268 --> 00:46:34.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right away,
the early Bible students eliminated

00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:38.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a lot of jungle growth” from the path.

00:46:38.733 --> 00:46:41.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
No immortal soul—we are a soul.

00:46:41.486 --> 00:46:44.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
No hellfire—when we die,

00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:48.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
we cease to exist
and depend on a resurrection.

00:46:48.076 --> 00:46:50.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ransom—Jesus’ death

00:46:50.411 --> 00:46:53.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
saved all of mankind
who would put faith in him.

00:46:53.164 --> 00:46:55.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom is a heavenly government

00:46:55.291 --> 00:47:00.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will rule over the earth
and was established in 1914.

00:47:00.254 --> 00:47:02.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing how well they cleared the path.

00:47:02.590 --> 00:47:05.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course,
there was still much work to do,

00:47:05.426 --> 00:47:07.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the path was much clearer.

00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:11.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, so clear and profound
were those truths

00:47:11.099 --> 00:47:13.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so clear was the path

00:47:13.518 --> 00:47:16.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if you read the life experiences
and life stories

00:47:16.813 --> 00:47:20.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who came to the truth
in the 1920’s and 1930’s,

00:47:20.191 --> 00:47:24.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ll often say
that they read one book or one brochure

00:47:24.362 --> 00:47:28.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said, “I have found the truth.”

00:47:28.282 --> 00:47:32.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
this was not just clearing away doctrine

00:47:32.078 --> 00:47:35.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also changing
how the organization operated:

00:47:35.373 --> 00:47:39.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
appointments of elders
—not elections, not paid;

00:47:39.419 --> 00:47:44.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
circuit overseers who visit the congregations
like Paul and Timothy did;

00:47:44.173 --> 00:47:46.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
weekly congregation meetings

00:47:46.676 --> 00:47:48.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that we could study and read

00:47:48.803 --> 00:47:51.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah and discuss Bible truths

00:47:51.347 --> 00:47:54.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
or focus on the preaching work
like the apostles did;

00:47:54.767 --> 00:47:57.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
door-to-door and public witnessing.

00:47:59.147 --> 00:48:03.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our text for today, Acts 16:4,

00:48:03.651 --> 00:48:06.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
is one example of how closely

00:48:06.612 --> 00:48:10.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization today
follows the first-century pattern.

00:48:10.533 --> 00:48:15.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Acts 16:4
in its entirety.

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:20.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 16:4:

00:48:20.543 --> 00:48:22.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they traveled on through the cities,

00:48:22.712 --> 00:48:26.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they would deliver to them
for observance the decrees

00:48:26.466 --> 00:48:30.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that had been decided on
by the apostles and the elders

00:48:30.094 --> 00:48:32.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were in Jerusalem.”

00:48:33.848 --> 00:48:35.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, led by Jesus Christ,

00:48:35.975 --> 00:48:39.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was it that sent out these decrees?

00:48:39.312 --> 00:48:42.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.

00:48:43.775 --> 00:48:48.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah’s Witnesses today
don’t have a single leader, or one man,

00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is leading the organization.

00:48:51.449 --> 00:48:54.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re organized today
as it was in the first century

00:48:54.202 --> 00:48:56.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a Governing Body, a group of men

00:48:56.537 --> 00:48:59.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah uses to lead his organization today.

00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:02.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all the congregations around the world

00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
are united by the direction
that we get from the Governing Body.

00:49:07.256 --> 00:49:10.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just as the apostles
and elders in Jerusalem

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:15.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
would send out decrees for all the early
Christian congregations of the time,

00:49:15.223 --> 00:49:18.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
the same exact model is used today.

00:49:18.518 --> 00:49:22.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, today, decisions
from the Governing Body take many forms.

00:49:22.814 --> 00:49:25.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be articles in <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:49:25.358 --> 00:49:28.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
letters to bodies of elders
and the congregations,

00:49:28.444 --> 00:49:32.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Governing Body updates,
organizational direction provided at schools,

00:49:32.281 --> 00:49:34.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many other forms.

00:49:34.909 --> 00:49:39.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But all around the world,
no matter where Jehovah’s Witnesses live,

00:49:39.288 --> 00:49:43.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
they accept the direction
from one Governing Body.

00:49:44.252 --> 00:49:46.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s not the Latin Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:49:46.754 --> 00:49:49.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the American Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:49:49.006 --> 00:49:51.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the European Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:49:51.050 --> 00:49:54.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re all united worldwide.

00:49:54.554 --> 00:49:57.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah’s Witnesses in one country
don’t say, “Well, you know,

00:49:57.598 --> 00:50:02.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think that direction
from the Governing Body applies to us here.”

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:06.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, all of us understand that worldwide,

00:50:06.482 --> 00:50:09.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and Jesus
are using the Governing Body as the channel

00:50:09.944 --> 00:50:12.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
for spiritual food
and organizational direction.

00:50:14.782 --> 00:50:19.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some feel that because our
world headquarters is in the United States,

00:50:19.161 --> 00:50:22.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses are an American religion.

00:50:22.206 --> 00:50:25.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that reasoning is like some who say,

00:50:25.042 --> 00:50:30.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, the Bible is only for the Jews
because it was written by Jewish men.”

00:50:30.006 --> 00:50:34.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
But clearly, the Bible’s message
is for all mankind,

00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:38.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fact that Jehovah
chose Jewish men to write it down for us

00:50:38.347 --> 00:50:41.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t limit its message to just Jews.

00:50:41.934 --> 00:50:44.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, the fact that Jehovah
chose the United States

00:50:44.937 --> 00:50:47.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the location for world headquarters

00:50:47.565 --> 00:50:51.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t mean that Jehovah’s Witnesses
are an American religion.

00:50:51.986 --> 00:50:56.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no limit to anyone
—no matter what country or language—

00:50:56.324 --> 00:51:00.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
to becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
and worshipping Jehovah.

00:51:00.745 --> 00:51:03.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the very fact that Jehovah’s spirit

00:51:03.331 --> 00:51:05.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
has moved the Governing Body to work so hard

00:51:05.875 --> 00:51:09.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that the truth
is available to all nations

00:51:09.587 --> 00:51:14.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
is further proof in my mind
that we have found the path of Christianity

00:51:14.592 --> 00:51:18.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus and the apostles practiced.

00:51:18.554 --> 00:51:20.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in review: First,

00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:24.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses are not
a new religion started by Brother Russell

00:51:24.226 --> 00:51:27.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, Brother Russell
and the early Bible students 

00:51:27.229 --> 00:51:30.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
found the ancient path of Christianity

00:51:30.191 --> 00:51:33.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus and the apostles walked on.

00:51:33.444 --> 00:51:37.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second, Jehovah’s Witnesses
are not an American religion.

00:51:37.531 --> 00:51:39.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has made every effort

00:51:39.909 --> 00:51:42.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach all mankind with the truth.

00:51:42.578 --> 00:51:44.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
We truly are the only

00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:49.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
united worldwide followers of Christ
on the planet today.

00:51:51.462 --> 00:51:55.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
True Christianity has not changed,

00:51:55.132 --> 00:51:59.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
but at times our understanding
of certain Bible teachings

00:51:59.303 --> 00:52:01.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been clarified.

00:52:01.681 --> 00:52:04.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you feel about these refinements?

00:52:04.892 --> 00:52:07.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can learn much from one another’s example.

00:52:07.895 --> 00:52:12.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please note the candid life story
of Brother Norio Ishibashi.

00:52:17.822 --> 00:52:21.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will Jesus separate
the sheep from the goats?

00:52:22.535 --> 00:52:26.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
When were true Christians held captive
by Babylon the Great?

00:52:28.874 --> 00:52:32.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
There have been
so many interesting developments

00:52:32.545 --> 00:52:34.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our understanding

00:52:34.422 --> 00:52:36.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
that I have deeply appreciated.

00:52:38.342 --> 00:52:41.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, some adjustments
were a challenge for me.

00:52:44.265 --> 00:52:49.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was baptized in 1960
when I was 12 years old.

00:52:49.311 --> 00:52:52.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
I enjoyed the circuit and district work

00:52:52.773 --> 00:52:54.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 41 years.

00:52:55.735 --> 00:52:57.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1971,

00:52:57.820 --> 00:53:00.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was serving
as the congregation servant.

00:53:04.368 --> 00:53:08.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “Divine Name” District Assembly
shined new light of truth.

00:53:09.373 --> 00:53:14.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before then,
congregations had just one overseer,

00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:16.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregation servant.

00:53:16.505 --> 00:53:18.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that assembly highlighted

00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:22.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
that just as Philippians 1:1 shows,

00:53:22.261 --> 00:53:26.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first-century Christian congregations
had more than one elder.

00:53:30.686 --> 00:53:33.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, there was a letter in my mailbox.

00:53:33.939 --> 00:53:35.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was from the branch.

00:53:37.276 --> 00:53:41.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
The letter said that the arrangement
for a body of elders would start.

00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:45.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to prepare,

00:53:45.409 --> 00:53:49.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregation committee
and exemplary brothers

00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:54.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to meet and recommend
those they believed could serve as elders.

00:53:55.086 --> 00:53:58.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prayerfully discussed the matter,

00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:03.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all of us were recommended
as ministerial servants.

00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:09.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Until then, I had given public talks

00:54:09.642 --> 00:54:12.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
in other congregations
and at circuit assemblies.

00:54:13.521 --> 00:54:17.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I would not be given such assignments.

00:54:17.191 --> 00:54:21.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many elders from other congregations
would come up to me and ask,

00:54:21.195 --> 00:54:25.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brother Ishibashi, can you come
and give a talk at our congregation?”

00:54:26.408 --> 00:54:30.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, sorry, I can’t.
I’m not an elder.”

00:54:30.121 --> 00:54:31.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What?”

00:54:31.372 --> 00:54:34.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone looked genuinely surprised.

00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:37.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really tested my humility,

00:54:37.044 --> 00:54:40.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at times, I felt quite depressed.

00:54:43.175 --> 00:54:46.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Proverbs 4:18 says:

00:54:46.095 --> 00:54:50.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The path of the righteous
is like the bright morning light.”

00:54:51.100 --> 00:54:53.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
With each flash of light,

00:54:53.185 --> 00:54:56.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed to adjust
to Jehovah’s way of thinking

00:54:56.689 --> 00:54:58.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and way of handling things

00:54:58.732 --> 00:55:01.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep moving ahead.

00:55:02.278 --> 00:55:04.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayerfully shifted gears.

00:55:04.905 --> 00:55:09.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had many things to do,
so I devoted myself to the field service

00:55:09.493 --> 00:55:11.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to congregation activities.

00:55:11.537 --> 00:55:14.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I rejoiced
over the congregation’s growth.

00:55:15.457 --> 00:55:19.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having a body of elders helped many brothers.

00:55:19.837 --> 00:55:22.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helped them reach out and attain 

00:55:22.464 --> 00:55:25.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Scriptural qualifications
to be an elder.

00:55:26.302 --> 00:55:28.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
That arrangement helps decisions to be made

00:55:28.596 --> 00:55:31.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
in better harmony with Jehovah’s will.

00:55:31.307 --> 00:55:33.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are great changes.

00:55:34.852 --> 00:55:39.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few months later,
I received another letter from the branch.

00:55:39.273 --> 00:55:43.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said that I was to serve as an elder
in a different congregation.

00:55:46.155 --> 00:55:48.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I receive new publications

00:55:48.866 --> 00:55:51.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a new <i>Watchtower</i>  magazine,

00:55:51.118 --> 00:55:53.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always study them carefully

00:55:53.913 --> 00:55:56.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see if there are any new understandings

00:55:56.999 --> 00:55:59.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
or topics to study further.

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:02.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also look up
the “Beliefs Clarified” section

00:56:02.963 --> 00:56:05.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the <i>Publications Index,</i>

00:56:05.132 --> 00:56:08.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I make it a topic of personal study.

00:56:09.303 --> 00:56:12.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
This research has really benefited me.

00:56:20.022 --> 00:56:23.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is “the God of love.”

00:56:23.651 --> 00:56:26.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
By clarifying our beliefs,

00:56:26.445 --> 00:56:29.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has adjusted our organization

00:56:29.865 --> 00:56:33.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be more holy and more effective
in carrying out his will.

00:56:34.495 --> 00:56:38.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people
are just getting better and better;

00:56:38.332 --> 00:56:41.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are always at new heights.

00:56:41.377 --> 00:56:44.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is so different from how the world is.

00:56:46.257 --> 00:56:49.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to keep moving forward with Jehovah

00:56:49.677 --> 00:56:52.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
whenever he shows us his will

00:56:52.680 --> 00:56:55.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he guides us into the Paradise to come.

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:07.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Refinements in our understanding of truth

00:57:07.444 --> 00:57:11.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
can strengthen our faith if we allow them to.

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:14.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Brother Ishibashi did.

00:57:14.118 --> 00:57:16.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
He kept an open mind

00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:19.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prayerfully meditated on the refinements.

00:57:19.623 --> 00:57:23.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do the same,
we’ll view clarifications as evidence

00:57:23.544 --> 00:57:27.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah continues
to educate his humble people.

00:57:28.465 --> 00:57:31.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now it’s time for this month’s music video,

00:57:31.385 --> 00:57:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will remind us
that Jehovah knows what we need.

00:57:35.097 --> 00:57:38.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its title, <i>Let’s Keep It Simple.</i>

00:57:56.452 --> 00:58:00.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the shiny things
that we see

00:58:00.581 --> 00:58:04.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Promise us
pleasure and security.

00:58:04.752 --> 00:58:09.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we want it all,
there’s a cost—

00:58:09.048 --> 00:58:12.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could be slaves
to what we’ve bought.

00:58:12.426 --> 00:58:16.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple.
Jehovah knows what we need.

00:58:16.597 --> 00:58:20.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple
and be happy.

00:58:20.642 --> 00:58:24.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple,
And you and I will be free.

00:58:24.855 --> 00:58:29.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple
and be happy.

00:58:38.202 --> 00:58:42.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have roofs
over our heads,

00:58:42.373 --> 00:58:46.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Food to eat,
and nice, warm beds.

00:58:46.543 --> 00:58:50.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are satisfied
with simple things,

00:58:50.506 --> 00:58:54.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll feel the joy
and peace it brings.

00:58:54.301 --> 00:58:58.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple.
Jehovah knows what we need.

00:58:58.389 --> 00:59:02.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple
and be happy.

00:59:02.393 --> 00:59:06.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple,
And you and I will be free.

00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:11.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple
and be happy.

00:59:11.568 --> 00:59:20.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
God will bless us if we try.
He will never let us down.

00:59:20.953 --> 00:59:29.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is loving, just, and wise.
He will be our solid ground.

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:35.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
On him
we can rely.

00:59:51.066 --> 00:59:55.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
How good it feels
to live the simple life!

00:59:55.571 --> 00:59:59.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hearts are happy,
and our loads are light.

00:59:59.658 --> 01:00:03.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
With all this weight
taken off our chests,

01:00:03.745 --> 01:00:07.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re free to give
our God our best.

01:00:07.374 --> 01:00:11.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple.
Jehovah knows what we need.

01:00:11.503 --> 01:00:15.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple
and be happy.

01:00:15.716 --> 01:00:19.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple,
And you and I will be free.

01:00:19.761 --> 01:00:23.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple.
Let’s keep it simple.

01:00:23.849 --> 01:00:28.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple.
Jehovah knows what we need.

01:00:28.020 --> 01:00:32.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple
and be happy.

01:00:32.191 --> 01:00:36.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple,
And you and I will be free.

01:00:36.570 --> 01:00:42.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep it simple
and be happy.

01:01:08.894 --> 01:01:11.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve enjoyed an encouraging program.

01:01:12.648 --> 01:01:17.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve learned that Jehovah
has revealed his sacred secret to Christians,

01:01:17.194 --> 01:01:19.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
not for us to keep to ourselves,

01:01:19.780 --> 01:01:22.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to declare it boldly to all.

01:01:23.659 --> 01:01:27.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our preaching campaigns
are an effective way to find sheeplike ones.

01:01:28.539 --> 01:01:31.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Motion-picture technology is a powerful tool

01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:33.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach people’s hearts with Bible truth.

01:01:35.462 --> 01:01:38.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve learned
to appreciate doctrinal refinements

01:01:38.340 --> 01:01:40.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
as proof of Jehovah’s love.

01:01:41.426 --> 01:01:44.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ve seen the value of focusing,

01:01:44.054 --> 01:01:46.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on when the end will come,

01:01:46.348 --> 01:01:49.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on working every day
to remain “in God’s love.”

01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:56.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s visit our brothers and sisters
in Colombia for this month’s postcard.

01:01:57.442 --> 01:02:00.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Colombia
remind you of a certain beverage?

01:02:00.862 --> 01:02:03.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes me think of coffee.

01:02:03.532 --> 01:02:07.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colombia is one of the world’s
largest coffee producers,

01:02:07.035 --> 01:02:09.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
since its soil, rainfall, and geography

01:02:09.955 --> 01:02:12.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
are ideal for growing arabica beans,

01:02:12.958 --> 01:02:15.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
known for their rich flavor and aroma.

01:02:16.503 --> 01:02:19.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
But more than coffee thrives here.

01:02:19.256 --> 01:02:23.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 1,500 species of birds fill the air.

01:02:24.845 --> 01:02:28.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jaguars, monkeys, sloths, and tapirs

01:02:28.473 --> 01:02:30.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
roam the landscape.

01:02:30.475 --> 01:02:32.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Burrowing just below the surface,

01:02:32.477 --> 01:02:36.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
earthworms grow up to 1.8 meters,
or 6 feet, in length.

01:02:38.233 --> 01:02:40.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth took root in the 1920’s

01:02:40.569 --> 01:02:43.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Heliodoro Hernández
began reading <i>The Watchtower.</i>

01:02:44.906 --> 01:02:47.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first missionaries arrived in 1945.

01:02:49.411 --> 01:02:53.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the past, parts of the country
suffered from internal conflicts,

01:02:53.957 --> 01:02:56.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some remote areas
still experience their effects.

01:02:58.045 --> 01:03:00.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because our brothers maintained neutrality

01:03:00.714 --> 01:03:04.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wisely exercised caution in the ministry,

01:03:04.092 --> 01:03:06.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
the preaching work never stopped.

01:03:07.971 --> 01:03:11.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, more than 186,000 publishers

01:03:11.516 --> 01:03:16.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
zealously share the good news
with Colombia’s 51 million inhabitants.

01:03:17.356 --> 01:03:20.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers preach
in 18 languages and dialects

01:03:20.567 --> 01:03:24.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can be found in every corner
of this diverse land

01:03:24.946 --> 01:03:27.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
in cities such as Manizales,

01:03:27.491 --> 01:03:30.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bogotá, Cartagena, and Medellín.

01:03:31.411 --> 01:03:35.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll see them preaching
in communities such as Villa de Leyva,

01:03:35.499 --> 01:03:38.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
rural areas like Neflandia, Córdoba,

01:03:38.835 --> 01:03:40.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the island of Providencia

01:03:40.671 --> 01:03:43.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, yes, on coffee farms too.

01:03:44.466 --> 01:03:46.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here publishers are on their way to preach

01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:49.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
on an Embera Chamí indigenous reservation.

01:03:51.306 --> 01:03:55.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to the ministry,
our brothers enjoy association,

01:03:55.018 --> 01:03:58.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
music, dancing,
and delicious Colombian dishes,

01:03:58.355 --> 01:04:01.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as <i>arepas, bandeja paisa,</i> and <i>sancocho</i>.

01:04:03.026 --> 01:04:05.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Colombia,

01:04:05.946 --> 01:04:09.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the Bethel family,
send you their warm love and greetings.

01:04:11.410 --> 01:04:15.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please remember
that we too cherish each one of you

01:04:15.539 --> 01:04:18.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
as part of our precious international family.

01:04:20.085 --> 01:04:22.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:04:22.921 --> 01:04:25.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
