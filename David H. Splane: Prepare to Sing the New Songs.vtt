00:01.550 --> 00:04.253
If you have seen our broadcast 
of the annual meeting 


00:04.253 --> 00:06.288
that was held last October, 


00:06.288 --> 00:10.060
you are aware of the fact 
that our songbook is being revised. 


00:10.060 --> 00:13.328
Well, perhaps 
some of you missed that broadcast. 


00:13.328 --> 00:15.331
So you may be wondering, 


00:15.332 --> 00:19.669
‘Why is it necessary 
to make changes to the songbook?’ 


00:19.668 --> 00:22.438
Well, as we explained 
at the annual meeting, 


00:22.438 --> 00:25.475
some of the expressions used 
in our current songbook 


00:25.475 --> 00:29.845
were drawn from the earlier edition 
of the New World Translation. 


00:29.845 --> 00:33.450
That translation has been revised, 
as you know. 


00:33.450 --> 00:37.153
Instead of 
‘the desirable things of the nations,’ 


00:37.153 --> 00:41.090
we now say, 
‘the precious things of the nations.’ 


00:41.090 --> 00:45.062
Instead of “loving-kindness,” 
we use “loyal love”; 


00:45.062 --> 00:48.532
“long-suffering”  
is rendered “patience”; 


00:48.532 --> 00:50.567
and so forth. 


00:50.567 --> 00:54.237
Since some of the terminology used 
in the songbook had to be adjusted, 


00:54.237 --> 00:58.374
the Governing Body decided 
to add a few songs as well, 


00:58.373 --> 01:01.210
and we are very happy for that.


01:01.210 --> 01:04.580
Now those in attendance 
at the annual meeting this year 


01:04.580 --> 01:07.717
were invited to sing three new songs, 


01:07.717 --> 01:10.687
and one of them 
was composed specially 


01:10.687 --> 01:15.000
to mark the 100th anniversary
of the establishment of the Kingdom. 


01:16.358 --> 01:19.161
If you weren’t present 
at the annual meeting this year, 


01:19.162 --> 01:24.100
don’t worry, you’ll get your chance 
to learn the new songs—and soon! 


01:24.100 --> 01:28.170
And you won’t have to wait 
until the new songbook is released either. 


01:28.170 --> 01:31.875
From time to time, 
new songs will be released 


01:31.875 --> 01:34.443
on our website for you to download. 


01:34.443 --> 01:36.980
Not only that, but at times, 


01:36.980 --> 01:39.815
we will even conclude 
the service meeting


01:39.815 --> 01:42.818
by singing one of the new songs.


01:42.818 --> 01:46.856
Case in point: 
During the week of January 5th, 


01:46.857 --> 01:50.260
an entire service meeting 
has been set aside  


01:50.260 --> 01:53.395
to help us appreciate 
our Kingdom songs. 


01:53.395 --> 01:56.765
One of the new songs 
will be sung on that occasion. 


01:56.765 --> 02:01.737
It’s entitled 
“The Kingdom Is in Place—Let It Come!” 


02:01.737 --> 02:03.774
You guessed it. 


02:03.773 --> 02:06.041
That’s the song that was composed 


02:06.042 --> 02:08.912
to mark 
the Kingdom’s 100th anniversary. 


02:08.912 --> 02:10.914
Would you like to hear it? 


02:10.913 --> 02:13.000
Please listen and watch.


02:27.297 --> 02:36.239
Jehovah, you always have been,
And always you will be.


02:36.238 --> 02:45.481
You’ve given the throne to your Son;
He rules by your decree.


02:45.482 --> 02:54.857
The Kingdom has been brought to birth;
His rulership will fill the earth.


02:54.857 --> 03:03.967
For now have come to pass
Salvation and kingdom and might.


03:03.967 --> 03:13.000
The Kingdom is in place.
We pray: “Let it come, Let it come!”


03:14.943 --> 03:24.420
The time for the Devil is short;
We know what this will mean.


03:24.420 --> 03:33.162
Though living in times of distress,
We see the things unseen.


03:33.162 --> 03:42.872
The Kingdom has been brought to birth;
His rulership will fill the earth.


03:42.872 --> 03:51.949
For now have come to pass
Salvation and kingdom and might.


03:51.948 --> 04:02.000
The Kingdom is in place.
We pray: “Let it come, Let it come!”


04:04.427 --> 04:07.930
What a majestic song of praise 
to Jehovah! 


04:07.930 --> 04:09.932
Isn’t that beautiful? 


04:09.932 --> 04:13.069
But how can we prepare to sing that song 


04:13.068 --> 04:15.705
as well as the others that will follow? 


04:15.705 --> 04:19.775
We take you now to our studios 
in Patterson, New York, 


04:19.775 --> 04:23.278
where our music choral arrangements 
are produced. 


04:23.278 --> 04:27.516
We’d like to introduce you 
to Brothers Ted Adams and Danny Baker 


04:27.517 --> 04:30.252
who have worked 
with our orchestra for years. 


04:30.252 --> 04:33.555
We also have with us 
Chris and Susan Mavor, 


04:33.555 --> 04:36.292
who both have a background in music. 


04:36.292 --> 04:39.529
Ted, we’re counting on you and your guests 


04:39.528 --> 04:43.065
to help us prepare to sing the new songs.


04:43.065 --> 04:45.067
Thank you, Brother Splane. 


04:45.067 --> 04:49.172
Singing is an important, 
prominent feature of our worship. 


04:49.172 --> 04:51.640
So we want to be able 
to face the challenges 


04:51.640 --> 04:53.643
of singing in a congregation setting. 


04:53.643 --> 04:55.978
There is a special challenge 
when we are learning a new song. 


04:55.978 --> 04:57.413
What is that?


04:57.413 --> 05:01.783
Well, I think learning a new song 
is like breaking in a new pair of shoes. 


05:01.783 --> 05:06.621
At first, the new songs aren’t as comfortable
as the ones that we’re used to singing, 


05:06.622 --> 05:09.492
but after singing them for a while, 


05:09.492 --> 05:11.494
exerting a little effort, 


05:11.493 --> 05:15.431
well, these could become 
our most favorite songs to sing.


05:15.432 --> 05:19.002
Now, some of us have 
a hard time learning new songs. 


05:19.002 --> 05:21.070
But we have to remember 
that these new songs 


05:21.070 --> 05:23.072
were composed for a good reason. 


05:23.072 --> 05:24.740
It’s actually a Scriptural reason, isn’t it?


05:24.740 --> 05:25.708
That’s right. 


05:25.708 --> 05:29.945
You know throughout the Scriptures, 
we often see an expression like this: 


05:29.945 --> 05:33.048
“Sing to Jehovah a new song.” 


05:33.048 --> 05:38.020
And the Bible tells us why 
new songs were composed and sung 


05:38.020 --> 05:41.590
and why we should learn 
new songs today and sing them. 


05:41.590 --> 05:45.795
The 98th Psalm and verse 1 
gives us a good reason. 


05:45.795 --> 05:48.998
It says: “Sing to Jehovah a new song, 


05:48.998 --> 05:53.101
for he has done wonderful things.” 


05:53.102 --> 05:57.174
Now, we think about what Jehovah 
is doing today with his organization


05:57.173 --> 06:01.376
—truly wonderful things he’s accomplishing 
to glorify his name 


06:01.377 --> 06:04.014
and to help his servants here on earth. 


06:04.013 --> 06:06.415
And each of us, in our personal lives, 


06:06.415 --> 06:11.420
have experienced Jehovah’s wonderful things
in our lives personally. 


06:11.420 --> 06:13.622
Not only that, the new songs also reflect 


06:13.622 --> 06:16.659
a clearer understanding of the Bible 


06:16.658 --> 06:19.861
as well as expressing the love 
that we have for Jehovah 


06:19.862 --> 06:22.565
and our appreciation for his tender care.


06:22.565 --> 06:24.933
So when we get these new songs, 


06:24.933 --> 06:29.138
we can think about what Jehovah
has done for us personally, that’s true, 


06:29.138 --> 06:32.641
but also, especially what he’s doing 
with the organization now. 


06:32.642 --> 06:35.377
This should put us 
in the right frame of mind and heart 


06:35.377 --> 06:37.380
to really learn the songs. 


06:37.380 --> 06:40.082
But what if we feel 


06:40.082 --> 06:45.054
that we’re just not as good 
as the singers on the recordings?


06:45.053 --> 06:47.723
Well, actually 
the singers on the recordings, 


06:47.723 --> 06:52.026
some might be interested to know, 
very few of those used for vocal renditions


06:52.027 --> 06:55.565
have had any professional training 
or professional experience. 


06:55.565 --> 06:58.500
So all of them 
have had to learn to sing better, 


06:58.500 --> 07:00.503
mainly through practice. 


07:00.503 --> 07:02.371
And that’s comforting for the rest of us. 


07:02.372 --> 07:06.242
We feel like we may not sing so well, 
but we all can improve. 


07:06.242 --> 07:08.244
We all can learn to sing better. 


07:08.243 --> 07:11.180
And, of course, the more you sing, 
the easier it will become.


07:11.180 --> 07:13.182
Now some of us hesitate to sing 


07:13.182 --> 07:16.585
because we feel the notes 
are a bit too high for us. 


07:16.585 --> 07:19.188
Would you give us some ideas 


07:19.188 --> 07:21.490
how we can change the range of our voice 


07:21.490 --> 07:23.793
and be able to sing these higher notes?


07:23.793 --> 07:27.028
Well, you know, for young people, 
 the range is not a problem, 


07:27.028 --> 07:30.833
but as we age, unfortunately, 
like the rest of our bodies, 


07:30.833 --> 07:35.303
our voices can lose range 
like we lose range of motion. 


07:35.303 --> 07:38.340
So we can regain some of our range 


07:38.340 --> 07:41.110
by doing a type of stretching with our voice, 


07:41.110 --> 07:45.682
just as an athlete would stretch 
before a game or before going for a run. 


07:45.682 --> 07:49.652
We can do that very simply 
by using like a humming sound 


07:49.652 --> 07:53.755
maybe in the shower, the kitchen, the car, 
somewhere you feel comfortable 


07:53.755 --> 07:55.792
and just using a humming sound 


07:55.792 --> 07:59.162
to gently go through your full range 
of your voice, 


07:59.162 --> 08:02.199
and then gently pushing the limits of it. 


08:02.198 --> 08:06.335
In that way, we can regain 
and maintain the range of our voice.


08:06.335 --> 08:09.772
So that helps us with the range, 
but now what about those high notes?


08:09.772 --> 08:13.475
Well, those high notes can be 
a bit of a challenge, but you know, 


08:13.475 --> 08:17.213
there are a couple of things we can do
that will really make them easier to produce.


08:17.213 --> 08:20.081
One is: We need to make sure 
we take a really good breath


08:20.082 --> 08:22.419
before we sing the phrase 
with the high note in it, 


08:22.418 --> 08:25.186
because more breath energy 
makes it much easier 


08:25.187 --> 08:27.490
to produce a higher note. 


08:27.490 --> 08:32.060
Also, physiologically, 
we need more space in the mouth 


08:32.060 --> 08:35.463
and throat area to make it easier 
to produce a high note. 


08:35.463 --> 08:38.533
So we would even see that on the outside, 


08:38.533 --> 08:42.771
when the mouth gets larger, 
going from a lower note to a higher note. 


08:42.772 --> 08:48.577
[Vocal exercise]


08:48.577 --> 08:52.114
Then it won’t feel so tight, 
and it is easier to produce a higher note.


08:52.113 --> 08:53.748
Good. 
So those two things are: 


08:53.748 --> 08:56.585
take a deeper, bigger breath 
for the high notes 


08:56.585 --> 08:59.155
and then more space 
created by the mouth. 


08:59.155 --> 09:00.288
Good. 


09:00.288 --> 09:02.391
Well, now how does 
the composing team 


09:02.392 --> 09:05.194
help us with some 
of these high note issues?


09:05.193 --> 09:08.130
Well, the composers 
do take the musical range 


09:08.130 --> 09:10.132
of the human voice into account, 


09:10.132 --> 09:12.769
including the range of unskilled singers. 


09:12.768 --> 09:15.303
And in a musical composition, 


09:15.303 --> 09:17.640
in dealing with high notes in particular, 


09:17.640 --> 09:20.508
there are basically two ways 
to get up there as a composer. 


09:20.508 --> 09:24.480
One is to walk your way up there, 
going up the scale. 


09:24.480 --> 09:27.283
That’s the easier method vocally. 


09:27.283 --> 09:29.318
That’s easier to get up there. 


09:29.318 --> 09:31.686
At times, in a composition, 


09:31.687 --> 09:34.090
there are jumps 
from low notes to high notes, 


09:34.090 --> 09:37.260
but there are jumps 
which are more logical, 


09:37.260 --> 09:39.262
musically, 
which also makes them 


09:39.262 --> 09:41.830
more instinctively comfortable 
for us to sing,


09:41.830 --> 09:43.832
even if we are not trained singers. 


09:43.832 --> 09:47.537
So the compositions have taken 
these factors into account, 


09:47.537 --> 09:49.539
and I think, two keys here: 


09:49.538 --> 09:51.806
Number one, what Susan 
has been talking about 


09:51.807 --> 09:55.210
is to try and develop 
our voices a little more;


09:55.210 --> 09:57.680
couple that with learning the song. 


09:57.680 --> 10:00.382
And if you have 
those two things in place, 


10:00.382 --> 10:04.000
high notes are not the issue 
that maybe you thought they would be.


10:05.788 --> 10:09.091
You know, it sounds 
like the fundamentals for good singing


10:09.092 --> 10:11.994
are basically the same as 
for good public speaking.


10:11.993 --> 10:15.163
Like the instructions we get 
in the Ministry School textbook.


10:15.163 --> 10:16.598
Exactly! 


10:16.598 --> 10:19.668
Maintaining good posture, 
standing up nice and straight, 


10:19.668 --> 10:23.138
and being sure to take 
good, deep breaths before speaking.


10:23.138 --> 10:26.875
It’s very true that poor posture 
and shallow breathing 


10:26.875 --> 10:29.478
are definitely the enemies 
of good singing. 


10:29.478 --> 10:32.815
It’s just the way that Jehovah created us. 


10:32.815 --> 10:36.118
Physiologically, we have 
these tiny little vocal chords, 


10:36.118 --> 10:39.255
but when we take a good breath 
and send the air through them, 


10:39.255 --> 10:41.857
then it resonates 
through our bones and tissues, 


10:41.857 --> 10:43.994
and we can produce sound easily.


10:43.993 --> 10:45.160
Good. 
Thanks, Susan. 


10:45.160 --> 10:46.995
Good ideas on technique. 


10:46.995 --> 10:49.265
Now here’s a problem 
that comes up during our meetings. 


10:49.265 --> 10:52.200
Sometimes the piano can’t be heard. 


10:52.200 --> 10:54.903
The volume of the piano 
is not high enough. 


10:54.903 --> 10:58.340
And when you 
fill the auditorium with voices, 


10:58.340 --> 11:00.342
it just drowns the piano out. 


11:00.342 --> 11:02.345
Now, how can we handle that?


11:02.345 --> 11:04.947
Well, the key to solving 
that problem is 


11:04.947 --> 11:08.984
for the brother at the sound console 
to be listening. 


11:08.983 --> 11:12.220
Listening not just to the piano volume 


11:12.220 --> 11:16.558
but listening also to what you referred to
—how the singing is going. 


11:16.558 --> 11:20.228
For example, if the singers 
can’t stay together 


11:20.228 --> 11:22.998
or if they can’t stay 
with the piano recording, 


11:22.998 --> 11:25.433
they’re either ahead of it or behind it, 


11:25.433 --> 11:29.000
then that’s the cue for the sound operator 
to turn the piano up.


11:30.605 --> 11:35.610
So the operator, then, 
has to be free to focus on the sound. 


11:35.610 --> 11:38.380
Just as when you are driving a car, 


11:38.380 --> 11:41.783
you have to keep your hand on the wheel 
and make adjustments to stay on the road.


11:41.783 --> 11:46.188
Yes, I think “free” 
for that task is the key word there. 


11:46.188 --> 11:50.125
The reality is that at the beginning 
of many of our meeting programs, 


11:50.125 --> 11:53.228
the brother or brothers 
in our sound department 


11:53.228 --> 11:56.198
are trying to multitask 
with various little things 


11:56.198 --> 11:58.233
that happen 
right at the beginning of the program. 


11:58.233 --> 12:02.838
And this issue of the piano volume 
sometimes just gets overlooked. 


12:02.838 --> 12:05.406
So at least one person back there 


12:05.407 --> 12:08.010
has to be dedicated 
exclusively at that moment 


12:08.010 --> 12:11.513
to listening to 
and adjusting the piano volume.


12:11.513 --> 12:13.981
And this would be especially true 


12:13.982 --> 12:18.520
whenever a new song 
is scheduled for a program. 


12:18.520 --> 12:21.423
Definitely, 
we need to be listening to 


12:21.423 --> 12:24.726
the cues 
or the music when it’s being played. 


12:24.727 --> 12:27.797
But you know this doesn’t relieve us 
of the personal responsibility 


12:27.797 --> 12:31.400
that each of us has 
to become familiar with the music, 


12:31.400 --> 12:34.337
even ahead of time, 
before going to the meeting,


12:34.337 --> 12:37.940
and that way we can be prepared 
to sing the songs when we arrive.


12:37.940 --> 12:40.275
The same way we prepare 
for other parts in the meeting.


12:40.275 --> 12:42.010
That’s right.


12:42.010 --> 12:44.680
Well, doesn’t that just put us 
right in mind of family worship then? 


12:44.680 --> 12:46.682
Because family worship is where 


12:46.682 --> 12:49.050
so much meeting preparation 
is done typically.


12:49.050 --> 12:53.222
So include the music 
during family worship. 


12:53.222 --> 12:55.224
Get the songbook out. 


12:55.223 --> 12:57.960
Turn on the piano recording. 
Sing along.


12:57.960 --> 13:00.395
Even better, 
if you can play the piano 


13:00.395 --> 13:04.533
or if you play the guitar, 
do it live, and sing to it live. 


13:04.533 --> 13:08.803
Simplified chords are up there 
on jw.org that we can download, 


13:08.803 --> 13:12.273
but even for social occasions, 


13:12.273 --> 13:15.076
social gatherings, we can sing the songs. 


13:15.077 --> 13:18.047
The idea is: 
Prepare for this part of our worship 


13:18.047 --> 13:21.317
with the congregation or even 
for our assemblies and conventions.


13:21.317 --> 13:25.287
Yeah, you know, the faithful slave 
has really given us the tools 


13:25.287 --> 13:27.455
to be well prepared not only 
at our congregation meetings 


13:27.455 --> 13:31.660
but also at these events: 
the assemblies and conventions. 


13:31.660 --> 13:36.332
Months ahead of time the programs
are posted on the website. 


13:36.332 --> 13:40.302
And in those programs are the songs
that will be sung at these events, 


13:40.302 --> 13:44.507
and so we can be well-prepared 
by downloading, as you mentioned, 


13:44.507 --> 13:48.477
the piano music 
or the sheet music from jw.org 


13:48.477 --> 13:52.849
and include that 
in our preparation for these assemblies.


13:52.848 --> 13:57.753
And you mentioned downloading 
a number of things, but is that hard to do?


13:57.753 --> 13:59.755
Well, they’ve tried 
to make it as simple as possible. 


13:59.755 --> 14:02.758
On the home page 
is the Publications tab. 


14:02.758 --> 14:07.261
You click on that; it brings up a tab 
on the left side that says Music. 


14:07.262 --> 14:10.765
You click on that, 
and all the music products are right there: 


14:10.765 --> 14:14.637
the MP3s for the vocal renditions, 


14:14.637 --> 14:17.674
the piano accompaniment, 
orchestral arrangements. 


14:17.673 --> 14:21.743
There’s also a tab 
for the songbook Sing to Jehovah. 


14:21.743 --> 14:24.446
If you click on that, 
there’s a PDF tab, 


14:24.447 --> 14:27.249
and it gives you all the sheet music 
that you need, 


14:27.248 --> 14:30.451
including the simplified guitar chords.


14:30.452 --> 14:33.822
Well, you know, Ted, 
as simple as that sounds, we do understand


14:33.822 --> 14:38.160
that many still find navigating websites 
to be a challenging thing, 


14:38.160 --> 14:41.130
and at the same time we know 
that some of our brothers and sisters 


14:41.130 --> 14:43.132
still don’t own the equipment,


14:43.132 --> 14:45.800
the computer equipment 
to do their own downloads. 


14:45.800 --> 14:47.803
This is where the congregation, 


14:47.803 --> 14:50.605
and in particular 
the elders and ministerial servants, 


14:50.605 --> 14:55.543
can take the lead in helping 
everyone to have these materials. 


14:55.543 --> 14:57.713
Because as we help each other that way, 


14:57.713 --> 14:59.748
especially the brothers taking the lead, 


14:59.748 --> 15:03.751
then this really engenders 
a spirit of enthusiasm, 


15:03.752 --> 15:06.000
interest in this feature of our worship.


15:07.288 --> 15:09.991
It seems like we have 
all the tools that we need, then, 


15:09.992 --> 15:14.830
to learn the new songs and be well-prepared 
to sing them at our congregation meetings 


15:14.830 --> 15:17.098
with the help of the elders, 
even as brought out here. 


15:17.098 --> 15:20.568
And it really is important to do that 
because some of the songs, 


15:20.568 --> 15:23.105
besides not knowing 
the melodies or the words, 


15:23.105 --> 15:26.208
also could be written in a particular style 


15:26.208 --> 15:28.410
that maybe we’re not used to singing in. 


15:28.410 --> 15:31.913
And so when we listen 
to the music ahead of time, 


15:31.913 --> 15:35.750
then we can become better familiar 
not just with the tune and the words 


15:35.750 --> 15:38.000
but also the style 
in which they are written.


15:39.355 --> 15:42.057
Well, Chris, 
because you mention musical style, 


15:42.057 --> 15:45.727
this brings up another personal matter, 
I think, for many of us, 


15:45.727 --> 15:48.830
and that’s how we view music itself. 


15:48.830 --> 15:53.502
The point here is 
that it’s all too common in this world 


15:53.502 --> 15:56.239
to just be the product 
of the entertainment industry 


15:56.238 --> 15:58.406
with respect to our musical tastes. 


15:58.407 --> 16:01.877
They’re in the business of selling 
what you might call “ear candy.” 


16:01.877 --> 16:05.014
What that means is that anything 
that just quickly catches the ear 


16:05.013 --> 16:06.948
and catches on 
and becomes popular, well, 


16:06.948 --> 16:10.151
that’s a very marketable product, 
and they make a lot of money selling it. 


16:10.152 --> 16:15.124
Well, it’s kind of like candy 
that we like to eat when we are children. 


16:15.123 --> 16:17.458
And we still like it when we grow up too, 


16:17.458 --> 16:21.296
but the point is that when we are children, 
that’s kind of all we want. 


16:21.297 --> 16:23.965
Later on, we have to learn 


16:23.965 --> 16:26.635
to appreciate and enjoy the foods 


16:26.635 --> 16:30.172
that are really better for us 
and the ones that we really need. 


16:30.172 --> 16:33.075
Well, the music that we use in our worship 


16:33.075 --> 16:35.177
is kind of like that healthy food. 


16:35.177 --> 16:37.880
We might not yet have the taste for it, 


16:37.880 --> 16:39.882
but we need to develop it 


16:39.882 --> 16:43.552
because it’s there to nourish us spiritually.


16:43.552 --> 16:47.222
The Governing Body wants us all 
to sing praises to Jehovah. 


16:47.222 --> 16:50.059
Just like back in King Jehoshaphat’s time 


16:50.058 --> 16:52.160
when the army was going out into battle, 


16:52.160 --> 16:55.663
there was singing, and the scripture says 


16:55.663 --> 16:58.466
they were 
“joyfully singing praises” to Jehovah. 


16:58.467 --> 17:01.002
So we want to use 
all the tools that we have 


17:01.002 --> 17:04.005
to learn the new songs 
and just start singing.


17:04.005 --> 17:07.810
You know, Ted, I couldn’t help but think 
about that Scriptural reference; 


17:07.810 --> 17:11.847
it really indicates that those men 
were not at all timid 


17:11.847 --> 17:14.784
about singing praises to Jehovah God. 


17:14.783 --> 17:17.685
And really that sets a pattern for us today. 


17:17.685 --> 17:21.823
We should not feel shy or timid 
about singing at the Kingdom Hall 


17:21.823 --> 17:25.160
or at any of our meetings
—praises to Jehovah God. 


17:25.160 --> 17:29.598
And certainly we have the tools now 
to learn these new songs 


17:29.598 --> 17:32.166
and to be 
just like those ancient Israelites, 


17:32.167 --> 17:35.104
singing praises to Jehovah 
with full heart and joy.


17:35.103 --> 17:38.273
What you just said, Chris, 
really helps to make the point 


17:38.273 --> 17:41.276
that we should view 
our singing in worship 


17:41.277 --> 17:43.312
as we view our prayers. 


17:43.312 --> 17:46.014
That matter of being timid, 


17:46.013 --> 17:48.783
well, prayer is not always easy, 


17:48.783 --> 17:51.853
even private prayer is not always easy. 


17:51.853 --> 17:54.456
Sometimes we are praying 
about something painful


17:54.457 --> 17:58.860
or difficult or something that’s 
kind of confusing at the time. 


17:58.860 --> 18:01.097
So we’re struggling 
for the clear thought. 


18:01.097 --> 18:03.799
We’re struggling even 
for the words to use in the prayer, 


18:03.798 --> 18:05.800
even though it’s a private prayer. 


18:05.800 --> 18:09.705
But we still manage 
to give that prayer to Jehovah 


18:09.705 --> 18:11.707
because we love him 


18:11.707 --> 18:14.342
and because we want 
to continue worshipping him. 


18:14.342 --> 18:17.914
That’s why, even people 
with limited vocabularies 


18:17.913 --> 18:22.316
can still pray very successfully, 
very effectively to Jehovah. 


18:22.317 --> 18:24.687
And maybe that’s the way 
some of us are as singers. 


18:24.687 --> 18:28.124
We’re limited. 
But that’s OK. 


18:28.123 --> 18:31.926
We still do it, 
and we’re not timid about it. 


18:31.927 --> 18:35.330
We do it for the same important reasons 
that we love Jehovah 


18:35.330 --> 18:38.500
and that we 
want to worship him in this way.


18:38.500 --> 18:42.637
When we get the new songs, 
we want to be excited about learning them.


18:42.637 --> 18:47.642
These new songs express our devotion, 
our feeling for Jehovah. 


18:47.642 --> 18:52.114
They also keep us in harmony 
with the greater understanding of scriptures


18:52.113 --> 18:55.450
and, of course, 
how Jehovah deals with us personally.


18:55.450 --> 18:58.000
Now we’ll go back to our studio in Brooklyn.


18:59.353 --> 19:01.356
Thank you so much, panel. 


19:01.357 --> 19:15.422
Your insights have been most helpful.
