00:01.150 --> 00:03.487
Welcome to our program. 


00:03.487 --> 00:06.757
Here’s a preview 
of what we can look forward to.


00:06.757 --> 00:10.194
This brother began 
his ministry in the Congo 


00:10.193 --> 00:13.830
when his fellow Witnesses 
were few in number. 


00:13.830 --> 00:16.232
How did Jehovah bless his hard work 


00:16.232 --> 00:19.569
to preach and shepherd?


00:19.568 --> 00:23.000
It’s a joy when we come together 
at Assembly Halls for spiritual programs. 


00:24.373 --> 00:28.000
But how much work goes into caring 
for these places of pure worship?


00:29.478 --> 00:31.313
We also work to maintain 
peaceful relationships 


00:31.313 --> 00:33.315
with our brothers and sisters. 


00:33.315 --> 00:35.952
What lesson does this sister learn 


00:35.952 --> 00:40.590
that lets her see 
the beautiful qualities in others?


00:40.590 --> 00:45.462
And we’ll consider the privilege we have 
to be fellow workers with God. 


00:45.462 --> 00:51.000
You’re watching the October 2017 edition 
of JW Broadcasting.


01:10.220 --> 01:13.557
We begin with a report 
from the United States branch 


01:13.557 --> 01:15.559
in Wallkill, New York. 


01:15.558 --> 01:20.563
Any Bethel assignment is a joy 
and sometimes a challenge. 


01:20.563 --> 01:25.000
Proper training is therefore 
an important part of every job. 


01:26.202 --> 01:28.270
How does the Maintenance Department 


01:28.270 --> 01:33.275
train hundreds of volunteers 
to work efficiently and safely? 


01:33.275 --> 01:38.000
And how do the students feel 
about the practical training they receive?


01:43.787 --> 01:45.689
There were a few factors


01:45.688 --> 01:48.190
that created the need at Bethel 


01:48.190 --> 01:50.827
for a more structured training program. 


01:50.827 --> 01:55.832
One of those factors included
the regular changeover in personnel.


01:55.832 --> 01:57.534
The brothers have to be more versatile


01:57.533 --> 01:58.535
in their assignments. 


01:58.535 --> 02:00.403
They may have to do tasks they


02:00.403 --> 02:01.670
previously weren’t trained on.


02:01.670 --> 02:05.208
Printing equipment became
more technologically advanced; 


02:05.208 --> 02:09.245
our building systems
became more complicated; 


02:09.245 --> 02:11.247
computer systems were now starting


02:11.247 --> 02:13.584
to be used to control virtually everything.


02:13.583 --> 02:17.920
Well, I feel like Bethel has definitely
always been good about training,


02:17.920 --> 02:19.955
but especially now. 


02:19.955 --> 02:22.658
I think everyone sees 
the need to continue investing


02:22.658 --> 02:26.061
in the brothers and sisters
that are currently at Bethel.


02:26.062 --> 02:28.565
I don’t think it’s possible for someone


02:28.565 --> 02:30.367
to know less about the trades 


02:30.367 --> 02:31.600
than I did when I started.


02:31.600 --> 02:33.235
I remember my first reaction


02:33.235 --> 02:34.737
when I was invited to help 


02:34.737 --> 02:37.107
in electrical was fear.


02:37.107 --> 02:39.242
So when I received my assignment,


02:39.242 --> 02:41.710
I found out that it involved


02:41.710 --> 02:43.880
running the heavy equipment. 


02:43.880 --> 02:45.215
So I called my parents. 


02:45.215 --> 02:47.217
I was really excited about it. 


02:47.217 --> 02:49.419
I said, “Mom and Dad,
guess what I get to do?” 


02:49.418 --> 02:51.753
And Dad said, “OK, Son. 


02:51.753 --> 02:56.291
Well, did you tell them
that you don’t know how to drive?”


02:56.292 --> 02:58.494
It was decided to pull a group


02:58.493 --> 03:01.663
of highly experienced, 
highly skilled brothers


03:01.663 --> 03:05.133
to concentrate 
on developing and teaching


03:05.133 --> 03:07.736
repeatable, consistent classes


03:07.737 --> 03:12.275
that could bring people’s skill levels
up to what was needed.


03:12.275 --> 03:14.143
We teach well over 100 different classes


03:14.143 --> 03:16.611
in 12 major categories.


03:16.612 --> 03:18.480
Here at Bethel, 
I’ve probably been


03:18.480 --> 03:20.917
a part of over 30 different classes,


03:20.917 --> 03:23.687
so it’s been a variety, 
depending on


03:23.687 --> 03:25.522
the needs at the time 
of the assignment.


03:25.522 --> 03:28.825
I would estimate 
that I’ve taken about 15


03:28.825 --> 03:31.393
or 20 different courses
from safety and training 


03:31.393 --> 03:33.963
over the course of my 13 years 
in learning a trade. 


03:33.963 --> 03:35.431
I’ve become certified


03:35.432 --> 03:39.002
in at least these
seven different licensed requirements.


03:39.002 --> 03:40.437
We teach people technical skills, 


03:40.437 --> 03:42.005
but that’s not the sole purpose 


03:42.005 --> 03:43.072
of the training.


03:43.072 --> 03:44.374
If you aren’t skilled in safety, 


03:44.373 --> 03:46.841
you can’t be skilled
in your trade and vice versa.


03:46.842 --> 03:49.812
The objective in all of our safety courses


03:49.812 --> 03:53.684
is to get them to view safety
the same way Jehovah views it


03:53.683 --> 03:56.018
—as a reflection of their spirituality.


03:56.018 --> 03:59.455
So training in safety is essential.


03:59.455 --> 04:00.790
So our goal is to take them


04:00.790 --> 04:01.857
into the classroom


04:01.857 --> 04:02.959
and give them some time


04:02.958 --> 04:04.526
to consider the theoretical. 


04:04.527 --> 04:05.662
And then we take them out 


04:05.662 --> 04:08.330
where there is a lab set up, 
and we have them do some tests on it. 


04:08.330 --> 04:10.333
Typically, they will tell us 


04:10.333 --> 04:13.703
that they’ve been able to learn 
more in a week 


04:13.703 --> 04:16.338
than what they have learned
in a year of trade school.


04:16.338 --> 04:20.476
We’ve done over 60,000 instances of training.


04:20.477 --> 04:22.479
And so now receiving this training, 


04:22.478 --> 04:25.180
it provides an area or an aspect


04:25.180 --> 04:28.652
in which I can give 
my 100 percent to Jehovah.


04:28.652 --> 04:30.219
You see it in their eyes. 


04:30.218 --> 04:31.653
They’re just so happy


04:31.653 --> 04:34.723
that they now have maybe a new skill 


04:34.723 --> 04:38.828
or a new understanding
that they can use to benefit Jehovah.


04:38.828 --> 04:42.731
I love the fact that I came
into Bethel with virtually no experience. 


04:42.732 --> 04:46.502
And not only did I 
receive a trade that I could use


04:46.502 --> 04:50.039
to carry out a work 
that glorifies Jehovah 


04:50.038 --> 04:53.175
but I was trained well enough
that I can share that with others, 


04:53.175 --> 04:54.777
and they can be trained too.


04:54.777 --> 04:58.514
Helping someone else 
to go from that feeling 


04:58.513 --> 05:01.683
of not knowing anything 
to feeling productive


05:01.683 --> 05:04.720
and feeling like they’re 
contributing is a real joy for me.


05:04.720 --> 05:06.488
And they can take what they learn


05:06.488 --> 05:07.923
wherever they go.


05:07.923 --> 05:11.726
The confidence that people
leave with once they’ve received 


05:11.727 --> 05:14.630
that investment
—it’s confidence that they can carry out


05:14.630 --> 05:16.732
whatever assignment
Jehovah has given them, 


05:16.732 --> 05:18.969
and the confidence that Jehovah
is going to train them


05:18.968 --> 05:21.303
for whatever is being asked of them. 


05:21.303 --> 05:23.338
I think if younger brothers and sisters


05:23.338 --> 05:26.108
are trying to learn a skill
so that they can come to Bethel,


05:26.108 --> 05:30.245
that’s commendable, 
but more important is spirituality. 


05:30.245 --> 05:32.048
Let Jehovah “finish your training.”


05:32.048 --> 05:34.616
In regard to training,
we’re really only getting started.


05:34.617 --> 05:38.855
The training that we are getting 
in this system of things by Jehovah,


05:38.855 --> 05:41.423
and especially related to safety, 


05:41.423 --> 05:44.760
is absolutely going
to be vital in the new world.


05:44.760 --> 05:46.262
I can imagine the idea


05:46.262 --> 05:48.430
of being able to use
some of the things I’ve learned


05:48.430 --> 05:50.298
to figure out how 


05:50.298 --> 05:53.001
we can use the natural resources
in a way without using them up.


05:53.002 --> 05:56.739
We know that we serve a God 
who is known as the “Grand Instructor.” 


05:56.738 --> 05:59.808
So the things that we’re
teaching and training right now,


05:59.808 --> 06:02.678
it can only expand in the future.


06:02.678 --> 06:07.000
And as long as you let him train you,
you’re going to be all right.


06:09.718 --> 06:14.090
Good training gives us confidence 
to do our best for Jehovah. 


06:14.090 --> 06:19.128
That’s true at Bethel 
but also true in the field.


06:19.128 --> 06:22.231
Have you, though, 
ever felt alone in your assignment,


06:22.232 --> 06:26.569
even if for just a few hours
in the ministry? 


06:26.568 --> 06:31.406
Brother Pontien Mukanga may have felt
that way early in his assignment. 


06:31.407 --> 06:35.479
He was the first circuit overseer
for all of what is now


06:35.478 --> 06:40.683
the Democratic Republic of Congo
and the Republic of Congo. 


06:40.683 --> 06:45.000
He traveled great distances to visit
the few brothers throughout the territory. 


06:46.322 --> 06:50.000
Listen to what encouraged him
the most to keep going.


06:52.528 --> 06:54.530
In 1960,


06:54.530 --> 06:58.000
I was made a circuit overseer
for the whole of Congo. 


06:59.968 --> 07:02.000
I was so happy to receive this privilege. 


07:03.472 --> 07:06.409
But I was shocked and scared. 


07:06.408 --> 07:09.578
The assignment was huge.


07:09.578 --> 07:12.581
Congo is a vast country. 


07:12.582 --> 07:16.000
I was afraid to go to places I didn’t know. 


07:17.085 --> 07:22.725
I felt overwhelmed, 
so I turned to Jehovah.


07:22.725 --> 07:27.197
Sometimes I had to go through
savannahs and across the jungle. 


07:27.197 --> 07:29.832
There were wild animals. 


07:29.832 --> 07:34.004
One day, I climbed up a tree
to find a place to sleep. 


07:34.003 --> 07:37.373
I tied myself to a branch with my belt. 


07:37.373 --> 07:41.000
I was afraid I would be taken by a boa snake.


07:42.278 --> 07:46.681
I was afraid of getting lost in the forest.


07:46.682 --> 07:49.752
Visiting the brothers was very difficult. 


07:49.752 --> 07:53.055
Sometimes the journey took many days. 


07:53.055 --> 07:55.925
I remember one day, 
I left my house


07:55.925 --> 07:58.000
to visit the brothers to encourage them. 


08:01.897 --> 08:04.134
I left at 5:30 in the morning, 


08:04.133 --> 08:07.000
and I arrived at 7:30 that night. 


08:08.170 --> 08:10.740
I had to push my bicycle through sand


08:10.740 --> 08:13.000
for up to 13 miles (21 km) or even more. 


08:14.243 --> 08:16.645
Other times, we traveled by truck. 


08:16.645 --> 08:18.647
That was not easy. 


08:18.647 --> 08:22.000
You had to climb on top of the truck. 


08:23.052 --> 08:27.724
I had to hold on tight so as not to fall.


08:27.723 --> 08:32.000
Congregations, isolated groups
were far away from one another. 


08:33.462 --> 08:36.365
There were no phones at that time either. 


08:36.365 --> 08:39.568
Even though they did not know I was coming,


08:39.568 --> 08:43.000
they made me feel so welcome. 


08:44.407 --> 08:48.879
The brothers were really very hospitable. 


08:48.878 --> 08:50.913
When I arrived, 


08:50.913 --> 08:55.000
I was exhausted
but so happy to see the brothers.


08:58.353 --> 09:01.000
The Kitawala was a religion. 


09:02.157 --> 09:04.594
They sent many letters
to the Belgium branch


09:04.593 --> 09:08.000
asking to be recognized
as Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


09:09.465 --> 09:10.833
These people used


09:10.833 --> 09:16.000
our publications
and used the name Watch Tower. 


09:17.240 --> 09:20.000
It created a lot of confusion. 


09:21.477 --> 09:23.645
To clarify the matter,


09:23.645 --> 09:26.000
the organization prepared a booklet.


09:28.450 --> 09:30.552
My mission was to check whether


09:30.552 --> 09:34.000
there were any genuine
Jehovah’s Witnesses in Kisangani. 


09:36.858 --> 09:39.061
We found out that these people were


09:39.062 --> 09:42.000
not Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


09:43.698 --> 09:47.135
In all the confusion, 
people even tried to kill me


09:47.135 --> 09:49.172
during the trip. 


09:49.172 --> 09:53.000
Fortunately, I managed to escape. 


09:54.077 --> 09:58.000
Since it was Jehovah
who assigned me this privilege,


09:59.915 --> 10:03.000
I was confident
that he would always help me.


10:07.255 --> 10:09.758
And today, I am very happy


10:09.758 --> 10:13.428
to have at my side my children, 
my grandchildren,


10:13.428 --> 10:18.000
and my great-grandchildren
—all Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


10:19.968 --> 10:22.905
Jehovah has given me many blessings. 


10:22.905 --> 10:24.000
I am truly grateful. 


10:25.708 --> 10:29.000
What a joy to be used by Almighty God.


10:30.913 --> 10:34.000
Through all these years,
I have never lacked anything. 


10:36.052 --> 10:38.054
Jehovah has given me the strength 


10:38.053 --> 10:43.993
to serve him up until now—to the age of 86. 


10:43.993 --> 10:47.195
In everything and for everything, 


10:47.195 --> 10:50.000
my trust really is in Jehovah.


10:51.233 --> 10:53.268
There were 46 publishers


10:53.268 --> 10:55.603
in the whole of Congo. 


10:55.603 --> 10:58.106
Today, I hear there are more than


10:58.107 --> 11:00.442
223,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses 


11:00.442 --> 11:03.000
in the Congo.


11:05.613 --> 11:08.316
Today, when I see


11:08.317 --> 11:12.000
the increase of Jehovah’s people, 


11:14.023 --> 11:17.000
to me it is like a miracle. 


11:19.295 --> 11:23.065
I thank Jehovah 
for allowing me to see 


11:23.065 --> 11:25.067
‘the little one become a thousand’ 


11:25.067 --> 11:28.000
here in the Congo.


11:36.812 --> 11:42.000
Brother Mukanga continues to serve
as an elder at nearly 88 years old. 


11:43.285 --> 11:46.422
Can you imagine yourself
experiencing both the joys


11:46.422 --> 11:49.000
and difficulties he had
as a circuit overseer? 


11:50.727 --> 11:54.330
He courageously visited
the Kitawala religious groups


11:54.330 --> 11:56.565
who claimed to serve Jehovah, 


11:56.565 --> 12:01.203
only to find some were violent
and practiced immorality. 


12:01.203 --> 12:04.206
But it was his reliance on Jehovah


12:04.207 --> 12:07.109
and watching Him turn
the small group of brothers


12:07.108 --> 12:12.000
into more than 200,000
that has kept him going.


12:13.182 --> 12:16.685
He personally experienced 
our theme for this program: 


12:16.685 --> 12:21.000
“The Privilege and Blessing 
of Being God’s Fellow Worker.”


12:22.625 --> 12:24.627
As Jehovah’s people, 


12:24.627 --> 12:26.629
we enjoy many undeserved


12:26.628 --> 12:28.630
and precious privileges. 


12:28.630 --> 12:32.067
Among them, we bear Jehovah’s name


12:32.067 --> 12:34.770
and render him sacred service. 


12:34.770 --> 12:37.238
As we carry out his will, 


12:37.238 --> 12:41.476
he dignifies us in a very special way. 


12:41.477 --> 12:46.215
At 1 Corinthians 3:9,
the apostle Paul under inspiration


12:46.215 --> 12:51.887
stated that “we are God’s fellow workers.”


12:51.887 --> 12:55.657
What an honor to be a fellow worker
with the Universal Sovereign,


12:55.657 --> 12:58.660
our loving heavenly Father! 


12:58.660 --> 13:02.197
To build appreciation for the privilege
of working with Jehovah, 


13:02.197 --> 13:07.000
we’re going to review events
in the life of Jonathan, a son of King Saul. 


13:08.437 --> 13:12.742
First Samuel 14:45 
describes Jonathan when it says:


13:12.742 --> 13:16.000
“For it was with God
that he acted this day.” 


13:17.145 --> 13:20.883
What was the background
that led to this statement? 


13:20.883 --> 13:24.000
How did Jonathan act, or work,
with Jehovah on that day? 


13:25.922 --> 13:29.000
What lessons can we learn
from their working relationship? 


13:30.225 --> 13:34.000
And what blessings result
from being a fellow worker with God?


13:35.430 --> 13:38.000
Let us begin with some background. 


13:39.402 --> 13:43.005
First Samuel 12:20 


13:43.005 --> 13:45.107
records the encouraging words 


13:45.107 --> 13:48.644
spoken by the prophet Samuel 
to the nation of Israel: 


13:48.643 --> 13:50.745
“Do not be afraid.  . . .


13:50.745 --> 13:54.115
“Only do not turn away
from following Jehovah, 


13:54.115 --> 13:56.985
and serve Jehovah 
with all your heart.” 


13:56.985 --> 13:59.120
Verse 22 adds:


13:59.120 --> 14:01.823
“For the sake of his great name, 


14:01.823 --> 14:04.000
Jehovah will not abandon his people.” 


14:05.193 --> 14:07.361
As long as they remained faithful, 


14:07.362 --> 14:13.569
Jehovah would always be there to guide,
protect, and rescue them. 


14:13.568 --> 14:17.606
These words no doubt strengthened
Jonathan to carry out Jehovah’s directive


14:17.607 --> 14:19.775
to subdue the enemy nations


14:19.775 --> 14:22.000
and take possession of the Promised Land.


14:23.645 --> 14:26.248
At  1 Samuel chapter 13, 


14:26.248 --> 14:29.851
we read that Jonathan 
was assigned 1,000 men


14:29.852 --> 14:32.000
to attack a Philistine garrison at Geba. 


14:33.755 --> 14:38.927
Although poorly equipped,
Jonathan and his men succeeded. 


14:38.927 --> 14:42.565
This victory strengthened 
Jonathan’s confidence in Jehovah


14:42.565 --> 14:45.000
and provides a valuable lesson for us: 


14:46.402 --> 14:48.404
While we gain strength and courage


14:48.403 --> 14:51.440
from Jehovah’s reassuring
words of the Scriptures, 


14:51.440 --> 14:55.510
our confidence in Jehovah’s support
becomes even stronger


14:55.510 --> 14:58.547
when we successfully
carry out our assignments 


14:58.547 --> 15:01.000
that may seem overwhelming.


15:02.250 --> 15:04.587
The account then relates
how the Philistines


15:04.587 --> 15:09.000
were infuriated over their defeat
and mounted a massive counterattack. 


15:10.025 --> 15:12.027
They sent out raiding parties 


15:12.027 --> 15:15.430
from their camp 
at Michmash near Jerusalem. 


15:15.430 --> 15:17.733
Many Israelite men hid out of fear, 


15:17.733 --> 15:21.000
and some even fled
to the other side of the Jordan River.


15:22.370 --> 15:26.000
In contrast,
Jonathan remained courageous. 


15:27.275 --> 15:29.812
Determined to put a stop to the raids, 


15:29.812 --> 15:32.314
he confronted the Philistine outpost


15:32.313 --> 15:35.883
at the ravine pass of Michmash. 


15:35.883 --> 15:40.000
The approach was by way of a deep gorge
with nearly vertical cliffs. 


15:41.357 --> 15:46.295
This would have seemed next to impossible
to someone unfamiliar with the area, 


15:46.295 --> 15:51.000
but Jonathan grew up in this territory
and apparently knew it well.


15:52.500 --> 15:56.000
His knowledge of the surroundings
provides another practical lesson:


15:57.438 --> 16:00.475
Whatever theocratic assignment
we may be given,


16:00.475 --> 16:04.380
putting forth time and effort 
to get to know the terrain, 


16:04.380 --> 16:08.283
so to speak,
will contribute to our effectiveness. 


16:08.283 --> 16:10.785
When we show interest
in our assigned work, 


16:10.785 --> 16:14.000
we become even more effective
fellow workers of Jehovah.


16:15.690 --> 16:20.000
Let’s read as Jonathan prepares
to take action against the Philistines. 


16:21.463 --> 16:24.098
First Samuel 14:6 states:


16:24.098 --> 16:26.801
“So Jonathan said to his armor-bearer:


16:26.802 --> 16:31.640
“‘Come and let us cross over 
to the outpost of these uncircumcised men. 


16:31.640 --> 16:34.643
“‘Perhaps Jehovah will act in our behalf, 


16:34.643 --> 16:40.415
for nothing can hinder Jehovah
from saving by many or by few.’”


16:40.415 --> 16:43.000
What contributed
to his confidence in Jehovah? 


16:44.185 --> 16:47.555
Recall that he put faith
in Jehovah’s reassuring words


16:47.555 --> 16:51.493
through the prophet Samuel: 
“Do not be afraid. . . . 


16:51.493 --> 16:56.000
For the sake of his great name,
Jehovah will not abandon his people.” 


16:57.767 --> 16:59.835
He experienced Jehovah’s support 


16:59.835 --> 17:03.000
when he struck down
the Philistine garrison at Geba. 


17:04.272 --> 17:07.000
Jonathan could also
think back on Israel’s history. 


17:08.243 --> 17:11.280
He could reflect
on how Gideon and his 300 men


17:11.280 --> 17:16.685
were victorious over 135,000 Midianites. 


17:16.685 --> 17:20.822
He could meditate
on Samson killing 1,000 Philistines


17:20.822 --> 17:23.000
with the jawbone of a donkey. 


17:24.560 --> 17:27.562
Such examples 
would bolster his confidence


17:27.562 --> 17:31.000
that he was working 
with the Almighty God, Jehovah.


17:33.135 --> 17:37.438
We too can meditate on fellow workers
of God recorded in the Scriptures


17:37.438 --> 17:42.745
as well as published life stories
of modern-day faithful servants. 


17:42.745 --> 17:45.880
Such examples
reinforce our faith in Jehovah


17:45.880 --> 17:48.000
as we rely on him for success.


17:50.418 --> 17:54.021
Another lesson comes from the response
of Jonathan’s armor-bearer


17:54.022 --> 17:56.892
at 1 Samuel 14:7: 


17:56.892 --> 17:59.729
“At this his armor-bearer said to him:


17:59.728 --> 18:02.931
“‘Do whatever your heart impels you to do. 


18:02.932 --> 18:05.167
“‘Turn wherever you wish, 


18:05.167 --> 18:09.539
and I will follow you 
wherever your heart impels you.’”


18:09.538 --> 18:11.740
It is unlikely that the attendant


18:11.740 --> 18:14.000
would have initiated
this challenging mission on his own. 


18:15.777 --> 18:20.000
Jonathan’s confident lead was a positive, 
motivating influence on the man. 


18:22.117 --> 18:25.054
What happens today
when elders and overseers


18:25.053 --> 18:30.691
take the lead and display zeal
in Jehovah’s work like Jonathan? 


18:30.692 --> 18:36.000
Others in the congregation are also
motivated to action by their fine example.


18:37.565 --> 18:40.468
Let us now read verses 8-10:


18:40.468 --> 18:42.938
“Then Jonathan said:


18:42.938 --> 18:47.608
“‘We will cross over to those men
and reveal our presence to them. 


18:47.608 --> 18:51.980
“‘If they say to us,
“Stand still until we come to you!” 


18:51.980 --> 18:55.217
“‘we will stand where we are
and not go up to them. 


18:55.217 --> 18:58.787
“‘But if they say, “Come up against us!” 


18:58.787 --> 19:03.559
“‘we will go up, because Jehovah 
will give them into our hand. 


19:03.558 --> 19:06.395
This will be our sign.’”


19:06.395 --> 19:10.000
Jonathan once again demonstrated
humble reliance on Jehovah.


19:11.167 --> 19:13.169
Later in Second Samuel, 


19:13.168 --> 19:16.371
Jonathan is described
as “swifter than the eagles”


19:16.372 --> 19:19.340
and “mightier than the lions.” 


19:19.340 --> 19:23.378
However, these qualities
and abilities did not cause him


19:23.378 --> 19:27.415
to be self-reliant or overconfident. 


19:27.415 --> 19:31.000
He sought Jehovah’s direction
by means of a sign. 


19:32.587 --> 19:35.357
What a powerful reminder for us! 


19:35.357 --> 19:38.260
Regardless of any natural abilities,


19:38.260 --> 19:41.563
acquired skills,
or experience we may have,


19:41.563 --> 19:46.968
the key to success is seeking
Jehovah’s guidance and support. 


19:46.968 --> 19:50.371
We seek his direction
through specific prayers, 


19:50.372 --> 19:52.975
Bible reading and meditation, 


19:52.975 --> 19:56.000
and applying direction
from “the faithful and discreet slave.” 


19:58.147 --> 20:01.417
We also consult 
with longtime faithful brothers and sisters 


20:01.417 --> 20:05.000
who can share their rich experience
as God’s fellow workers.


20:07.388 --> 20:11.393
One such example was Sister Joey Orrom, 


20:11.393 --> 20:14.730
who served in the Britain branch. 


20:14.730 --> 20:18.733
She shared her experiences 
in an archived interview 


20:18.733 --> 20:24.471
some time before finishing 
her earthly course in 2011. 


20:24.472 --> 20:28.010
Listen also to the comments 
of her fellow workers in Britain 


20:28.010 --> 20:31.000
who benefited from their time together.


20:35.417 --> 20:37.419
I had the privilege for two years


20:37.418 --> 20:40.321
of sitting at the same table
as Sister Orrom for morning worship. 


20:40.322 --> 20:42.959
She expected nothing and appreciated


20:42.958 --> 20:44.593
everything that you did for her.


20:44.593 --> 20:48.096
Sister Orrom
was affectionately known as Joey. 


20:48.097 --> 20:50.432
And if you take the “e” out of Joey, 


20:50.432 --> 20:53.635
you’re left with the English word “joy,”


20:53.635 --> 20:55.303
and that summed her up. 


20:55.303 --> 20:57.838
My impression of Joey
when I first met her


20:57.838 --> 21:00.441
was here is this frail old lady. 


21:00.442 --> 21:03.379
But then when you
started to speak to Joey, 


21:03.378 --> 21:06.615
you were tapping
into a tremendous depth.


21:06.615 --> 21:08.217
About the age of 20, 


21:08.217 --> 21:09.384
round about that time,


21:09.383 --> 21:11.018
I had the heavenly calling. 


21:11.018 --> 21:12.553
That was a big battle. 


21:12.553 --> 21:16.591
I couldn’t understand why Jehovah
would use a person like me. 


21:16.592 --> 21:19.160
And when I was 21,


21:19.160 --> 21:21.863
I got into pioneering, in 1939. 


21:21.863 --> 21:23.931
But the police were after me


21:23.932 --> 21:27.735
because I wouldn’t join the armed forces,
and I was tried under a new act. 


21:27.735 --> 21:30.305
And they kept taking me
into a side room and saying,


21:30.305 --> 21:32.940
“If you will say you are not connected
with Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


21:32.940 --> 21:36.143
not connected with the Watch Tower,
you’ll have a walk away.” 


21:36.143 --> 21:38.546
I said: “I am connected
with the Watch Tower. 


21:38.547 --> 21:40.749
I’m proud to be connected
with the Watch Tower.” 


21:40.748 --> 21:44.151
And they said,
“Then they are directing you.” 


21:44.152 --> 21:49.057
I said, “No, my stand of not doing
as you wish is my own personal stand.” 


21:49.057 --> 21:50.159
So this went on. 


21:50.158 --> 21:52.893
In the end, they sent me
to prison just for two months 


21:52.893 --> 21:54.228
and then let me out. 


21:54.228 --> 21:56.230
I partnered with another sister, 


21:56.230 --> 21:59.835
and she and I went to Northern Ireland 


21:59.835 --> 22:01.570
and pioneered there for 18 months. 


22:01.570 --> 22:03.838
And it was in Northern Ireland
that we had our call to Gilead.


22:03.838 --> 22:06.541
In 1948, Joey was invited to Gilead, 


22:06.542 --> 22:08.910
and that was the 11th class.


22:08.910 --> 22:12.680
It left an impression on me, 
which I will never ever, ever forget. 


22:12.680 --> 22:16.183
You pick up that spirit 
of good behavior, of love. 


22:16.183 --> 22:18.786
It’s something that leaves
its mark, or it should. 


22:18.787 --> 22:22.157
It has left its mark on me
—very, very much so. 


22:22.157 --> 22:24.625
One thing Brother Knorr impressed on us:


22:24.625 --> 22:28.863
“You’ll be three years on your assignment
before you really love it.” 


22:28.863 --> 22:31.533
And it was true 
because it was a hard assignment.


22:31.533 --> 22:35.070
After Gilead, 
she was assigned to be a missionary


22:35.070 --> 22:37.072
in Dublin,
in the Irish Republic. 


22:37.072 --> 22:39.809
That was the time when Catholic priests


22:39.808 --> 22:42.876
used to organize mobs against the pioneers. 


22:42.877 --> 22:44.914
She was full of joy, 
but that didn’t mean to say


22:44.913 --> 22:46.615
that she’d had an easy life.


22:46.615 --> 22:49.150
We never went out from door to door
without being mobbed


22:49.150 --> 22:52.320
and attacked and beaten up
and thrown around. 


22:52.320 --> 22:54.957
And you could only do
a few houses in a row, 


22:54.957 --> 22:57.025
and you’d have to get away very quickly. 


22:57.025 --> 22:58.760
But we made a very good name. 


22:58.760 --> 23:01.062
People got to know
we were completely neutral.


23:01.062 --> 23:04.734
They chose four of us
to work the business property, 


23:04.733 --> 23:06.968
and I got some studies
going in their offices. 


23:06.968 --> 23:10.971
But one place I went into,
I walked the length of this draper shop,


23:10.972 --> 23:14.009
and I asked if I could go
into the manager’s office. 


23:14.008 --> 23:16.678
As I went in, I didn’t say a word. 


23:16.678 --> 23:19.146
I didn’t open my mouth
and even say good morning, 


23:19.147 --> 23:22.184
but this man stood up,
and he said, “Russellite!” 


23:22.183 --> 23:25.186
And he took hold of me
by the scruff of my neck


23:25.187 --> 23:27.655
and the seat of my pants,
and he lifted me up


23:27.655 --> 23:30.625
and he carried me
the length of the store. 


23:30.625 --> 23:35.163
Well, like a silly one,
I should’ve gone heavy on him, you see. 


23:35.163 --> 23:37.298
But instead of that, 
I let my legs paddle


23:37.298 --> 23:40.301
and I was hanging onto my book bag,
not wanting to lose it. 


23:40.302 --> 23:42.937
And when he got 
to the front door, the staff, 


23:42.937 --> 23:45.507
their eyes were absolutely aghast
at what was happening. 


23:45.507 --> 23:48.210
He opened his front door
and threw me out, literally. 


23:48.210 --> 23:51.045
And I went zoom!
just managed to go zoom! 


23:51.045 --> 23:54.215
And one of the brothers was passing,


23:54.215 --> 23:56.818
and he caught me
—caught me steady—


23:56.818 --> 23:58.220
and said, 
“Whatever is going on?” 


23:58.220 --> 24:00.222
And I couldn’t stop laughing. 


24:00.222 --> 24:02.224
To me it was very, very funny. 


24:02.223 --> 24:05.660
The rest were so cross about it,
but I wasn’t at all cross. 


24:05.660 --> 24:07.162
I thought it was quite hilarious. 


24:07.162 --> 24:10.699
I could see myself being carried
through this shop sky-high. 


24:10.698 --> 24:12.466
Things like that happened.


24:12.467 --> 24:15.270
These experiences 
did not dampen her zeal. 


24:15.270 --> 24:18.307
She always retained that missionary spirit.


24:18.307 --> 24:20.042
I first met Joey


24:20.042 --> 24:21.477
when I was commuting to Bethel


24:21.477 --> 24:23.044
in the infirmary.


24:23.043 --> 24:27.681
She was sitting on that old-fashioned chair
with this huge Bible,


24:27.682 --> 24:31.654
and she stayed there hours reading the Bible,


24:31.653 --> 24:32.853
praying to Jehovah.


24:32.853 --> 24:35.756
Often, when you came in, 
she’d be in the middle of Bible reading. 


24:35.757 --> 24:37.392
And she’d be saying something like,


24:37.392 --> 24:39.594
“Daniel has just been thrown
into the lion’s den!” 


24:39.593 --> 24:41.596
or “Oh, Jehovah is really angry. 


24:41.597 --> 24:43.399
He’s thundering from the heavens!” 


24:43.398 --> 24:44.598
And it made me think, ‘Wow! 


24:44.598 --> 24:46.701
‘She must have read
the Bible so many times,


24:46.702 --> 24:49.804
but every time it was as if it was
happening right in front of her.’


24:49.803 --> 24:53.040
Right up until she became incapacitated,


24:53.040 --> 24:55.243
she was conducting Bible studies


24:55.243 --> 24:57.911
and helping people
to come to know Jehovah.


24:57.912 --> 25:01.049
She was looking forward
to her heavenly reward. 


25:01.048 --> 25:04.551
And for her that was the culmination


25:04.552 --> 25:06.789
of a life of joy in Jehovah’s service


25:06.788 --> 25:10.358
and that she was just transferring
to her next assignment.


25:10.358 --> 25:12.226
I’m very, very grateful for work. 


25:12.227 --> 25:14.129
In fact, often in my prayers,


25:14.128 --> 25:16.998
I’ll pray to Jehovah that I’ll have
some good work to do today. 


25:16.998 --> 25:20.000
I’m very grateful to have work to do.


25:26.240 --> 25:29.010
Similar to what we 
learned about Jonathan, 


25:29.010 --> 25:33.782
Sister Orrom demonstrated 
humble reliance on Jehovah.


25:33.782 --> 25:36.384
So sure was her trust in God 


25:36.383 --> 25:39.020
that she could face even fearful situations 


25:39.020 --> 25:41.388
with a sense of humor. 


25:41.388 --> 25:44.893
We may not be able to laugh 
when enduring persecution, 


25:44.893 --> 25:49.000
but we can imitate Joey’s faith 
and firm resolve.


25:50.298 --> 25:53.000
What else can we learn
from Jonathan’s account? 


25:54.668 --> 25:58.806
Picking up at 1 Samuel 14:12, 


25:58.807 --> 26:03.000
Jonathan and his armor-bearer
advance toward the Philistines. 


26:04.212 --> 26:08.517
From their elevated location,
the Philistines shout to them: 


26:08.517 --> 26:12.454
“‘Come up to us,
and we will teach you a lesson!’ 


26:12.453 --> 26:15.856
“At once Jonathan said to his armor-bearer:


26:15.857 --> 26:20.000
“‘Follow me, for Jehovah will give them
into the hand of Israel.’”


26:21.462 --> 26:25.700
Jonathan had requested a specific sign,
and he got it. 


26:25.700 --> 26:30.005
But it meant advancing 
up a steep and treacherous incline 


26:30.005 --> 26:33.140
right into enemy hands. 


26:33.140 --> 26:36.745
Someone lacking complete trust 
in Jehovah might have said,


26:36.745 --> 26:41.582
“Before proceeding,
perhaps we should ask for another sign,” 


26:41.582 --> 26:44.019
but not Jonathan. 


26:44.018 --> 26:47.588
Without hesitation,
he told his attendant to follow him 


26:47.588 --> 26:51.826
because Jehovah would give
the enemy into their hand. 


26:51.827 --> 26:54.129
When we receive Jehovah’s direction, 


26:54.128 --> 26:57.931
we should without hesitation
put our hearts into the work, 


26:57.932 --> 27:00.000
confident of Jehovah’s backing.


27:01.637 --> 27:03.639
What happened next? 


27:03.638 --> 27:08.476
First Samuel 14:13, 14 reports:


27:08.477 --> 27:12.747
“And Jonathan climbed up
on his hands and feet, 


27:12.747 --> 27:15.684
“and his armor-bearer was behind him;


27:15.683 --> 27:19.086
“and the Philistines began
to fall before Jonathan,


27:19.087 --> 27:22.557
“and his armor-bearer was putting 
them to death behind him. 


27:22.557 --> 27:26.360
“In the first attack that Jonathan
and his armor-bearer made,


27:26.360 --> 27:29.897
they struck down about 20 men.” 


27:29.897 --> 27:32.900
Even after receiving
a clear sign from Jehovah, 


27:32.900 --> 27:34.902
it took great effort. 


27:34.902 --> 27:38.340
They had to ‘climb up
on their hands and feet,’


27:38.340 --> 27:42.877
exerting themselves
vigorously over rugged terrain. 


27:42.877 --> 27:44.912
The lesson? 


27:44.912 --> 27:49.517
Even when we receive clear direction
and are ready to obey, 


27:49.517 --> 27:53.000
carrying out our assignments
will not always be easy. 


27:54.022 --> 27:56.490
We have to exert ourselves vigorously, 


27:56.490 --> 28:01.000
being willing to work hard 
with all of our mind, heart, and strength.


28:03.097 --> 28:07.000
How did the Philistines react to seeing
Jehovah’s support for his people? 


28:08.002 --> 28:10.439
First Samuel 14:15 reads:


28:10.438 --> 28:13.741
“Then terror spread in the field camp 


28:13.742 --> 28:16.310
“and among all the people of the outpost, 


28:16.310 --> 28:19.580
“and even the raiding parties were terrified. 


28:19.580 --> 28:24.000
The earth began quaking, 
and a terror from God ensued.”


28:25.120 --> 28:29.390
The earthquake Jehovah caused
melted the Philistines’ hearts. 


28:29.390 --> 28:33.828
Soon, the Israelites, even those 
who had previously fled in fear,


28:33.828 --> 28:37.000
joined the victory battle
over the Philistines. 


28:38.098 --> 28:42.436
Likewise, when we put our hearts 
into theocratic assignments,


28:42.437 --> 28:46.140
Jehovah, our best Fellow Worker,


28:46.140 --> 28:51.000
will always come through with whatever
we need to accomplish his will.


28:52.180 --> 28:56.885
But there is another lesson to be learned
from this exciting Bible account. 


28:56.885 --> 28:58.887
During the height of the battle, 


28:58.887 --> 29:02.000
King Saul gave an unwise order saying:


29:03.157 --> 29:06.795
“Cursed is the man who eats
any food before the evening


29:06.795 --> 29:10.000
and until I have taken 
vengeance on my enemies!” 


29:11.298 --> 29:15.236
Jonathan, however, was not aware
of his father’s order


29:15.237 --> 29:18.000
and ate some wild honey 
that he had found.


29:19.373 --> 29:25.913
How did Saul react when he discovered
that his own son had disobeyed him? 


29:25.913 --> 29:30.518
First Samuel 14:43, 44 tells us: 


29:30.518 --> 29:33.420
“Then Saul said to Jonathan:


29:33.420 --> 29:36.223
“‘Tell me, what have you done?’ 


29:36.223 --> 29:38.760
“So Jonathan told him:


29:38.760 --> 29:43.000
“‘I merely tasted a little honey
on the tip of the staff in my hand. 


29:44.065 --> 29:47.568
“Here I am! 
I am ready to die!’ 


29:47.568 --> 29:49.770
“At this Saul said:


29:49.770 --> 29:52.973
“‘Thus may God do and may he add to it


29:52.973 --> 29:55.000
if you do not die, Jonathan.’”


29:56.043 --> 29:59.513
Imagine, after all that Jonathan had done


29:59.513 --> 30:02.516
in risking his life in behalf of his people


30:02.517 --> 30:05.720
and seeing Jehovah grant so much success, 


30:05.720 --> 30:10.000
he is now being condemned
to death by his own father. 


30:11.125 --> 30:14.795
How his heart must have sank in disbelief, 


30:14.795 --> 30:18.000
disappointment, and sadness!


30:19.533 --> 30:23.203
Would Jehovah now abandon 
his loyal fellow worker? 


30:23.203 --> 30:26.806
First Samuel 14:45 reads:


30:26.807 --> 30:29.810
“But the people said to Saul: 


30:29.810 --> 30:32.013
“‘Should Jonathan die


30:32.013 --> 30:34.948
“‘—the one who brought
this great victory to Israel? 


30:34.948 --> 30:36.951
“‘It is unthinkable! 


30:36.952 --> 30:39.454
“‘As surely as Jehovah is alive, 


30:39.453 --> 30:42.690
“‘not even a single hair of his head
should fall to the ground, 


30:42.690 --> 30:46.000
“for it was with God that he acted this day.’ 


30:47.595 --> 30:52.000
With that the people rescued Jonathan,
and he did not die.” 


30:53.067 --> 30:56.872
Jonathan’s success
provided undeniable evidence


30:56.872 --> 30:59.000
that he was truly Jehovah’s fellow worker. 


31:00.575 --> 31:04.478
Jehovah, who had been
at Jonathan’s side the whole time, 


31:04.478 --> 31:06.881
saw everything that had happened


31:06.882 --> 31:11.000
and would not allow his loyal worker
to die at Saul’s hands.


31:12.653 --> 31:16.925
How comforting to know that when we
faithfully carry out our assignments,


31:16.925 --> 31:20.795
he will never forget our zealous efforts! 


31:20.795 --> 31:23.130
If someone as close as a father


31:23.130 --> 31:27.002
fails to see and appreciate 
the work we do in Jehovah’s service


31:27.002 --> 31:32.707
or even turns against us,
Jehovah will never forget our work. 


31:32.707 --> 31:35.175
He will always be there to guide, 


31:35.175 --> 31:39.000
support, protect, and bless us.


31:40.013 --> 31:42.016
What a faith-building account 


31:42.017 --> 31:46.487
we’ve considered 
in 1 Samuel chapters 13 and 14! 


31:46.487 --> 31:50.559
Why not take the time
to read these chapters for yourself? 


31:50.558 --> 31:54.695
You’ll be moved to imitate
Jonathan’s excellent example of loyalty,


31:54.695 --> 31:57.000
courage, and obedience. 


31:58.565 --> 32:03.570
We want to be described 
just as Jonathan was at 1 Samuel 14:45:


32:03.570 --> 32:07.000
“For it was with God
that he acted this day.” 


32:08.342 --> 32:11.845
By continuing 
as industrious fellow workers with Jehovah, 


32:11.845 --> 32:14.948
we are assured
that ‘through faith and patience 


32:14.948 --> 32:17.000
we will inherit the promised reward.’


32:20.422 --> 32:24.000
Let’s look at another example 
of modern-day fellow workers with God. 


32:25.660 --> 32:28.162
Assembly Hall servants 
care for the cleaning 


32:28.162 --> 32:31.165
and maintenance 
of these places of worship, 


32:31.165 --> 32:34.202
but they don’t do this work alone. 


32:34.202 --> 32:37.339
In this report from the United States, 


32:37.338 --> 32:40.040
we’ll see how the work is organized, 


32:40.040 --> 32:42.443
and we’ll hear how 
our brothers and sisters 


32:42.443 --> 32:46.000
feel about being able 
to help with the work.


32:47.982 --> 32:50.585
The Assembly Hall is an educational center. 


32:50.585 --> 32:55.000
This is a center of pure worship 
for all the congregations that come. 


32:57.392 --> 32:59.194
Taking care of Jehovah’s house 


32:59.193 --> 33:01.061
is part of sacred service. 


33:01.062 --> 33:03.832
Even going back to the temple, 


33:03.832 --> 33:05.834
everyone had an assignment. 


33:05.833 --> 33:07.935
They had someone to open the doors. 


33:07.935 --> 33:11.000
So, of course, they also had 
somebody maintaining things.


33:13.307 --> 33:16.010
As of December 2016, 


33:16.010 --> 33:19.747
there are 773 Assembly Halls worldwide. 


33:19.747 --> 33:21.915
There are so many details 
at an Assembly Hall; 


33:21.915 --> 33:23.785
you can’t do it all yourself. 


33:23.785 --> 33:25.000
To be overseer of an Assembly Hall— 


33:26.520 --> 33:31.000
We were excited to do it, 
but it seemed real heavy at the time.


33:35.062 --> 33:36.730
It does take, 


33:36.730 --> 33:38.933
in our particular case, a couple of hundred. 


33:38.933 --> 33:41.601
There are about 200 or so volunteers 


33:41.602 --> 33:44.139
each and every week 


33:44.138 --> 33:46.773
that really are necessary 


33:46.773 --> 33:49.276
to care for the Assembly Hall
—the grounds, 


33:49.277 --> 33:51.845
the accounting, the purchasing, 


33:51.845 --> 33:53.613
the maintenance,


33:53.613 --> 33:55.281
and the cleaning. 


33:55.282 --> 33:58.285
Each and every one of these chairs
—the seating—


33:58.285 --> 34:01.788
all have moving parts 
and have to be maintained. 


34:01.788 --> 34:05.258
And with 4,050 seats in here, 


34:05.258 --> 34:10.000
we can say that every single one 
of them has been maintained.


34:12.233 --> 34:16.436
John 2:17 says: 
“The zeal for your house will consume me.” 


34:16.437 --> 34:19.740
And I think we have 
an opportunity to show Jehovah that


34:19.740 --> 34:24.212
—that we have zeal, 
we have an eagerness, a fire for his house, 


34:24.212 --> 34:26.580
and for caring for it. 


34:26.580 --> 34:29.000
So we appreciate all those 
who want to work at the Assembly Hall.


34:30.485 --> 34:33.653
So many of the dear friends, 
after they just spent a whole day 


34:33.653 --> 34:38.158
doing some terribly dirty job, 
they thank you for the privilege. 


34:38.158 --> 34:40.795
Well, that’s zeal for Jehovah’s house. 


34:40.795 --> 34:42.797
Nowhere else does that happen. 


34:42.797 --> 34:45.467
And if we tried to do it ourselves 
or if we hired somebody, 


34:45.467 --> 34:49.000
it wouldn’t be as good as the work 
that the friends do when they come in.


34:50.337 --> 34:52.440
When the friends come on the weekend, 


34:52.440 --> 34:54.442
this is an educational facility. 


34:54.442 --> 34:55.444
So they come here 


34:55.443 --> 34:57.645
to be educated about Jehovah. 


34:57.645 --> 34:59.780
And new ones come, 


34:59.780 --> 35:01.882
and it needs to be dignified 


35:01.882 --> 35:05.520
and reflect Jehovah’s qualities. 


35:05.520 --> 35:09.623
So the cleaning that goes on 
and the maintenance that goes on


35:09.623 --> 35:12.000
—that’s what the purpose is.


35:14.195 --> 35:17.565
At lunchtime, we do a spiritual program. 


35:17.565 --> 35:21.302
It could be a talk; 
it could be a discussion. 


35:21.302 --> 35:25.239
And we, really, 
generally try to cover a topic 


35:25.238 --> 35:27.708
that helps the volunteers 
see the connection 


35:27.708 --> 35:30.778
between their work 
at the Assembly Hall 


35:30.778 --> 35:33.113
and the Kingdom preaching work.


35:33.113 --> 35:34.081
We are preachers. 


35:34.082 --> 35:37.319
That’s number one
—to spread the good news. 


35:37.318 --> 35:40.320
And we see the results of that here. 


35:40.320 --> 35:43.000
We’re filling this place up.


35:51.532 --> 35:53.534
It’s a real privilege. 


35:53.533 --> 35:57.905
You learn so much 
from the sacrifices that the friends make 


35:57.905 --> 36:00.373
in order to serve Jehovah 


36:00.373 --> 36:03.845
that it makes us feel very small, 
and we realize 


36:03.845 --> 36:08.348
what a blessing it is for us to be 
in that environment all the time.


36:08.348 --> 36:10.450
The goal of any work in Jehovah’s service 


36:10.450 --> 36:12.587
is to help as many people as you can 


36:12.587 --> 36:13.587
to come to know him 


36:13.587 --> 36:15.857
and to take care of his interests


36:15.857 --> 36:16.857
here on the earth. 


36:16.857 --> 36:18.592
And we all have the same goal


36:18.592 --> 36:21.000
—trying to please him 
and doing what we can.


36:25.298 --> 36:29.536
Our goal, really, as Assembly Hall servants 


36:29.537 --> 36:34.142
is to take care of the place in such a way


36:34.142 --> 36:37.245
—take care of the Assembly Hall 
in such a way—


36:37.245 --> 36:40.648
that not only saves and makes wise use 


36:40.648 --> 36:43.450
of dedicated funds and resources 


36:43.450 --> 36:46.353
but also makes things ready 
in such a way 


36:46.353 --> 36:48.990
that on Saturday morning 
when the brothers and sisters walk in 


36:48.990 --> 36:51.092
and the attendants and the sound 


36:51.092 --> 36:53.227
and the stage brothers are getting ready, 


36:53.227 --> 36:56.730
all they really have to do 
is come on in and flip the switches


36:56.730 --> 36:59.233
—lights come on, air conditioning, heat. 


36:59.233 --> 37:00.768
Everything is functioning. 


37:00.768 --> 37:03.636
All they have to do 
is just focus on the program 


37:03.637 --> 37:06.407
and listen and take in instruction. 


37:06.407 --> 37:09.777
That’s what we’re asked to do
—listen and take in instruction. 


37:09.777 --> 37:12.780
And we can do that when we’re 
not distracted by anything else. 


37:12.780 --> 37:14.615
So if everything 


37:14.615 --> 37:16.783
works well on an assembly day, 


37:16.783 --> 37:20.000
we know we’ve done our job.


37:23.958 --> 37:26.493
We can remember 
these hard-working brothers and sisters 


37:26.493 --> 37:28.495
in our prayers, 


37:28.495 --> 37:31.098
and we can do our part to help them. 


37:31.098 --> 37:33.700
If possible, volunteer to assist 


37:33.700 --> 37:35.970
with your congregation’s 
cleaning assignment 


37:35.970 --> 37:37.972
at your next assembly. 


37:37.972 --> 37:42.977
Or ask about the arrangement 
for maintaining Assembly Halls in your area. 


37:42.977 --> 37:45.847
A few are needed to take the lead, 


37:45.847 --> 37:49.000
but they need our help 
to get the work done.


37:50.150 --> 37:54.522
The same is true with the great amount 
of work in the congregation. 


37:54.522 --> 37:56.924
In our discussion about Jonathan, 


37:56.923 --> 38:00.000
we mentioned 
the zealous example of our elders. 


38:01.728 --> 38:03.730
Are the elders “leaders” 


38:03.730 --> 38:05.933
or do they “take the lead”? 


38:05.933 --> 38:07.935
What’s the difference? 


38:07.935 --> 38:11.000
Brother Geoffrey Jackson explains 
in this Bethel morning worship.


38:12.507 --> 38:15.575
While meditating on the text this morning,


38:15.575 --> 38:17.578
I was reminded of an experience 


38:17.578 --> 38:20.013
I had many years ago as a missionary. 


38:20.013 --> 38:20.848
At the time,


38:20.848 --> 38:23.116
I was studying with a young man


38:23.117 --> 38:25.119
who was training to be a pastor


38:25.118 --> 38:26.820
in his church.


38:26.820 --> 38:31.492
This man had got to the point
where he started to attend all our meetings


38:31.492 --> 38:35.000
while at the same time
still attending his church gatherings. 


38:36.297 --> 38:38.799
The church, obviously,
was very disturbed


38:38.798 --> 38:42.068
about the fact that he was coming
to the meetings of Jehovah’s Witnesses,


38:42.068 --> 38:45.438
and their headquarters
sent in a missionary from overseas 


38:45.438 --> 38:47.941
to try and rectify the situation. 


38:47.942 --> 38:50.210
The young man told me what happened. 


38:50.210 --> 38:52.212
He said the missionary asked him, 


38:52.212 --> 38:55.549
“What is it that impresses you
about Jehovah’s Witnesses?” 


38:55.548 --> 39:00.086
He said, “Well, one of the things is
that they do the preaching work.” 


39:00.087 --> 39:04.692
The missionary replied, 
“Well, our church can do that too.” 


39:04.692 --> 39:08.129
So the next time they had a service, 


39:08.128 --> 39:12.833
the missionary conducted the service 
and with great zeal and enthusiasm 


39:12.833 --> 39:17.036
demanded that everyone in the church
take part in the preaching work. 


39:17.037 --> 39:21.042
He announced the time that they
would have the group to go preaching. 


39:21.042 --> 39:24.179
The young man told me 
quite a number of people came along. 


39:24.178 --> 39:28.515
But there was just one thing missing,
you guessed it, the missionary. 


39:28.515 --> 39:30.852
He felt that it was enough


39:30.852 --> 39:35.000
just to encourage everybody else
to do it without engaging in it himself. 


39:36.423 --> 39:41.428
How different was the example
of Jesus and of our hard-working elders


39:41.428 --> 39:45.065
who do take the lead
with regard to the preaching work.


39:45.065 --> 39:49.070
Now let’s take our Bibles
and turn to a very interesting scripture


39:49.070 --> 39:54.075
in Hebrews 13:7, 17. 


39:54.075 --> 39:58.245
Now, I’d like to highlight the beauty
of the New World Translation 


39:58.245 --> 40:00.280
in these two verses. 


40:00.280 --> 40:02.617
You see at the beginning of verse 7:


40:02.617 --> 40:05.987
“Remember those
who are taking the lead among you.” 


40:05.987 --> 40:07.989
And then verse 17:


40:07.988 --> 40:11.000
“Be obedient to those
who are taking the lead among you.” 


40:12.693 --> 40:16.196
If you look at other Bibles,
whether new or old,


40:16.197 --> 40:19.500
most of them say “your leaders.” 


40:19.500 --> 40:23.303
Now, obviously,
the New World Translation Committee 


40:23.303 --> 40:26.240
had in mind Jesus’ comments with regard


40:26.240 --> 40:29.143
to no one being a leader among us,


40:29.143 --> 40:32.278
and although it’s a different
word in the Greek text, 


40:32.278 --> 40:36.550
still in English we can’t help
but be sensitive to that matter. 


40:36.550 --> 40:40.553
And so this accurate translation
of saying “taking the lead”


40:40.553 --> 40:45.158
really summarizes, doesn’t it,
what the role is of an elder. 


40:45.158 --> 40:49.061
We’re not leaders, 
but we set the right example.


40:49.062 --> 40:53.700
Now, this accurate translation
is also portrayed


40:53.700 --> 40:58.372
in the words of our Lord Jesus Christ 
as recorded in Luke chapter 22, 


40:58.372 --> 41:01.142
and you’ll be interested to note


41:01.142 --> 41:05.545
that this is part of the revision
of the New World Translation text. 


41:05.545 --> 41:10.483
Luke 22:26, 
it now portrays accurately


41:10.483 --> 41:13.986
the fact that both expressions in Hebrew 


41:13.987 --> 41:17.424
and this one here are the same word. 


41:17.423 --> 41:21.595
So, Luke 22:26,


41:21.595 --> 41:25.332
it says: 
“You, though, are not to be that way. 


41:25.332 --> 41:29.770
But let the one who is the greatest
among you become as the youngest.” 


41:29.770 --> 41:33.140
And then notice: 
“and the one taking the lead,” 


41:33.140 --> 41:36.043
now this is the same expression
as in the Hebrews, 


41:36.043 --> 41:39.078
“as the one ministering.” 


41:39.078 --> 41:44.083
So, obviously,
to take the lead means to do the work,


41:44.083 --> 41:48.021
to be a minister,
to be a servant, to serve others.


41:48.022 --> 41:50.657
This also reminds me, 
many years ago,


41:50.657 --> 41:55.662
when I worked with the translation team
in the Pacific nation of Samoa. 


41:55.662 --> 41:59.567
At that point, we were trying to select
an accurate expression


41:59.567 --> 42:02.770
to convey this thought of “taking the lead.” 


42:02.770 --> 42:05.738
And there were two words eventually
that the brothers


42:05.738 --> 42:08.641
were trying to select between, 
or choose between. 


42:08.642 --> 42:11.745
One was the word ta’ita’i
and the other ta’imua. 


42:11.745 --> 42:14.215
Now, you don’t have
to remember those words,


42:14.215 --> 42:18.085
but as a foreigner,
I didn’t really understand


42:18.085 --> 42:20.988
the subtleties between
the difference of the two words. 


42:20.988 --> 42:23.623
So I asked the brothers, 
“How can you explain to me 


42:23.623 --> 42:25.791
what these two words mean?” 


42:25.792 --> 42:28.862
So one of the brothers was very eloquent. 


42:28.862 --> 42:32.900
He said: “Well, just imagine
a procession, a parade. 


42:32.900 --> 42:36.337
“So a ta’ita’i is the old man who sits


42:36.337 --> 42:39.274
“on the side of the road
barking out the orders: 


42:39.273 --> 42:41.908
“‘You should do it this way;
you should do it that way.’ 


42:41.908 --> 42:46.780
“The ta’imua, on the other hand, 
is the one right in the front of the parade


42:46.780 --> 42:49.817
taking the lead
and everyone’s following him.” 


42:49.817 --> 42:52.820
Which word do you think we selected?


42:52.820 --> 42:57.825
Doesn’t that summarize nicely just exactly
what’s involved with being an elder? 


42:57.825 --> 43:01.562
It’s not a matter of sitting
on the sidelines barking out orders


43:01.562 --> 43:03.564
but getting involved,


43:03.563 --> 43:06.700
setting the right example,
and then others following. 


43:06.700 --> 43:09.603
And this is in harmony
with one Greek lexicon


43:09.603 --> 43:12.505
that describes
this expression this way, it says, 


43:12.505 --> 43:15.475
“The concept of leading can be expressed


43:15.475 --> 43:18.278
“by showing how to do something, 


43:18.278 --> 43:20.680
“demonstrating how we ought to do it, 


43:20.680 --> 43:23.383
and going ahead showing the way.”


43:23.383 --> 43:27.186
Of course, on the other hand,
some religions even view


43:27.187 --> 43:30.190
the expression “elder” as a title. 


43:30.190 --> 43:33.193
You’ve probably heard of them
introducing themselves,


43:33.193 --> 43:36.096
“Good morning, I’m Elder Jackson.” 


43:36.097 --> 43:38.799
Well, of course,
none of us would want to view


43:38.798 --> 43:43.070
being an elder as a title
in the sense of a position


43:43.070 --> 43:45.172
that lords it over others. 


43:45.172 --> 43:48.875
And with that in mind,
another subtlety to the revision


43:48.875 --> 43:51.712
is seen in 1 Timothy chapter 3, 


43:51.712 --> 43:54.549
so please turn there with me, 


43:54.548 --> 43:58.418
1 Timothy 3:1. 


43:58.418 --> 44:01.155
These are well-known words


44:01.155 --> 44:06.160
—particularly when brothers are considering
the qualifications for elders—


44:06.160 --> 44:09.095
but you may or may not have seen


44:09.095 --> 44:12.867
the subtleties of the change
here in this revision. 


44:12.867 --> 44:17.437
It says now:
“This statement is trustworthy: 


44:17.437 --> 44:20.974
“If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,


44:20.973 --> 44:24.478
he is desirous of a fine work.” 


44:24.478 --> 44:29.483
Do you remember before 
the original New World Translation said:


44:29.483 --> 44:34.355
‘If someone is reaching out 
for the office of being an overseer?’ 


44:34.355 --> 44:37.892
And that reflected
and no doubt was influenced


44:37.892 --> 44:41.562
by the King James 
and many of the older translations


44:41.562 --> 44:44.030
that translated it that way. 


44:44.030 --> 44:46.700
But when we look at the rest of the verse, 


44:46.700 --> 44:50.603
we see that it’s not the office,
or the position, 


44:50.603 --> 44:54.206
of being an overseer
that someone reaches out for;


44:54.207 --> 44:56.277
rather, it’s the work. 


44:56.277 --> 45:00.847
Yes, the hard work that needs 
to be done by an overseer. 


45:00.847 --> 45:04.084
An overseer recognizes


45:04.083 --> 45:08.921
that he needs to work hard
at setting the right example, 


45:08.922 --> 45:10.924
and then others will follow


45:10.923 --> 45:14.360
—rather than just telling
everyone what they should do. 


45:14.360 --> 45:18.165
So when we look at these subtleties
in the New World Translation,


45:18.165 --> 45:21.168
it only helps us to appreciate
it even more, doesn’t it?


45:21.168 --> 45:22.970
So with this in mind,


45:22.970 --> 45:26.840
what does our text this morning
help us to keep in mind? 


45:26.840 --> 45:30.710
Well, as elders, what do we need to do? 


45:30.710 --> 45:35.448
Not sit on the sidelines
barking out orders but, rather, 


45:35.448 --> 45:39.420
to take the lead,
be in the forefront, do the work,


45:39.420 --> 45:41.855
and then others will follow our example,


45:41.855 --> 45:44.000
just as we follow the example of Jesus.


45:45.725 --> 45:48.262
The Bible gives us a clear understanding 


45:48.262 --> 45:51.599
of what Jehovah wants us 
to do in the congregation. 


45:51.598 --> 45:54.535
Elders take the lead by doing the work, 


45:54.535 --> 45:57.000
and we follow their good example.


45:58.338 --> 46:01.675
Applying God’s Word 
contributes to our being fellow workers 


46:01.675 --> 46:04.077
under peaceful conditions. 


46:04.077 --> 46:06.079
But we could be distracted 


46:06.078 --> 46:10.105
even when our brothers 
and sisters are right there with us. 


46:10.105 --> 46:12.485
What are these distractions? 


46:12.485 --> 46:15.000
Let’s see in this music video.


46:24.832 --> 46:30.504
Think—think outside the box.
Be someone who talks.


46:30.503 --> 46:33.606
Don’t waste away behind that tiny screen


46:33.607 --> 46:37.510
’Cause you know 
that there’s much more to life


46:37.510 --> 46:43.250
Than friend requests and likes.
Think of all the things we haven’t seen. 


46:43.250 --> 46:44.350
Well, you—


46:44.350 --> 46:48.788
You’ll never see them
if you’re focused on the superficial.


46:48.788 --> 46:52.391
You need real friends, 
if you know what I mean.


46:52.392 --> 46:56.897
Look at me.
Can you see


46:56.897 --> 47:01.969
What I see?
Around the world, this happy family.


47:01.968 --> 47:05.971
Look at me.
Do you know


47:05.972 --> 47:10.277
What I know?
That you belong. 


47:10.277 --> 47:14.000
Put down the phone, and look at me.


47:17.017 --> 47:22.455
Take—take the time to see.
See what others see.


47:22.455 --> 47:25.958
Don’t trade that plastic box
for all your friends.


47:25.958 --> 47:32.065
You can make friends you know are true,
Who love Jehovah too,


47:32.065 --> 47:35.468
Who’ll stand right 
by your side until the end. 


47:35.468 --> 47:36.436
But, you—


47:36.437 --> 47:40.940
You’ll never meet them
if you’re focused on the superficial.


47:40.940 --> 47:44.745
You need real friends,
if you know what I mean.


47:44.745 --> 47:48.915
Look at me.
Can you see


47:48.915 --> 47:54.287
What I see?
Around the world, this happy family.


47:54.287 --> 47:58.292
Look at me.
Do you know


47:58.292 --> 48:02.595
What I know?
That you belong.


48:02.595 --> 48:07.000
Put down the phone, and look at me.


48:23.983 --> 48:29.021
Don’t let it play you for a fool.


48:29.022 --> 48:33.727
What you’re getting 
could be fact or could be fiction.


48:33.727 --> 48:38.865
Life in the cloud can be so cruel.


48:38.865 --> 48:46.000
Why don’t you come back down to earth,
converse, and reverse the addiction?


49:04.490 --> 49:10.297
Put—put down your device
’Cause if you don’t think twice,


49:10.297 --> 49:13.867
The best in life will surely pass you by.


49:13.867 --> 49:19.907
Look, listen, taste, and touch—
The things we love so much


49:19.907 --> 49:24.144
Have been here all along. 
All you need to do is


49:24.143 --> 49:28.748
Realize what’s in your hand
is only superficial.


49:28.748 --> 49:32.451
You’ve got real friends, 
if you know what I mean.


49:32.452 --> 49:36.757
Look at me.
Can you see


49:36.757 --> 49:42.062
What I see?
Around the world, this happy family.


49:42.062 --> 49:46.065
Look at me.
Do you know


49:46.065 --> 49:50.370
What I know?
That you belong. 


49:50.370 --> 49:53.407
Put down the phone, and look at me.


49:53.407 --> 49:58.079
Can you see
What I see?


49:58.078 --> 50:01.080
Around the world, this happy family.


50:01.080 --> 50:05.085
Look at me.
Do you know


50:05.085 --> 50:09.322
What I know?
That you belong. 


50:09.322 --> 50:13.000
Put down the phone, and look at me.


50:14.360 --> 50:18.798
Time spent with our brothers 
and sisters is precious. 


50:18.798 --> 50:22.068
Make the most of it 
by setting aside anything 


50:22.068 --> 50:26.806
that could distract 
from the interchange of encouragement.


50:26.807 --> 50:30.810
Sometimes, though, 
our viewpoint of ones in the congregation 


50:30.810 --> 50:34.647
hides their true beauty that Jehovah sees. 


50:34.647 --> 50:39.385
How does the sister 
in this dramatization learn that lesson and, 


50:39.385 --> 50:43.000
in turn, 
become more beautiful herself?


51:04.410 --> 51:06.413
My name is Miki. 


51:06.413 --> 51:09.081
I moved here one year ago. 


51:09.082 --> 51:12.000
Everyone was so nice and friendly.


51:20.360 --> 51:25.000
Well, that’s how I felt in the beginning.


51:38.545 --> 51:41.000
I am not your babysitter!


51:48.355 --> 51:51.000
Didn’t you see we were talking?


52:02.035 --> 52:06.000
Come on! 
This is not a park!


52:07.007 --> 52:10.377
And the elders are always busy. 


52:10.377 --> 52:14.000
I’m not sure if they really want me here.


52:24.223 --> 52:29.000
Yoko, a pioneer sister
from my former congregation, visited me. 


52:30.197 --> 52:33.000
She asked me how I was doing. 


52:34.067 --> 52:38.000
I told her how I felt
about my congregation. 


52:39.238 --> 52:43.776
Then she told me that she
had a similar experience. 


52:43.777 --> 52:47.000
And she shared with me
a Watchtower article that helped her. 


52:49.015 --> 52:53.000
I made this my next personal study project.


52:55.555 --> 52:59.525
“What do you see when you look at others? 


52:59.525 --> 53:02.362
“Do you have the tendency
to view what they say or do


53:02.362 --> 53:04.965
“as either black or white, 


53:04.965 --> 53:08.000
as if no other colors or shades existed?”


53:10.103 --> 53:11.805
“Having that viewpoint


53:11.805 --> 53:15.908
“would be like a photographer
who ignores the large variety


53:15.908 --> 53:19.545
“of brilliant hues and shades
in an autumn landscape, 


53:19.545 --> 53:23.000
as if only black and white images existed.”


53:29.788 --> 53:34.000
Maybe I’ve been viewing
the congregation as “black and white.” 


53:35.495 --> 53:40.000
The article then turned
my attention to Jesus’ example.


53:41.333 --> 53:44.000
“The spirit, of course, is eager,


53:45.105 --> 53:48.000
but the flesh is weak.”


53:51.343 --> 53:54.446
Why was Jesus able to say such kind words 


53:54.447 --> 53:56.000
to his disciples?


54:06.492 --> 54:08.929
Insight is the ability to put yourself


54:08.928 --> 54:10.663
in the other’s place. 


54:10.663 --> 54:13.300
Jesus did that with his disciples. 


54:13.300 --> 54:16.000
OK, I need to do the same.


54:17.037 --> 54:19.872
She always looks after the children at home. 


54:19.872 --> 54:22.509
She also needs time to be refreshed


54:22.508 --> 54:25.511
by association with friends
at the Kingdom Hall.


54:25.512 --> 54:28.000
She probably didn’t mean to be rude. 


54:29.348 --> 54:32.685
Since we looked like we were
having an enjoyable conversation, 


54:32.685 --> 54:35.000
she may have just wanted to join us.


54:36.990 --> 54:39.758
The elders are so busy caring for the needs


54:39.758 --> 54:41.226
of the congregation. 


54:41.227 --> 54:43.830
I know they’re doing the best they can. 


54:43.830 --> 54:47.000
I want to do what
I can to make their job easier.


55:13.092 --> 55:14.527
Miki,


55:14.527 --> 55:17.597
you are such a beautiful Christian. 


55:17.597 --> 55:21.000
We’re so glad to have you 
in our congregation.


55:27.340 --> 55:29.842
“The insight of a man certainly


55:29.842 --> 55:34.747
“slows down his anger,
and it is beauty on his part


55:34.747 --> 55:36.000
to overlook an offense.”


55:46.693 --> 55:48.928
If you’d like to make this lesson a topic 


55:48.928 --> 55:51.931
for your personal study or family worship, 


55:51.932 --> 55:56.102
you can review 
the March 15, 2008, Watchtower article 


55:56.102 --> 55:58.705
beginning on page 25. 


55:58.705 --> 56:01.173
The title asks the question: 


56:01.173 --> 56:04.920
“Do You View Others as Jehovah Does?” 


56:04.920 --> 56:07.363
When we share Jehovah’s view of others, 


56:07.363 --> 56:10.433
we’re better equipped 
to be fellow workers with God 


56:10.433 --> 56:13.000
and with our brothers and sisters.


56:14.120 --> 56:16.957
Finally, this month’s report 
from fellow workers 


56:16.957 --> 56:20.694
comes to us 
from the country of Georgia. 


56:20.693 --> 56:24.063
Forests, streams, and lush valleys 


56:24.063 --> 56:28.350
adorn this mountainous region 
on the border of Europe and Asia. 


56:28.350 --> 56:29.752
Georgia’s capital, 


56:29.752 --> 56:32.922
Tbilisi, is a bustling city 


56:32.922 --> 56:36.702
where modern buildings 
mix with historic architecture.


56:36.702 --> 56:39.305
The Georgian people are known 


56:39.305 --> 56:43.000
for their strong family ties 
and warm hospitality. 


56:44.017 --> 56:48.789
Folk music and dances 
are a rich part of their culture. 


56:48.788 --> 56:52.708
Visitors are offered to try 
a variety of delicious local foods, 


56:52.708 --> 56:56.728
such as this candy 
made from walnuts and grape juice.


56:56.728 --> 56:59.765
Old town Sighnaghi is a unique place 


56:59.765 --> 57:03.000
to enjoy the beautiful landscape and culture. 


57:04.153 --> 57:06.655
The congregation here has 50 publishers 


57:06.655 --> 57:08.625
who keep busy in the preaching work. 


57:08.625 --> 57:11.327
Despite being a small congregation, 


57:11.327 --> 57:15.000
they represent almost 3 percent 
of the town’s population. 


57:17.120 --> 57:20.035
Remote towns and villages 
create opportunities to preach 


57:20.035 --> 57:24.173
in unassigned territories 
throughout the year.


57:24.173 --> 57:26.910
We thank the congregation in Sighnaghi 


57:26.910 --> 57:30.380
and the more than 18,000 brothers 
and sisters in Georgia 


57:30.380 --> 57:32.715
for this encouraging visit with them. 


57:32.715 --> 57:35.518
And we send them and all of you 


57:35.518 --> 57:38.000
our warm Christian love and greetings.


57:39.372 --> 57:42.192
From the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


57:42.192 --> 57:51.402
