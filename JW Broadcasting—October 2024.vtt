Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month marks ten years
since the first program debuted.

00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:12.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll take a look at the special role

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:15.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW Broadcasting has played
in uniting God’s people.

00:00:16.704 --> 00:00:21.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Part 1 of the episode
of <i>Applying Bible Principles,</i>

00:00:21.417 --> 00:00:25.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
James and Linda were too focused
on when the end would come.

00:00:25.838 --> 00:00:30.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how they now help others
keep a balanced view of the future.

00:00:31.844 --> 00:00:33.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
In <i>Iron Sharpens Iron,</i>

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll learn how to put our website
to better use in the ministry.

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the October 2024 edition

00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:43.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:02.416 --> 00:01:04.835 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I first began serving at Bethel,

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:07.087 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’d call home to speak with my family

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:09.131 line:10% position:50% align:center
and my mother would always ask,

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:10.633 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Have they told you when the date

00:01:10.633 --> 00:01:12.176 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Armageddon is?”

00:01:12.885 --> 00:01:15.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though she was being humorous
and didn’t expect an answer,

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:18.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
her question reveals what we all long for

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:22.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s promised new world.

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:25.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you have, in a sense,
asked Jehovah that question,

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:28.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How much longer, Jehovah?”

00:01:28.192 --> 00:01:31.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you’ve said to Jehovah:
“I’m exhausted.

00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t know how much longer
I can keep going.

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please, Jehovah, when will your promises
for a world of lasting peace,

00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
refreshment, and relief from the pressures
of this world come true?”

00:01:45.042 --> 00:01:48.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all likely feel this way
from time to time.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us not give up,

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:55.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
not give out, in our spiritual battle?

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the words of Jesus at Mark 13:29.

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:05.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what he says: “Likewise also you,

00:02:05.521 --> 00:02:08.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when you see these things happening,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
know that he is near at the doors.”

00:02:11.193 --> 00:02:14.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
What things would we see happening?

00:02:15.531 --> 00:02:18.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prophecy being fulfilled.

00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:23.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we recognize Bible prophecies
being fulfilled before our eyes,

00:02:23.247 --> 00:02:25.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
our faith is fortified.

00:02:25.374 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see that the end is imminent.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:31.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recognize that we’re almost done.

00:02:31.755 --> 00:02:35.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helps us not give out.

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:37.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some of these prophecies?

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re familiar with the prophecies
of earthquakes,

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:43.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“wars and reports of wars,”
food shortages,

00:02:43.225 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
and disease all happening at once.

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:48.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see these things happening.”

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:51.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see the diminished love of God

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the deteriorating attitude
of people in general,

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
as foretold in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:02:59.616 --> 00:03:02.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 3:13 says:

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:04.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Wicked men and impostors

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
will advance from bad to worse.”

00:03:07.416 --> 00:03:11.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see these things happening.”

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:15.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
As foretold, “this good news
of the Kingdom” is being preached worldwide

00:03:15.007 --> 00:03:17.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
—now in over 1,000 languages.

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:19.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see these things happening.”

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:22.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of Christ’s rule,

00:03:22.181 --> 00:03:25.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
the knowledge of Jehovah
is abundantly overflowing.

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see these things happening.”

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about Isaiah 45:18?

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here Jehovah calls himself
the “Maker” of the earth,

00:03:35.527 --> 00:03:38.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who did not create it simply for nothing,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
but formed it to be inhabited.”

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, scientists say that the world
is on the brink of becoming uninhabitable.

00:03:46.955 --> 00:03:51.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
They warn that if action to stop
global warming is not taken quickly,

00:03:51.668 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
its compounding effects
will become irreversible.

00:03:56.048 --> 00:03:58.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 11:18,

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible foretold that in our day,

00:04:01.136 --> 00:04:04.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
man would be “ruining the earth,”

00:04:04.181 --> 00:04:06.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it also assures us

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will step in
and not let the earth be completely ruined.

00:04:12.606 --> 00:04:16.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some may wonder how much worse
things will get.

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:19.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, at Luke 17:20,

00:04:19.404 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said this

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:23.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke 17:20:

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Kingdom of God
is not coming with striking observableness.”

00:04:29.248 --> 00:04:33.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that world conditions
during the last days

00:04:33.127 --> 00:04:35.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
would not be so extreme

00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people would be forced to believe
that the end is near.

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:42.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Matthew 24:37-39 indicates,

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:45.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would still be “eating and drinking,”

00:04:45.264 --> 00:04:48.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting married,
and able to carry on their everyday lives.

00:04:49.476 --> 00:04:52.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should this affect us?

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
It should fortify us not to give up.

00:04:56.483 --> 00:04:58.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Mark 13:35,

00:04:58.735 --> 00:05:02.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said we must “keep on the watch.”

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means to stay awake and be on guard.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:08.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the parallel account in Matthew 24,

00:05:08.704 --> 00:05:12.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus connects this with being ready.

00:05:14.126 --> 00:05:18.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will help us to do this
when we feel so exhausted?

00:05:18.672 --> 00:05:21.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where can we get strength
to keep up the fight?

00:05:23.051 --> 00:05:26.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a word—trust.

00:05:27.347 --> 00:05:30.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all love Jehovah.

00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:33.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to be convinced

00:05:33.645 --> 00:05:37.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s loyal love for us individually.

00:05:38.859 --> 00:05:43.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we trust that he’ll always
be there to help us?

00:05:44.698 --> 00:05:48.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice on-screen the assurance Jehovah gives

00:05:48.076 --> 00:05:51.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 13:5:

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:55.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will never leave you,

00:05:55.959 --> 00:05:59.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will never abandon you.”

00:06:00.005 --> 00:06:04.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has been sustaining us.

00:06:04.635 --> 00:06:06.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how he sustains you.

00:06:07.596 --> 00:06:12.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’ve experienced
the ravages of a natural disaster;

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:15.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has sustained you.

00:06:15.646 --> 00:06:18.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’ve dealt
with the loss of a loved one;

00:06:18.649 --> 00:06:21.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has sustained you.

00:06:21.526 --> 00:06:23.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever trial we’ve gone through,

00:06:23.695 --> 00:06:27.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see how Jehovah has helped us.

00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:32.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
This confirms for us
that he’ll sustain us in the future.

00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:34.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have the confidence

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s stated at Psalm 46:1, 2:

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is our refuge and strength,

00:06:42.547 --> 00:06:46.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a help that is readily found
in times of distress.

00:06:46.885 --> 00:06:50.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why we will not fear,
though the earth undergoes change,

00:06:50.722 --> 00:06:53.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
though the mountains topple
into the depths of the sea.”

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
These emphatic expressions leave no doubt

00:06:59.106 --> 00:07:02.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will care for us.

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is this reminder so important?

00:07:07.614 --> 00:07:10.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, verse 6 of Hebrews chapter 13

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:14.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
links trust with courage.

00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:16.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says:

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that we may be of good courage and say:

00:07:22.546 --> 00:07:27.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘Jehovah is my helper;
I will not be afraid.

00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:29.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can man do to me?’”

00:07:30.137 --> 00:07:33.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice it doesn’t say <i>our </i> or <i>their </i> helper.

00:07:33.724 --> 00:07:36.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says “my helper.”

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love Jehovah.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:41.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also be absolutely convinced

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah loves us
and will help us individually.

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:51.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, it can be difficult
to trust that Jehovah loves us personally

00:07:51.867 --> 00:07:54.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will act in our behalf.

00:07:54.411 --> 00:07:58.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help build our trust
in Jehovah’s love?

00:07:58.915 --> 00:08:01.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss three ways.

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Proverbs 15

00:08:03.962 --> 00:08:06.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 15, notice verse 9:

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah detests the way of the wicked one,

00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:16.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he loves the one
who pursues righteousness.”

00:08:17.309 --> 00:08:19.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He loves the one

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:24.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
who pursues
[or, chases after] righteousness.”

00:08:25.192 --> 00:08:28.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows we can’t be perfectly righteous.

00:08:28.612 --> 00:08:32.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he loves us for trying our best,

00:08:32.157 --> 00:08:35.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he said, ‘for pursuing righteousness.’

00:08:35.619 --> 00:08:38.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves us because we don’t quit.

00:08:38.622 --> 00:08:42.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can trust that he’ll never abandon us

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:46.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we don’t give up
in pursuing righteousness.

00:08:47.547 --> 00:08:52.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, pour out your heart to Jehovah.

00:08:52.469 --> 00:08:55.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lamentations 2:19 says this

00:08:55.764 --> 00:08:58.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Lamentations 2:19:

00:08:58.683 --> 00:09:01.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pour out your heart like water

00:09:01.937 --> 00:09:03.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the face of Jehovah.”

00:09:04.898 --> 00:09:09.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t say,
“Pour out your mind” or “your thoughts”

00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:12.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
but “pour out your heart”

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that includes our feelings,
our concerns, our anxieties.

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:21.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pour out our heart
like one pours out water

00:09:21.039 --> 00:09:23.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not holding anything back.

00:09:24.209 --> 00:09:26.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we express to our heavenly Father

00:09:26.837 --> 00:09:29.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love and appreciation for him,

00:09:29.798 --> 00:09:32.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we tell him our concerns and desires,

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:35.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we ask for his direction,

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:38.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show that we value
our friendship with him.

00:09:39.850 --> 00:09:42.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will be the result for you?

00:09:42.436 --> 00:09:45.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more you pour out your heart like water

00:09:45.188 --> 00:09:48.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel his personal response to you,

00:09:48.316 --> 00:09:51.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more you’ll sense his love for you

00:09:51.361 --> 00:09:55.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the more you’ll trust
that he’ll never abandon you.

00:09:55.282 --> 00:09:59.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your gratitude for Jehovah’s
enduring love will increase.

00:10:00.996 --> 00:10:04.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, third, remember that trials

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not mean a loss of Jehovah’s favor.

00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:11.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our enemy knows that feeling close to Jehovah

00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:14.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the source of our strength.

00:10:14.301 --> 00:10:17.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he’ll try to undermine our confidence,

00:10:17.429 --> 00:10:20.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he hopes that we break away from Jehovah.

00:10:20.599 --> 00:10:25.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when Job
was undergoing a severe trial,

00:10:25.437 --> 00:10:30.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
his false comforters lyingly said
that the reason for these trials

00:10:30.442 --> 00:10:32.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that he’d lost Jehovah’s favor.

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:37.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah reminded Job to look at creation

00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:41.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see His love and wisdom.

00:10:42.829 --> 00:10:45.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did faithful Job respond?

00:10:45.582 --> 00:10:48.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said at Job 42:5:

00:10:49.544 --> 00:10:52.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My ears have heard about you,

00:10:52.714 --> 00:10:57.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now I do see you with my eyes.”

00:10:58.094 --> 00:11:01.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may wonder if we’ve lost Jehovah’s favor.

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:04.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should ask Jehovah to help us see him

00:11:04.768 --> 00:11:09.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see his loyal love for us every day.

00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:11.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask him to help you use this trial

00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:15.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a stepping stone to love
and trust him even more.

00:11:17.447 --> 00:11:22.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve discussed one way
we get ready for the upcoming events

00:11:22.285 --> 00:11:27.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
—build our trust that Jehovah
has loyal love for us individually.

00:11:28.375 --> 00:11:31.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting that Jehovah will never abandon us

00:11:31.127 --> 00:11:33.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us the strength to keep up the fight

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep on the watch.

00:11:36.508 --> 00:11:38.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 6:16,

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:42.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
faith, or trust, in Jehovah
is compared to a shield

00:11:42.973 --> 00:11:47.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a shield “with which you [can] extinguish
all the wicked one’s burning arrows,”

00:11:47.394 --> 00:11:50.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
or all of Satan’s spiritual attacks.

00:11:50.647 --> 00:11:55.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when we hear lies about Jehovah,

00:11:55.026 --> 00:11:59.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
his organization,
and those he’s appointed to take the lead,

00:11:59.114 --> 00:12:01.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not be shaken.

00:12:01.157 --> 00:12:04.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t give up or give out.

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:09.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know the prophecy
at Matthew 24:45 has been fulfilled.

00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:12.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has lovingly provided a slave

00:12:12.419 --> 00:12:15.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s “faithful and discreet.”

00:12:16.423 --> 00:12:21.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recognize that Jehovah
provides spiritual food and direction

00:12:21.052 --> 00:12:24.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
through this body of men at the right time.

00:12:24.472 --> 00:12:27.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re not left floundering
or trying to find our way.

00:12:27.726 --> 00:12:30.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we remain obedient

00:12:30.645 --> 00:12:34.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
and responsive to the direction we receive.

00:12:34.441 --> 00:12:36.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never dismiss it,

00:12:36.443 --> 00:12:40.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if it doesn’t appear practical
from a human standpoint.

00:12:41.990 --> 00:12:44.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting in Jehovah’s loyal love

00:12:44.618 --> 00:12:46.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
has saved his people in the past.

00:12:48.204 --> 00:12:53.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Chronicles 20:1, 2,

00:12:53.126 --> 00:12:57.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
it tells us that Jehoshaphat
learned that a coalition of nations

00:12:57.088 --> 00:12:59.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“a large crowd . . . from the region
of the sea”—

00:12:59.549 --> 00:13:01.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
were coming against him.

00:13:01.885 --> 00:13:06.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat already had the habit
of turning to Jehovah.

00:13:06.181 --> 00:13:10.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He resolved to search for Jehovah.”

00:13:10.268 --> 00:13:13.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he and his faithful subjects do this?

00:13:13.563 --> 00:13:18.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat poured his heart out
like water to Jehovah.

00:13:18.985 --> 00:13:20.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in verse 12

00:13:20.987 --> 00:13:25.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he expresses
his complete trust in Jehovah:

00:13:27.369 --> 00:13:32.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For we are powerless before this large crowd
that is coming against us;

00:13:32.207 --> 00:13:35.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we do not know what we should do,

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:38.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our eyes are toward you.”

00:13:39.506 --> 00:13:42.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah respond?

00:13:42.008 --> 00:13:44.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice verse 15.

00:13:44.302 --> 00:13:48.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sent Jahaziel to reassure them:

00:13:48.848 --> 00:13:52.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid or be terrified
because of this large crowd,

00:13:52.936 --> 00:13:56.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the battle is not yours but God’s.”

00:13:57.691 --> 00:14:00.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
The strategy that Jehoshaphat followed

00:14:00.151 --> 00:14:02.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t seem practical
from a human standpoint.

00:14:03.613 --> 00:14:05.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat appointed singers

00:14:05.615 --> 00:14:09.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
dressed “in holy adornment”
to praise Jehovah.

00:14:09.244 --> 00:14:13.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how unusual that he put them
in front of the armed men!

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:17.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were they singing songs about how Jehovah

00:14:17.043 --> 00:14:20.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
defeated their enemies in past wars?

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:21.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:14:21.631 --> 00:14:26.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
They sang about Jehovah’s loyal love.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:28.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result?

00:14:28.888 --> 00:14:32.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah confused their enemies,
and they attacked each other.

00:14:34.227 --> 00:14:37.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons can we learn from this account?

00:14:37.856 --> 00:14:42.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting Jehovah includes
trusting his representatives.

00:14:42.694 --> 00:14:46.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lifesaving direction we receive
from Jehovah’s organization

00:14:46.656 --> 00:14:50.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not appear practical
from a human standpoint.

00:14:50.452 --> 00:14:53.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we recognize
the fulfillment  of the prophecy

00:14:53.496 --> 00:14:55.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 24:45

00:14:55.498 --> 00:14:57.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
about “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:14:57.667 --> 00:15:00.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re ready to obey
any instruction they provide.

00:15:02.046 --> 00:15:06.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, getting ready includes building trust

00:15:06.718 --> 00:15:11.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being convinced that Jehovah
will deliver us from the wicked one.

00:15:13.141 --> 00:15:15.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting Him will help us understand

00:15:15.977 --> 00:15:18.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophetic role
of “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:15:18.897 --> 00:15:22.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this time of the end
when Jehovah is using them

00:15:22.233 --> 00:15:26.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide lifesaving direction.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:30.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
This direction is helping us to stay ready.

00:15:31.576 --> 00:15:34.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has sustained us in the past,

00:15:34.412 --> 00:15:37.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he sustains us now.

00:15:39.667 --> 00:15:41.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing these things happening

00:15:41.961 --> 00:15:46.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also fortify and strengthen us.

00:15:47.258 --> 00:15:50.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of you have been fighting
to “keep on the watch”

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:52.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
for many years.

00:15:52.847 --> 00:15:56.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the end is clearly in sight.

00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:58.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t want to give up now.

00:15:58.812 --> 00:16:03.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the reassurance at Galatians 6:9

00:16:04.818 --> 00:16:08.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Galatians 6:9:

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:12.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So let us not give up in doing what is fine,

00:16:12.784 --> 00:16:15.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for in due time we will reap

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:18.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we do not tire out.”

00:16:19.415 --> 00:16:21.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of our imperfect flesh

00:16:21.709 --> 00:16:24.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the efforts of Satan
and this wicked world,

00:16:24.671 --> 00:16:29.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must constantly battle
negative influences.

00:16:29.175 --> 00:16:33.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you dear brothers and sisters
must fight hard every day

00:16:33.638 --> 00:16:36.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain your relationship with Jehovah.

00:16:36.349 --> 00:16:37.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t give up!

00:16:39.561 --> 00:16:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your fight has not been in vain.

00:16:42.146 --> 00:16:44.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve made the right choices.

00:16:44.399 --> 00:16:46.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has seen your loyal love for him,

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:50.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he treasures your devotion.

00:16:50.321 --> 00:16:53.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time and time again,
you’ve made sacrifices

00:16:53.658 --> 00:16:56.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
and left your comfort zone
to give Jehovah your best,

00:16:56.452 --> 00:17:00.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay active in the ministry,
to keep taking in spiritual food,

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:03.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to teach your children
how to speak about Jehovah.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:08.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves you dearly for this

00:17:08.131 --> 00:17:13.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will loyally continue
to help you until the battle is won.

00:17:13.094 --> 00:17:15.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not give up now!

00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:20.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you young ones,
Jehovah loves you too.

00:17:20.435 --> 00:17:24.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that you’re growing up
in a world that’s broken.

00:17:24.397 --> 00:17:28.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that it can be hard for you
to maintain hope for the future.

00:17:28.484 --> 00:17:32.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, never forget that your God,

00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:36.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
your heavenly Father, loves you dearly.

00:17:36.159 --> 00:17:40.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never forget that your future is bright.

00:17:41.456 --> 00:17:44.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we’re young or old or in between,

00:17:44.709 --> 00:17:46.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not give up.

00:17:46.961 --> 00:17:48.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so close.

00:17:48.796 --> 00:17:52.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see these things happening
with our own eyes.

00:17:52.967 --> 00:17:57.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ll keep on the watch,
we’ll trust Jehovah with all our hearts,

00:17:57.347 --> 00:17:59.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll trust Jehovah’s arrangements,

00:17:59.557 --> 00:18:03.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we will not give out
in our spiritual battle,

00:18:03.186 --> 00:18:07.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we will reap
rich blessings soon—very soon.

00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:13.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you believe it’s been ten years

00:18:13.738 --> 00:18:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
since JW Broadcasting began?

00:18:16.699 --> 00:18:20.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s 120 monthly programs!

00:18:20.036 --> 00:18:22.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
These programs have unified

00:18:22.664 --> 00:18:25.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthened Jehovah’s organization.

00:18:25.917 --> 00:18:30.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the next video, we’ll be reminded
of some gems we’ve received

00:18:30.755 --> 00:18:34.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll hear personal stories
that illustrate the impact

00:18:34.342 --> 00:18:37.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW Broadcasting has had on the brotherhood.

00:18:48.272 --> 00:18:50.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
We warmly welcome you,

00:18:50.775 --> 00:18:52.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
dear brothers and sisters,

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:53.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our first

00:18:53.569 --> 00:18:57.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW Broadcasting® monthly program.

00:19:01.369 --> 00:19:03.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Christian neutrality.”

00:19:03.246 --> 00:19:04.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Modesty.

00:19:04.998 --> 00:19:06.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do the Math.”

00:19:06.666 --> 00:19:10.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Deal With Anxiety
One Day at a Time.”

00:19:10.837 --> 00:19:15.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Children] are an inheritance
from Jehovah.”

00:19:15.591 --> 00:19:19.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves each one of us

00:19:19.178 --> 00:19:23.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite our appearances
or imperfections.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:28.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
A marriage that has good patterns
shaped by Jehovah’s principles

00:19:28.396 --> 00:19:32.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
looks like this well-balanced family circle.

00:19:32.108 --> 00:19:34.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though we’re tainted with sin,

00:19:34.485 --> 00:19:38.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not discard
imperfect humans.

00:19:38.197 --> 00:19:42.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may worry about
what might seem to be big tests,

00:19:42.702 --> 00:19:45.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
only to find
that they’re not as overwhelming

00:19:45.496 --> 00:19:47.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we feared they would be.

00:19:48.624 --> 00:19:52.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each individual grain of sand
reveals distinct beauty. . . .

00:19:52.879 --> 00:19:56.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is how Jehovah sees each of you.

00:19:56.132 --> 00:19:57.633 line:10% position:50% align:center
My personal favorite thing

00:19:57.633 --> 00:19:59.218 line:10% position:50% align:center
about JW Broadcasting

00:19:59.218 --> 00:20:00.595 line:10% position:50% align:center
has to be that there are videos

00:20:00.595 --> 00:20:02.096 line:10% position:50% align:center
on really anything,

00:20:02.096 --> 00:20:04.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it’s something
to help me in school

00:20:04.432 --> 00:20:06.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
or something to help me
in my spiritual life.

00:20:06.601 --> 00:20:08.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
We like to theme our family worship.

00:20:08.478 --> 00:20:11.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently,
we did a family worship on neutrality.

00:20:11.481 --> 00:20:16.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we found a lot of great videos
that specifically had to do with that.

00:20:16.319 --> 00:20:18.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
I use my device quite a bit,

00:20:18.112 --> 00:20:20.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I don’t like it to get in the way

00:20:20.573 --> 00:20:23.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
of schoolwork and family time.

00:20:23.367 --> 00:20:26.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the video has really helped me

00:20:26.329 --> 00:20:29.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
manage my screen time so it doesn’t
get in the way of those things.

00:20:29.665 --> 00:20:33.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being able to see brothers and sisters

00:20:33.127 --> 00:20:36.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
from all over the world,
all different ages, all different backgrounds

00:20:36.464 --> 00:20:38.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving Jehovah

00:20:38.049 --> 00:20:40.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s helped me personally.

00:20:40.301 --> 00:20:43.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I think it’s really helped the kids
in setting their own spiritual goals

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:47.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being able to see

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there’s so much that can be done
in Jehovah’s organization,

00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:54.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what their interests are,
and that Jehovah can take care of them.

00:20:54.857 --> 00:20:57.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel part
of Jehovah’s worldwide organization.

00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:00.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, you know, at the end of the broadcast,
they say, “We love you, friends.”

00:21:00.988 --> 00:21:02.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s really no substitute for that.

00:21:03.574 --> 00:21:06.661 line:10% position:50% align:center
As a special pioneer,

00:21:06.661 --> 00:21:09.288 line:10% position:50% align:center
the pandemic lasted so long.

00:21:10.790 --> 00:21:12.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I had various sources of stress.

00:21:13.626 --> 00:21:16.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, fortunately,
it was the direction

00:21:16.212 --> 00:21:19.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the discreet slave,
a motherlike organization,

00:21:19.757 --> 00:21:22.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gave us direction
every step of the way.

00:21:23.636 --> 00:21:25.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was great.

00:21:26.139 --> 00:21:29.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body taught us principles

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave us so much support.

00:21:33.396 --> 00:21:36.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been such a joy
to hear in the Governing Body updates

00:21:36.566 --> 00:21:39.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
that many inactive ones are coming back.

00:21:43.239 --> 00:21:47.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
I visited a single brother
who was inactive for 24 years.

00:21:50.538 --> 00:21:54.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said several times
how he wanted to come back.

00:21:56.544 --> 00:21:58.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was really happy that I acted

00:21:58.754 --> 00:22:00.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the message
from the Governing Body updates.

00:22:03.384 --> 00:22:05.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really strengthened my faith.

00:22:09.849 --> 00:22:13.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
In one Governing Body update from 2022,

00:22:13.352 --> 00:22:16.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
they highlighted our return
to the in-person ministry.

00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:22.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like a brand-new publisher

00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:24.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we went out
in the field ministry again.

00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:30.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt like a baby, a toddler, in a way.

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my wife and I
prayed a lot to Jehovah

00:22:34.582 --> 00:22:37.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to be able
to have good conversations

00:22:37.126 --> 00:22:39.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be able
to muster up the courage needed.

00:22:41.589 --> 00:22:44.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we actually went
from house to house,

00:22:44.217 --> 00:22:46.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our surprise,
householders were willing to listen.

00:22:50.598 --> 00:22:53.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt the support of the holy spirit

00:22:53.476 --> 00:22:56.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and felt the kindness and help
from the Governing Body

00:22:56.395 --> 00:22:58.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the pandemic.

00:23:00.191 --> 00:23:02.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this gives us the motivation to overcome 

00:23:02.735 --> 00:23:06.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
any obstacle in our way,
no matter what the future holds.

00:23:09.742 --> 00:23:12.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m really appreciative of that.

00:23:14.121 --> 00:23:16.374 line:10% position:50% align:center
I got baptized when I was 25 years old.

00:23:18.417 --> 00:23:21.671 line:10% position:50% align:center
What contributed to me becoming inactive

00:23:21.671 --> 00:23:24.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the lack of Bible study,

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:27.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
neglecting my meeting attendance,

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some bad associations.

00:23:30.888 --> 00:23:33.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remained inactive for ten years.

00:23:35.518 --> 00:23:39.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
The JW Broadcasting program
that helped me to return to Jehovah

00:23:41.065 --> 00:23:43.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the program from February 2016,

00:23:46.112 --> 00:23:48.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we find the experience
of Brother Derrick,

00:23:50.032 --> 00:23:52.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
who similarly had strayed away
from Jehovah.

00:23:54.328 --> 00:23:56.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he recognized
that he had made a big mistake,

00:23:56.998 --> 00:23:59.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
which caused him many problems.

00:24:00.668 --> 00:24:02.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I could relate to Brother Derrick.

00:24:03.963 --> 00:24:06.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, I said,

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:08.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why can’t I return to Jehovah?”

00:24:10.511 --> 00:24:12.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
That video helped me fix matters

00:24:12.596 --> 00:24:15.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
and get close to Jehovah little by little.

00:24:17.768 --> 00:24:19.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve been able to watch
Gilead School talks

00:24:19.895 --> 00:24:22.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some broadcasts as a family.

00:24:22.898 --> 00:24:25.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has helped us to expand our friendships

00:24:25.109 --> 00:24:27.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers in the congregation.

00:24:29.196 --> 00:24:32.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember a Gilead School talk
that was given by Brother David Splane

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:36.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the theme
“If You Look for It, You Will Find It.”

00:24:38.247 --> 00:24:40.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
That taught us that when we want
to expand our friendships

00:24:40.416 --> 00:24:43.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our brothers in the congregation,

00:24:43.502 --> 00:24:46.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should not focus on their defects,

00:24:46.422 --> 00:24:49.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we should look more
at their good qualities.

00:24:49.717 --> 00:24:51.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that helped us as a family

00:24:51.802 --> 00:24:54.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain united
with all those in the congregation.

00:24:56.849 --> 00:25:00.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really like everything
that comes out on JW Broadcasting.

00:25:02.063 --> 00:25:04.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what I love the most

00:25:04.690 --> 00:25:06.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
are the experiences
of our brothers and sisters

00:25:06.942 --> 00:25:11.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
who remain steadfast
and keep their faith in Jehovah.

00:25:12.698 --> 00:25:14.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love family worship so much

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we get to sit down as a family

00:25:16.994 --> 00:25:19.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
and practice some Kingdom songs,

00:25:19.705 --> 00:25:23.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
read a Bible story,
or watch the broadcast for the month.

00:25:24.543 --> 00:25:27.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first time I went to a convention
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:25:27.755 --> 00:25:30.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was like ten thousand people.

00:25:30.257 --> 00:25:32.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I went in there and I saw

00:25:32.301 --> 00:25:35.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
all these different faces
and different colors,

00:25:35.179 --> 00:25:38.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was like Jehovah showing me:
“Hey, Rafika,

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“remember you were asking me
about all different people getting together

00:25:41.811 --> 00:25:43.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and being one?

00:25:43.687 --> 00:25:47.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, I’m not partial;
they do get along; we are unified.”

00:25:48.192 --> 00:25:51.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
To know that you have
a heavenly Father

00:25:51.237 --> 00:25:53.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cares about you

00:25:53.948 --> 00:25:56.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that was the best feeling on earth.

00:25:56.742 --> 00:25:58.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never thought that God had a name.

00:26:00.454 --> 00:26:04.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ever since that day on,
I never forget Jehovah’s name.

00:26:04.583 --> 00:26:06.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s superglued in my heart.

00:26:07.586 --> 00:26:09.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our love for Jehovah

00:26:09.964 --> 00:26:13.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our determination
to live by his standards

00:26:13.008 --> 00:26:15.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
are being tested each day.

00:26:15.511 --> 00:26:18.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet,
because we’re being well-fed spiritually,

00:26:18.514 --> 00:26:22.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have everything we need
to meet those tests with joy.

00:26:24.979 --> 00:26:26.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:26:26.939 --> 00:26:28.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
please be assured

00:26:28.941 --> 00:26:30.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the warm love

00:26:30.734 --> 00:26:33.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body
and our prayers in your behalf.

00:26:35.448 --> 00:26:37.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:26:37.825 --> 00:26:40.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.

00:26:44.665 --> 00:26:47.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
What program was special to you?

00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:49.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember one?

00:26:49.503 --> 00:26:52.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage you
to rewatch the spiritual food

00:26:52.673 --> 00:26:55.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s been presented in past programs.

00:26:55.217 --> 00:26:59.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank Jehovah
for making all this possible.

00:27:00.848 --> 00:27:04.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever watched the news
and thought: ‘Is this it?

00:27:04.435 --> 00:27:07.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this the beginning
of the great tribulation?’

00:27:07.688 --> 00:27:11.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a previous episode
of <i>Apply Bible Principles,</i>

00:27:11.442 --> 00:27:16.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
James and Linda learned
to change their focus and maintain joy.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now they’ll help a young brother do the same.

00:32:30.427 --> 00:32:33.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t control when the end will come,

00:32:33.472 --> 00:32:36.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can control who we are when it does.

00:32:36.725 --> 00:32:41.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe like Thulani, you wonder
if the sacrifices you made were worth it.

00:32:42.523 --> 00:32:44.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Francis Páez del Rosario

00:32:44.983 --> 00:32:48.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
made sacrifices as an accomplished musician

00:32:48.278 --> 00:32:50.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
to focus on the Kingdom.

00:32:50.489 --> 00:32:54.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her life story was featured
in the August 2005 <i>Awake!</i>

00:32:54.493 --> 00:32:57.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how she views her choices
in the next segment.

00:33:05.963 --> 00:33:08.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad sold the house
to buy musical instruments

00:33:08.549 --> 00:33:12.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that us children
could become great artists.

00:33:14.513 --> 00:33:16.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we achieved just that.

00:33:23.522 --> 00:33:25.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
We made it to the top.

00:33:29.403 --> 00:33:31.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dancing style became so famous

00:33:31.613 --> 00:33:34.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they would advertise
with only a picture of me.

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:36.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wherever they put that image,

00:33:36.702 --> 00:33:39.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone knew Los Rosario would be there.

00:33:51.508 --> 00:33:53.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really liked dancing.
I loved it.

00:33:53.552 --> 00:33:58.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved the makeup, the clothes, the stage.

00:33:58.473 --> 00:33:59.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was me.

00:34:00.809 --> 00:34:03.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after the concerts were over,

00:34:03.687 --> 00:34:05.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt empty.

00:34:07.566 --> 00:34:11.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s nothing like the happiness
that comes from knowing

00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:13.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re doing what’s right before Jehovah.

00:34:15.032 --> 00:34:17.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
That happiness doesn’t fade,

00:34:17.034 --> 00:34:20.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it will always be there
because it comes from Jehovah.

00:34:29.963 --> 00:34:31.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I decided to leave the group,

00:34:31.965 --> 00:34:34.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
my dad was not pleased.

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:37.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had worked so hard for it.

00:34:40.724 --> 00:34:45.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things got, um,

00:34:45.687 --> 00:34:47.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
difficult.

00:34:49.399 --> 00:34:51.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
This opposition really pained me

00:34:51.735 --> 00:34:56.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my dad and I
had always enjoyed a beautiful friendship.

00:34:56.448 --> 00:34:58.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very close.

00:35:00.118 --> 00:35:04.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the way he treated us,
we never disrespected him.

00:35:04.539 --> 00:35:06.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were always kind to him.

00:35:06.667 --> 00:35:09.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of that,

00:35:09.044 --> 00:35:12.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
little by little he started to soften.

00:35:13.840 --> 00:35:17.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, one of my sons asked,

00:35:17.135 --> 00:35:19.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why don’t you invite him to a meeting?”

00:35:19.262 --> 00:35:21.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad’s eyes lit up, and he said,

00:35:21.807 --> 00:35:24.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve been wanting to go for some time now.”

00:35:24.184 --> 00:35:26.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we started studying with him.

00:35:27.729 --> 00:35:30.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that he had found the truth.

00:35:32.567 --> 00:35:35.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
He enrolled in the school;
he gave his first part.

00:35:37.114 --> 00:35:41.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the truth really touched him deeply.

00:35:41.994 --> 00:35:45.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked him one day during the study:

00:35:45.831 --> 00:35:49.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dad, tell me, what do you think now?

00:35:49.376 --> 00:35:53.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do you think I made a good decision
in leaving the group

00:35:53.422 --> 00:35:55.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and following this path

00:35:55.924 --> 00:35:59.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and dedicating my life to Jehovah?”

00:35:59.344 --> 00:36:02.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
He looked at me and said:

00:36:02.014 --> 00:36:04.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You did well.

00:36:04.266 --> 00:36:07.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You made a very good decision.

00:36:07.144 --> 00:36:12.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
I only wish I had been able
to raise all of you in the truth.”

00:36:14.568 --> 00:36:17.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad saw his children succeed,
accomplish so much,

00:36:17.738 --> 00:36:20.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see their dreams come true.

00:36:21.575 --> 00:36:25.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he realized that that wasn’t everything.

00:36:27.622 --> 00:36:30.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
He realized that true happiness

00:36:30.208 --> 00:36:33.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes from serving the Creator, Jehovah God.

00:36:34.212 --> 00:36:36.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminded me
of the words of the apostle Paul

00:36:36.506 --> 00:36:38.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 3:8.

00:36:38.967 --> 00:36:41.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that he considered what he did before

00:36:41.553 --> 00:36:43.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a lot of refuse.”

00:36:44.931 --> 00:36:46.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt the same.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were willing to leave everything behind.

00:36:50.353 --> 00:36:54.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a concert,
there was that emptiness inside.

00:36:54.566 --> 00:36:56.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so different to the way I feel

00:36:56.818 --> 00:37:00.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
after a meeting with the brothers and sisters

00:37:00.989 --> 00:37:03.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
or after I give a Bible study

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:08.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
or after a day serving at Bethel
with Roberto, my husband.

00:37:09.247 --> 00:37:12.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
That happiness doesn’t go away.

00:37:12.209 --> 00:37:14.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing better than that.

00:37:23.428 --> 00:37:26.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Francis doesn’t focus on what could’ve been

00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:29.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on the blessings of the present.

00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:32.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s seen the seeds of truth
take root within her family

00:37:32.395 --> 00:37:34.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now happily serves as a commuter

00:37:34.481 --> 00:37:37.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Dominican Republic branch
with her husband.

00:37:38.777 --> 00:37:43.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
She isn’t the only one
who followed this successful formula.

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:45.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see who else from the Bible

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:48.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed the same pattern
in this morning worship.

00:37:49.788 --> 00:37:52.999 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our Scripture text and article highlight

00:37:52.999 --> 00:37:55.293 line:10% position:50% align:center
the importance of submission

00:37:55.293 --> 00:37:58.672 line:10% position:50% align:center
and why we should submit to Jehovah.

00:37:58.672 --> 00:38:00.882 line:10% position:50% align:center
Of course, we find it a pleasure

00:38:00.882 --> 00:38:03.301 line:10% position:50% align:center
to submit to Jehovah because we love him.

00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:06.221 line:10% position:50% align:center
That’s why we submit to Jehovah.

00:38:06.221 --> 00:38:10.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is that occasion
when submitting to Jehovah is difficult.

00:38:10.475 --> 00:38:11.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s hard.

00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we have to take a firm stand
in front of opposers.

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to stand up for Jehovah.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:19.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means we stick out from the world.

00:38:19.818 --> 00:38:21.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s hard.

00:38:21.611 --> 00:38:24.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps we have to change something
in our personal life

00:38:24.573 --> 00:38:29.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring our life more in harmony
with Jehovah’s will and standards.

00:38:29.119 --> 00:38:30.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s hard.

00:38:31.329 --> 00:38:33.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps we want
to give wholehearted support

00:38:33.623 --> 00:38:35.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
to an organizational adjustment
or arrangement

00:38:35.834 --> 00:38:37.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we don’t fully understand.

00:38:37.878 --> 00:38:39.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
That may be hard.

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:42.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can help us?

00:38:42.883 --> 00:38:47.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Confidence that God is with his people.

00:38:49.264 --> 00:38:54.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we know that God is with his people,
with us,

00:38:54.269 --> 00:38:56.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we know he will bless us.

00:38:56.521 --> 00:39:00.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each time we’re going to make
any adjustment in our life

00:39:00.567 --> 00:39:05.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
or submit to Jehovah’s way of doing things,
we’re going to get a blessing.

00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:07.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we have such confidence?

00:39:07.532 --> 00:39:09.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:39:09.117 --> 00:39:13.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we can say
that Jehovah gives us signs,

00:39:13.705 --> 00:39:17.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
or solid evidence, that he is with us.

00:39:17.792 --> 00:39:19.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, let’s open our Bibles

00:39:19.794 --> 00:39:23.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Isaiah chapter 7.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:25.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back in time

00:39:25.508 --> 00:39:29.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
and review this historical account
in Isaiah chapter 7.

00:39:30.972 --> 00:39:34.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
The background is in verses 1 and 2,

00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:37.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the days of King Ahaz.

00:39:37.103 --> 00:39:39.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what we can learn.

00:39:39.522 --> 00:39:44.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham
son of Uzziah, the king of Judah,

00:39:44.361 --> 00:39:46.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
“King Rezin of Syria

00:39:46.863 --> 00:39:51.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Pekah son of Remaliah,
the king of Israel,

00:39:51.076 --> 00:39:54.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“came up to wage war against Jerusalem,

00:39:54.287 --> 00:39:56.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but he could not capture it.

00:39:57.415 --> 00:39:59.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A report was made to the house of David:

00:39:59.668 --> 00:40:03.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Syria has joined forces with Ephraim.’

00:40:03.964 --> 00:40:07.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the heart of Ahaz
and the heart of his people

00:40:07.926 --> 00:40:12.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
began to tremble, like the trees
of the forest shaking in the wind.”

00:40:13.431 --> 00:40:16.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s true;
the situation was terrifying.

00:40:16.476 --> 00:40:19.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both the king of Israel and the king of Syria
joined forces.

00:40:19.771 --> 00:40:22.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
They declared war on Judah.

00:40:22.565 --> 00:40:23.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted to dethrone Ahaz as the king

00:40:26.987 --> 00:40:31.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and replace him with another man, perhaps
one who was not in the line of David.

00:40:32.742 --> 00:40:37.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what a triumph that would be for Satan
if he could install

00:40:37.163 --> 00:40:41.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
his own diabolical dynasty
on the throne in Jerusalem!

00:40:41.251 --> 00:40:43.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Jehovah allow that?

00:40:44.212 --> 00:40:46.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Ahaz do?
What effect did it have on him?

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:49.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he show faith and confidence in Jehovah?

00:40:50.969 --> 00:40:53.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
He began to tremble in fear.

00:40:53.263 --> 00:40:55.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 2 says tremble in fear,

00:40:55.557 --> 00:40:59.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like the trees of the forest shaking
in the wind”—no faith at all.

00:41:00.603 --> 00:41:02.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does Jehovah do?

00:41:02.772 --> 00:41:05.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, verse 11,

00:41:05.525 --> 00:41:08.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah continued speaking to Ahaz:

00:41:08.403 --> 00:41:11.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ask for a sign from Jehovah . . . ;

00:41:11.656 --> 00:41:14.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
[make it] as deep as the Grave
or as high as the sky.”

00:41:14.367 --> 00:41:16.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Ahaz, just ask for a sign.

00:41:16.578 --> 00:41:18.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to help you.’

00:41:19.664 --> 00:41:21.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what does Ahaz say?

00:41:21.082 --> 00:41:23.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘No, I’m not going to ask for a sign.’

00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:25.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah says: ‘What?

00:41:25.712 --> 00:41:27.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’re not going to ask for a sign?

00:41:27.922 --> 00:41:30.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m going to give you a sign.’

00:41:30.425 --> 00:41:32.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s in verse 14:

00:41:33.595 --> 00:41:37.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, Jehovah himself
will give you a sign:

00:41:37.682 --> 00:41:41.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! The young woman
will become pregnant

00:41:41.478 --> 00:41:45.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and will give birth to a son,

00:41:45.732 --> 00:41:48.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she will name him Immanuel.”

00:41:50.111 --> 00:41:52.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assures Ahaz

00:41:52.864 --> 00:41:56.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
that He will protect the line of David,

00:41:56.576 --> 00:41:59.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just with words, notice, but with a sign.

00:41:59.746 --> 00:42:01.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You’re going to have this son.

00:42:01.748 --> 00:42:04.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to see a boy named Immanuel.’

00:42:04.876 --> 00:42:07.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that name is not just random.

00:42:07.545 --> 00:42:09.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name means something.

00:42:09.255 --> 00:42:11.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name means “With Us Is God.”

00:42:11.925 --> 00:42:13.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Ahaz, with us is God.

00:42:13.927 --> 00:42:18.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’m not going to allow the covenant
that I made with David to be broken.

00:42:18.431 --> 00:42:21.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ahaz, I don’t tell lies,’ Jehovah says.

00:42:21.309 --> 00:42:25.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I don’t tell lies to David’ (Psalm 89:35)

00:42:26.773 --> 00:42:28.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a sign.

00:42:28.441 --> 00:42:30.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happens?

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:34.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 16, Jehovah gets more specific:

00:42:35.698 --> 00:42:39.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before the boy knows how to reject
the bad and choose the good,

00:42:39.661 --> 00:42:42.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the land of the two kings whom you dread

00:42:42.497 --> 00:42:45.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be completely abandoned.”

00:42:45.291 --> 00:42:48.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, notice, that’s exactly what happened.

00:42:48.002 --> 00:42:50.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
The birth of Immanuel held true,

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:53.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before the boy was old enough
to know between good and bad,

00:42:53.842 --> 00:42:57.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
those two kings, Pekah and Rezin,
were killed.

00:42:57.053 --> 00:42:59.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were out of the picture.

00:42:59.055 --> 00:43:00.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:03.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because God is with his people.

00:43:03.726 --> 00:43:06.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the lesson: Immanuel.

00:43:07.814 --> 00:43:12.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah goes further, chapter 8 and verse 10.

00:43:12.819 --> 00:43:15.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a warning this is for all of us
and for all of those 

00:43:15.989 --> 00:43:19.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
who want to try to oppose
Jehovah’s way of doing things!

00:43:19.033 --> 00:43:21.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice chapter 8 and verse 10.

00:43:21.327 --> 00:43:23.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no conspiracy that can win

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:27.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
or somehow interrupt Jehovah’s purpose.

00:43:28.501 --> 00:43:30.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 10 says:

00:43:30.670 --> 00:43:35.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Devise a plan, but it will be thwarted!

00:43:35.550 --> 00:43:39.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Say what you like, but it will not succeed,

00:43:39.471 --> 00:43:43.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God is with us!”

00:43:43.016 --> 00:43:46.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a warning to all those who oppose Jehovah.

00:43:46.519 --> 00:43:50.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the days of Hezekiah,
you had the Assyrians—185,000 Assyrians.

00:43:50.857 --> 00:43:53.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Fine!
Camp out near Jerusalem;

00:43:53.276 --> 00:43:55.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re going to die.’—185,000 died.

00:43:55.570 --> 00:43:56.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:43:56.279 --> 00:44:00.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because clearly God is with his people
and the royal line of David.

00:44:00.658 --> 00:44:02.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
No conspiracy will succeed.

00:44:04.621 --> 00:44:07.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does this mean for you and me?

00:44:07.081 --> 00:44:09.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this mean for us?

00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:10.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it have meaning?

00:44:10.835 --> 00:44:14.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we have confidence
that God is with us today?

00:44:14.172 --> 00:44:19.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s open our Bibles
to Matthew 1:23,

00:44:20.094 --> 00:44:22.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 1:23.

00:44:22.096 --> 00:44:25.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we have now the angel
speaking to Joseph about the birth of Jesus.

00:44:25.433 --> 00:44:28.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what he says in verse 23:

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:34.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look! The virgin will become pregnant
and will give birth to a son,

00:44:34.067 --> 00:44:37.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and they will name him Immanuel’
[there it is again],

00:44:37.487 --> 00:44:42.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means, when translated,
‘With Us Is God.’”

00:44:42.283 --> 00:44:44.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the connection?

00:44:44.285 --> 00:44:46.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name Immanuel comes up again,

00:44:46.496 --> 00:44:49.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this time it represents Christ Jesus

00:44:49.207 --> 00:44:53.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his role, his leadership, his rulership—

00:44:53.753 --> 00:44:55.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
the title given to Jesus.

00:44:55.755 --> 00:44:57.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see the connection?

00:44:57.757 --> 00:45:01.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophecy about Immanuel
is completely fulfilled in Jesus.

00:45:01.678 --> 00:45:03.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rules as our heavenly King.

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of the blessing
and the protection of his rulership,

00:45:06.724 --> 00:45:11.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have every reason to declare
with confidence today,

00:45:11.187 --> 00:45:13.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With us is God.”

00:45:14.899 --> 00:45:17.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see the signs?

00:45:17.026 --> 00:45:21.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see the evidence that Jehovah
is giving us to prove he is with us?

00:45:21.990 --> 00:45:26.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see Jesus living up
to that wonderful name, Immanuel?

00:45:28.538 --> 00:45:30.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:45:30.748 --> 00:45:35.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
several weeks ago,
we had a report from the Writing Committee.

00:45:35.503 --> 00:45:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
And despite the obstacles of the past year
—do you recall that report?—

00:45:39.716 --> 00:45:42.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work in the Writing Department,
Art Department,

00:45:42.302 --> 00:45:46.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
MEPS, Text Processing,
and Translation Services didn’t stop.

00:45:46.306 --> 00:45:49.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t even slow down.

00:45:49.267 --> 00:45:53.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible translations in 2019, 33 were released;

00:45:53.313 --> 00:45:55.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 2020, 33 were released.

00:45:55.898 --> 00:45:58.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Add the comments from Wednesday
about a country

00:45:58.776 --> 00:46:00.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is now having
more and more Bible studies

00:46:00.862 --> 00:46:04.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an increase in interested ones
and baptisms

00:46:04.741 --> 00:46:07.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
—these are more than just updates.

00:46:07.076 --> 00:46:10.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are more than just statistics.

00:46:10.747 --> 00:46:13.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we see them as evidences

00:46:13.082 --> 00:46:15.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “with us is God”

00:46:15.293 --> 00:46:18.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he is backing us up
in our undertakings?

00:46:18.504 --> 00:46:20.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we want to understand.

00:46:20.965 --> 00:46:23.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we’re not perfect.

00:46:23.301 --> 00:46:26.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll get there at the end
of the Thousand Year Reign.

00:46:26.054 --> 00:46:28.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
But compare the leadership and rulership

00:46:28.348 --> 00:46:32.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Immanuel, Christ Jesus,
with the world’s leadership.

00:46:32.101 --> 00:46:34.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look what we have.

00:46:34.103 --> 00:46:36.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s wonderful to contemplate.

00:46:36.606 --> 00:46:39.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the lesson for you and me?

00:46:40.276 --> 00:46:44.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t miss the clear evidence
that God is with us.

00:46:44.656 --> 00:46:48.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep your spiritual vision sharp and clear.

00:46:48.493 --> 00:46:49.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s a tip.

00:46:51.454 --> 00:46:54.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
After reading a portion of the Bible,

00:46:54.374 --> 00:46:58.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask yourself: ‘How did Jehovah

00:46:58.211 --> 00:47:02.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘keep his word in this situation?

00:47:02.382 --> 00:47:06.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does this show God is with us today?’

00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then take that knowledge and assimilate it

00:47:10.723 --> 00:47:13.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
into your own life
and personal circumstances.

00:47:13.351 --> 00:47:17.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Build your confidence
in the situation that you are in.

00:47:19.315 --> 00:47:21.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned?

00:47:21.859 --> 00:47:24.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) When we know that God is with us,

00:47:24.987 --> 00:47:27.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are convinced
that he will bless us every time

00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:32.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to bring ourselves
into submission to Jehovah.

00:47:32.328 --> 00:47:36.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
And (2) in Ahaz’s day,

00:47:36.582 --> 00:47:39.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah assured him
that He would protect the line of David,

00:47:39.669 --> 00:47:42.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just with words, but with a sign:

00:47:42.797 --> 00:47:46.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
a boy, Immanuel, “With Us Is God.”

00:47:46.426 --> 00:47:51.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Jesus, in his role as Immanuel,
rules as our heavenly King.

00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:53.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of the blessing of his rulership,

00:47:53.558 --> 00:47:58.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have every reason to declare
with confidence: “With us is God.”

00:47:58.855 --> 00:48:02.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sign of Immanuel is all around us.

00:48:02.066 --> 00:48:06.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question is,
Do we see and appreciate the evidence?

00:48:08.197 --> 00:48:11.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has never abandoned his servants,

00:48:11.159 --> 00:48:13.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will not start with you.

00:48:13.578 --> 00:48:16.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep looking for the evidence
that he is with you now.

00:48:19.167 --> 00:48:22.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next in our program,
we’ll hone our skills in the ministry

00:48:22.462 --> 00:48:25.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
by using our website in the next installment

00:48:25.298 --> 00:48:28.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Iron Sharpens Iron.</i>

00:48:29.218 --> 00:48:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi!
I am Jacob.

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:34.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.” </i>

00:48:42.982 --> 00:48:45.276 line:10% position:50% align:center
Being an effective minister

00:48:45.276 --> 00:48:48.404 line:10% position:50% align:center
means being familiar with our message

00:48:49.781 --> 00:48:52.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the tools we use to share it.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those tools

00:48:56.162 --> 00:48:59.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
is  <i>JW Library®.</i>

00:48:59.123 --> 00:49:01.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows us to download,

00:49:01.417 --> 00:49:04.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
organize, and study our publications.

00:49:06.088 --> 00:49:08.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve got tons of notes with gems

00:49:08.257 --> 00:49:10.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
from personal study.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:15.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another tool is jw.org.

00:49:16.808 --> 00:49:21.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s special
because of a powerful search engine

00:49:21.437 --> 00:49:25.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ability to easily switch languages.

00:49:25.024 --> 00:49:28.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the first place
many interested people search

00:49:28.277 --> 00:49:30.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
for more information.

00:49:31.239 --> 00:49:35.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
These features make it
an invaluable tool for our ministry.

00:49:37.328 --> 00:49:40.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can it make us better?

00:49:41.290 --> 00:49:43.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see in this demonstration.

00:49:51.551 --> 00:49:53.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is everything OK?

00:49:54.428 --> 00:49:55.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sorry.

00:49:56.222 --> 00:49:58.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something just reminded me of my dad.

00:49:59.517 --> 00:50:01.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
No need to be sorry.

00:50:01.394 --> 00:50:03.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to talk about it?

00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:11.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
The smallest things remind me that

00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:13.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s not here.

00:50:13.573 --> 00:50:16.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
One moment I’m fine

00:50:16.909 --> 00:50:18.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the next in tears.

00:50:20.997 --> 00:50:23.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is something that helps me
when I get overwhelmed.

00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:25.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a promise for our future.

00:50:36.178 --> 00:50:39.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he will wipe out every tear
from their eyes,

00:50:39.348 --> 00:50:42.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and death will be no more,
neither will mourning

00:50:42.518 --> 00:50:45.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor outcry nor pain be anymore.

00:50:45.313 --> 00:50:48.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
The former things have passed away.”

00:50:48.149 --> 00:50:51.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
This scripture has gotten me
through some of the worst times in my life.

00:50:53.279 --> 00:50:56.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s also an amazing article

00:50:56.032 --> 00:50:58.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
that goes through each piece of the promise.

00:51:00.202 --> 00:51:03.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister could have used  <i>JW Library </i>

00:51:03.873 --> 00:51:06.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
to look up the scripture,

00:51:06.584 --> 00:51:08.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that would be fine.

00:51:08.836 --> 00:51:12.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by using jw.org,

00:51:12.256 --> 00:51:14.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
she had the scripture,

00:51:14.967 --> 00:51:17.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
related articles,

00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:20.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and videos right at her fingertips.

00:51:20.932 --> 00:51:23.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
The search page acted as her guide.

00:51:25.186 --> 00:51:29.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Depending on the language you choose
on jw.org,

00:51:29.106 --> 00:51:31.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
the search results can vary,

00:51:31.359 --> 00:51:35.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
since not every article or video
is available in all languages.

00:51:36.948 --> 00:51:39.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you will find something helpful

00:51:39.116 --> 00:51:41.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
related to your entered scripture.

00:51:41.869 --> 00:51:45.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could focus on really listening

00:51:45.122 --> 00:51:47.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being a compassionate person.

00:51:49.168 --> 00:51:52.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if she didn’t have
a scripture in mind to share?

00:51:53.422 --> 00:51:55.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what she does now.

00:52:05.267 --> 00:52:08.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a video of those
who felt the pain of losing a loved one,

00:52:08.437 --> 00:52:10.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is how they coped.

00:52:20.866 --> 00:52:25.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, effectively searching with jw.org

00:52:25.871 --> 00:52:27.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
proved helpful.

00:52:27.999 --> 00:52:30.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice her search terms?

00:52:32.169 --> 00:52:35.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
She chose words specific to the situation

00:52:35.798 --> 00:52:38.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
but general enough to encompass

00:52:38.467 --> 00:52:41.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
a variety of articles and videos.

00:52:42.638 --> 00:52:44.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
If she only typed in “death,”

00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:48.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
articles on Jesus’ death

00:52:48.352 --> 00:52:50.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being afraid of death

00:52:50.354 --> 00:52:52.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be featured

00:52:52.398 --> 00:52:54.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not helpful in this situation.

00:52:55.234 --> 00:52:57.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by focusing the topic,

00:52:57.361 --> 00:53:02.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
the right article or video is a click away.

00:53:03.659 --> 00:53:08.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember the benefit of using jw.org?

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:13.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her workmate
can now explore the site on her own.

00:53:14.128 --> 00:53:16.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what can we do

00:53:16.672 --> 00:53:19.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
if the householder speaks
a different language?

00:53:27.391 --> 00:53:36.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
[Speaking Chinese]

00:53:36.692 --> 00:53:39.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!
Your Chinese is pretty good.

00:53:39.070 --> 00:53:40.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s pretty much all I got.

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:42.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where are you visiting from?

00:53:45.159 --> 00:53:48.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I show you how to find more answers
from the Bible?

00:53:48.287 --> 00:53:49.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:53:50.873 --> 00:53:53.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
On this website,
you will find the digital version

00:53:53.709 --> 00:53:56.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the brochure you have and many others.

00:53:56.712 --> 00:54:00.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you want to read the site
in a different language,

00:54:00.257 --> 00:54:02.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
you tap here.

00:54:03.511 --> 00:54:04.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s Mandarin.

00:54:04.553 --> 00:54:05.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you!

00:54:05.596 --> 00:54:06.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re welcome.

00:54:08.849 --> 00:54:12.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
We give people the Bible’s powerful message

00:54:12.895 --> 00:54:15.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the language of their heart.

00:54:17.274 --> 00:54:22.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take time to get familiar with jw.org.

00:54:22.154 --> 00:54:25.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not practice searching
your favorite scriptures

00:54:25.866 --> 00:54:28.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing the related articles
that come up?

00:54:28.994 --> 00:54:31.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you can rehearse switching the website

00:54:31.413 --> 00:54:34.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a language others commonly speak
in your area.

00:54:35.835 --> 00:54:37.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
By sharpening our skills,

00:54:37.837 --> 00:54:41.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can focus on the people in front of us

00:54:41.549 --> 00:54:45.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help them get to know our God, Jehovah.

00:54:46.887 --> 00:54:49.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Practice these skills, and small interactions

00:54:49.765 --> 00:54:52.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
can turn into meaningful conversations.

00:54:54.019 --> 00:54:58.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video
shows how small acts of kindness

00:54:58.149 --> 00:55:01.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
can blossom into something unexpected.

00:55:20.254 --> 00:55:28.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I drive my car or I take a train,
there’s an angry world out there.

00:55:28.762 --> 00:55:36.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each day arrives, and so many lives
have heavy loads to bear.

00:55:36.187 --> 00:55:44.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then Jehovah’s words come back to me,
‘Be patient, calm, and kind,

00:55:44.195 --> 00:55:53.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no matter where, say a silent prayer
for a peaceful state of mind.’

00:55:53.954 --> 00:56:02.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living peacefully in a peaceless world
is easier said than done.

00:56:02.171 --> 00:56:11.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you can do it now, just imagine
how it’ll feel when the new world comes!

00:56:15.935 --> 00:56:24.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I get to work, and the day seems good,
but I’m feeling things might change.

00:56:24.318 --> 00:56:32.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without a doubt, the storm breaks out,
but I’m keeping out of range.

00:56:32.243 --> 00:56:39.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall the words that I read before:
‘Life’s more than what you see’—

00:56:39.917 --> 00:56:49.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
That ‘Behind the scorn may be a heart
that’s torn and in need of sympathy.’

00:56:49.843 --> 00:56:57.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living peacefully in a peaceless world
is easier said than done.

00:56:57.810 --> 00:57:06.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you can do it now, just imagine
how it’ll feel when the new world comes!

00:57:06.485 --> 00:57:14.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s never an easy ride
When you’re going against the tide.

00:57:14.201 --> 00:57:24.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a world that’s lost and torn apart,
‘The God of peace will guard your heart.’

00:57:39.727 --> 00:57:47.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the weekend comes, and we’re taking
turns sharing good news door to door,

00:57:47.985 --> 00:57:56.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
But something someone heard brings
an angry word, and we hear the lion roar.

00:57:56.243 --> 00:58:04.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the Bible’s words speaking loud
and clear, we prepare to ‘take our leave.’

There’s “no wood” about, so “the fire
goes out,” and we go our way in peace.

00:58:14.053 --> 00:58:21.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living peacefully in a peaceless world
is easier said than done.

00:58:21.852 --> 00:58:30.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you can do it now, just imagine
how it’ll feel when the new world comes!

we treat our neighbors

00:59:04.186 --> 00:59:06.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
can move them to serve God.

We learned in this program that as
Bible prophecy is fulfilled before our eyes,

00:59:10.984 --> 00:59:13.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
our trust in Jehovah grows.

00:59:14.196 --> 00:59:16.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We help others gain that same trust

00:59:16.407 --> 00:59:19.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
by preaching the good news
using the latest tools.

00:59:20.411 --> 00:59:24.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
We trust that Jehovah values
our sacrifices to put the Kingdom first.

00:59:25.707 --> 00:59:29.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we trust that he’ll fulfill
all his promises in due time.

in the country in the 1930’s,

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:12.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the truth began to spread.

01:00:12.337 --> 01:00:16.967 line:90% position:50% align:center

to call out from the heights above.”

01:00:47.998 --> 01:00:52.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
