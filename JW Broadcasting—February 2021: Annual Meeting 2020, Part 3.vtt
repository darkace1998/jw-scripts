We’d like to welcome all of you
to JW Broadcasting®

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:08.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for February 2021!

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.814 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In Parts 1 and 2 of the annual meeting,

00:00:30.814 --> 00:00:33.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we enjoyed encouraging announcements,

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:37.020 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
videos, talks, and interviews.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’ll enjoy the final part
of the annual meeting.

00:00:42.358 --> 00:00:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please pay close attention
as we begin with a talk

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother Kenneth Cook entitled

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will You Keep Standing Among the Righteous?”

00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:57.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live in a time of judgment.

00:00:57.373 --> 00:01:00.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not talking
about flawed human judgment.

00:01:00.343 --> 00:01:02.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re talking about the perfect judgment 

00:01:02.712 --> 00:01:04.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes from the heavenly Kingdom

00:01:04.781 --> 00:01:07.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jesus’ hands.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus spoke of this judgment
in his great prophecy

00:01:10.553 --> 00:01:15.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the “last days” found
in Matthew chapters 24 and 25.

00:01:15.525 --> 00:01:18.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After outlining what we could expect to see,

00:01:18.394 --> 00:01:22.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he provided three parables
that deal with final judgment.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:25.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Matthew chapter 25,

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:29.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first two parables
relate to the final sealing

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:31.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of genuine anointed ones.

00:01:31.374 --> 00:01:33.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These parables will be fulfilled

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:36.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not long before the great tribulation begins.

00:01:36.813 --> 00:01:39.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, in the third parable,

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:42.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gives attention to the rest of mankind.

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:45.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the opening four verses

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:48.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what he said starting in verse 31:

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the Son of man comes in his glory,
and all the angels with him,

00:01:54.831 --> 00:01:57.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then he will sit down
on his glorious throne.

00:01:57.934 --> 00:02:00.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All the nations will be gathered before him,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he will separate people
one from another,

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:07.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as a shepherd separates
the sheep from the goats.

00:02:07.844 --> 00:02:10.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he will put the sheep on his right hand,

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the goats on his left.

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:16.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then the King will say
to those on his right:

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Come, you who have been blessed
by my Father,

00:02:19.756 --> 00:02:22.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘inherit the Kingdom prepared for you

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the founding of the world.’”

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Inherit the Kingdom,”

00:02:27.897 --> 00:02:30.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in other words, Paradise,

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the earthly realm of the Kingdom.

00:02:32.535 --> 00:02:34.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When is this fulfilled?

00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:38.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Jesus comes in his glory, he said,

00:02:38.107 --> 00:02:40.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and judges those then living.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that this judgment would result

00:02:43.947 --> 00:02:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a figurative separating of people 

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:49.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his right hand and to his left hand,

00:02:49.052 --> 00:02:52.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like separating sheep from goats.

00:02:52.322 --> 00:02:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus calls those
at his right hand “righteous.”

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he calls those
separated to his left hand “cursed,”

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sends them off
into everlasting destruction.

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:06.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the first two parables

00:03:06.903 --> 00:03:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involve judgment that takes place

00:03:09.405 --> 00:03:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the great tribulation,

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:14.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about this third parable?

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When does Jesus start
to identify the righteous sheep

00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:20.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the cursed goats?

00:03:21.584 --> 00:03:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Back in 1995,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  helped us to understand

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:29.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the final judgment of the sheep
and the goats will be decided 

00:03:29.492 --> 00:03:33.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus comes in his glory
during the great tribulation.

00:03:33.863 --> 00:03:38.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this mean that the judgment process
does not start until then?

00:03:38.768 --> 00:03:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is no.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why can we say this?

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:44.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s illustrate the point.

00:03:44.774 --> 00:03:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about judgments
delivered by a Supreme Court.

00:03:48.611 --> 00:03:51.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the day arrives
for a judgment to be announced,

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:54.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does this mean that only then the court

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:56.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starts to consider the evidence at hand?

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:00.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By that time,
the court has already read briefs,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have prepared and heard oral arguments,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they consider
the legal background to the case.

00:04:08.164 --> 00:04:11.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This may take considerable time.

00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:14.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No court opinion is considered final

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until it is delivered in open court

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:18.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or released to the public.

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:20.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the point?

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:23.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if the Supreme Courts
of human governments

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:25.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take time to hear all the facts

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to weigh all the circumstances,

00:04:27.817 --> 00:04:29.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should we be surprised that Jesus

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:32.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is wisely using his time now

00:04:32.155 --> 00:04:34.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to judge people fairly?

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:37.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the start of the great tribulation,

00:04:37.026 --> 00:04:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will know who
is goatlike and who is sheeplike.

00:04:40.863 --> 00:04:42.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

00:04:42.365 --> 00:04:45.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, consider this:
To a degree, even we can see

00:04:45.568 --> 00:04:47.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where people are choosing to stand.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, the Bible foretold
that this would be the case

00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:53.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Malachi chapter 3.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There we find prophetic words
that point ahead

00:04:56.946 --> 00:04:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to events in the first century

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:01.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in modern times.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verse 18 says that we would

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“see the distinction between
a righteous person and a wicked person,

00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:10.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“between one serving God

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one not serving him.”

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:15.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we can see the distinction,

00:05:15.765 --> 00:05:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can be certain
that Jesus is far ahead of us.

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Jesus see?

00:05:22.071 --> 00:05:25.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can be sure
that he’s carefully watching

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:30.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the attitudes, actions,
and speech of each person.

00:05:30.213 --> 00:05:34.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, he sees
their response to the good news.

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:37.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, Jesus is observing

00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:40.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether individuals support
his anointed brothers

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will serve with him in the Kingdom.

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:46.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 25:35-40,

00:05:46.896 --> 00:05:51.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that his brothers
would experience many trials.

00:05:51.501 --> 00:05:55.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he explained that those
whom he judges as sheep

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:58.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are the ones who assist his brothers.

00:05:58.074 --> 00:06:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also said that he views
what is done to them

00:06:02.178 --> 00:06:04.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as being done to him.

00:06:06.015 --> 00:06:08.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While Christ’s brothers will undoubtedly face

00:06:08.418 --> 00:06:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trials during the great tribulation,

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:13.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how are they helped now?

00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:15.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing good to Christ’s brothers now

00:06:15.958 --> 00:06:18.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
includes working
along with them as they strive

00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to complete the preaching
of the good news of the Kingdom.

00:06:22.598 --> 00:06:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus takes note of this.

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else does Jesus observe?

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 12:36, 37,

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:36.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus stated that a person’s words
would also be a basis

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:39.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for how he or she is judged.

00:06:39.982 --> 00:06:41.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at what Jesus said

00:06:41.984 --> 00:06:45.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 12:36, 37.

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:51.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “I tell you that men will render
an account on Judgment Day

00:06:51.828 --> 00:06:55.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for every unprofitable saying
that they speak;

00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:58.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for by your words
you will be declared righteous,

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:02.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by your words you will be condemned.”

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:06.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, does Jesus hear what we say?

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:08.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he does,

00:07:08.544 --> 00:07:12.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including what we have said
in preaching the good news.

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, by using the words
“render an account” here,

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was referring

00:07:19.322 --> 00:07:23.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what a person has said in the past.

00:07:23.192 --> 00:07:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That thought is reinforced
by the use of the past tense

00:07:26.929 --> 00:07:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 25:34-40 for the sheep

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:38.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 41-45 for the goats.

00:07:38.274 --> 00:07:42.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in verse 40,
Jesus says to the sheeplike ones:

00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:46.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the extent that you did it [past tense]

00:07:46.282 --> 00:07:48.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to one of the least of these my brothers,

00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you did it to me.”

00:07:51.521 --> 00:07:53.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this tell us?

00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:57.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tells us that everyone who desires
to be viewed as a righteous sheep

00:07:57.693 --> 00:08:02.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must build up a good record
of support for Christ’s brothers—now!

00:08:02.398 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A person must be sheeplike
when entering the great tribulation,

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they must remain sheeplike
to the very end.

00:08:10.873 --> 00:08:13.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time
“the Son of man comes in his glory,”

00:08:13.943 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be far too late to build up
such a good record with him.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:21.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is like the king mentioned

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:24.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Proverbs 20:8.

00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:26.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says:

00:08:26.422 --> 00:08:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the king sits on the throne to judge,

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:33.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he sifts out all evil with his eyes.”

00:08:33.496 --> 00:08:38.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In line with this, we can be certain
that Jesus, our heavenly King,

00:08:38.134 --> 00:08:40.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is already sifting and taking note

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:45.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of who are goatlike
in their attitudes, actions, and speech.

00:08:45.808 --> 00:08:50.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For those who continue refusing
to serve Jehovah and his Kingdom,

00:08:50.246 --> 00:08:54.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their judgment will be in place
as the great tribulation begins.

00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:58.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can say this
because there are no Scriptural indications

00:08:58.754 --> 00:09:03.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of any conversions to pure worship
during the great tribulation.

00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:08.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we read at Revelation 6:16, 17

00:09:08.264 --> 00:09:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that those who chose
not to obey the good news

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:15.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will at that time turn to man-made things
to try to save them.

00:09:15.938 --> 00:09:20.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will run to things that they view
as mountainlike, or strong,

00:09:20.109 --> 00:09:23.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as their political
and commercial systems.

00:09:23.646 --> 00:09:25.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 6:16 tells us

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they will cry out to such things saying:

00:09:28.684 --> 00:09:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Fall over us and hide us from the face

00:09:31.554 --> 00:09:33.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the One seated on the throne

00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:36.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from the wrath of the Lamb.”

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But these human institutions
will have no power to save them.

00:09:41.397 --> 00:09:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will this mean for such ones?

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:46.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many goatlike ones will perish

00:09:46.535 --> 00:09:48.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
early in the great tribulation

00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:53.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the governments of this world
turn on and destroy false religion.

00:09:53.576 --> 00:09:57.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many more will perish
at the hands of other goatlike people.

00:09:57.713 --> 00:10:00.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ezekiel 38:21 prophetically states

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:03.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “every man’s sword

00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:05.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be against his own brother.”

00:10:05.821 --> 00:10:08.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, all remaining goatlike ones

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:12.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will perish by means
of the angelic forces at Armageddon.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as for the sheeplike ones,

00:10:16.265 --> 00:10:19.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Fine Shepherd, Jesus,

00:10:19.001 --> 00:10:23.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will know each one of them
before the start of the great tribulation,

00:10:23.272 --> 00:10:26.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will observe their loyalty to Jehovah

00:10:26.442 --> 00:10:28.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the great tribulation.

00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:32.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, just before Armageddon begins,

00:10:32.448 --> 00:10:37.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will, in effect, sit down
as judge to make the final distinction

00:10:37.186 --> 00:10:41.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between the sheep and the goats
out of all people then living.

00:10:42.692 --> 00:10:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notably, in this third parable,

00:10:45.294 --> 00:10:49.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that those
who were at that time judged as goats

00:10:49.098 --> 00:10:51.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will call him Lord.

00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:53.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus will make it clear

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:56.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they did not support his brothers.

00:10:57.139 --> 00:11:00.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, any persons who were once sheeplike

00:11:00.576 --> 00:11:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but who failed to endure to the end

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:05.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by courageously supporting Christ’s brothers

00:11:05.981 --> 00:11:08.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be placed among the goats.

00:11:08.884 --> 00:11:12.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Referring to Jesus as Lord
will not save them.

00:11:12.788 --> 00:11:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will be too late to do good
for Christ’s brothers

00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will likely be with Jesus
in the heavenly Kingdom by that time.

00:11:20.429 --> 00:11:23.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the goats
will also include those enemies of God

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:27.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are still alive out of all the nations.

00:11:27.169 --> 00:11:30.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This final judging serves
an important purpose.

00:11:30.773 --> 00:11:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:11:32.608 --> 00:11:35.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will leave no doubt
in the eyes of all then living

00:11:35.811 --> 00:11:38.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as to who Jesus’ righteous sheep are

00:11:38.681 --> 00:11:42.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they prepare to enter the new world.

00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:46.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, strive to keep standing
among the righteous

00:11:46.288 --> 00:11:49.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be placed at Jesus’ right hand.

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:54.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word promises that as long
as sheeplike ones remain loyal to Him

00:11:54.530 --> 00:11:57.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to his appointed King, Jesus,

00:11:57.032 --> 00:12:00.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they will be guided into everlasting life.

00:12:00.703 --> 00:12:03.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such ones must display courage

00:12:03.005 --> 00:12:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by supporting the work of Christ’s brothers,

00:12:05.508 --> 00:12:09.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both now and during the great tribulation.

00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:12.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of courage will be needed?

00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage like that of Onesiphorus.

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:19.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul mentions
this faithful Christian

00:12:19.855 --> 00:12:23.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Timothy 1:16-18.

00:12:23.459 --> 00:12:25.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to read
what he said about him,

00:12:25.828 --> 00:12:28.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
starting in verse 16:

00:12:28.898 --> 00:12:33.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May the Lord grant mercy
to the household of Onesiphorus,

00:12:33.302 --> 00:12:35.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he often refreshed me,

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:39.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he did not become ashamed
of my prison chains.

00:12:39.308 --> 00:12:42.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the contrary, when he was in Rome,

00:12:42.044 --> 00:12:44.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he diligently looked for me and found me.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“May the Lord grant him to find mercy

00:12:47.716 --> 00:12:50.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Jehovah in that day.”

00:12:52.054 --> 00:12:56.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Onesiphorus would have been
an anointed Christian,

00:12:56.192 --> 00:13:00.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his example is one
for every Christian to imitate.

00:13:00.663 --> 00:13:03.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just visiting Paul
could have cost Onesiphorus

00:13:03.599 --> 00:13:05.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his freedom or his life.

00:13:05.935 --> 00:13:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that did not stop him from finding Paul

00:13:09.038 --> 00:13:11.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and refreshing him, did it?

00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:14.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Qualities such as Onesiphoruslike courage

00:13:14.610 --> 00:13:17.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be required of all sheeplike ones

00:13:17.279 --> 00:13:19.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the great tribulation.

00:13:20.115 --> 00:13:23.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in summary, Jesus is now observing

00:13:23.185 --> 00:13:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the actions, attitudes,
and speech of all people.

00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a thorough Judge,

00:13:29.592 --> 00:13:33.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will have identified
sheeplike ones and goatlike ones

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the start of the great tribulation.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:38.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, according to Jesus’ parable,

00:13:38.634 --> 00:13:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before Armageddon begins,

00:13:41.537 --> 00:13:46.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will pass final judgment
on all then living on earth,

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:49.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving attention to why the righteous sheep

00:13:49.044 --> 00:13:51.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are placed at his right hand.

00:13:51.146 --> 00:13:55.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you be found standing
among the righteous?

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:58.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To receive that blessing,
don’t be swayed by the things

00:13:58.153 --> 00:14:01.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you see taking place
around you in this world.

00:14:01.323 --> 00:14:04.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be swayed by popular protests.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:07.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain neutral—no part of it.

00:14:07.396 --> 00:14:10.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be swayed by political promises.

00:14:10.332 --> 00:14:13.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain neutral—no part of it.

00:14:13.502 --> 00:14:17.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be swayed as governments say,
“Peace and security!”

00:14:17.439 --> 00:14:20.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain neutral—no part of it.

00:14:20.476 --> 00:14:23.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when it comes to obeying God’s laws,

00:14:23.245 --> 00:14:27.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stand firmly on the side of the Kingdom.

00:14:27.182 --> 00:14:30.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only those who remain no part of the world

00:14:30.185 --> 00:14:33.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be viewed by Jesus as being sheeplike

00:14:33.522 --> 00:14:35.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the great tribulation begins

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when it wraps up at Armageddon.

00:14:39.194 --> 00:14:42.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And only those who continue
to support Jesus’ brothers

00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be placed at Jesus’ right hand

00:14:45.134 --> 00:14:47.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he makes the final judgment

00:14:47.136 --> 00:14:50.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the righteous sheep and the cursed goats.

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show where you desire to stand

00:14:53.142 --> 00:14:56.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all that you say and do right now.

00:14:56.111 --> 00:14:58.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:15:07.489 --> 00:15:09.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the end comes.

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Cook, for making clear

00:15:14.697 --> 00:15:18.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what a person does now
to support Jehovah’s arrangement

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:21.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is crucial in Christ’s final judgment
of the sheep

00:15:21.837 --> 00:15:25.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and goats just before Armageddon.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May all of us choose
to support true worship now

00:15:28.877 --> 00:15:32.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and on through the great tribulation
yet to come!

00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:37.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we are happy to share with you a video

00:15:37.019 --> 00:15:40.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about an upcoming video series.

00:15:40.122 --> 00:15:43.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Stephen Lett
is the host of this presentation.

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:47.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be delighted
with what he has to say.

00:15:49.331 --> 00:15:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said as recorded at Matthew 11:27:

00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:55.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one fully knows . . .

00:15:55.838 --> 00:15:59.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father except the Son

00:15:59.341 --> 00:16:04.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anyone to whom the Son
is willing to reveal him.”

00:16:04.947 --> 00:16:07.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This teaches us two things.

00:16:07.583 --> 00:16:10.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, that it is possible

00:16:10.285 --> 00:16:13.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to know the Father fully,

00:16:13.722 --> 00:16:18.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and second, that Jesus is the key
to knowing Jehovah.

00:16:19.728 --> 00:16:23.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus clearly identified his role

00:16:23.132 --> 00:16:25.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in revealing the Father.

00:16:25.534 --> 00:16:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On his last night here on earth,

00:16:28.037 --> 00:16:30.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he told his apostles

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:33.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at John 14:6:

00:16:33.776 --> 00:16:38.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am the way and the truth and the life.

00:16:38.147 --> 00:16:43.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one comes to the Father
except through me.”

00:16:44.453 --> 00:16:48.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only through Jesus
can we truly know the Father

00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:52.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have an approved relationship with Him.

00:16:52.161 --> 00:16:55.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, at the transfiguration,

00:16:55.497 --> 00:16:59.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah confirmed Jesus’ pivotal role

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:02.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he instructed
Peter, James, and John

00:17:02.237 --> 00:17:04.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen to Jesus.

00:17:05.841 --> 00:17:10.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For over a century,
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:17:10.245 --> 00:17:13.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has provided a wide range of study aids

00:17:13.782 --> 00:17:17.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us learn about the life, ministry,

00:17:17.152 --> 00:17:20.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teachings of Jesus Christ.

00:17:20.322 --> 00:17:23.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These gifts enrich our study of God’s Word.

00:17:23.959 --> 00:17:27.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They shed light on the world he lived in,

00:17:28.163 --> 00:17:30.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the places he walked,

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the towns where he preached,

00:17:35.104 --> 00:17:37.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the landscapes he saw,

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:40.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the food he ate,

00:17:41.543 --> 00:17:43.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the seasons

00:17:43.545 --> 00:17:46.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which various events took place.

00:17:47.182 --> 00:17:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These printed publications

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:52.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are more than just words on a page.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They illuminate Jesus’ personality

00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:57.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reveal his qualities,

00:17:57.226 --> 00:18:00.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which mirror those of his heavenly Father.

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:04.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn about Jesus’ compassion,

00:18:04.133 --> 00:18:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
self-sacrifice,

00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:09.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humility, power,

00:18:09.138 --> 00:18:12.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
boldness, courage,

00:18:12.207 --> 00:18:14.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love.

00:18:14.643 --> 00:18:16.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More important,

00:18:16.645 --> 00:18:20.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focusing on Jesus’ teachings and example

00:18:20.015 --> 00:18:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draw us closer to the One who sent him.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:26.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our meetings, assemblies, and conventions

00:18:26.488 --> 00:18:29.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also deepen our love and appreciation

00:18:29.391 --> 00:18:31.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for God’s Son.

00:18:31.393 --> 00:18:33.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In more recent years,

00:18:33.495 --> 00:18:36.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization has used videos

00:18:36.732 --> 00:18:38.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the hearts

00:18:38.734 --> 00:18:41.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all those attending our conventions.

00:18:42.704 --> 00:18:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how can we continue
to help honest-hearted ones

00:18:46.775 --> 00:18:51.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand Jesus’ role
as King and High Priest

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:55.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help them acquire
“the mind of Christ”?

00:18:56.285 --> 00:18:59.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, bringing events of Jesus’ ministry

00:18:59.188 --> 00:19:03.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to life on screen or on the printed page

00:19:03.258 --> 00:19:06.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not without its challenges.

00:19:08.297 --> 00:19:10.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know,

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body
had those full-costume dramas

00:19:12.868 --> 00:19:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for years at conventions,

00:19:15.437 --> 00:19:18.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but never was Jesus depicted.

00:19:18.273 --> 00:19:20.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can understand the challenge.

00:19:20.776 --> 00:19:22.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who’s going to play Jesus?

00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine trying
to select brothers in say 

00:19:27.783 --> 00:19:32.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
200-300 (or even more)
different places

00:19:32.554 --> 00:19:35.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to play the role of Jesus Christ?

00:19:35.290 --> 00:19:36.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then finally,

00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:40.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>‘For a Certainty God Made Him </i>
<i>Lord and Christ’ (Part I, Part II)</i>

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we went ahead, 
and the Governing Body approved it:

00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go ahead. Let’s have that.”

00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:46.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it worked very well.

00:19:46.735 --> 00:19:50.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you see Jesus 
with the woman that had a flow of blood

00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:54.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the tenderness shown in our video
of Jesus dealing with that woman

00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:58.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her fear
and yet her confidence

00:19:58.146 --> 00:20:02.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she could be healed by him
and the way Jesus treated her,

00:20:02.317 --> 00:20:05.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that conveyed something
that we would not always bring up

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our imagination.

00:20:08.323 --> 00:20:11.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So once we saw the reaction
from the brothers and sisters

00:20:11.026 --> 00:20:14.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how their hearts were touched
by this presentation—

00:20:14.596 --> 00:20:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could see
that this is a very effective way

00:20:17.199 --> 00:20:19.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to portray Jesus’ teachings.

00:20:19.301 --> 00:20:22.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could boost your spirituality more

00:20:22.004 --> 00:20:25.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than actually seeing
the Scriptures come alive?

00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:31.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here is a very exciting announcement:

00:20:31.947 --> 00:20:36.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body is pleased to announce

00:20:36.318 --> 00:20:40.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a very special video series about Jesus

00:20:40.489 --> 00:20:43.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is currently being developed.

00:20:43.325 --> 00:20:46.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Work is under way to develop and produce

00:20:46.828 --> 00:20:50.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new, live-action dramatic series

00:20:50.232 --> 00:20:52.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jesus Christ.

00:20:52.868 --> 00:20:55.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The title of the series is

00:20:55.637 --> 00:21:00.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:03.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This series will combine the strengths

00:21:03.312 --> 00:21:07.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all our preceding research and study tools

00:21:07.049 --> 00:21:11.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the power of the moving image

00:21:11.653 --> 00:21:16.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will enable the viewer
to gain an even deeper understanding

00:21:16.325 --> 00:21:19.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jesus’ life and ministry,

00:21:19.027 --> 00:21:23.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which in turn increases
our knowledge of Jehovah.

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:27.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although other religious
and commercial institutions

00:21:27.836 --> 00:21:31.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have produced various films
on the life of Jesus,

00:21:31.907 --> 00:21:36.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these have often been tainted
by unscriptural views of Jesus,

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:40.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they have placed excessive emphasis

00:21:40.248 --> 00:21:42.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on violence.

00:21:42.884 --> 00:21:45.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And existing video productions

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focus on one Bible book at a time

00:21:48.790 --> 00:21:53.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or only on specific episodes
of Jesus’ ministry on earth.

00:21:54.296 --> 00:21:56.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus, </i>

00:21:56.765 --> 00:21:59.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
however, will show all the events

00:21:59.901 --> 00:22:02.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John

00:22:02.437 --> 00:22:05.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the order in which they happened

00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in as much of the rich detail

00:22:08.477 --> 00:22:13.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as current research
and Bible understanding will allow.

00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:18.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, a presentation
like the one you are about to see

00:22:18.286 --> 00:22:22.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is shown
after a feature-length drama is released.

00:22:22.824 --> 00:22:25.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such behind-the-scenes videos

00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:27.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help us to understand and appreciate

00:22:27.996 --> 00:22:32.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
various facets of the video-making process.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:37.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, however,
we are giving you a preview

00:22:37.139 --> 00:22:39.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a first look—

00:22:39.141 --> 00:22:41.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at an upcoming convention project

00:22:41.610 --> 00:22:44.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will take years to complete.

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:48.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In view of the large scope of this project,

00:22:48.083 --> 00:22:50.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we encourage you

00:22:50.118 --> 00:22:53.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it a matter
of earnest prayer to Jehovah

00:22:53.822 --> 00:22:57.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and please support it

00:22:57.592 --> 00:23:00.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to your circumstances.

Would you like see
what Episode One might look like?

00:23:07.202 --> 00:23:11.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To provide an advance impression
of the look and feel of an episode,

00:23:11.873 --> 00:23:16.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Audio/Video Services prepares storyboards.

00:23:16.778 --> 00:23:19.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re pleased to share with you now

00:23:19.381 --> 00:23:24.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an excerpt from an animated storyboard.

00:23:37.232 --> 00:23:39.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assuming that he was

00:23:39.301 --> 00:23:41.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the group traveling together,

00:23:41.236 --> 00:23:42.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they went a day’s journey

00:23:42.804 --> 00:23:44.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then began to search for him

00:23:44.773 --> 00:23:47.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the relatives and acquaintances.

00:23:52.514 --> 00:23:54.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not finding him,

00:23:54.549 --> 00:23:56.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they returned to Jerusalem

00:23:56.685 --> 00:23:59.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made a diligent search for him.

00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:22.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, after three days,

00:24:22.077 --> 00:24:24.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they found him in the temple,

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:27.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sitting in the midst of the teachers

00:24:27.582 --> 00:24:28.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and listening to them

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:31.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asking them questions.

00:24:33.889 --> 00:24:36.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But all those listening to him

00:24:36.024 --> 00:24:38.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were in constant amazement

00:24:38.026 --> 00:24:40.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at his understanding and his answers.

00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:44.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now when his parents saw him,

00:24:44.733 --> 00:24:46.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were astounded.

00:24:54.643 --> 00:24:58.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Child, why did you treat us this way?

00:24:58.647 --> 00:25:00.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here your father and I

00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:03.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been frantically looking for you.

00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:06.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were you looking for me?

00:25:06.621 --> 00:25:08.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you not know that I must be

00:25:08.623 --> 00:25:11.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the house of my Father?

00:25:11.293 --> 00:25:13.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, they did not understand

00:25:13.295 --> 00:25:15.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he was saying to them.

00:25:15.297 --> 00:25:17.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he went down with them

00:25:17.299 --> 00:25:18.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and returned to Nazareth,

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he continued subject to them.

00:25:21.069 --> 00:25:23.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, his mother carefully kept

00:25:23.405 --> 00:25:25.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these sayings in her heart.

00:25:34.282 --> 00:25:37.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus went on progressing in wisdom

00:25:37.852 --> 00:25:40.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in physical growth

00:25:40.021 --> 00:25:42.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in favor with God and men.

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:48.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The true light that gives light

00:25:48.163 --> 00:25:50.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to every sort of man

00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:53.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was about to come into the world.

00:25:56.504 --> 00:25:59.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, this is not the final video.

00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:02.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, it’s an example

00:26:02.177 --> 00:26:06.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how the words on a page can come to life.

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:10.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preparing simple, basic drawings

00:26:10.151 --> 00:26:12.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to convey the idea of a video

00:26:12.821 --> 00:26:16.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is one of the early visual tools used

00:26:16.157 --> 00:26:18.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the approval process.

00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:23.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The animatic review is a very early milestone

00:26:23.565 --> 00:26:26.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the visual storytelling.

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:30.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how has the project been developed?

00:26:30.505 --> 00:26:33.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What direction has the Governing Body given

00:26:33.575 --> 00:26:37.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for bringing events
in Jesus’ life to the screen?

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So first of all,
the Governing Body approved the concept

00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:45.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of producing a production like this.

00:26:45.553 --> 00:26:47.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there were some questions, such as,

00:26:47.589 --> 00:26:49.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you do it?

00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:52.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So three options were given
to the Governing Body.

00:26:52.727 --> 00:26:54.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first option

00:26:54.729 --> 00:26:58.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was for us just to have
a theatrical stage production

00:26:58.833 --> 00:27:01.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
similar to what we’d already done.

00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:05.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second set of options involved

00:27:05.206 --> 00:27:08.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a narrator speaking

00:27:08.009 --> 00:27:11.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just reading the sections of Scripture

00:27:11.079 --> 00:27:13.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the background to have acting

00:27:13.415 --> 00:27:16.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not actually having Jesus speaking

00:27:16.117 --> 00:27:19.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or those involved with Jesus speaking.

00:27:19.888 --> 00:27:22.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then finally, the third option

00:27:22.357 --> 00:27:26.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—which is, of course, the hardest
and involves a lot of work—

00:27:26.561 --> 00:27:30.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to do a real-life drama.

00:27:30.098 --> 00:27:32.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were interested to see

00:27:32.133 --> 00:27:34.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the Governing Body would feel about this.

00:27:34.803 --> 00:27:37.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a joyous time it was
to hear the brothers say:

00:27:37.706 --> 00:27:40.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We want the best for the brotherhood.

00:27:40.308 --> 00:27:42.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We want them to be able to see

00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:46.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the power and impact of what Jesus taught.

00:27:46.114 --> 00:27:48.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we want the third option!”

00:27:48.316 --> 00:27:51.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then we realized
that there’s a lot of work ahead.

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:56.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s easy to think:
‘The inspired text is there.

00:27:56.157 --> 00:27:58.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s to write?’

00:27:58.159 --> 00:28:01.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not as simple
as just taking little, half-hour chunks

00:28:01.663 --> 00:28:03.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of the four Gospel accounts

00:28:03.965 --> 00:28:07.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and throwing them
on a script and filming them.

00:28:07.235 --> 00:28:09.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Which Gospel account do you use?

00:28:09.738 --> 00:28:12.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you use Matthew’s account?
Mark’s? Luke’s?

00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, very quickly we saw the need to lay each

00:28:15.677 --> 00:28:19.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the four Gospel accounts side by side

00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:22.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and decide which account

00:28:22.283 --> 00:28:24.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in every case, every event—

00:28:24.753 --> 00:28:27.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us the fullest picture,
the most details.

00:28:27.956 --> 00:28:32.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So even if you can’t say everything
that appears in all four accounts,

00:28:32.427 --> 00:28:35.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you use the one
to carry the bulk of the story,

00:28:35.930 --> 00:28:38.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the others provide
the rest of the details

00:28:38.433 --> 00:28:40.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll actually see.

00:28:40.468 --> 00:28:43.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers who help write the dramas

00:28:43.037 --> 00:28:45.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a tremendous amount of work to do.

00:28:45.774 --> 00:28:48.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then there are also those
who do the research

00:28:48.643 --> 00:28:51.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just to make sure little details are correct,

00:28:51.112 --> 00:28:53.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether it be the shoes a person has on

00:28:53.381 --> 00:28:55.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or whether he even wears shoes.

00:28:55.483 --> 00:28:58.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you show something on film,

00:28:58.553 --> 00:29:00.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are committing yourself.

00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:04.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are saying that this is the explanation

00:29:04.692 --> 00:29:07.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, in some cases, the application.

00:29:07.562 --> 00:29:10.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It goes beyond illustration;
it’s the explanation.

00:29:10.231 --> 00:29:12.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the way to understand what happened.

00:29:12.233 --> 00:29:14.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is what sticks
with people’s memories.

00:29:14.903 --> 00:29:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s a huge responsibility
to get that right.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:22.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our Research Department
already has a lot of information.

00:29:22.744 --> 00:29:26.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But doing something like this
is yet another step

00:29:26.848 --> 00:29:29.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
down the path of being very, very difficult

00:29:29.751 --> 00:29:32.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because there are
a lot more questions that come up.

00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:34.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are we going to depict the Devil?

00:29:34.389 --> 00:29:36.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you show Jesus walking on water?

00:29:36.191 --> 00:29:39.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What footwear was allowed in the <i>Soreg?</i>

00:29:39.394 --> 00:29:41.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s a <i>Soreg?</i>

00:29:41.429 --> 00:29:44.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Research is pivotal in this.

00:29:44.933 --> 00:29:48.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you make a decision about what to depict.

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:52.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then there are details when it comes

00:29:52.273 --> 00:29:56.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to not just telling it,
not just reading what happened,

00:29:56.411 --> 00:29:59.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now you have to show what happened.

00:29:59.914 --> 00:30:01.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you do that?

00:30:01.916 --> 00:30:04.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you take something that’s static,
like a piece of artwork

00:30:04.185 --> 00:30:06.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s well-researched with solid sources,

00:30:06.721 --> 00:30:10.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now bring it to life,
then in many respects,

00:30:10.024 --> 00:30:12.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more research needs to go into this

00:30:12.427 --> 00:30:15.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that everything is looked at
from various angles.

00:30:17.465 --> 00:30:20.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let me explain the challenge
we have with John chapter 6.

00:30:20.368 --> 00:30:23.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we look at Map 3B in the Appendix section,

00:30:23.972 --> 00:30:27.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just imagine we have the Sea of Galilee here.

00:30:27.542 --> 00:30:29.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, according to what it shows us,

00:30:29.611 --> 00:30:31.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have Magadan here on this side

00:30:31.946 --> 00:30:34.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Sea of Galilee,

00:30:34.315 --> 00:30:37.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and up here we have Capernaum.

00:30:37.085 --> 00:30:40.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, according to what this tells us,

00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:42.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus performed his miracle

00:30:42.156 --> 00:30:45.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
across on this side of the Sea of Galilee,

00:30:45.393 --> 00:30:48.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the apostles traveled by boat

00:30:48.263 --> 00:30:50.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this general area.

00:30:50.331 --> 00:30:53.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jesus joined up with them
when he walked on the water.

00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:56.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So according to John chapter 6,

00:30:56.237 --> 00:30:58.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus starts to teach the crowd

00:30:58.273 --> 00:31:01.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he is walking along the seashore.

00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:04.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But by the end of John chapter 6,

00:31:04.612 --> 00:31:08.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Jesus
is actually speaking at that time

00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:10.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here in Capernaum.

00:31:10.518 --> 00:31:12.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question comes up,

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What part of the dialogue

00:31:14.589 --> 00:31:17.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was actually stated here
in the synagogue in Capernaum,

00:31:17.926 --> 00:31:19.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what part was stated

00:31:19.961 --> 00:31:22.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along the seashore as he was walking along?

00:31:22.497 --> 00:31:26.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll have to do
some research into John chapter 6

00:31:26.367 --> 00:31:28.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see where there is a good break

00:31:28.503 --> 00:31:30.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to realize what words

00:31:30.505 --> 00:31:32.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were actually said there in the synagogue.

00:31:32.507 --> 00:31:34.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the challenge.

00:31:34.542 --> 00:31:38.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need for the friends
to be able to watch this video series

00:31:38.546 --> 00:31:40.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feel they’re actually there.

00:31:40.882 --> 00:31:43.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what they are seeing
is as close to the way

00:31:43.284 --> 00:31:45.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it must have been
as we can possibly make it.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the role of research
helps us to ensure that.

00:31:49.857 --> 00:31:52.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With scripts being developed and approved,

00:31:52.894 --> 00:31:55.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the production team continues work

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:57.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the visual look and feel of the series.

00:31:59.867 --> 00:32:01.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we found out
that the project involved

00:32:01.869 --> 00:32:03.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entirety of Jesus’ ministry,

00:32:03.805 --> 00:32:05.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was simply overwhelming.

00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:07.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we’ve read our script,
we go into a phase

00:32:07.976 --> 00:32:10.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we start working with storyboards.

00:32:10.578 --> 00:32:13.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Storyboards are kind of like a first pass

00:32:13.681 --> 00:32:15.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at what this story might look like.

00:32:16.918 --> 00:32:19.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s compiled
into what’s called an animatic,

00:32:19.387 --> 00:32:21.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is a type of video.

00:32:21.389 --> 00:32:23.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’ve got a narration,

00:32:23.424 --> 00:32:25.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ve got dialogue, and you’ve got music,

00:32:25.493 --> 00:32:27.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s to these cartoon boards.

00:32:27.996 --> 00:32:30.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s great because it gets you prepared

00:32:30.198 --> 00:32:32.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that on set,
the challenges don’t just pop up.

00:32:32.867 --> 00:32:34.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can anticipate them.

00:32:36.671 --> 00:32:38.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Concept art is a communication tool

00:32:38.673 --> 00:32:41.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us to get all on the same page.

00:32:42.443 --> 00:32:46.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Concept art helps us
to get the mood of it, the lighting,

00:32:47.415 --> 00:32:49.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to experience it maybe from a perspective

00:32:49.417 --> 00:32:51.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we hadn’t thought of before.

00:32:52.954 --> 00:32:56.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The story of Jesus’ ministry
isn’t just dry, cold facts.

00:32:56.090 --> 00:32:58.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s actually human stories.

00:32:58.526 --> 00:33:03.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we see how different people
responded and reacted to Jesus’ ministry

00:33:03.097 --> 00:33:05.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how they were shaped 
and molded by what they experienced—

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:07.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s essentially that character’s arc.

00:33:07.735 --> 00:33:09.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We go in and say:

00:33:09.704 --> 00:33:12.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“OK, where does our character start?
How does he grow?

00:33:12.974 --> 00:33:16.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And where is he by the end of this series?”

00:33:17.478 --> 00:33:19.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By seeing his struggles,
seeing his challenges,

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it makes that character more relatable.

00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:24.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As years of development passed,

00:33:25.887 --> 00:33:30.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the immense scope of this project
came into clear focus.

00:33:30.124 --> 00:33:32.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A natural question arose,

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where would we record it?

00:33:36.464 --> 00:33:38.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were doing the production of Jonah,

00:33:38.433 --> 00:33:40.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we used parts of southern California.

00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:42.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thought
that would be a very good location.

00:33:42.804 --> 00:33:45.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was proposed to the Governing Body,

00:33:45.773 --> 00:33:48.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they said, “Thank you very much,

00:33:48.643 --> 00:33:52.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but we would rather
that you use existing Bethel facilities

00:33:52.346 --> 00:33:53.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that would be available

00:33:53.848 --> 00:33:56.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that maybe are not being utilized
to their full potential.”

00:33:57.418 --> 00:34:00.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We worked with Worldwide Design/Construction,

00:34:00.354 --> 00:34:04.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they provided a list
of some of the branches that had space.

00:34:04.192 --> 00:34:07.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we were doing so,
it came to our attention

00:34:07.862 --> 00:34:12.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in Australasia,
the printery was about to be phased out.

00:34:13.134 --> 00:34:15.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the end of 2015,

00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:18.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the printing work was moved to Japan.

00:34:18.673 --> 00:34:20.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The press was then put up for sale.

00:34:20.475 --> 00:34:22.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It sold about three years later.

00:34:22.477 --> 00:34:24.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we had this big warehouse space

00:34:24.512 --> 00:34:27.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just what we needed for a studio.

00:34:28.049 --> 00:34:29.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were just stunned

00:34:29.951 --> 00:34:33.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think that such a project
could be accomplished here.

00:34:33.454 --> 00:34:36.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I think we’ve also seen so much evidence

00:34:36.157 --> 00:34:38.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s blessing on this project

00:34:38.459 --> 00:34:41.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s very clear
it’s something he wants.

00:34:41.729 --> 00:34:44.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The temporary accommodations
here at the branch

00:34:44.031 --> 00:34:46.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were due for demolition,

00:34:46.033 --> 00:34:49.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, I mean, like the bulldozers
were almost at the gate.

00:34:49.303 --> 00:34:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we were able to stop those bulldozers

00:34:52.573 --> 00:34:55.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as a result,
we’re currently renovating those residences.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:58.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s hand
was definitely in that experience.

00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:01.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without the stopping of that demolition,

00:35:01.582 --> 00:35:04.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wouldn’t have had enough accommodations 
to look after this project.

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:09.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if Jehovah
was dropping this option in our laps

00:35:09.724 --> 00:35:13.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all the criteria
that we needed to do this project.

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:15.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the primary location selected,

00:35:16.898 --> 00:35:20.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Production Design helps take a concept

00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:22.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and make it a reality.

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:28.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our goal as Production Design
is to immerse the audience in the story.

00:35:28.876 --> 00:35:32.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they have that sense,
now they’re paying attention

00:35:32.146 --> 00:35:35.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what’s being said on screen

00:35:35.683 --> 00:35:38.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what they can learn,
what they can benefit from it.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s one thing to design something,

00:35:41.222 --> 00:35:43.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then to execute that design
is another thing.

00:35:44.525 --> 00:35:46.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even like with the throne room,

00:35:46.561 --> 00:35:48.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this actually is too much work.

00:35:48.596 --> 00:35:50.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to simplify it.

00:35:50.298 --> 00:35:52.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we need to show three walls?

00:35:52.266 --> 00:35:54.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we just get away with building two walls

00:35:54.569 --> 00:35:58.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have the same effect,
the same production quality?

00:35:58.773 --> 00:36:02.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually,
we design the set, we build a set,

00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:05.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we film the set,
and then we tear the set down.

00:36:05.313 --> 00:36:08.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this project is unique
in that we’re not doing that.

00:36:08.149 --> 00:36:10.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These buildings, these structures,

00:36:10.151 --> 00:36:12.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re going to be filming
are going to last for years,

00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:15.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so they had to be built that way.

00:36:16.724 --> 00:36:21.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do we combine
modern-day building standards to make it last

00:36:21.395 --> 00:36:24.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still make it look
like an old, ancient, building

00:36:24.065 --> 00:36:26.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was built 2,000 years ago?

00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:30.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were looking for a certain type of finish
—a concrete finish.

00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:33.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through a website,
we found there was a company

00:36:33.741 --> 00:36:37.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over in Perth that was able to achieve this.

00:36:37.678 --> 00:36:40.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after calling them,
we found out they’re brothers.

00:36:41.482 --> 00:36:43.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those brothers
have been able to come over and help us

00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:46.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their expertise
to get the right type of finish.

00:36:47.755 --> 00:36:51.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The support from all those
under the Australasia branch territory

00:36:51.926 --> 00:36:54.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been faith-strengthening.

00:36:55.596 --> 00:36:57.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one of the biggest needs
we probably have at the moment

00:36:57.598 --> 00:36:59.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be auditioning.

00:36:59.634 --> 00:37:03.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We absolutely need
more volunteers for acting.

00:37:03.204 --> 00:37:05.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a unique and new form of sacred service.

00:37:05.339 --> 00:37:09.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something that probably most
never thought they would ever do

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:12.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or be asked to do,
but there is definitely a need.

00:37:12.713 --> 00:37:16.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more that can make themselves available 
through this auditioning process

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:19.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would allow us to have
the right people in the roles.

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:21.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One fundamental principle that underlies

00:37:21.322 --> 00:37:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any good acting is empathy.

00:37:24.058 --> 00:37:25.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something
that we all learn as Christians.

00:37:25.893 --> 00:37:29.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about showing
the behavior in big ways.

00:37:29.196 --> 00:37:31.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s about understanding
who the character is,

00:37:31.198 --> 00:37:33.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then it exudes naturally.

00:37:33.234 --> 00:37:35.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization will always train us,

00:37:35.403 --> 00:37:38.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah’s spirit will make us ready

00:37:38.472 --> 00:37:40.341 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the task that’s ahead of us.

00:37:40.341 --> 00:37:41.742 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It’s simple training,

00:37:41.742 --> 00:37:44.812 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but it’s definitely designed to help somebody

00:37:44.812 --> 00:37:47.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get comfortable in front of a camera,

00:37:47.481 --> 00:37:49.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
performing in front of many people

00:37:49.583 --> 00:37:52.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being able to relax
—being able to be themselves.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:54.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To see our brothers and sisters
offering themselves,

00:37:54.555 --> 00:37:56.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
putting themselves out in this way,

00:37:56.557 --> 00:37:58.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is wonderful.

00:38:01.329 --> 00:38:03.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When this project was first discussed,

00:38:03.331 --> 00:38:06.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it felt like it was so far into the future

00:38:06.167 --> 00:38:07.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and almost an impossibility.

00:38:07.868 --> 00:38:09.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so big in scope.

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:12.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now,
it’s actually happening

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:16.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you see Jehovah’s blessing
on the planning, on the construction,

00:38:16.243 --> 00:38:19.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the people.

00:38:21.248 --> 00:38:22.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will there be challenges?

00:38:22.516 --> 00:38:24.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh yeah, guaranteed.

00:38:24.218 --> 00:38:28.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if Jehovah wants something done,
that’s what happens.

00:38:28.789 --> 00:38:30.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have things at the right time,

00:38:30.758 --> 00:38:32.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s what we’ve done.

00:38:32.126 --> 00:38:34.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve advanced now
to where we’re able to do it

00:38:34.462 --> 00:38:36.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such a wonderful way for the whole world.

00:38:36.931 --> 00:38:39.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are working with the best words

00:38:39.367 --> 00:38:42.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have ever been spoken on this planet

00:38:42.203 --> 00:38:45.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—words that have power and meaning.

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:48.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is such a huge endeavor,

00:38:48.376 --> 00:38:52.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet Jehovah has shown us
his direction all along.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It needs to be done.

00:38:54.615 --> 00:38:58.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this project being blessed by Jehovah,
that’s what’s going to happen.

00:38:58.519 --> 00:39:02.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The genuine good news according to Jesus

00:39:02.156 --> 00:39:04.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s what we’re going to have.

00:39:06.127 --> 00:39:10.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s clear that Jehovah is blessing

00:39:10.431 --> 00:39:13.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this tremendous undertaking. 

00:39:13.634 --> 00:39:16.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus </i>

00:39:16.504 --> 00:39:20.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help all of us
to teach the truth about Jesus,

00:39:20.841 --> 00:39:24.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it will help us
to deepen our own appreciation

00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:28.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his loving sacrifice
in behalf of all mankind.

00:39:28.916 --> 00:39:33.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said as recorded at John 14:13, 14:

00:39:35.022 --> 00:39:38.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whatever you ask in my name,

00:39:38.359 --> 00:39:40.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will do this,

00:39:40.361 --> 00:39:42.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that the Father may be glorified

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:44.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in connection with the Son.

00:39:44.965 --> 00:39:47.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you ask anything in my name,

00:39:47.868 --> 00:39:49.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will do it.”

00:39:50.538 --> 00:39:53.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, our sincere prayer

00:39:53.174 --> 00:39:55.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that this multi-year project

00:39:55.976 --> 00:39:58.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be a grand success

00:39:58.712 --> 00:40:03.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will result in the salvation
of many more true disciples,

00:40:03.717 --> 00:40:07.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all to the praise of Jehovah’s great name.

00:40:08.189 --> 00:40:12.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you all
for your continued prayers and support.

00:40:12.526 --> 00:40:14.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for encouraging yet others

00:40:14.662 --> 00:40:17.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support this project with their prayers,

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:20.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talents, time, and assets.

00:40:20.401 --> 00:40:25.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you to our dear brothers
and sisters in Australasia as well

00:40:25.372 --> 00:40:27.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your willing spirit.

00:40:27.908 --> 00:40:32.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us eagerly await what the future holds

00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:35.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this good work ahead of us.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:40.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prologue to the book
<i>“Come Be My Follower”</i>  states this:

00:40:41.889 --> 00:40:45.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah sent
his only-begotten Son to the earth

00:40:45.893 --> 00:40:48.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to give his life as a ransom. . . .

00:40:48.662 --> 00:40:50.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In addition to dying for us,

00:40:50.998 --> 00:40:54.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that Son showed us how to live.

00:40:54.235 --> 00:40:56.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With each step he took,

00:40:56.403 --> 00:40:58.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he kept his integrity

00:40:58.506 --> 00:41:01.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and brought joy to his Father’s heart.

00:41:02.243 --> 00:41:06.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus also showed us
how to be like his Father.

00:41:06.447 --> 00:41:09.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The ways and the will of the Father

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“found perfect expression

00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:15.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the words and deeds of the Son.”

00:41:16.757 --> 00:41:20.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we want to draw closer to Jehovah

00:41:20.194 --> 00:41:22.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and know him fully,

00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:26.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must continue to learn more about his Son.

00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:29.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May this new video series

00:41:29.703 --> 00:41:32.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help us to grow in love for the Son

00:41:32.973 --> 00:41:37.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our loving Father, Jehovah.

00:41:39.847 --> 00:41:43.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an exciting announcement!

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:45.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love the Gospel accounts.

00:41:45.719 --> 00:41:49.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love Jesus’ teachings and personality,

00:41:49.023 --> 00:41:51.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we love Jehovah, who is the One

00:41:51.358 --> 00:41:54.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus so perfectly imitated.

00:41:54.895 --> 00:41:57.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As stated in the video,

00:41:57.064 --> 00:41:59.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Good News According to Jesus</i>  series

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:02.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will take years to complete.

00:42:02.069 --> 00:42:04.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reassure you,

00:42:04.071 --> 00:42:07.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do have additional Bible dramas planned

00:42:07.107 --> 00:42:09.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our upcoming regional conventions.

00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:11.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,

00:42:11.812 --> 00:42:14.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do not have to wait
for this new video series

00:42:14.882 --> 00:42:16.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be fully completed

00:42:16.984 --> 00:42:21.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before benefiting
from the visual Gospel accounts.

00:42:21.055 --> 00:42:23.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In future convention programs,

00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:27.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will see the various segments
of the life of Jesus

00:42:27.061 --> 00:42:30.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
play out each year at our convention.

00:42:30.764 --> 00:42:33.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s guidance,

00:42:33.067 --> 00:42:36.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are so well-fed spiritually.

00:42:37.905 --> 00:42:42.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson has
an interesting talk to present at this time.

00:42:42.743 --> 00:42:46.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His theme is “Where Is Jehovah?”

00:42:48.749 --> 00:42:52.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is with you, you mighty warrior.”

00:42:52.953 --> 00:42:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With those words, Jehovah’s angel

00:42:55.923 --> 00:42:58.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greeted faithful Judge Gideon,

00:42:58.692 --> 00:43:02.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his reply to those words
might surprise you.

00:43:02.363 --> 00:43:03.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you open your Bibles?

00:43:03.831 --> 00:43:08.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Judges 6:13,

00:43:08.269 --> 00:43:11.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s Judges 6:13:

00:43:11.805 --> 00:43:14.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At this Gideon said to him:

00:43:14.508 --> 00:43:17.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Pardon me, my lord,

00:43:17.444 --> 00:43:19.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but if Jehovah is with us,

00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:23.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘why has all of this come upon us?

00:43:23.017 --> 00:43:28.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Where are all his wonderful acts
that our fathers related to us, saying,

00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:31.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Did Jehovah not bring us up out of Egypt?”

00:43:31.659 --> 00:43:35.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Now Jehovah has deserted us

00:43:35.496 --> 00:43:39.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and given us into Midian’s hand.’”

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:42.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, is that how you would respond

00:43:42.002 --> 00:43:45.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to an angel of Jehovah
who is speaking to you?

00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:49.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, probably not
under normal circumstances.

00:43:49.410 --> 00:43:53.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about in 2020?

00:43:53.213 --> 00:43:57.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has truly been an incredible year!

00:43:57.818 --> 00:44:00.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have faced a pandemic—

00:44:00.321 --> 00:44:03.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a pandemic that has robbed us

00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our dear loved ones,

00:44:05.859 --> 00:44:10.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a pandemic that has caused us
to face isolation,

00:44:10.030 --> 00:44:13.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be separated from our relatives
and close friends

00:44:13.867 --> 00:44:17.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that now an epidemic of anxiety

00:44:17.838 --> 00:44:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has settled down across our earth.

00:44:22.209 --> 00:44:24.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times during this year,

00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:27.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe you have felt like Gideon.

00:44:27.614 --> 00:44:30.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe his words have been your words.

00:44:30.784 --> 00:44:32.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what does that mean?

00:44:32.419 --> 00:44:35.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you have said those things
or felt those things,

00:44:35.389 --> 00:44:38.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does it mean that you’re lacking faith?

00:44:38.192 --> 00:44:41.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does it mean that your love for Jehovah
is disappearing

00:44:41.595 --> 00:44:46.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that now you’re sort of diminishing
in your relationship with God?

00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:44:48.602 --> 00:44:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Gideon was not
the only faithful servant of Jehovah

00:44:52.406 --> 00:44:54.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who expressed similar thoughts.

00:44:54.742 --> 00:44:56.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember what Habakkuk said?

00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:58.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open our Bibles.

00:44:58.379 --> 00:45:02.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read together Habakkuk chapter 1

00:45:03.951 --> 00:45:05.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verses 2 and 3.

00:45:08.989 --> 00:45:13.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Habakkuk said: “How long, O Jehovah,

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:17.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must I cry for help, but you do not hear?

00:45:17.598 --> 00:45:20.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long must I ask for help from violence,

00:45:20.901 --> 00:45:23.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but you do not intervene?

00:45:23.470 --> 00:45:26.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you make me witness wrongdoing?

00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And why do you tolerate oppression?

00:45:29.309 --> 00:45:32.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why are destruction and violence before me?

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:37.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why do quarreling and conflict abound?”

00:45:37.751 --> 00:45:42.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why? Why? Why?

00:45:42.589 --> 00:45:46.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, maybe those words
sound a little bit familiar to you.

00:45:47.694 --> 00:45:50.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But brothers, when we feel overwhelmed

00:45:50.864 --> 00:45:54.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by our circumstances, by our grief,

00:45:54.535 --> 00:45:56.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by our anxiety,

00:45:56.870 --> 00:46:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is a question that we need to ask.

00:46:00.641 --> 00:46:05.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is a question
that was first recorded in the Bible

00:46:05.312 --> 00:46:08.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the faithful prophet Elisha.

00:46:08.015 --> 00:46:10.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, would you read it with me?

00:46:10.017 --> 00:46:13.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s at 2 Kings chapter 2

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 14

00:46:15.722 --> 00:46:19.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—2 Kings 2:14.

00:46:20.894 --> 00:46:24.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Then he
[Now, this is Elisha. Then he]

00:46:24.832 --> 00:46:28.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“took the official garment of Elijah
that had fallen off him

00:46:28.569 --> 00:46:31.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and struck the waters and said:

00:46:31.371 --> 00:46:36.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?’

00:46:36.176 --> 00:46:38.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he struck the waters,

00:46:38.178 --> 00:46:41.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they were divided
to the left and to the right,

00:46:41.715 --> 00:46:45.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that Elisha went across.”

00:46:45.219 --> 00:46:47.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the question?

00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:50.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where is Jehovah?”

00:46:50.390 --> 00:46:54.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what did Elisha mean
when he asked that question?

00:46:54.361 --> 00:46:56.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was he saying: “Where is Jehovah?

00:46:56.663 --> 00:46:58.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why isn’t he doing something?”

00:46:58.866 --> 00:47:01.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that the sense of the question?

00:47:01.101 --> 00:47:02.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not at all.

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:06.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elisha was looking for Jehovah.

00:47:06.006 --> 00:47:08.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was searching for his direction.

00:47:08.442 --> 00:47:12.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to see the hand of God.

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:15.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Elisha got the answer to his prayer.

00:47:15.415 --> 00:47:18.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those waters opened right in front of him

00:47:18.852 --> 00:47:21.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that he could cross.

00:47:21.622 --> 00:47:25.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is not the only place
where this question appears in the Bible.

00:47:25.526 --> 00:47:29.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at another place
here in Jeremiah chapter 2,

00:47:30.931 --> 00:47:35.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 2:5:

00:47:37.571 --> 00:47:39.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is what Jehovah says:

00:47:39.973 --> 00:47:43.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘What fault did your forefathers find in me,

00:47:43.744 --> 00:47:46.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘so that they strayed so far from me,

00:47:46.446 --> 00:47:51.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and they walked after worthless idols
and became worthless themselves?

00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:55.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They did not ask,
[now notice, they did not ask]

00:47:55.489 --> 00:47:57.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Where is Jehovah,

00:47:57.758 --> 00:48:00.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“the One who brought us
out of the land of Egypt,

00:48:00.494 --> 00:48:04.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“who led us through the wilderness,
through a land of deserts and pits,

00:48:04.398 --> 00:48:06.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“through a land of drought
and of deep shadow,

00:48:06.934 --> 00:48:09.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“through a land where no man travels

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:13.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where no humans dwell?”’”

00:48:13.974 --> 00:48:15.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:48:15.976 --> 00:48:20.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wanted his people to search for him.

00:48:20.347 --> 00:48:23.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted them to ask: “Where is Jehovah?”

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to look for his hand,

00:48:25.652 --> 00:48:29.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to seek his help and direction.

00:48:29.656 --> 00:48:33.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, brothers,
why is it so urgent for us

00:48:33.660 --> 00:48:36.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during these critical times
—during a pandemic—

00:48:36.597 --> 00:48:40.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be saying, “Where is Jehovah?”

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we so desperately need

00:48:44.137 --> 00:48:49.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help, the direction,
the support, the comfort

00:48:49.142 --> 00:48:54.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come from our amazing,
our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:59.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now you might say:
“Well, is Jehovah really going to help you?

00:48:59.286 --> 00:49:01.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is Jehovah really going to help me?

00:49:01.521 --> 00:49:03.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m not important. I’m not significant.

00:49:03.690 --> 00:49:07.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Jehovah really going to be there for me?”

00:49:07.027 --> 00:49:09.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, look at these beautiful words

00:49:09.529 --> 00:49:13.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the scripture in Isaiah chapter 57

00:49:13.567 --> 00:49:15.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Isaiah chapter 57,

00:49:15.869 --> 00:49:19.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is really a promise
from our God, Jehovah.

00:49:20.841 --> 00:49:24.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 57:15 says:

00:49:24.645 --> 00:49:28.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For this is
what the High and Lofty One says,

00:49:28.548 --> 00:49:33.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who lives forever and whose name is holy:

00:49:33.153 --> 00:49:36.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I reside in the high and holy place,

00:49:36.857 --> 00:49:39.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[but now notice this]

00:49:39.192 --> 00:49:43.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but also with those crushed

00:49:43.063 --> 00:49:45.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and lowly in spirit,

00:49:45.666 --> 00:49:48.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘to revive the spirit of the lowly

00:49:48.735 --> 00:49:53.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to revive the heart
of those being crushed.’”

00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an amazing thought!

00:49:56.009 --> 00:50:00.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here our God, Jehovah, the Almighty
who dwells in the highest heavens,

00:50:00.747 --> 00:50:04.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that when we are crushed,
when we are lowly

00:50:04.117 --> 00:50:08.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in a figurative sense—
he resides right with us.

00:50:08.755 --> 00:50:11.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How beautiful! How amazing!

00:50:11.358 --> 00:50:13.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what does that mean?

00:50:13.193 --> 00:50:14.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that teach us?

00:50:14.961 --> 00:50:17.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It teaches us
that we need to ask that question

00:50:17.197 --> 00:50:19.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where is Jehovah?” every day.

00:50:19.733 --> 00:50:21.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to beg Jehovah for his direction.

00:50:21.868 --> 00:50:24.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to beg him for his help.

00:50:24.905 --> 00:50:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then we need to do something more.

00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:30.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be on the lookout

00:50:30.877 --> 00:50:33.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the hand of Jehovah.

00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:37.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Elijah felt completely isolated,

00:50:37.417 --> 00:50:39.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was so discouraged,
you remember, he said:

00:50:39.986 --> 00:50:43.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am the only one left.”

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just poured his heart out to Jehovah.

00:50:45.992 --> 00:50:48.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did Jehovah do for him?

00:50:48.228 --> 00:50:52.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you remember,
Jehovah allowed Elijah to see

00:50:52.399 --> 00:50:54.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a miraculous display of his power.

00:50:54.735 --> 00:50:57.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, he felt that wind;

00:50:57.270 --> 00:50:59.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he felt the earthquake;

00:50:59.272 --> 00:51:02.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he felt the fire.

00:51:02.109 --> 00:51:06.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, the Bible says:
“Jehovah was not in the wind.”

00:51:06.346 --> 00:51:08.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah was not in the earthquake.”

00:51:08.515 --> 00:51:11.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah was not in the fire.”

00:51:11.985 --> 00:51:14.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then what came next?

00:51:14.588 --> 00:51:19.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A calm, low voice.”

00:51:19.126 --> 00:51:23.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was Jehovah.

00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:26.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, what do we learn
from that experience?

00:51:26.633 --> 00:51:28.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, brothers, we might be waiting

00:51:28.769 --> 00:51:33.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some big, bold, dramatic expression
of Jehovah’s hand.

00:51:34.808 --> 00:51:37.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in reality, what do we need to do?

00:51:37.611 --> 00:51:41.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to turn up
our “spiritual hearing aids”

00:51:41.615 --> 00:51:43.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can hear

00:51:43.617 --> 00:51:48.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “calm, low voice” of Jehovah.

00:51:48.021 --> 00:51:51.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jehovah’s answer to our prayers

00:51:51.825 --> 00:51:54.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might come in a way that we don’t expect.

00:51:54.494 --> 00:51:59.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s through the kind gesture or act
of one of our brothers or sisters.

00:51:59.466 --> 00:52:04.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe it’s through a text message,
an e-mail, a phone call,

00:52:04.137 --> 00:52:07.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some other way
that our brother or sister acts

00:52:07.874 --> 00:52:09.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show their kindness.

00:52:09.576 --> 00:52:11.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe that’s Jehovah’s way

00:52:11.745 --> 00:52:14.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of giving us the help that we need.

00:52:14.981 --> 00:52:18.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That means
that when we are earnestly praying,

00:52:18.351 --> 00:52:21.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re earnestly seeking Jehovah’s help

00:52:21.087 --> 00:52:23.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—be attentive, be alert,

00:52:23.256 --> 00:52:25.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ask: “Where is Jehovah?”

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:28.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look for his hand.

00:52:28.195 --> 00:52:30.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now here’s another question, brothers:

00:52:31.832 --> 00:52:33.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that help comes,

00:52:33.834 --> 00:52:37.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah does provide
that assistance that you need,

00:52:37.938 --> 00:52:40.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will you be willing to accept it?

00:52:40.941 --> 00:52:45.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Mary came to Jesus
with the perfumed oil, genuine nard

00:52:45.879 --> 00:52:48.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—remember, so expensive

00:52:48.381 --> 00:52:53.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it would cost a year’s wages
for an average laborer—

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would have been so easy for Jesus
to turn her away,

00:52:57.457 --> 00:53:01.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to just say: “Oh, no, Mary,
thank you very much, but I don’t need you.

00:53:01.561 --> 00:53:05.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is going to help me,
so you can just go now,

00:53:05.031 --> 00:53:07.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll be fine.”

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus didn’t do that.

00:53:09.603 --> 00:53:13.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus willingly accepted the help.

00:53:13.139 --> 00:53:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, maybe Jesus understood

00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:19.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah had put it into Mary’s heart
to do this

00:53:19.212 --> 00:53:22.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that his body
would be properly prepared for burial.

00:53:22.315 --> 00:53:23.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:27.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the point is, Jesus accepted

00:53:27.287 --> 00:53:30.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that Mary provided.

00:53:30.423 --> 00:53:33.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, brothers and sisters,
what’s the lesson?

00:53:33.660 --> 00:53:36.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we need to learn from this?

00:53:36.396 --> 00:53:38.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re a person who always says,

00:53:38.999 --> 00:53:42.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh, no, we’re fine; we don’t need anything;

00:53:42.002 --> 00:53:44.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to help us,”

00:53:44.004 --> 00:53:46.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, “Oh, no, you don’t need to tell me that;

00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I already know Jehovah
will give me the direction I need,”

00:53:51.077 --> 00:53:53.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, then, you may be missing out.

00:53:53.813 --> 00:53:57.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may not be seeing or hearing

00:53:57.083 --> 00:54:01.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the help that Jehovah wants to give us.

00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:06.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch a video and see
how our brothers and sisters in distress

00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:11.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have experienced the help of Jehovah
at a critical time.

00:54:13.133 --> 00:54:15.936 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thought that fire was loud.

00:54:15.936 --> 00:54:18.605 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I thought that you could hear a wildfire,

00:54:18.605 --> 00:54:21.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was just dead quiet.

00:54:21.174 --> 00:54:23.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the time we went down the driveway
and around the corner,

00:54:23.977 --> 00:54:26.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we stopped and looked back

00:54:26.112 --> 00:54:28.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the back of my parents’ house
was on fire.

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:34.020 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When the pandemic hit, we lost our work.

00:54:34.020 --> 00:54:39.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t go to work,
and we also couldn’t leave our apartment.

00:54:39.025 --> 00:54:41.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The situation was very hard.

00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:45.365 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband, Ivan, was charged

00:54:45.365 --> 00:54:47.968 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with organizing extremist activity.

00:54:47.968 --> 00:54:51.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was put into pretrial detention

00:54:51.037 --> 00:54:52.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for four months.

00:54:52.639 --> 00:54:55.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found out that I had a tumor in my chest

00:54:55.942 --> 00:55:00.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I would have to have
a very serious operation.

00:55:01.748 --> 00:55:04.484 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I lost my mom to the coronavirus.

00:55:04.918 --> 00:55:07.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Living 3,000 miles apart,

00:55:07.153 --> 00:55:09.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be a long time
before I was able to go home at all,

00:55:09.990 --> 00:55:12.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wasn’t able to be there
when it happened.

00:55:15.729 --> 00:55:19.065 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Earlier this year, my son, Nathan, died

00:55:19.065 --> 00:55:21.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a tragic accident.

00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:23.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was two years old.

00:55:24.004 --> 00:55:26.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time, I asked Jehovah (the question),

00:55:26.706 --> 00:55:28.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why is this happening to me?ʺ

00:55:30.844 --> 00:55:34.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were friends there before we got there.

00:55:34.714 --> 00:55:38.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we got to the place that we knew
we were going to evacuate to,

00:55:38.618 --> 00:55:41.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(because they asked,
“Where are you going to be?”)

00:55:41.388 --> 00:55:44.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were willing to just provide anything
that we needed

00:55:44.891 --> 00:55:48.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we even knew
what it was that we needed

00:55:48.762 --> 00:55:51.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and especially spiritually.

00:55:51.598 --> 00:55:56.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when I didn’t know
that we needed to say a prayer, it was there.

00:55:58.938 --> 00:56:02.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those moments, we saw Jehovah’s hand.

00:56:03.576 --> 00:56:06.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers would come by and give us food.

00:56:08.048 --> 00:56:10.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was even a brother that called me

00:56:10.283 --> 00:56:13.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things started to go bad and said,

00:56:13.887 --> 00:56:16.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I think you’re going to need some money.”

00:56:19.926 --> 00:56:24.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And without saying anything, he came
and left an envelope outside our apartment.

00:56:26.299 --> 00:56:30.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we opened the envelope, we saw
that there was exactly the amount we needed

00:56:30.670 --> 00:56:34.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay the bills and to buy things
that we needed for the apartment.

00:56:37.310 --> 00:56:39.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had only learned about brotherly love,

00:56:39.979 --> 00:56:44.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but during that time,
I really understood what it truly means.

00:56:45.952 --> 00:56:50.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that time, brothers
who we did not even know called us,

00:56:50.690 --> 00:56:52.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spent time with us,

00:56:52.792 --> 00:56:55.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they prayed with us,

00:56:55.361 --> 00:56:58.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spent a lot of their time
encouraging us.

00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:03.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During that time, I saw evidence
of Jehovah’s hand in our lives.

00:57:04.370 --> 00:57:08.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really, really struggling one day,
and I had to reach out to Jehovah in prayer

00:57:08.975 --> 00:57:10.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just try and throw all my burdens on him,

00:57:10.977 --> 00:57:15.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not two minutes
after I finished that prayer

00:57:15.048 --> 00:57:17.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when an elder reached out to me

00:57:17.484 --> 00:57:21.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave me the best shepherding call
I think I’ve ever had in my life.

00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:24.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And clearly, that was
Jehovah reaching out to me

00:57:24.991 --> 00:57:29.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trying to show me that he understood
how I felt and was there for me.

00:57:29.462 --> 00:57:34.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After intensive care, I felt that I needed
someone to hold my hand,

00:57:34.033 --> 00:57:37.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I understood that Jehovah
would take me by the hand.

00:57:37.637 --> 00:57:40.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister visited me every day,

00:57:40.573 --> 00:57:44.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she helped me get dressed,
she brushed my hair,

00:57:44.177 --> 00:57:47.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we went for short walks
along the corridor.

00:57:47.747 --> 00:57:51.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I can really see how compassionate
and considerate Jehovah is

00:57:51.751 --> 00:57:54.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he knows how to support us.

00:57:54.187 --> 00:57:56.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows us inside and out.

00:57:56.623 --> 00:57:59.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we were going through
this difficult time,

00:57:59.192 --> 00:58:03.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us so much,
and we definitely saw his hand in our lives.

00:58:03.530 --> 00:58:06.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the future,
if any difficulty should occur,

00:58:06.766 --> 00:58:11.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are confident
that Jehovah will help us and protect us.

00:58:11.437 --> 00:58:13.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter what we face,

00:58:13.106 --> 00:58:15.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’ll get worse and worse in this system.

00:58:15.175 --> 00:58:16.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that Jehovah

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:18.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can get us through absolutely anything.

00:58:18.611 --> 00:58:20.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen the overwhelming evidence

00:58:20.046 --> 00:58:21.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my own life;

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen it for others too.

00:58:22.782 --> 00:58:25.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whatever Satan throws at us,

00:58:25.552 --> 00:58:26.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t matter,

00:58:26.786 --> 00:58:27.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah is stronger.

00:58:27.887 --> 00:58:29.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s the most powerful ally

00:58:29.255 --> 00:58:31.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could have.

00:58:33.092 --> 00:58:38.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At this annual meeting, we have heard so much
about what the Governing Body,

00:58:38.064 --> 00:58:41.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under the direction
of Jehovah God and Christ Jesus,

00:58:41.034 --> 00:58:46.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing to strengthen
Jehovah’s people worldwide.

00:58:46.039 --> 00:58:48.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But brothers and sisters,

00:58:48.541 --> 00:58:52.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you know one thing
that is strengthening the Governing Body

00:58:52.111 --> 00:58:54.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue on in our work?

00:58:54.814 --> 00:58:56.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s you.

00:58:56.649 --> 00:59:01.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s every one of you brothers and sisters
out in the field.

00:59:01.654 --> 00:59:03.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know what you’re going through.

00:59:03.923 --> 00:59:06.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read your cards and letters.

00:59:06.059 --> 00:59:08.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hear your expressions.

00:59:08.228 --> 00:59:12.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know you’re suffering
through a difficult time.

00:59:12.131 --> 00:59:16.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet you keep going; you keep enduring;

00:59:16.102 --> 00:59:19.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you keep serving Jehovah faithfully.

00:59:19.906 --> 00:59:22.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That not only warms our hearts

00:59:22.475 --> 00:59:27.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it strengthens our own faith
to continue serving Jehovah.

00:59:28.915 --> 00:59:31.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are facing a challenging time now.

00:59:31.484 --> 00:59:33.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we face the great tribulation,

00:59:33.786 --> 00:59:38.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will face even greater challenges.

00:59:38.124 --> 00:59:40.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have times of discouragement

00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:43.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like Gideon had, just like Habakkuk had,

00:59:43.696 --> 00:59:46.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Elijah had.

00:59:46.699 --> 00:59:49.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we will also prove faithful to the end

00:59:49.602 --> 00:59:52.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as each of those men did.

00:59:52.705 --> 00:59:54.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we do what?

00:59:54.774 --> 00:59:57.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we keep looking for Jehovah,

00:59:57.343 --> 01:00:00.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we keep searching for his hand,

01:00:00.613 --> 01:00:05.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we keep turning up
our “spiritual hearing aids”

01:00:05.184 --> 01:00:07.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can be attentive to the ways

01:00:07.887 --> 01:00:10.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah will use to help us

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:13.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to strengthen us and to direct us.

01:00:13.126 --> 01:00:15.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, dear brothers and sisters,

01:00:15.395 --> 01:00:17.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep on asking,

01:00:17.497 --> 01:00:20.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Where is Jehovah?”

01:00:22.502 --> 01:00:25.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was upbuilding.

01:00:25.505 --> 01:00:28.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing to have now enjoyed

01:00:28.107 --> 01:00:31.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire annual meeting program!

01:00:31.678 --> 01:00:36.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope that it will help you
to continue preaching about Jehovah 

01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:40.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his Kingdom with renewed zeal.

01:00:40.053 --> 01:00:43.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that this world seems to be

01:00:43.022 --> 01:00:45.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more turmoil than ever before,

01:00:45.992 --> 01:00:49.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s clear that Jehovah’s holy spirit

01:00:49.762 --> 01:00:54.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is guiding us during these troublesome times.

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:59.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll conclude this month’s program

01:00:59.038 --> 01:01:02.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our video postcard,
which comes to us from the Solomon Islands, 

01:01:02.975 --> 01:01:07.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where my wife and I
enjoyed the privilege of serving a convention

01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a number of years ago.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Located northeast of Australia
in the Pacific Ocean,

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:17.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Solomon Islands
comprise six main islands

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:21.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and almost one thousand smaller islands,
atolls, and reefs.

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This archipelago was the site

01:01:24.497 --> 01:01:28.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of intense warfare during World War II,

01:01:28.835 --> 01:01:31.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remnants of that war still litter beaches

01:01:31.437 --> 01:01:34.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the water just offshore.

01:01:34.006 --> 01:01:37.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The official language
of the country is English.

01:01:37.110 --> 01:01:41.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, most residents
speak Melanesian Pidgin

01:01:41.247 --> 01:01:43.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other indigenous languages.

01:01:43.649 --> 01:01:45.118 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our publications 

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:47.019 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and videos are being translated

01:01:47.019 --> 01:01:49.288 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
into ten of those languages.

01:01:49.288 --> 01:01:51.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the Solomon Islands,

01:01:51.157 --> 01:01:55.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll find tree-filled mountainous terrain,
beautiful beaches,

01:01:55.294 --> 01:02:00.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
volcanoes, and even volcanic steam vents
on the island of Simbo.

01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:02.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this breathtaking beauty

01:02:02.168 --> 01:02:05.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes with inherent challenges
caused by nature,

01:02:05.872 --> 01:02:09.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as frequent cyclones and earthquakes.

01:02:09.208 --> 01:02:12.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The majority of the people
in the Solomon Islands live in rural areas,

01:02:13.379 --> 01:02:16.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while about 20 percent
of the population resides

01:02:16.516 --> 01:02:19.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in urban areas, including the capital city

01:02:19.218 --> 01:02:23.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Honiara,
where our branch office is located.

01:02:23.022 --> 01:02:25.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Honiara, our brothers cover the territory

01:02:25.291 --> 01:02:28.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the good news just as you do.

01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:31.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, at the time
this video postcard was recorded,

01:02:31.731 --> 01:02:35.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers in Honiara
and the more than 2,000 publishers 

01:02:35.868 --> 01:02:39.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Solomon Islands
had to adjust their preaching methods

01:02:39.672 --> 01:02:42.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the worldwide pandemic.

01:02:42.074 --> 01:02:43.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like many of us, they quickly found

01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:47.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
alternative ways
to accomplish their ministry.

01:02:47.747 --> 01:02:50.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
although many publishers

01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:54.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Honiara Kukum Congregation
do not own 

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:58.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
personal cell phones,
they found ways to make phone calls.

01:02:58.224 --> 01:03:02.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, even before our brothers
could call a return visit,

01:03:02.328 --> 01:03:05.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the householder was already calling them

01:03:05.264 --> 01:03:08.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ask more questions about the Bible.

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:12.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 105 publishers
of the Honiara Kukum Congregation

01:03:12.605 --> 01:03:15.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were happy to have a total

01:03:15.107 --> 01:03:18.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 490 attend the Memorial in 2020.

01:03:18.945 --> 01:03:21.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now they send you

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their warm love and greetings.

01:03:24.283 --> 01:03:27.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
