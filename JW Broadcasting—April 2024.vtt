00:00:01.856 --> 00:00:06.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, everybody, to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:09.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
My cohost is Brother Izak Marais.

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:12.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, his given name is Izak,
but we all call him Saki.

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:16.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so glad to see you, Saki,
because we’ve got a lot of work today.

00:00:16.871 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, you have
quite an interesting background in the truth.

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t you tell us something about it?

00:00:22.084 --> 00:00:23.168 line:10% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:00:23.168 --> 00:00:25.546 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’ll be happy to do so.

00:00:25.546 --> 00:00:27.548 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was born in South Africa

00:00:27.548 --> 00:00:29.425 line:10% position:50% align:center
in a very small town

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
called Blyvooruitzicht.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father was not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:40.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
He initially opposed my mother,
who was a dedicated servant of Jehovah,

00:00:40.227 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
but later changed and was very supportive.

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:46.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother served Jehovah faithfully

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:50.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
until her death in 2017.

00:00:50.654 --> 00:00:55.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
My grandfather and great-grandfather
on my mother’s side

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
came into the truth in the early 1920’s

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:00.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
simply by reading a tract.

00:01:02.374 --> 00:01:04.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was about ten years old,

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
I read the book
<i>What Has Religion Done for Mankind? </i>

00:01:08.547 --> 00:01:13.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was convinced
that my mother had the truth.

00:01:13.177 --> 00:01:17.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
My two brothers and three sisters
also embraced the truth

00:01:17.264 --> 00:01:19.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
at an early age.

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:23.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to this day,
all of them serve Jehovah faithfully

00:01:23.395 --> 00:01:25.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
in various parts of the earth.

00:01:25.397 --> 00:01:26.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
While I was in my final year at school,

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:33.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was invited to go to Bethel,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I started Bethel service

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
in January 1965 in South Africa.

00:01:40.663 --> 00:01:43.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethel was located in Elandsfontein,

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:46.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
not far from Johannesburg.

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bethel family had only 55 members then.

00:01:51.298 --> 00:01:53.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had no particular skill,

00:01:53.092 --> 00:01:57.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
education, or training when I came to Bethel.

00:01:57.137 --> 00:02:00.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two older brothers in the small family,

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Andrew Jack from Scotland

00:02:03.644 --> 00:02:06.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Gert Nel from South Africa,

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:08.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
took me under their wing because they knew

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had so much to learn.

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:16.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
They taught me how to apply Bible principles

00:02:16.156 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the school of life

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:22.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
as outlined at Proverbs 1:1-7.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Andrew Jack taught me how to work

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:31.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reminded me always to glorify Jehovah.

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:37.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gert Nel, an Afrikaans translator since 1947,

00:02:37.386 --> 00:02:42.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
taught me how to reason
on Scriptural principles.

00:02:42.391 --> 00:02:45.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of them finished
their earthly course long ago,

00:02:45.394 --> 00:02:47.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
but their example

00:02:47.771 --> 00:02:51.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
of loyalty still has a deep impact

00:02:51.525 --> 00:02:54.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the loyal servants of Jehovah
in southern Africa.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had several assignments over the years

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Translation and in the Printery,

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:05.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I worked mostly in cleaning assignments.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1976,

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
I married Jean,

00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:14.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
who served as a pioneer in Durban.

00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:18.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was born in Malawi,
but she grew up in South Africa.

00:03:18.635 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
She set a great example for me

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
by working diligently

00:03:23.432 --> 00:03:26.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
at every assignment that she was given.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:29.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
She always has a good attitude

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:33.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and works “as to Jehovah and not to men.”

00:03:33.734 --> 00:03:34.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, very good.

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:39.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
After serving at the South Africa branch
for a few years,

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were transferred
to the United States Bethel in 1981.

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:46.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve served in Wallkill,

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:48.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brooklyn, Patterson,

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:51.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are now serving in Warwick.

00:03:51.418 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thanks for sharing.

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:55.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know I’ve been built up
by hearing your experience,

00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:58.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I am sure the friends feel the same way.

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:02.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t you give us the highlights
of what we can expect during the program?

00:04:02.554 --> 00:04:05.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll be glad to, David.

00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:09.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this system nears its end,

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:12.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may at times feel trapped and helpless.

00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:16.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we be sure

00:04:16.068 --> 00:04:19.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is still helping us?

00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:22.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many years ago,

00:04:22.491 --> 00:04:26.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Karen found joy and fulfillment
with her spiritual family.

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:29.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
But her life serving Jehovah
hasn’t been easy.

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:34.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how she’s doing in the next episode

00:04:34.086 --> 00:04:38.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the series <i>Where Are They Now? </i>

00:04:38.507 --> 00:04:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever wished that you could have

00:04:41.343 --> 00:04:44.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
more conversations in the ministry?

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:45.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our latest episode

00:04:45.722 --> 00:04:48.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Iron Sharpens Iron </i>

00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:51.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides suggestions for doing so.

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:56.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the April 2024 edition

00:04:56.984 --> 00:04:59.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting!

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:21.133 line:10% position:50% align:center
An outstanding fact

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:25.387 line:10% position:50% align:center
is recorded at Isaiah 55:10, 11:

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For just as the rain and the snow
pour down from heaven

00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:34.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not return there
until they saturate the earth,

00:05:34.938 --> 00:05:37.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“making it produce and sprout,

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:41.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“giving seed to the sower
and bread to the eater,

00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:43.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now notice this]

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so my word [my word]

00:05:47.826 --> 00:05:50.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that goes out of my mouth will be.

00:05:50.245 --> 00:05:54.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will not return to me without results,

00:05:54.082 --> 00:05:56.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but it will certainly accomplish

00:05:56.585 --> 00:05:59.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
whatever is my delight.”

00:05:59.671 --> 00:06:03.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word of God
is the statement of his purpose.

00:06:03.425 --> 00:06:08.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it can be delivered orally
or in writing.

00:06:08.388 --> 00:06:12.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
We call the Bible God’s written Word,
and rightly so.

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
But long before writing was invented,

00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:18.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah expressed his purpose in words.

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:21.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And God said: ‘Let there be light.’

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:23.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then there was light.”

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through Isaiah, Jehovah is telling us

00:06:26.615 --> 00:06:29.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will always accomplish his purpose.

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no matter how powerful fighters
against that purpose seem to be,

00:06:34.748 --> 00:06:38.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will always lose in the end.

00:06:38.418 --> 00:06:40.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remembering that will help us when we’re

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
faced with opposers who seem unbeatable.

00:06:43.382 --> 00:06:47.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I thought we might consider some
Bible examples that illustrate the point.

00:06:49.179 --> 00:06:52.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take the days of King Saul, for example.

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jehovah sent Samuel

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:56.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
to anoint the next king of Israel.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as recorded at 1 Samuel 16:1,

00:06:59.481 --> 00:07:01.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
God said to Samuel:

00:07:01.733 --> 00:07:05.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite,

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:07.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because I have selected
from among his sons

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:09.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
a king for myself.”

00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:12.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul’s replacement turned out to be David.

00:07:12.869 --> 00:07:15.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was Jehovah’s choice.

00:07:15.372 --> 00:07:18.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
At some point, Saul himself understood that.

00:07:18.041 --> 00:07:21.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, according to 1 Samuel 23:17,

00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:23.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
his son Jonathan said to David:

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will be king over Israel, . . .

00:07:26.967 --> 00:07:31.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my father Saul also knows that.”

00:07:33.265 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Confirming this, on one occasion
Saul said to David:

00:07:36.768 --> 00:07:40.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I know that you will surely rule as king.”

00:07:40.439 --> 00:07:44.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
In spite of it all, Saul tried to kill David.

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:47.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had the support of a powerful army.

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:50.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul himself was apparently a very strong man.

00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:55.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, it was God’s will
for David to become king,

00:07:55.078 --> 00:07:57.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Saul knew it.

00:07:57.539 --> 00:08:02.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we ask: Why did Saul keep on fighting?

00:08:02.586 --> 00:08:05.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whom was he fighting, really?

00:08:05.505 --> 00:08:07.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not just David.

00:08:07.758 --> 00:08:10.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was fighting against God.

00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:15.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saul was setting himself up for failure.

00:08:15.015 --> 00:08:18.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt Satan was egging Saul on.

00:08:18.268 --> 00:08:23.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Satan could cause
just one of Jehovah’s promises to fail—

00:08:23.065 --> 00:08:26.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the end, the word of God prevailed.

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:28.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
David became king.

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:35.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, who would replace David
when the time came?

00:08:35.077 --> 00:08:38.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was also Jehovah’s decision to make,
and he made it.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to 1 Chronicles 22:9, 10,

00:08:41.666 --> 00:08:43.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told David:

00:08:43.085 --> 00:08:45.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! You will have a son . . .

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Solomon will be his name

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and . . . I will firmly establish the throne

00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:54.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his kingship over Israel forever.”

00:08:54.346 --> 00:08:58.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Solomon would be the next king of Israel.

00:08:58.683 --> 00:09:01.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who could prevent that from happening?

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:05.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
David’s son Adonijah tried and failed.

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:07.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:09:07.192 --> 00:09:10.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
As quoted at 1 Kings 2:15, he later admitted:

00:09:10.612 --> 00:09:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The kingship eluded me
and became my brother’s,

00:09:13.990 --> 00:09:18.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
for it was from Jehovah that it became his.”

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:21.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Adonijah thought
he could outmaneuver Jehovah,

00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:24.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was sadly mistaken.

00:09:25.419 --> 00:09:27.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promised the Israelites

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:31.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would give them
the land of Canaan as an inheritance.

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:33.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Canaanites had other ideas.

00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:35.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had heard of Jehovah’s powerful works
in Egypt,

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:38.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they fought against him anyway.

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:39.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
They learned.

00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:41.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
They learned at their cost

00:09:41.935 --> 00:09:45.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fighters against God always lose.

00:09:46.815 --> 00:09:49.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you were asked to name
some prominent fighters

00:09:49.734 --> 00:09:52.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
against God in Jesus’ day,

00:09:52.279 --> 00:09:55.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
you might think of King Herod the Great,

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:57.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jewish High Priest Caiaphas,

00:09:57.951 --> 00:10:01.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe the Roman Governor Pontius Pilate.

00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:03.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about them.

00:10:03.957 --> 00:10:06.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Herod the Great.

00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read Matthew 2:1, 2.

00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:15.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, astrologers visit King Herod,

00:10:15.969 --> 00:10:19.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they ask a strange question.

00:10:19.181 --> 00:10:20.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read:

00:10:20.557 --> 00:10:24.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After Jesus had been born
in Bethlehem of Judea

00:10:24.227 --> 00:10:27.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the days of Herod the king, look!

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:29.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
“astrologers from the East
came to Jerusalem,

00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:34.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“saying:
‘Where is the one born king of the Jews?

00:10:34.696 --> 00:10:37.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘[king of the Jews?]

00:10:37.407 --> 00:10:40.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For we saw his star
when we were in the East,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have come to do obeisance to him.’”

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:46.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice something strange here?

00:10:46.708 --> 00:10:49.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
No angel had spoken to those astrologers,

00:10:49.753 --> 00:10:52.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet when the men saw a light in heaven,

00:10:52.422 --> 00:10:56.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
they concluded that it signaled
the birth of the “king of the Jews.”

00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:58.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a stretch!

00:10:58.553 --> 00:11:01.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who do you suppose
put that idea in their head?

00:11:01.806 --> 00:11:04.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who do you suppose
gave them the bright idea

00:11:04.726 --> 00:11:09.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ask the present king of Israel
about his future rival?

00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:12.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
That has Satan the Devil written all over it,
doesn’t it?

00:11:12.609 --> 00:11:15.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now notice verses 3 and 4:

00:11:16.404 --> 00:11:19.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At hearing this, King Herod was agitated,

00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:21.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all Jerusalem with him.

00:11:21.993 --> 00:11:25.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On gathering together all the chief priests
and scribes of the people,

00:11:25.914 --> 00:11:29.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he inquired of them where

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:32.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Christ was to be born.”

00:11:32.712 --> 00:11:34.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interesting!

00:11:34.589 --> 00:11:38.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Herod doesn’t just ask where
the future “king of the Jews” will be born;

00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:42.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
he asks “where the Christ [will] be born.”

00:11:42.973 --> 00:11:45.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as a Jewish proselyte,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:48.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s supposed to be waiting for the Christ,
the Messiah.

00:11:48.311 --> 00:11:50.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, now that the Messiah has come,

00:11:50.981 --> 00:11:53.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Herod wants to kill him.

00:11:53.483 --> 00:11:57.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Herod is fighting against God.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:11:58.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does he win?

00:11:58.697 --> 00:11:59.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:02.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus escapes his clutches.

00:12:02.075 --> 00:12:05.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a few months later, Herod himself dies.

00:12:05.537 --> 00:12:07.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Few mourn his death.

00:12:09.541 --> 00:12:12.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jesus’ day, the Jewish high priests

00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:16.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
were appointed and removed by the Romans.

00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:19.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, High Priest Caiaphas
was a skilled politician.

00:12:19.718 --> 00:12:21.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew how to please the Romans.

00:12:21.761 --> 00:12:26.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of that, he hung on to his job
a lot longer than many others.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:31.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had a powerful supporter,
Pontius Pilate.

00:12:31.354 --> 00:12:36.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
With his connections,
Caiaphas seemed untouchable.

00:12:36.318 --> 00:12:39.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate himself was very well-connected.

00:12:39.195 --> 00:12:41.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a good friend in high places in Rome:

00:12:41.948 --> 00:12:45.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lucius Sejanus.

00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:48.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, maybe you’ve never heard
of Sejanus before,

00:12:48.121 --> 00:12:52.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was probably the most powerful man
in the Roman Empire.

00:12:52.334 --> 00:12:56.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
The emperor left most of the major decisions
to Sejanus.

00:12:56.004 --> 00:13:00.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he made many enemies,
but they were powerless against him

00:13:00.425 --> 00:13:05.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
until—until—the fall of 31 C.E.

00:13:06.723 --> 00:13:10.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time,
Sejanus got on the wrong side of the emperor

00:13:10.935 --> 00:13:13.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was put to death.

00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that,

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:19.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
the emperor commanded
that anyone who had been friends

00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:23.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Sejanus was to be executed.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you think Pilate felt?

00:13:27.494 --> 00:13:29.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
He must have been a nervous wreck!

00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:34.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we said, he and Sejanus
had been very close.

00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:39.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, a year and a half
after Sejanus was executed,

00:13:39.172 --> 00:13:42.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do you suppose Pilate was thinking

00:13:42.592 --> 00:13:44.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the Jewish rulers cried out,

00:13:44.761 --> 00:13:49.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘If you release Jesus,
you are no friend of Caesar’?

00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:53.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some scholars believe that this was a factor

00:13:53.228 --> 00:13:56.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Pilate’s decision
to order Jesus’ execution

00:13:56.523 --> 00:13:58.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to protect his own job.

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:01.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he protect it?

00:14:01.277 --> 00:14:02.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:14:02.529 --> 00:14:05.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate wasn’t immediately
struck by lightning.

00:14:05.073 --> 00:14:08.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
But less than four years
after he sentenced Jesus to death,

00:14:08.702 --> 00:14:12.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
he got into big trouble
and was recalled to Rome.

00:14:12.664 --> 00:14:14.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
With no powerful friend to defend him,

00:14:14.958 --> 00:14:17.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate was removed as Roman governor.

00:14:19.003 --> 00:14:21.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened next isn’t clear.

00:14:21.423 --> 00:14:24.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some say Pilate committed suicide.

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:26.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others say he was banished.

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever happened, it wasn’t good.

00:14:30.807 --> 00:14:34.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Pilate lost his job,
Caiaphas lost his protector

00:14:34.936 --> 00:14:38.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and soon he was removed as high priest.

00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:41.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, two fighters against God,

00:14:41.151 --> 00:14:44.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pilate and Caiaphas, were dispatched

00:14:44.028 --> 00:14:47.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
soon after they committed
their greatest crime.

00:14:49.242 --> 00:14:53.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
We certainly don’t want to be fighters
against Jehovah God.

00:14:53.246 --> 00:14:56.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we cooperate with his purpose today?

00:14:56.958 --> 00:14:59.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider this scenario:

00:14:59.002 --> 00:15:03.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother offends you,
says something thoughtless.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re hurt.

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how does Jehovah view that person?

00:15:08.762 --> 00:15:10.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s God’s friend.

00:15:10.764 --> 00:15:12.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves his friends.

00:15:12.766 --> 00:15:15.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants you to love them too.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:19.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s God’s purpose
for the brother who offended you?

00:15:19.481 --> 00:15:23.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants him to enjoy life forever.

00:15:23.109 --> 00:15:27.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how can you
work along with Jehovah’s purpose?

00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:32.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you can just overlook the offense,
Jehovah will appreciate that.

00:15:32.786 --> 00:15:34.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you can’t overlook it,

00:15:34.788 --> 00:15:39.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would want you to approach
the person in a kind, respectful way.

00:15:39.626 --> 00:15:41.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might say something like this:

00:15:41.795 --> 00:15:43.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maybe I’m being too sensitive,

00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:46.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I was hurt
by what you said the other day.

00:15:46.257 --> 00:15:48.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, I know you didn’t mean to hurt me,

00:15:48.551 --> 00:15:51.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I thought I’d let you know how I felt.”

00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:53.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the person responds favorably

00:15:53.973 --> 00:15:56.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unity is restored,

00:15:56.226 --> 00:15:59.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you imagine how pleased Jehovah will be?

00:16:00.855 --> 00:16:05.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Matthew chapter 18, Jesus gave
the illustration of the lost sheep.

00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:08.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
A man had 100 sheep.

00:16:08.238 --> 00:16:09.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
One got lost.

00:16:09.906 --> 00:16:12.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
The shepherd left the 99 in the field

00:16:12.283 --> 00:16:14.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and went to great lengths
to find the sheep that had strayed

00:16:14.911 --> 00:16:17.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and bring it back to the fold.

00:16:17.622 --> 00:16:19.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it a coincidence

00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:22.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
that right after telling that story,

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus outlined three steps we should follow

00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:28.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
when someone has sinned seriously
against us?

00:16:28.341 --> 00:16:30.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 18:15,

00:16:30.343 --> 00:16:34.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus tells us what our goal should be
when we follow those steps.

00:16:34.097 --> 00:16:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that:

00:16:35.723 --> 00:16:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Moreover, if your brother commits a sin,

00:16:39.727 --> 00:16:43.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“go and reveal his fault
between you and him alone.

00:16:43.773 --> 00:16:46.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If he listens to you, [notice]

00:16:46.359 --> 00:16:50.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have gained your brother.”

00:16:50.738 --> 00:16:54.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother who sinned against us
may be like that lost sheep.

00:16:54.409 --> 00:16:56.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
What should be our goal?

00:16:56.578 --> 00:16:59.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
To gain our brother, not to expose him,

00:16:59.664 --> 00:17:02.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to get revenge, not to prove him wrong,

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:05.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to shame him, but to get him back.

00:17:05.587 --> 00:17:07.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like that loving shepherd,

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are willing to go
to great lengths to bring

00:17:09.757 --> 00:17:12.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
that erring brother back to the fold.

00:17:13.511 --> 00:17:17.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, if the brother
is an unrepentant sinner,

00:17:17.015 --> 00:17:20.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders will follow the third step
outlined by Jesus

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:23.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll be removed from the congregation.

00:17:25.273 --> 00:17:29.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
How else can we work along
with Jehovah’s purpose?

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:32.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do that by being involved
in the preaching work.

00:17:32.405 --> 00:17:35.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word has gone out:
“This good news of the Kingdom

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:38.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
[must] be preached
in all the inhabited earth.”

00:17:38.828 --> 00:17:42.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many have tried
to prevent that from happening.

00:17:42.832 --> 00:17:45.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the early 20th century,

00:17:45.001 --> 00:17:47.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few prominent brothers opposed
the organization’s efforts

00:17:47.962 --> 00:17:50.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get everyone involved
in the preaching work.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those dignitaries were quite happy
to get all dressed up

00:17:54.177 --> 00:17:57.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give public talks to large audiences,

00:17:57.221 --> 00:18:01.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they refused to “lower themselves”
to go from house to house.

00:18:02.644 --> 00:18:05.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were fighting against God,

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:09.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the angels soon sifted them out.

00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:11.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of them were never heard of again.

00:18:13.738 --> 00:18:16.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in countries
where there’s a measure of religious freedom,

00:18:16.824 --> 00:18:20.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
fighters against God have tried to prevent us
from carrying out our commission.

00:18:20.912 --> 00:18:23.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You need a permit to go from house to house.

00:18:23.373 --> 00:18:25.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You can’t offer magazines on the street.

00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:28.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
You people are a dangerous sect.”

00:18:28.711 --> 00:18:32.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve even enacted laws
directed at stopping our work.

00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:36.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unless they change their ways,

00:18:36.302 --> 00:18:40.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
those lawmakers
are going to be in big trouble.

00:18:40.223 --> 00:18:44.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word has gone out: “As you go, preach.”

00:18:44.727 --> 00:18:46.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
That great work will be accomplished,

00:18:46.938 --> 00:18:49.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their support or in spite of them.

00:18:51.859 --> 00:18:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we mentioned, fighters against God

00:18:54.737 --> 00:18:58.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes seem to get away
with their acts of rebellion.

00:18:58.116 --> 00:19:00.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they’re on a slippery slope.

00:19:00.952 --> 00:19:03.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t express it better than David did

00:19:03.663 --> 00:19:06.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 37:1, 2:

00:19:06.749 --> 00:19:10.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be upset because of evil men

00:19:10.128 --> 00:19:12.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or envious of wrongdoers.

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:14.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will quickly wither like grass

00:19:14.757 --> 00:19:17.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
and shrivel like green new grass.”

00:19:18.386 --> 00:19:23.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you hear about powerful opposers
who seem to be untouchable,

00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:25.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember what we’ve discussed.

00:19:25.601 --> 00:19:28.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
These men may seem to prosper for a while,

00:19:28.855 --> 00:19:31.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
but since they’re fighting against God,

00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:34.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re more to be pitied than to be feared.

00:19:34.694 --> 00:19:37.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re on the wrong side.

00:19:37.238 --> 00:19:40.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are fighting a losing battle.

00:19:41.367 --> 00:19:45.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Splane,
for your encouraging discussion,

00:19:45.371 --> 00:19:48.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fighters Against God Always Lose.”

00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:53.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
How reassuring that is to all of us!

00:19:54.839 --> 00:19:57.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting Jehovah when faced with one problem

00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:00.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
after another is not easy,

00:20:00.678 --> 00:20:03.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it can refine us.

00:20:03.014 --> 00:20:07.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please listen as Sister Sigrid Detoffolli

00:20:07.143 --> 00:20:10.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
explains how she learned this lesson.

00:20:17.653 --> 00:20:19.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
World War II was going on,

00:20:20.948 --> 00:20:22.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting worse and worse.

00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:27.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got the evacuation notice,

00:20:28.539 --> 00:20:30.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we had to leave.

00:20:33.419 --> 00:20:35.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
People do terrible things to people.

00:20:38.508 --> 00:20:40.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were afraid.

00:20:44.055 --> 00:20:46.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter where you looked,

00:20:46.099 --> 00:20:49.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were worldly possessions,
material things.

00:20:50.686 --> 00:20:53.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
And everybody threw more things,

00:20:53.272 --> 00:20:55.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nobody picked anything up.

00:20:57.568 --> 00:20:59.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
What they carried were things

00:20:59.612 --> 00:21:01.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would save their life at the moment,

00:21:01.739 --> 00:21:03.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
something to eat.

00:21:05.952 --> 00:21:10.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really didn’t know how
I would spend my life at that time, right?

00:21:10.873 --> 00:21:15.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I knew
that I would not use it to get rich,

00:21:15.878 --> 00:21:18.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work and work, for what?

00:21:21.676 --> 00:21:23.970 line:10% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t dedicated to Jehovah at that time.

00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.222 line:10% position:50% align:center
Even so, I knew who Jehovah was,

00:21:26.222 --> 00:21:27.723 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we prayed to him,

00:21:27.723 --> 00:21:29.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m sure he helped us.

00:21:32.937 --> 00:21:35.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1946, we found out

00:21:35.314 --> 00:21:38.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
my father was alive and my sister was alive.

00:21:38.025 --> 00:21:40.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very privileged

00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:42.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be united as a family.

00:21:42.530 --> 00:21:47.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at that time, my father was near Berlin.

00:21:47.994 --> 00:21:50.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we started all over again.

00:21:51.497 --> 00:21:54.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father found the book <i>The Harp of God </i>

00:21:54.959 --> 00:21:56.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and started to study the Bible

00:21:56.752 --> 00:21:58.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my sister and with myself.

00:21:59.881 --> 00:22:04.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
And little by little,
he started a congregation at our house.

00:22:06.512 --> 00:22:11.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, coming to know Jehovah
and learning about the Paradise,

00:22:11.893 --> 00:22:13.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to tell people about it.

00:22:14.937 --> 00:22:17.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew I would have a purpose in life.

00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:24.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
I heard about Gilead, and I said: “Oh, boy!
That’s where I want to go.

00:22:24.363 --> 00:22:27.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to be a missionary
and tell the people about the Paradise.”

00:22:32.038 --> 00:22:34.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
The official ban on the Witnesses

00:22:34.207 --> 00:22:36.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Eastern zone of Germany

00:22:36.334 --> 00:22:40.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
came in 1950, but months before,

00:22:40.296 --> 00:22:43.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were already being observed.

00:22:43.257 --> 00:22:46.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father got literature

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:47.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the congregation.

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times he would send me

00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:54.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a bicycle
through the forest with the literature.

00:22:54.227 --> 00:22:58.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s interesting
when you’re in that situation

00:22:58.731 --> 00:23:02.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you might go to prison—
you just don’t worry about it.

00:23:02.735 --> 00:23:06.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
You trust in Jehovah, and you just go ahead.

00:23:06.239 --> 00:23:08.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what our family did.

00:23:11.369 --> 00:23:13.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then my father went to the branch,

00:23:13.537 --> 00:23:17.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they told him: “Max,” they said,
there’s an assembly in Berlin,

00:23:17.333 --> 00:23:21.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and if you come, don’t bring a Bible;

00:23:21.337 --> 00:23:23.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t bring a songbook; bring nothing.”

00:23:24.006 --> 00:23:26.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when our father
came back from that meeting,

00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:31.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
he told us and said, “Well, if we go,

00:23:31.222 --> 00:23:33.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
it looks like we can’t come back.”

00:23:35.268 --> 00:23:37.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said, “I’m going!”

00:23:37.979 --> 00:23:39.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my mother said, “I’m going!”

00:23:39.563 --> 00:23:42.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we all made up our minds
that we would go.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:45.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
That meant we would get prepared
to leave everything again, right?

00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:47.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I just put one dress

00:23:47.822 --> 00:23:49.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
on top of the other,

00:23:49.448 --> 00:23:51.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
took the bicycle, and off we went.

00:23:55.246 --> 00:23:59.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after we left, a police car came,

00:23:59.959 --> 00:24:02.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they looked for us.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:12.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a special arrangement
and privilege to be 

00:24:12.596 --> 00:24:14.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a convention in Berlin.

00:24:14.682 --> 00:24:17.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we all thanked Jehovah that we were there

00:24:17.268 --> 00:24:19.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen to and be strengthened

00:24:19.979 --> 00:24:21.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the spiritual food.

00:24:24.692 --> 00:24:26.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after the convention,

00:24:26.777 --> 00:24:30.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were recognized as refugees

00:24:32.033 --> 00:24:35.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and got out on a plane to West Germany.

00:24:36.245 --> 00:24:39.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father said:
“Well, now, here for the second time,

00:24:39.457 --> 00:24:44.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we lost all the material things
we had in Germany.

00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:47.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we better immigrate to the United States,”

00:24:47.131 --> 00:24:49.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
where my sister was
and we all would be together.

00:24:49.884 --> 00:24:52.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said, “Good, I’ll get close to Gilead!”

00:24:55.514 --> 00:24:58.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I was privileged

00:24:58.267 --> 00:25:01.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend the 29th class of Gilead.

00:25:01.729 --> 00:25:04.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my assignment was in Brazil,

00:25:05.816 --> 00:25:07.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was like paradise.

00:25:10.321 --> 00:25:14.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there I met my husband,
who was my circuit overseer.

00:25:16.535 --> 00:25:19.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I was privileged to travel with him.

00:25:19.497 --> 00:25:22.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a great, great blessing.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:27.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
No money can pay for the blessings I have.

00:25:30.508 --> 00:25:33.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life is the most important thing there is

00:25:33.052 --> 00:25:35.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
because no matter how much you have,

00:25:35.471 --> 00:25:37.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can’t prolong your life.

00:25:38.057 --> 00:25:40.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then learning about Jehovah,

00:25:40.059 --> 00:25:44.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
who gave his Son
to save us from all these terrible things,

00:25:44.688 --> 00:25:48.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
why wouldn’t you use your life to serve him?

00:25:51.445 --> 00:25:53.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust in Jehovah,

00:25:54.824 --> 00:25:58.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do what you can do
to serve him from your heart.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:25:59.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will never leave you.

00:26:02.206 --> 00:26:04.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Detoffolli’s story

00:26:04.208 --> 00:26:07.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not unlike what many of our brothers

00:26:07.211 --> 00:26:10.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
are going through right now.

00:26:10.131 --> 00:26:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following dramatization

00:26:12.508 --> 00:26:17.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
is based on the real-life experiences
of some of our brothers.

00:26:17.847 --> 00:26:21.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been three days
since the bombs started to fall.

00:26:25.479 --> 00:26:28.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the fighting got closer, we hid,

00:26:28.732 --> 00:26:33.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’m not sure
how much longer we can stay here.

00:26:35.448 --> 00:26:38.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some in the congregation
plan to leave the country.

00:26:38.993 --> 00:26:42.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mother says we’ll try too
when the shelling calms down.

00:26:42.496 --> 00:26:44.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it feels like it may never stop.

00:26:45.916 --> 00:26:48.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, can you still see us?

00:26:48.836 --> 00:26:51.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luda, you can finish this.

00:26:51.797 --> 00:26:53.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a little more.

00:26:57.511 --> 00:27:00.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always writing like your father.

00:27:00.097 --> 00:27:02.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Grandma.

00:27:07.062 --> 00:27:11.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you’re worried
about our brothers and sisters.

00:27:11.317 --> 00:27:13.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember the day’s text?

00:27:15.029 --> 00:27:18.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No weapon formed against you
will have any success.”

00:27:18.741 --> 00:27:20.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

00:27:21.869 --> 00:27:23.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we were under ban,

00:27:23.954 --> 00:27:28.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan did everything
to break our faith for decades,

00:27:30.085 --> 00:27:31.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he couldn’t stop us preaching.

00:27:31.879 --> 00:27:33.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you know why?

00:27:35.174 --> 00:27:36.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:27:36.926 --> 00:27:40.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing can take Jehovah’s love
away from his people.

00:27:40.679 --> 00:27:41.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
They tried,

00:27:41.889 --> 00:27:44.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we just drew closer to him.

00:27:46.477 --> 00:27:51.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cared for us then,
and he still does.

00:27:52.149 --> 00:27:54.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we lose our lives,

00:27:54.944 --> 00:27:59.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
that weapon will have no success
because of the resurrection.

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:13.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luda!

00:28:13.128 --> 00:28:14.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s time.

00:28:14.755 --> 00:28:16.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to go.
Now!

00:28:20.594 --> 00:28:23.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took forever to get to the station.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:30.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
One by one, trains left the city.

00:28:32.356 --> 00:28:36.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were so many people—so much fear.

00:28:38.028 --> 00:28:41.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of the brothers
were arrested because they would not fight,

00:28:41.490 --> 00:28:43.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a few were with us.

00:28:43.826 --> 00:28:46.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
The soldier will need to see your IDs.

00:28:46.036 --> 00:28:47.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s make a line.

00:28:49.623 --> 00:28:51.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hours felt like days.

00:28:53.002 --> 00:28:55.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know if we would get on.

00:28:57.631 --> 00:28:59.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Send the rest back to the shelter.

00:28:59.633 --> 00:29:00.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Confirmed.

00:29:04.221 --> 00:29:06.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no more room!

00:29:07.766 --> 00:29:10.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
You—from you back.

00:29:10.269 --> 00:29:11.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the shelter.

00:29:11.478 --> 00:29:12.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now!

00:29:18.652 --> 00:29:19.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry;

00:29:19.862 --> 00:29:22.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can try again tomorrow.

00:29:22.072 --> 00:29:24.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
This way, please.

00:29:36.128 --> 00:29:39.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luda, Jehovah will care for us.

00:29:39.131 --> 00:29:41.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is just a delay, not a defeat.

00:29:41.634 --> 00:29:43.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come, please.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll have to go check on the others,

00:29:49.141 --> 00:29:51.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’ll text you the moment we know more.

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:10.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you thinking about?

00:30:10.913 --> 00:30:13.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wish Papa were here with us.

00:30:13.957 --> 00:30:17.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you do.

00:30:17.002 --> 00:30:20.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your father knew you so well.

00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:22.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
I miss him too.

00:30:24.093 --> 00:30:26.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it hurts,

00:30:26.887 --> 00:30:31.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think of Jehovah’s special promise
to care for us.

00:30:32.559 --> 00:30:34.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember?

00:30:36.105 --> 00:30:38.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, um,

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:45.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 68:5, “a father of the fatherless.”

00:30:47.032 --> 00:30:49.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to trust him.

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can.

00:30:55.416 --> 00:30:57.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
The trains have stopped.

00:30:57.501 --> 00:31:00.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shelling destroyed some of the tracks.

00:31:00.129 --> 00:31:01.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
What?

00:31:01.964 --> 00:31:04.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we trapped?

00:31:08.095 --> 00:31:10.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry, dear.

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:12.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers know we are here.

00:31:12.391 --> 00:31:14.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah won’t forget us.

00:31:15.602 --> 00:31:17.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s pray.

00:31:23.819 --> 00:31:25.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sofiya!

00:31:25.362 --> 00:31:26.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luda!

00:31:28.323 --> 00:31:30.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anna!

00:31:30.159 --> 00:31:31.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re here.

00:31:31.869 --> 00:31:33.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re over here.

00:31:34.663 --> 00:31:36.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sorry it took so long.

00:31:36.707 --> 00:31:38.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you hear about the trains?

00:31:38.542 --> 00:31:41.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry;
there is good news.

00:31:44.214 --> 00:31:45.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
We couldn’t leave,

00:31:45.841 --> 00:31:48.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
but brothers and sisters
in a safe part of the city

00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:50.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
opened their homes to us.

00:31:52.389 --> 00:31:55.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned that a war can’t stop Jehovah.

00:31:55.726 --> 00:31:59.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll always find a way
to care for his people.

00:32:00.814 --> 00:32:03.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing can take Jehovah’s love away.

00:32:06.779 --> 00:32:11.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know where he will guide us,
but I trust him.

00:32:17.456 --> 00:32:20.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luda trusted in Jehovah

00:32:20.626 --> 00:32:25.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was not overreached
by fear or discouragement.

00:32:26.298 --> 00:32:30.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it mean to be overreached?

00:32:30.177 --> 00:32:33.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen carefully as Brother Harold Corkern

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:37.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
explains in this Morning Worship program.

00:32:38.185 --> 00:32:40.521 line:10% position:50% align:center
The expression used in our day’s text,

00:32:40.521 --> 00:32:42.940 line:10% position:50% align:center
the word used, is “overreached.”

00:32:43.607 --> 00:32:46.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
And what comes to mind when we hear

00:32:46.193 --> 00:32:48.612 line:10% position:50% align:center
of someone that has been overreached?

00:32:49.279 --> 00:32:51.949 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, to “overreach” means to “get better of,

00:32:51.949 --> 00:32:53.951 line:10% position:50% align:center
“or to get the better

00:32:53.951 --> 00:32:57.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of especially by deceit or trickery,

00:32:57.162 --> 00:33:01.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
to outwit, to overtake, to overpower.”

00:33:02.292 --> 00:33:05.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we have to be
very careful at all times

00:33:05.838 --> 00:33:08.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
because our enemy, the Devil,

00:33:08.173 --> 00:33:11.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
is out to trick us, deceive us,

00:33:11.051 --> 00:33:14.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
overtake us on any occasion possible.

00:33:14.847 --> 00:33:18.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he has quite a variety of tactics,
doesn’t he?

00:33:18.433 --> 00:33:20.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the Bible at Ephesians 6:11

00:33:20.936 --> 00:33:25.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
describes these
as “the crafty acts of the Devil.”

00:33:26.316 --> 00:33:29.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the context of today’s text
(in the background)

00:33:29.152 --> 00:33:32.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to illustrate
just two of those tactics.

00:33:32.656 --> 00:33:36.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite you to open your Bibles
to 2 Corinthians chapter 2.

00:33:37.786 --> 00:33:41.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in Paul’s first letter
to the Corinthians,

00:33:41.415 --> 00:33:43.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregation had been affected by a man

00:33:43.834 --> 00:33:46.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had been overreached by Satan

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:50.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being involved
in very gross sexual immorality.

00:33:51.425 --> 00:33:54.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on top of his being overreached,

00:33:54.011 --> 00:33:56.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregation was tolerating it.

00:33:56.722 --> 00:34:00.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so,
what did Paul tell them in very clear terms?

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:04.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must hand such a man over to Satan.”

00:34:04.313 --> 00:34:08.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Remove the wicked person
from among yourselves.”

00:34:08.358 --> 00:34:10.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the congregation responded,

00:34:10.652 --> 00:34:13.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually this very man

00:34:13.864 --> 00:34:17.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had been living
such an immoral life really repented.

00:34:17.743 --> 00:34:22.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now permissiveness

00:34:22.039 --> 00:34:25.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tolerating badness
was no longer the issue.

00:34:25.459 --> 00:34:27.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the issue?

00:34:27.085 --> 00:34:30.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
The matter of forgiving such a man.

00:34:30.255 --> 00:34:34.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 2 Corinthians chapter 2,
we read verse 6:

00:34:34.635 --> 00:34:39.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This rebuke given by the majority
is sufficient for such a man;

00:34:39.556 --> 00:34:43.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“now you should instead
kindly forgive and comfort him,

00:34:43.352 --> 00:34:47.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he may not be overwhelmed
by excessive sadness.”

00:34:48.815 --> 00:34:53.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who was behind that ploy
of excessive sadness?

00:34:53.111 --> 00:34:58.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 11: “So that we
may not be overreached by Satan,

00:34:58.116 --> 00:35:02.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
for we are not ignorant of his designs.”

00:35:02.245 --> 00:35:06.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the Devil will use whatever

00:35:06.291 --> 00:35:09.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the temptation of sexual immorality:

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:12.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
either being overly permissive

00:35:12.172 --> 00:35:15.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
or being harsh, unforgiving,

00:35:15.717 --> 00:35:18.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and lacking mercy.

00:35:18.011 --> 00:35:21.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of those tactics can be very effective

00:35:21.223 --> 00:35:24.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
in taking Jehovah’s people
away from their heavenly Father.

00:35:25.769 --> 00:35:30.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on this matter of temptations,
when it comes to sexual immorality,

00:35:30.565 --> 00:35:34.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s just briefly talk about another tactic
that the Devil uses.

00:35:35.904 --> 00:35:38.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can convince someone that they can taste

00:35:38.865 --> 00:35:41.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
or toy with things

00:35:41.284 --> 00:35:44.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might be unclean or are unclean

00:35:44.663 --> 00:35:48.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that there will be no lasting harm
or no serious consequences to that.

00:35:49.793 --> 00:35:53.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may even touch something unclean,

00:35:53.046 --> 00:35:55.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and since nothing
apparently bad has happened,

00:35:55.048 --> 00:35:57.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
they conclude that it’s OK.

00:35:58.593 --> 00:36:02.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
But such a person is forgetting
the unchangeable law of Jehovah,

00:36:02.222 --> 00:36:04.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Galatians 6:7:

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:09.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whatever a [man] is sowing,
this he will also reap.”

00:36:09.312 --> 00:36:13.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just to illustrate that
(how the Devil can use bait

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and convince somebody that they’re
not really in any kind of trouble

00:36:16.903 --> 00:36:19.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet he will catch them),

00:36:19.656 --> 00:36:22.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to tell you an account
that goes back many years.

00:36:23.785 --> 00:36:28.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a group of young men
at a freshwater lake, and they were fishing.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they could look down into this lake,

00:36:30.876 --> 00:36:35.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they could see these big bass
—beautiful fish.

00:36:36.089 --> 00:36:39.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they tried all sorts of lures;

00:36:39.259 --> 00:36:43.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
they tried worms on hooks, artificial lures.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:47.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those big fish would not bite.

00:36:47.017 --> 00:36:49.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then an older gentleman came along,
and he said,

00:36:49.519 --> 00:36:51.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give me one of your worms.”

00:36:51.938 --> 00:36:53.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he took the worm without the hook,

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:57.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he threw it out in the vicinity
of where these big bass were.

00:36:57.277 --> 00:36:59.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a bass came and he took the worm.

00:36:59.821 --> 00:37:03.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said,
“Throw another one without the hook.”

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:05.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
He threw it; the bass took it.

00:37:05.744 --> 00:37:10.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now he said,
“Put the worm on the hook and cast.”

00:37:10.499 --> 00:37:12.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fish was caught.

00:37:13.418 --> 00:37:15.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is the lesson?

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:17.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil will give us bait sometimes,

00:37:17.672 --> 00:37:19.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it appears that it’s very pleasurable.

00:37:19.758 --> 00:37:22.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There’s nothing wrong here.
It’s harmless.”

00:37:22.761 --> 00:37:26.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with the Devil, there is always the hook

00:37:26.264 --> 00:37:28.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
—always the hook—

00:37:28.266 --> 00:37:31.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can cause spiritual, emotional, mental,

00:37:31.311 --> 00:37:33.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even physical harm.

00:37:33.605 --> 00:37:38.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can literally cost us our life
if we get tricked into thinking

00:37:38.568 --> 00:37:41.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
that uncleanness will not hurt us.

00:37:42.364 --> 00:37:46.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, besides pleasure
and the temptations that go with that,

00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:50.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Devil will also use pain and suffering.

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in the experience of Job,

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:58.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
he lost his material possessions,

00:37:58.588 --> 00:38:02.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
he lost his children, he got very ill.

00:38:02.676 --> 00:38:07.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
That caused all sorts
of physical and emotional pain,

00:38:07.097 --> 00:38:08.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
not pleasure.

00:38:09.975 --> 00:38:13.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with all that he was going through,

00:38:13.019 --> 00:38:16.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
then his so-called friends
came to comfort him.

00:38:16.314 --> 00:38:21.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they accused him of all sorts
of bad attitudes and actions.

00:38:21.319 --> 00:38:25.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they even put doubts in Job’s mind
—or tried to—

00:38:25.532 --> 00:38:28.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah couldn’t be pleased anyway.

00:38:30.162 --> 00:38:34.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was one of the toughest tests
that he faced

00:38:34.457 --> 00:38:38.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
from his friends
and from the words that they said.

00:38:39.254 --> 00:38:41.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, commenting on this,

00:38:41.506 --> 00:38:45.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
the August 15, 2002,<i> Watchtower</i>

00:38:45.719 --> 00:38:48.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
said this about how a great test

00:38:48.805 --> 00:38:51.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
can come from our fellow worshippers.

00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:56.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says this:
“Satan still makes use of misguided counsel

00:38:56.146 --> 00:39:00.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or thoughtless remarks
from friends and fellow believers.

00:39:00.066 --> 00:39:02.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Discouragement from within the congregation

00:39:02.152 --> 00:39:05.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“can undermine our morale more easily

00:39:05.864 --> 00:39:08.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
than persecution from without.”

00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:13.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then this article went on to explain
that there was a brother serving as an elder,

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he had seen active combat in the army.

00:39:16.708 --> 00:39:19.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’d been through terrible things.

00:39:19.169 --> 00:39:23.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when he faced criticism
and thoughtless remarks

00:39:23.798 --> 00:39:27.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was hurt by his fellow workers
in the congregation,

00:39:27.719 --> 00:39:31.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did he say about those tests
within the congregation?

00:39:31.431 --> 00:39:34.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “It’s the hardest thing

00:39:34.976 --> 00:39:37.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have ever been through [in my life].”

00:39:37.979 --> 00:39:40.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can the Devil use?

00:39:40.565 --> 00:39:44.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our own brothers can say
or do things sometimes,

00:39:44.194 --> 00:39:47.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Devil will play
on that and amplify that

00:39:47.489 --> 00:39:51.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cause one to stop serving Jehovah.

00:39:52.994 --> 00:39:55.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously there are
a variety of “crafty acts,”

00:39:55.830 --> 00:39:58.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve only covered
just a couple of them this morning.

00:39:59.834 --> 00:40:03.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what do we do to protect ourselves?

00:40:03.255 --> 00:40:07.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 4:7 says:
“Therefore, subject yourselves to God;

00:40:07.926 --> 00:40:10.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
but oppose the Devil.”

00:40:10.637 --> 00:40:14.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do that,
we always must remember

00:40:14.808 --> 00:40:18.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
the model prayer given by Jesus,
where he said:

00:40:18.103 --> 00:40:21.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Deliver us from the wicked one.”

00:40:23.024 --> 00:40:26.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why is that so important?

00:40:26.111 --> 00:40:29.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we bear Jehovah’s name.

00:40:29.155 --> 00:40:31.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he is very anxious to protect his name,

00:40:31.950 --> 00:40:34.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he loves us very much.

00:40:34.536 --> 00:40:36.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s our Father.

00:40:36.538 --> 00:40:38.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like any loving father,

00:40:38.623 --> 00:40:40.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he saw one of his faithful sons

00:40:40.792 --> 00:40:44.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
going through a terrible trial by someone
that was trying to kill him, 

00:40:44.713 --> 00:40:48.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
that father would respond quickly,
wouldn’t he?

00:40:48.425 --> 00:40:51.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does Jehovah feel about us?

00:40:51.511 --> 00:40:55.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s open our Bibles
to the book of Malachi

00:40:55.598 --> 00:40:59.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just reemphasize
how much Jehovah cares for us

00:40:59.978 --> 00:41:02.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why he would respond so quickly

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:05.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our cries for help to deliver us
from “the wicked one.”

00:41:06.776 --> 00:41:11.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Malachi 3:17, it says:

00:41:11.031 --> 00:41:14.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘And they will be mine,’
says Jehovah of armies,

00:41:14.868 --> 00:41:18.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in the day when I produce
a special property.

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:20.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I will show them compassion,

00:41:20.749 --> 00:41:24.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘just as a man shows compassion

00:41:24.044 --> 00:41:27.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his son who serves him.’”

00:41:27.255 --> 00:41:31.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a warm arrangement there,
isn’t it?

00:41:31.092 --> 00:41:33.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah cares for us.

00:41:33.094 --> 00:41:36.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other Bible translations,
when they talk about “special property,”

00:41:36.431 --> 00:41:40.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
use these expressions: “my very own,”

00:41:40.435 --> 00:41:44.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“my most prized possession,” “my jewels.”

00:41:44.356 --> 00:41:46.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves us.

00:41:46.691 --> 00:41:51.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah will only allow
the Devil to go so far

00:41:51.696 --> 00:41:56.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
in testing us, only according
to what Jehovah wills at the moment.

00:41:56.034 --> 00:41:57.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:41:57.869 --> 00:42:02.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember in the case of Job,
when fire came down from heaven

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:06.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
and consumed Job’s flock of sheep
and even some of his servants?

00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:10.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil caused that fire,
and Jehovah allowed it.

00:42:10.673 --> 00:42:12.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
But later in 1 Kings chapter 18

00:42:12.926 --> 00:42:17.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the fire test at Mount Carmel

00:42:17.263 --> 00:42:20.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
when there were two bulls,
the idea was to figure out

00:42:20.433 --> 00:42:23.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
who the true God is—Jehovah or Baal.

00:42:23.353 --> 00:42:26.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those Baal worshippers
went from morning to night

00:42:26.106 --> 00:42:29.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
crying out to their false god

00:42:29.109 --> 00:42:32.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not one flicker of flame
could be produced.

00:42:33.696 --> 00:42:38.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would not allow the Devil
to even burn up one bull

00:42:38.618 --> 00:42:42.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
in contrast to what he had done
with all those many sheep.

00:42:42.705 --> 00:42:45.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is in control.

00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:48.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what Jehovah allows today—

00:42:48.044 --> 00:42:51.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be sure that whatever
He allows the Devil to do

00:42:51.506 --> 00:42:55.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cause us emotional pain, physical pain,

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
to even persecute us,
perhaps even kill some of us

00:42:59.973 --> 00:43:02.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
—by means of his Son, Christ Jesus,

00:43:02.767 --> 00:43:07.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has made a way “to break up
the works of the Devil” completely.

00:43:08.189 --> 00:43:11.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever happens,
when we stay loyal to Jehovah

00:43:11.651 --> 00:43:15.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are on guard
against the crafty acts of the Devil,

00:43:15.029 --> 00:43:17.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not be overreached.

00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:20.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
No permanent harm
can come to Jehovah’s people

00:43:20.827 --> 00:43:24.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
by this deceitful, treacherous enemy.

00:43:24.539 --> 00:43:28.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
May all of us continue to stay on the alert,

00:43:28.376 --> 00:43:31.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
be mindful of the Devil’s tactics,

00:43:31.171 --> 00:43:33.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beg Jehovah to deliver us,

00:43:33.214 --> 00:43:35.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we can be confident that our loving,

00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
heavenly Father will never abandon us.

00:43:39.888 --> 00:43:44.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan may even use family members
who mean well

00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:47.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discourage us from serving Jehovah.

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this is your situation,

00:43:49.898 --> 00:43:54.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will find the following episode
of <i>Where Are They Now?</i>

00:43:54.527 --> 00:43:56.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially strengthening.

00:44:04.829 --> 00:44:06.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Karen Malone,

00:44:06.122 --> 00:44:08.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was born in Iowa,

00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:11.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I was raised all over
because my dad was in the military.

00:44:13.505 --> 00:44:16.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I think about Karen and how
she came into the truth, it touches my heart

00:44:16.591 --> 00:44:19.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she had no family in the truth.

00:44:19.636 --> 00:44:22.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, they didn’t support her at all.

00:44:23.014 --> 00:44:25.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once I knew who Jehovah was,

00:44:25.058 --> 00:44:28.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made it a goal in my life
that I just wanted to serve him forever,

00:44:28.811 --> 00:44:31.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I wanted to be happy doing it.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:42.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
I met Karen at Bethel.

00:44:43.076 --> 00:44:45.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was special pioneering in Tennessee,

00:44:45.203 --> 00:44:49.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was serving at Bethel,
and she came through on tour.

00:44:50.124 --> 00:44:52.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
A year later or so, we got married.

00:44:52.835 --> 00:44:55.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then nine months later,
we went back to Bethel.

00:44:56.297 --> 00:44:59.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in 1980 we left Bethel.

00:44:59.133 --> 00:45:01.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had our daughter that year.

00:45:01.678 --> 00:45:03.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
It changed things,

00:45:03.888 --> 00:45:07.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you just give your energy
and your love and your time

00:45:07.225 --> 00:45:09.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
to whatever assignment Jehovah gives you.

00:45:11.271 --> 00:45:15.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
She would take the kids out with her
in the field ministry during the week,

00:45:15.108 --> 00:45:16.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she always made it fun.

00:45:16.734 --> 00:45:19.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was one of the things
that was important to her,

00:45:19.904 --> 00:45:22.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when the kids
went in the field ministry,

00:45:22.907 --> 00:45:24.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
they enjoyed it.

00:45:26.995 --> 00:45:31.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just a matter of blooming
where you’re planted, wherever you’re at.

00:45:33.376 --> 00:45:37.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t ever walk into a congregation
and expect people to come up to us.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d be proactive in meeting people

00:45:40.091 --> 00:45:42.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trying to become a part
of wherever we were put

00:45:42.844 --> 00:45:44.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that it could become our home.

00:45:46.055 --> 00:45:49.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just loving them
—if they needed soup, we’d make soup.

00:45:49.559 --> 00:45:51.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they needed a meal,

00:45:51.561 --> 00:45:54.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they needed their house cleaned,
if they needed a babysitter,

00:45:54.314 --> 00:45:57.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
if there was a need,
we wanted to help them with it.

00:45:58.443 --> 00:46:02.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many challenges in life
that try to rob us of our peace.

00:46:03.573 --> 00:46:05.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s our choice if we let them.

00:46:06.534 --> 00:46:09.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we don’t let them.

00:46:13.166 --> 00:46:16.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were invited back to Bethel in 2007,

00:46:16.252 --> 00:46:18.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve been there since.

00:46:19.839 --> 00:46:23.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
I came into a beautiful department,
the Health Care Department,

00:46:23.635 --> 00:46:26.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
with people who were experts at it.

00:46:26.262 --> 00:46:29.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
To bloom where I was planted when I was put
in front of these two computer screens

00:46:29.557 --> 00:46:31.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
took a lot of prayer.

00:46:31.017 --> 00:46:33.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I remember 
literally going to the bathroom

00:46:33.645 --> 00:46:37.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and crying and telling Jehovah:
“Look, I know you can part the Red Sea.

00:46:37.899 --> 00:46:41.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to have to get this information
from here to here”

00:46:41.402 --> 00:46:42.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
—because I was a blank page.

00:46:42.862 --> 00:46:46.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the beautiful thing is
that two precious sisters, Bonnie and Zulma,

00:46:46.949 --> 00:46:49.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom I still treasure and work with,
helped me.

00:46:49.911 --> 00:46:51.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they taught me.

00:46:51.954 --> 00:46:53.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know that expression,

00:46:53.331 --> 00:46:56.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you can’t change your circumstance,
change your attitude.”

00:46:56.709 --> 00:47:00.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I really made it a matter of prayer
and, again, I had wonderful helpers

00:47:01.422 --> 00:47:04.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
who taught me and helped me to learn.

00:47:07.303 --> 00:47:08.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I first learned the truth, I realized

00:47:08.638 --> 00:47:12.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there are scriptures that teach us
the truth and then there are scriptures

00:47:12.475 --> 00:47:14.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will keep us in the truth.

00:47:14.602 --> 00:47:16.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I call those my “heart scriptures.”

00:47:16.979 --> 00:47:19.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those are my go-to scriptures.

00:47:19.190 --> 00:47:22.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
When things were rough,
when I was dealing with things,

00:47:22.110 --> 00:47:25.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
when something
was trying to rob me of my joy,

00:47:25.363 --> 00:47:27.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d refer to those “heart scriptures”

00:47:27.490 --> 00:47:31.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they would reinforce the conviction:

00:47:31.035 --> 00:47:34.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, no, you’re not going to win, Satan.”

00:47:35.915 --> 00:47:38.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
My favorite scripture
that I think epitomizes that

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:42.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Proverbs 27:11, which we all know,
where it says:

00:47:42.004 --> 00:47:45.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be wise, my son,
and make my heart rejoice,

00:47:45.049 --> 00:47:48.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can make a reply
to him who taunts me.”

00:47:49.053 --> 00:47:50.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what it’s all about.

00:47:50.138 --> 00:47:53.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s about Jehovah’s name
and making a reply to the Devil.

00:47:54.475 --> 00:47:57.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
His sovereignty is what’s important.
It’s not about us.

00:47:58.813 --> 00:48:03.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really love being parents
and loved pioneering together.

00:48:04.444 --> 00:48:08.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve loved every gift that we’ve been given.

00:48:10.366 --> 00:48:13.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
I tell my kids:
“Each day we live is a gift from God.

00:48:13.453 --> 00:48:16.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
How we live it is our gift to him.”

00:48:18.082 --> 00:48:20.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
The truth is only hard if we fight it.

00:48:20.334 --> 00:48:24.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we listen to Jehovah,
if we do what we’re asked,

00:48:24.297 --> 00:48:26.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
the blessings will catch up with us.

00:48:28.509 --> 00:48:32.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best day we could have here
—and we’ve all had wonderful days—

00:48:32.263 --> 00:48:36.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
is nothing in comparison
to the first day in the new world.

00:48:37.769 --> 00:48:40.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s such an amazing thought

00:48:40.688 --> 00:48:43.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think that all we have to do
is make good choices now

00:48:43.983 --> 00:48:45.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we’re going to be there!

00:48:51.532 --> 00:48:53.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
How delighted we are

00:48:53.951 --> 00:48:57.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Karen not only found
a supportive spiritual family

00:48:57.789 --> 00:49:01.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now contributes so much to it!

00:49:01.876 --> 00:49:06.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our spiritual family can bring us
much joy and peace,

00:49:06.005 --> 00:49:09.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ll see in this month’s music video.

00:49:24.065 --> 00:49:30.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s hard to face this life
with all we see,

00:49:30.321 --> 00:49:38.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
To not focus on
the uncertainty.

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:44.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anxious thoughts at times
we all may feel,

00:49:44.794 --> 00:49:51.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when we pray,
his promise is real.

00:49:51.217 --> 00:49:59.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives us peace
like a river—

00:49:59.767 --> 00:50:10.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace like a cool, gentle rain—
The hope to carry on,

00:50:10.361 --> 00:50:18.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
The power to stand strong
and know we’re not on our own.

00:50:21.205 --> 00:50:29.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his peace will flow forever,
yes, peace like a river.

00:50:40.516 --> 00:50:46.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
So pour out your heart to him
in prayer.

00:50:46.939 --> 00:50:54.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s listening;
he’s always there

00:50:54.155 --> 00:51:00.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
To comfort us
and guard our heart and mind.

00:51:00.870 --> 00:51:07.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfailing love from him
we find.

00:51:07.501 --> 00:51:15.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives us peace
like a river—

00:51:15.551 --> 00:51:26.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace like a cool, gentle rain—
The hope to carry on,

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
The power to stand strong
and know we’re not on our own.

00:51:37.531 --> 00:51:46.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his peace will flow forever,
yes, peace like a river.

00:52:12.149 --> 00:52:21.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives us peace
like a river—

00:52:21.409 --> 00:52:31.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace like a cool, gentle rain—
The hope to carry on,

00:52:31.752 --> 00:52:41.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
The power to stand strong
and know we’re not on our own.

00:52:42.722 --> 00:52:52.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his peace will flow forever,
yes, peace like a river.

00:53:10.041 --> 00:53:12.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you do in the ministry

00:53:12.752 --> 00:53:16.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it seems like no one is home?

00:53:16.047 --> 00:53:18.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ll see in this next episode

00:53:18.758 --> 00:53:21.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Iron Sharpens Iron,</i>

00:53:21.802 --> 00:53:24.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
there may still be many opportunities

00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
all around us to give a witness.

00:53:28.184 --> 00:53:33.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, I am Victor Anibaba,
and this is <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.” </i>

00:53:41.655 --> 00:53:43.657 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, so far in our series,

00:53:43.657 --> 00:53:45.951 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’ve discussed how we can become

00:53:45.951 --> 00:53:48.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
more effective at our ministry

00:53:48.079 --> 00:53:50.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a number of different ways,

00:53:50.081 --> 00:53:52.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as by starting conversations,

00:53:52.958 --> 00:53:54.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking questions,

00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:57.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
and getting better at return visits.

00:53:58.172 --> 00:54:01.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these techniques only work

00:54:01.300 --> 00:54:04.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we actually find people to talk to,

00:54:05.679 --> 00:54:08.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes
that can be our greatest challenge.

00:54:18.442 --> 00:54:21.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever had days like this
in the ministry

00:54:22.154 --> 00:54:25.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it seemed
that there was just no one to talk to?

00:54:27.118 --> 00:54:29.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you’ll be pleased to know

00:54:29.203 --> 00:54:31.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our literature is full of tips

00:54:31.747 --> 00:54:35.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help us
contact more people in our territory.

00:54:36.544 --> 00:54:39.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this episode,
we will consider three

00:54:39.713 --> 00:54:42.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have proved to be very effective.

00:54:42.925 --> 00:54:47.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tip number one: Be observant.

00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:52.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
There may actually be more opportunities
for us to contact people

00:54:52.309 --> 00:54:56.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we actually know where to look.

00:54:56.522 --> 00:55:00.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take for example our brothers and sisters
who we were just watching.

00:55:00.276 --> 00:55:03.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it is true
that there was no one at home,

00:55:03.571 --> 00:55:06.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
but does that mean
there was no one to talk to?

00:55:07.992 --> 00:55:09.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s see.

00:55:12.872 --> 00:55:13.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:55:13.914 --> 00:55:14.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:55:14.957 --> 00:55:16.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your dog is so cute.

00:55:16.709 --> 00:55:17.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s its name?

00:55:17.710 --> 00:55:18.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Darleen.

00:55:18.794 --> 00:55:22.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just like that,
a conversation is underway.

00:55:24.300 --> 00:55:27.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how about our couple
getting back into their car?

00:55:32.683 --> 00:55:35.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
By being observant,

00:55:35.436 --> 00:55:37.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
they too were able to give a witness.

00:55:37.813 --> 00:55:39.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more observant we are,

00:55:39.815 --> 00:55:41.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more opportunities we may find.

00:55:44.361 --> 00:55:48.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
The key is
to remain focused on our objective,

00:55:48.324 --> 00:55:50.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is to give a witness.

00:55:50.993 --> 00:55:53.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that can happen in between doors

00:55:53.954 --> 00:55:57.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as easily
as it could happen at the doors.

00:55:57.833 --> 00:56:01.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how about our tip number two?

00:56:01.587 --> 00:56:04.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is this: Be prepared.

00:56:04.924 --> 00:56:08.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often have you encountered someone
in your territory

00:56:08.427 --> 00:56:10.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
who doesn’t speak your language?

00:56:10.888 --> 00:56:15.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, growing up in London,
this used to happen all the time.

00:56:15.017 --> 00:56:17.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these days,
it’s not just big cities

00:56:17.394 --> 00:56:20.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we find this mixture
of culture and languages.

00:56:20.898 --> 00:56:25.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
The whole world
is becoming so much more cosmopolitan.

00:56:25.527 --> 00:56:30.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we do to be prepared?

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:33.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t have the gift of tongues

00:56:33.202 --> 00:56:36.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the first-century Christians did
at Pentecost,

00:56:36.121 --> 00:56:38.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do have the gift

00:56:38.457 --> 00:56:42.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>JW Language®</i>.

00:56:42.836 --> 00:56:47.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now with this app,
you can learn a simple presentation

00:56:47.007 --> 00:56:49.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
in dozens of different languages.

00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:50.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a look.

00:56:51.595 --> 00:56:55.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s designed in a very easy-to-use manner.

00:56:55.891 --> 00:56:57.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
First,

00:56:57.935 --> 00:57:00.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
set the primary language
to the one you speak

00:57:02.648 --> 00:57:05.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the target language
to the one you want to learn.

00:57:07.945 --> 00:57:10.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, under Preaching Skills,

00:57:10.781 --> 00:57:13.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
choose Greetings and Introductions

00:57:13.909 --> 00:57:17.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn how to say a simple, “hello.”

00:57:19.206 --> 00:57:22.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
And “I am pleased to meet you.”

00:57:26.463 --> 00:57:31.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Dobryi den’</i>. 
<i>Pryyemno poznayomytys’a</i>.

00:57:32.386 --> 00:57:34.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think I’ve made a mess of that.
I best try it again.

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Dobryi den’</i>. 
<i>Pryyemno poznayomytys’a</i>.

00:57:40.477 --> 00:57:44.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I still need to work on my accent,
but I think you get the idea.

00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:50.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a little practice,
you can ask simple questions

00:57:50.654 --> 00:57:54.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even introduce and explain a scripture.

00:57:54.783 --> 00:57:58.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really works.
Let’s look at an example.

00:57:58.662 --> 00:58:01.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi there,
we are making brief visits on our neighbors.

00:58:01.081 --> 00:58:02.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, no speak English.

00:58:02.708 --> 00:58:04.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, Arabic?

00:58:18.307 --> 00:58:21.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a great way to give a witness
to even more in our territory!

00:58:22.936 --> 00:58:25.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if mastering a whole presentation
in another language

00:58:25.939 --> 00:58:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
seems a bit overwhelming,

00:58:27.983 --> 00:58:30.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
then here’s a simple suggestion:

00:58:30.527 --> 00:58:32.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just learn a greeting.

00:58:32.571 --> 00:58:34.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s only a few words,

00:58:34.573 --> 00:58:37.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
but don’t underestimate the power

00:58:37.409 --> 00:58:40.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
of greeting someone in their native tongue

00:58:40.079 --> 00:58:42.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with a warm smile.

00:58:42.247 --> 00:58:44.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can certainly open up doors,

00:58:44.458 --> 00:58:46.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it could also pave the way
for you to call back

00:58:46.919 --> 00:58:50.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
with someone who does speak their language.

00:58:50.047 --> 00:58:54.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings us on to our third tip:

00:58:54.134 --> 00:58:57.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be diligent and follow up,

00:58:57.304 --> 00:59:00.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
which, first of all,
means trying to contact

00:59:00.307 --> 00:59:02.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
all those who weren’t home initially,

00:59:02.893 --> 00:59:06.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
either on a different day
or at a different time.

00:59:06.397 --> 00:59:08.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you can’t find them in that way,

00:59:08.524 --> 00:59:12.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
then don’t overlook
letter writing and telephone witnessing.

00:59:13.112 --> 00:59:15.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
These methods proved very effective
during the pandemic,

00:59:16.865 --> 00:59:19.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even now they can still help us

00:59:19.284 --> 00:59:22.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach those we can’t find at home.

00:59:22.079 --> 00:59:25.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regardless of what way
we have contacted someone,

00:59:25.833 --> 00:59:29.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
please be sure not to forget them,

00:59:29.044 --> 00:59:31.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
but return promptly

00:59:31.046 --> 00:59:34.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
to follow up on any interest
that you have found.

00:59:34.842 --> 00:59:39.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, reaching everyone in our territory
is definitely a challenge.

00:59:40.305 --> 00:59:43.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the tips we’ve discussed here today

00:59:43.058 --> 00:59:45.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
—(1) being observant,

00:59:45.602 --> 00:59:47.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) being prepared,

00:59:47.896 --> 00:59:52.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) being diligent
as we follow up on interest that we find—

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:57.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help all of us
fully accomplish our ministry.

00:59:57.906 --> 01:00:01.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do that,
we’ll be imitating Jesus,

01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:04.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
who wanted to give everyone

01:00:04.246 --> 01:00:07.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
an opportunity to come to know Jehovah.

01:00:08.375 --> 01:00:11.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
What excellent suggestions for the ministry!

01:00:11.545 --> 01:00:13.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look forward to using them

01:00:13.547 --> 01:00:18.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
during our upcoming
regional convention campaign.

01:00:18.135 --> 01:00:20.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to have a look at what

01:00:20.471 --> 01:00:23.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expect
from this year’s convention program?

01:00:31.356 --> 01:00:36.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good news is needed now more than ever.

01:00:40.073 --> 01:00:43.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news we need
is not of human origin.

01:00:44.328 --> 01:00:49.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
It originates with the Giver of real hope,
Jehovah God,

01:00:49.249 --> 01:00:53.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it centers on his Son,
Jesus Christ.

01:00:56.757 --> 01:00:59.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is this good news?

01:00:59.635 --> 01:01:01.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we trust it?

01:01:01.512 --> 01:01:04.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
And can it help people right now?

01:01:07.267 --> 01:01:11.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year’s “Declare the Good News!”
Convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:01:11.813 --> 01:01:16.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
will bolster confidence in God and his Son.

01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:21.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news of God’s Kingdom
will help you to cope with life now

01:01:21.698 --> 01:01:25.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and prepare you for eternal life
in the future.

01:01:25.994 --> 01:01:29.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that is good news!

01:01:36.838 --> 01:01:38.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a lot to look forward to

01:01:38.715 --> 01:01:41.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
at this year’s convention.

01:01:41.051 --> 01:01:46.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a faith-strengthening program
we’ve just enjoyed!

01:01:46.056 --> 01:01:50.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned that anyone who fights against God

01:01:50.102 --> 01:01:53.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
is on the losing side of the battle.

01:01:53.772 --> 01:01:57.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
We show our desire to work with God

01:01:57.859 --> 01:02:02.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
by keeping peace in the congregation
and by giving our all in the preaching work.

01:02:04.825 --> 01:02:06.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the dramatization,

01:02:06.994 --> 01:02:10.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
young Luda learned that Jehovah
never abandons 

01:02:10.956 --> 01:02:13.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
his loyal ones.

01:02:13.584 --> 01:02:15.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our music video

01:02:15.877 --> 01:02:19.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
beautifully illustrated that peace

01:02:19.298 --> 01:02:23.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strength belong
to those who rely on Jehovah.

01:02:24.886 --> 01:02:28.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have one more treat in store for you.

01:02:28.390 --> 01:02:33.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to announce a new series
for our young people,

01:02:33.395 --> 01:02:36.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
called <i>Learn From Jehovah’s Friends</i>.

01:02:37.441 --> 01:02:39.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
These short, animated videos

01:02:39.526 --> 01:02:42.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
will teach those
who are starting to read on their own

01:02:42.654 --> 01:02:46.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
about persons in the Bible who loved Jehovah.

01:02:47.034 --> 01:02:51.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look for it on JW Broadcasting soon.

01:02:52.873 --> 01:02:55.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our video postcard this month

01:02:55.083 --> 01:02:57.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes from a place known

01:02:57.127 --> 01:03:00.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the Land of Incorruptible People.

01:03:00.672 --> 01:03:03.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where might that be?

01:03:03.133 --> 01:03:04.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
The country’s name

01:03:04.593 --> 01:03:08.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
combines two words: “integrity”

01:03:08.221 --> 01:03:11.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Moore language and “homeland”

01:03:11.892 --> 01:03:15.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Jula language.

01:03:15.479 --> 01:03:20.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Burkina Faso,
a landlocked country in West Africa.

01:03:21.777 --> 01:03:25.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first Kingdom publisher
arrived in Burkina Faso

01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:29.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Ghana in 1959.

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:32.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1972,

01:03:32.204 --> 01:03:34.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first of many

01:03:34.414 --> 01:03:37.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
intrepid missionaries arrived.

01:03:37.501 --> 01:03:40.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just two years later,

01:03:40.212 --> 01:03:42.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
congregations were formed in the capital,

01:03:42.881 --> 01:03:46.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ouagadougou, and in Bobo-Dioulasso,

01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:48.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the west of the country.

01:03:51.056 --> 01:03:54.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daytime temperatures average
around 30 degrees Celsius,

01:03:54.059 --> 01:03:57.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 86 degrees Fahrenheit,

01:03:57.312 --> 01:04:00.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
and may be much warmer
during the peak of the dry season.

01:04:01.566 --> 01:04:06.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, a host will welcome visitors
with a drink of water.

01:04:06.446 --> 01:04:09.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
A common saying in the Moore language

01:04:09.408 --> 01:04:12.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
is <i>“Sãan la koom,” </i>

01:04:12.244 --> 01:04:15.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
which literally means “The guest is water.”

01:04:16.998 --> 01:04:20.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people are working hard

01:04:20.293 --> 01:04:23.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take life-giving waters of Bible truth

01:04:23.964 --> 01:04:27.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the nearly 23 million people

01:04:27.968 --> 01:04:31.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
scattered in villages
through the savanna and forest.

01:04:32.973 --> 01:04:35.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
In March 2023,

01:04:35.475 --> 01:04:38.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Burkina Faso reached a new peak

01:04:38.645 --> 01:04:42.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 684 auxiliary pioneers.

01:04:44.151 --> 01:04:47.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, there are over 2,000 publishers

01:04:47.988 --> 01:04:50.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Burkina Faso.

01:04:51.158 --> 01:04:53.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is no small feat,

01:04:53.076 --> 01:04:57.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
owing to the travel difficulties
between villages

01:04:57.247 --> 01:05:00.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the 66 indigenous languages

01:05:00.250 --> 01:05:02.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
spoken throughout the country.

01:05:03.962 --> 01:05:06.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two remote translation offices

01:05:06.673 --> 01:05:10.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
produce literature
for the Moore and Jula languages.

01:05:11.636 --> 01:05:13.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in 2023,

01:05:13.930 --> 01:05:16.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers were overjoyed

01:05:16.516 --> 01:05:21.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive the complete
<i>New World Translation</i>  in the Moore language.

01:05:22.105 --> 01:05:25.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters
from the Kamboincé Moore

01:05:25.442 --> 01:05:27.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Tampouy Moore congregations

01:05:27.986 --> 01:05:31.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their love and affection

01:05:31.531 --> 01:05:33.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood!

01:05:33.992 --> 01:05:36.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you enjoyed our monthly program.

01:05:37.746 --> 01:05:40.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I want to thank you, Saki,
for all your help.

01:05:40.290 --> 01:05:41.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was really appreciated.

01:05:41.917 --> 01:05:43.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re welcome.

01:05:43.084 --> 01:05:45.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:05:45.837 --> 01:05:49.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
