00:01.183 --> 00:05.588
This is the January 2018 edition 
of JW Broadcasting. 


00:05.588 --> 00:08.000
Welcome, one and all.


00:27.177 --> 00:29.479
As Mark Noumair explained last month, 


00:29.478 --> 00:30.480
the Governing Body 


00:30.480 --> 00:31.782
has approved the annual meeting 


00:31.782 --> 00:33.784
of the Pennsylvania Corporation 


00:33.783 --> 00:35.785
to be broadcast each year 


00:35.785 --> 00:39.155
as a monthly JW Broadcasting program. 


00:39.155 --> 00:42.458
In this way, 
more translation teams around the world 


00:42.458 --> 00:45.161
will have the resources 
to make this program available 


00:45.162 --> 00:48.665
to viewers in many more languages.


00:48.665 --> 00:51.835
This annual meeting was indeed special. 


00:51.835 --> 00:55.538
It was held on October 7, 2017. 


00:55.538 --> 01:00.110
Since it also included the dedication 
of many United States branch buildings 


01:00.110 --> 01:03.378
and the dedication 
of the world headquarters complex, 


01:03.378 --> 01:05.915
it was presented from the Bethel auditorium 


01:05.915 --> 01:08.552
in Warwick, New York.


01:08.552 --> 01:12.089
Brother Geoffrey Jackson 
of the Governing Body was the chairman. 


01:12.088 --> 01:14.490
The monthly program you’re about to see 


01:14.490 --> 01:18.227
consists of the dedication-related aspects 
of the event. 


01:18.227 --> 01:22.165
I’m sure you will enjoy the program.


01:22.165 --> 01:25.033
We’re going to start off 
by asking you a question. 


01:25.033 --> 01:27.770
In fact, 
the Governing Body has directed me 


01:27.770 --> 01:32.775
to ask the English-speaking brothers 
this question: What if? 


01:32.775 --> 01:36.378
What if during Brother Smalley’s prayer, 


01:36.378 --> 01:38.380
he said, 


01:38.380 --> 01:41.150
‘And we pray 
for the vindication of your name?’ 


01:41.150 --> 01:43.318
How would you have reacted? 


01:43.318 --> 01:47.000
‘Oh, no! 
I feel sorry for Gene.’ 


01:49.192 --> 01:51.527
Well, it’s true 
that in English over the years, 


01:51.527 --> 01:54.864
we have tended to be very careful, 
haven’t we, 


01:54.863 --> 01:59.168
about saying 
the sanctification of Jehovah’s name 


01:59.168 --> 02:02.505
and the vindication of his sovereignty? 


02:02.505 --> 02:06.108
But is it necessarily wrong for us to say 


02:06.108 --> 02:09.045
that Jehovah’s name could be vindicated? 


02:09.045 --> 02:13.750
Well, back in 1965, the Awake! magazine 
answered that yes, it would be wrong. 


02:13.750 --> 02:17.253
Then in 1995, The Watchtower made the point


02:17.253 --> 02:22.225
—it reemphasized—
it said no one is questioning Jehovah’s name, 


02:22.225 --> 02:26.228
so there’s no need to vindicate that name. 


02:26.228 --> 02:28.330
But the more we look at this subject, 


02:28.330 --> 02:31.400
the more we see a need 
to adjust our understanding, 


02:31.400 --> 02:33.770
particularly in English.


02:33.770 --> 02:37.607
So let’s think about the words 
associated with this problem. 


02:37.607 --> 02:41.610
First of all, “sanctify”
—what does “sanctify” mean? 


02:41.610 --> 02:45.348
Well, it means “to make holy,” 
or to treat something as holy. 


02:45.348 --> 02:47.350
And it’s very appropriate, isn’t it, 


02:47.350 --> 02:50.720
that we pray 
for the sanctification of Jehovah’s name? 


02:50.720 --> 02:52.822
That’s exactly what Jesus told us to do: 


02:52.822 --> 02:54.824
“Let your name be sanctified.” 


02:54.823 --> 02:55.825
So you can relax. 


02:55.825 --> 02:58.695
There’s no change with regard to that. 


02:58.695 --> 03:01.463
But what about the word “vindicate”? 


03:01.463 --> 03:05.935
Well, “vindicate” 
usually indicates exonerating or proving 


03:05.935 --> 03:08.772
that someone is correct 
in something they’ve done. 


03:08.772 --> 03:10.807
Perhaps they’re being criticized, 


03:10.807 --> 03:14.310
and then they’re proved 
to be true, or correct. 


03:14.310 --> 03:17.213
And what about the word “name”? 


03:17.213 --> 03:22.018
Does it just refer 
to an identification or a label? 


03:22.018 --> 03:25.488
Well, that’s usually not 
the case in the Bible, is it? 


03:25.488 --> 03:29.825
It often times 
refers to the reputation of the person, 


03:29.825 --> 03:33.630
not just their identifying name or label. 


03:33.630 --> 03:37.900
For example, 
at Proverbs 22:1, it tells us: 


03:37.900 --> 03:41.737
“A good name is to be chosen 
rather than great wealth.” 


03:41.737 --> 03:43.774
Now in that case, 


03:43.773 --> 03:47.943
“name” is referring to the reputation 
of the person.


03:47.943 --> 03:50.313
So let’s think for a few minutes. 


03:50.313 --> 03:55.318
What really has Satan criticized 
down through time? 


03:55.318 --> 04:00.155
Well, first of all, 
he has criticized Jehovah’s reputation


04:00.155 --> 04:02.158
—his name. 


04:02.158 --> 04:07.163
And secondly, he has criticized 
the rightfulness of Jehovah’s sovereignty or, 


04:07.163 --> 04:10.633
in other words, his way of ruling. 


04:10.633 --> 04:13.568
So, really, both of these things, 


04:13.568 --> 04:17.373
Jehovah’s reputation and his way of ruling, 


04:17.373 --> 04:19.875
need to be vindicated. 


04:19.875 --> 04:24.613
Satan has tried to besmirch 
the holy name of Jehovah in many ways. 


04:24.613 --> 04:29.618
One way is by painting him 
as a vengeful, harsh God. 


04:29.618 --> 04:32.455
Or in the churches of Christendom, 


04:32.455 --> 04:37.293
believing that he is a God 
that burns people in a fiery hell. 


04:37.293 --> 04:41.430
Or in the Scriptures, 
we see him implying that Jehovah is a liar 


04:41.430 --> 04:45.100
who holds back 
good things from his creatures. 


04:45.100 --> 04:49.905
Well, in that case, we can see 
that Jehovah’s name, or reputation, 


04:49.905 --> 04:54.610
does need to be exonerated or, 
in other words, vindicated. 


04:54.610 --> 04:56.612
So in summary, 


04:56.612 --> 05:00.249
Jehovah’s sovereignty 
certainly needs to be vindicated 


05:00.248 --> 05:02.251
as we’ve always said, 


05:02.252 --> 05:05.389
but also his name as a loving God


05:05.388 --> 05:08.891
—his reputation—
needs to be vindicated. 


05:08.892 --> 05:11.760
So it’s not wrong for us to say 


05:11.760 --> 05:15.598
that these actions 
of vindicating Jehovah’s sovereignty 


05:15.598 --> 05:17.800
and vindicating his name 


05:17.800 --> 05:21.270
lead to the sanctification of his name.


05:21.270 --> 05:24.373
Now at this point, you’re trying to think: 
‘What does that mean?’ 


05:24.373 --> 05:28.110
Simply put, 
it’s not wrong to say 


05:28.110 --> 05:32.082
that we pray 
for the vindication of Jehovah’s name 


05:32.082 --> 05:36.485
because his reputation 
certainly needs to be exonerated. 


05:36.485 --> 05:40.155
And what a privilege 
we have to be a part of that. 


05:40.155 --> 05:44.427
Well, what a way to start 
the annual meeting right off the block


05:44.427 --> 05:46.429
—a new understanding. 


05:46.428 --> 05:50.466
So this is how we’re going to start, 
with the chairman saying a few words. 


05:50.467 --> 05:52.735
What else is on the program? 


05:52.735 --> 05:56.000
Well, we are looking forward 
to seeing what we can enjoy.


05:57.107 --> 06:01.644
Well, when we think of this matter 
of the dedication program, 


06:01.643 --> 06:05.548
I’m sure you 
do appreciate that it’s impossible 


06:05.548 --> 06:10.553
for us to tell every story 
of every experience 


06:10.553 --> 06:15.156
of how our brothers and sisters 
have seen Jehovah’s hand help them, 


06:15.157 --> 06:19.762
either in their personal lives 
or in the actual construction work. 


06:19.762 --> 06:23.699
In just a few moments time, 
we’re going to have an opportunity 


06:23.698 --> 06:28.536
to see a specially prepared video 
that will tell us some of those stories. 


06:28.537 --> 06:32.040
But this video 
is mainly designed to tell us 


06:32.040 --> 06:36.245
about what happened 
with the construction here at Warwick.


06:36.245 --> 06:39.115
But before we start to watch the video, 


06:39.115 --> 06:41.217
the Governing Body asked me 


06:41.217 --> 06:44.787
to express appreciation on their behalf 


06:44.787 --> 06:49.092
for a very special group 
of brothers and sisters. 


06:49.092 --> 06:51.094
Who are we talking about? 


06:51.093 --> 06:54.063
Well, those thousands 
of brothers and sisters 


06:54.063 --> 06:57.366
who were working 
on all the other projects 


06:57.367 --> 07:01.070
that were being either built or renovated 


07:01.070 --> 07:03.773
at the same time as the Warwick project. 


07:03.773 --> 07:05.908
So sometimes we focus on Warwick, 


07:05.908 --> 07:08.076
but all these other brothers and sisters 


07:08.077 --> 07:11.447
were likewise making similar sacrifices, 


07:11.447 --> 07:14.784
and some of those projects were huge.


07:14.783 --> 07:16.785
For example, Wallkill: 


07:16.785 --> 07:20.690
Over 1.1 million square feet (102,193 sq m) 
of facilities 


07:20.690 --> 07:25.293
were either built or renovated 
or remodeled at Wallkill, 


07:25.293 --> 07:29.165
and 302 residence rooms were added. 


07:29.165 --> 07:34.170
This required 25,000 sheets 
of drywall to be hung 


07:34.170 --> 07:38.073
and over 451,000 feet (137,465 m) 


07:38.073 --> 07:41.376
of electrical wire cables to be installed. 


07:41.377 --> 07:46.215
Additionally, new office space 
was made for 240 people. 


07:46.215 --> 07:49.285
Now, when they added up 
how many brothers and sisters 


07:49.285 --> 07:52.688
actually helped 
with just the Wallkill project, 


07:52.688 --> 07:57.593
they came up with a figure 
of over 6,000 different individuals.


07:57.593 --> 07:59.861
Then the brothers, at one stage, 


07:59.862 --> 08:02.097
started a Saturday work program 


08:02.097 --> 08:06.002
that was designed to give 
extra help to the project. 


08:06.002 --> 08:09.505
And the Bethelites, 
who have other assignments 


08:09.505 --> 08:11.507
and who in their spare time 


08:11.507 --> 08:14.344
offered to give 
this extra help on a Saturday, 


08:14.343 --> 08:17.946
numbered 1,544


08:17.947 --> 08:21.450
—and they put in 
over 10,000 hours of work. 


08:21.450 --> 08:24.953
Then we had 937 outside volunteers 


08:24.953 --> 08:28.023
from 20 different states 
here in the United States 


08:28.023 --> 08:31.626
who contributed some 18,000 hours. 


08:31.627 --> 08:36.632
So a lot of work went into renovating 
and building there at Wallkill. 


08:36.632 --> 08:39.269
But what about the quality of the work there? 


08:39.268 --> 08:41.270
Was it any less? 


08:41.270 --> 08:42.305
No. 


08:42.305 --> 08:46.242
In fact, the F Residence 
and the Wallkill Office Building 


08:46.242 --> 08:49.945
received the highest award 
of Four Green Globes 


08:49.945 --> 08:54.183
from the Green Building Initiative 
—that’s the GBI. 


08:54.183 --> 08:58.020
That was back in 2015. 


08:58.020 --> 09:01.890
Now at that time, 
a project manager of GBI said: 


09:01.890 --> 09:04.960
“Of the 23 buildings in the United States 


09:04.960 --> 09:09.798
“that have been certified 
with Four Green Globes since 2006, 


09:09.798 --> 09:12.435
“the Watchtower Wallkill Office Building 


09:12.435 --> 09:17.172
achieved the highest point score 
with 94 percent.” 


09:17.172 --> 09:19.809
Now, of course, since 2015, 


09:19.808 --> 09:22.678
other buildings have also received 


09:22.678 --> 09:25.546
these Four Green Globes. 


09:25.547 --> 09:28.050
But remember, 
also among those buildings 


09:28.050 --> 09:33.455
that have received it 
are all seven buildings here at Warwick.


09:33.455 --> 09:36.692
Well, we could go on and on 
about Jehovah’s blessings 


09:36.692 --> 09:38.995
with regard to the Wallkill project. 


09:38.995 --> 09:40.997
But let’s just take one example: 


09:40.997 --> 09:45.000
the Wallkill chiller project 
that started in December of 2010. 


09:46.702 --> 09:48.770
It was critical, the brothers tell us, 


09:48.770 --> 09:50.773
to get the new chillers operational 


09:50.773 --> 09:54.843
no later than the first week 
of the following July. 


09:54.843 --> 09:57.913
But there was a problem 
because they wanted to make sure 


09:57.913 --> 10:00.650
the presses would continue to operate. 


10:00.650 --> 10:04.987
This is how one of the brothers 
expressed what happened, he said: 


10:04.987 --> 10:07.390
“By mid-June,” 
now remember by July 


10:07.390 --> 10:09.525
they had to have 
the chillers up and running, 


10:09.525 --> 10:13.728
“things started to get critical 
because of the lack of response 


10:13.728 --> 10:17.333
“from the specialists 
from the chiller fabricator. 


10:17.333 --> 10:20.670
“The Purchasing Department called repeatedly 


10:20.670 --> 10:23.072
“but were unable to get a commitment 


10:23.072 --> 10:25.809
from the fabricator to meet our deadlines.” 


10:25.808 --> 10:27.810
So, what did the brothers do? 


10:27.810 --> 10:31.947
Well, they made it a matter 
of fervent and urgent prayer. 


10:31.947 --> 10:33.015
What happened? 


10:33.015 --> 10:34.350
The brother continues: 


10:34.350 --> 10:35.818
“A few days later, 


10:35.818 --> 10:37.886
“I received a phone call telling me 


10:37.887 --> 10:40.155
“that there was a man 
from the chiller fabricator 


10:40.155 --> 10:42.358
“waiting for me in the main lobby. 


10:42.358 --> 10:47.128
“He wanted to quickly see 
our start-up schedule and our installations, 


10:47.128 --> 10:50.498
“and then give us a list 
of things we needed to complete. 


10:50.498 --> 10:53.501
“We explained that everything was ready, 


10:53.502 --> 10:57.239
“and we needed to begin 
the start-up in two weeks. 


10:57.238 --> 10:59.508
“Well, he went for a visit. 


10:59.508 --> 11:03.411
“As he walked through the factory, 
he was amazed. 


11:03.412 --> 11:06.549
“He said that he 
has never seen an installation 


11:06.548 --> 11:08.883
“in all the 20 years 
that he has been doing this 


11:08.883 --> 11:12.488
that was ready to start on the first visit.” 


11:12.488 --> 11:15.891
Then, as he was continuing to be amazed, 


11:15.892 --> 11:17.894
he said to the brother: 


11:17.893 --> 11:20.561
“Let me know who your insulators are. 


11:20.562 --> 11:23.000
I want to hire them.” 


11:24.033 --> 11:26.601
Well, the brother said 
—very wisely— 


11:26.602 --> 11:28.670
that he didn’t tell him until later 


11:28.670 --> 11:31.173
that most of the work was done by sisters, 


11:31.173 --> 11:34.000
many of whom had no experience at all. 


11:35.945 --> 11:38.180
We didn’t tell him that 
because we didn’t want him 


11:38.180 --> 11:40.850
to steal them away to other projects. 


11:40.850 --> 11:42.852
The brother then goes on to say 


11:42.852 --> 11:44.854
that eventually he got 
enough courage to ask him, 


11:44.853 --> 11:49.158
“Well, what caused you 
to actually come to the lobby that day?” 


11:49.158 --> 11:53.195
Well, the man said 
that he’d received an urgent trouble call 


11:53.195 --> 11:56.365
from another customer 
in a nearby town, 


11:56.365 --> 12:00.102
so he decided 
he’d just stop by Watchtower on the way. 


12:00.102 --> 12:01.804
He then said, 


12:01.803 --> 12:05.273
“The trouble call 
turned out to be a false alarm.” 


12:05.273 --> 12:07.810
Well, the chiller started on schedule 


12:07.810 --> 12:10.545
and everything 
was operating according to plan. 


12:10.545 --> 12:12.548
So that’s just one of many. 


12:12.548 --> 12:14.015
Now believe me, 


12:14.015 --> 12:18.853
they sent me reams 
of papers of experiences 


12:18.853 --> 12:22.658
and those that I didn’t use, 
please forgive me.


12:22.658 --> 12:24.660
But over and over again, 


12:24.660 --> 12:29.432
we see the brothers expressing 
how they appreciated the opportunity 


12:29.432 --> 12:32.669
to work on the Wallkill project 
as well as the other projects, 


12:32.668 --> 12:35.838
and how they saw 
Jehovah’s hand blessing them 


12:35.838 --> 12:39.341
—as many of them sold homes, 
simplified their lives, 


12:39.342 --> 12:43.379
or put their lives on hold 
so that they could be here with us. 


12:43.378 --> 12:45.981
So to all those brothers and sisters 


12:45.982 --> 12:49.084
who were working 
on all the peripheral projects, 


12:49.083 --> 12:51.986
we want to say to you: 
“Thank you. 


12:51.987 --> 12:54.000
Thank you 
from the bottom of our hearts.”


13:09.505 --> 13:12.642
But now we have 
an opportunity to watch a video 


13:12.642 --> 13:15.510
that’s going to have 
an interview with the CPC. 


13:15.510 --> 13:17.278
Who are the CPC? 


13:17.278 --> 13:22.000
The Construction Project Committee 
who organized the work here at Warwick.


13:26.355 --> 13:29.725
Isaiah 40:12 gives us a glimpse 


13:29.725 --> 13:33.362
into the power and the breadth 
of Jehovah’s hand. 


13:33.362 --> 13:35.630
Remember, that’s where 
it says that Jehovah holds 


13:35.630 --> 13:37.767
all “the waters 
in the hollow of his hand.” 


13:37.767 --> 13:41.104
He can measure the universe 
“with a span of his hand.” 


13:41.103 --> 13:44.306
And while this is figurative, 
it helps us to appreciate 


13:44.307 --> 13:48.210
what Jehovah can accomplish
to make sure his will takes place. 


13:48.210 --> 13:51.213
Well, when we look 
at the beautiful Warwick project, 


13:51.213 --> 13:56.218
we truly see that Jehovah’s hand 
was involved in what took place there. 


13:56.218 --> 13:58.753
Now, last year, you remember 
at the annual meeting, 


13:58.753 --> 14:00.821
we had the interview 
of the five brothers 


14:00.822 --> 14:03.459
who made up 
the Construction Project Committee. 


14:03.458 --> 14:06.661
And those brothers 
were the ones who oversaw 


14:06.662 --> 14:08.664
and coordinated 
the work of that project, 


14:08.663 --> 14:12.300
and they explained how 
the Warwick project took place. 


14:12.300 --> 14:15.437
Well, this year 
at this special dedication program, 


14:15.437 --> 14:18.240
we are again going to interview 
these dear brothers, 


14:18.240 --> 14:22.010
and this time they’re going 
to tell us their experiences 


14:22.010 --> 14:24.647
and other experiences 
that they had that convince them 


14:24.647 --> 14:27.282
that Jehovah’s hand was in this project.


14:27.282 --> 14:29.785
Well, we’ve got some 
really touching experiences 


14:29.785 --> 14:32.588
to relate about ones who really sacrificed 


14:32.588 --> 14:34.456
in order to volunteer on the project 


14:34.457 --> 14:36.459
and how their families supported them. 


14:36.458 --> 14:38.260
They’re really going to be beautiful.


14:38.260 --> 14:40.930
And we also have some 
good experiences in regards 


14:40.930 --> 14:45.267
to how the work was accomplished 
and seeing Jehovah’s hand in it.


14:45.267 --> 14:47.502
And lastly, we’re going to see 
how Jehovah’s hand 


14:47.502 --> 14:50.139
was really shown even in nonbelievers 


14:50.138 --> 14:53.208
and what they experienced 
and how the work was accomplished.


14:53.208 --> 14:55.376
Let’s get started with the aspect of how 


14:55.377 --> 14:58.214
those who came to work 
on the project saw Jehovah’s hand. 


14:58.213 --> 15:01.016
And I think, Rich, you had 
an overarching comment 


15:01.017 --> 15:03.452
that really convinced you of this.


15:03.452 --> 15:06.189
Despite challenging weather, long commutes, 


15:06.188 --> 15:10.391
difficult living situations, and hard jobs, 


15:10.392 --> 15:12.962
our brothers manifested 
the fruitage of the spirit. 


15:12.962 --> 15:16.232
You could see that at work, 
and you knew Jehovah was working with them 


15:16.232 --> 15:20.902
and motivating their work, and it really made 
the project something very special.


15:20.902 --> 15:23.205
One couple had decided 


15:23.205 --> 15:26.042
that with their circumstances 
and their finances, 


15:26.042 --> 15:28.810
that for a maximum, 
they could come and work 


15:28.810 --> 15:31.313
for three weeks on the project
—which they did. 


15:31.313 --> 15:33.648
But during the third week, 
they were asked 


15:33.648 --> 15:36.451
if they could possibly extend 
to a fourth week. 


15:36.452 --> 15:39.254
So they prayed to Jehovah: 
“Please just give us joy; 


15:39.253 --> 15:41.256
“help us not to have anxiety about this. 


15:41.257 --> 15:44.927
“Even though our finances will be at zero, 


15:44.927 --> 15:47.529
we want to stay the fourth week.” 


15:47.528 --> 15:48.630
They did. 


15:48.630 --> 15:50.165
They went on their way home, 
back to the airport, 


15:50.165 --> 15:52.500
and at the departure gate, 


15:52.500 --> 15:55.037
there was an announcement 
that the flight was overbooked. 


15:55.037 --> 15:57.840
They were looking for volunteers 
to take a later flight, 


15:57.840 --> 16:00.475
and in compensation the airline 


16:00.475 --> 16:03.112
would give a very significant amount of cash. 


16:03.112 --> 16:07.149
Well, they took the cash
—no longer had their finances at zero. 


16:07.148 --> 16:09.785
But that’s not where 
they felt Jehovah’s hand. 


16:09.785 --> 16:13.488
They felt it that last week 
—the joy while they were working 


16:13.488 --> 16:17.458
and not having the anxiety 
over what the final outcome might be.


16:17.458 --> 16:20.795
I’ll never forget the night 
that Troy called our room 


16:20.795 --> 16:25.533
and said that one of our volunteers 
that was going to be arriving— 


16:25.533 --> 16:29.471
They were fixing a tire alongside 
the road back at their home, 


16:29.472 --> 16:34.109
and the brother’s young wife 
was holding the flashlight. 


16:34.108 --> 16:37.078
A car veered off the road, hit her, 
and killed her right in front of him.


16:37.078 --> 16:40.248
Yeah, he’d already been invited 
and already scheduled to come. 


16:40.248 --> 16:43.151
But when this happened, 
we didn’t expect him to come, 


16:43.152 --> 16:46.589
and we reassured him that it’s OK 
to stay back and handle matters. 


16:46.588 --> 16:48.090
But he was determined to come. 


16:48.090 --> 16:51.627
What was amazing was to see how 
Jehovah helped him during that time. 


16:51.627 --> 16:54.730
His overseers that were assigned 
to care for him 


16:54.730 --> 16:57.332
and the department he worked with, 
they rallied to him. 


16:57.332 --> 17:00.469
And in the end, he says he felt 
that this experience 


17:00.468 --> 17:04.740
helped him to recover 
emotionally, spiritually, 


17:04.740 --> 17:06.842
and he saw Jehovah’s blessings in it. 


17:06.842 --> 17:11.000
And it gave him pure evidence 
that Jehovah’s promises will come true.


17:13.715 --> 17:17.585
A brother came for a week, 
but his wife was back home 


17:17.585 --> 17:19.788
with very serious health problems. 


17:19.788 --> 17:21.990
The wife told her husband: 


17:21.990 --> 17:23.725
“You must go. 


17:23.725 --> 17:25.727
“You must go. 


17:25.727 --> 17:29.230
This is the way I can make 
a sacrifice to the project.” 


17:29.230 --> 17:33.635
So seeing Jehovah’s hand on sisters like that 


17:33.635 --> 17:36.272
and their self-sacrificing spirit, 


17:36.272 --> 17:40.942
it made us feel like those sisters 
were right there working on the project.


17:40.942 --> 17:43.579
As we got into the project, 
as it became evident 


17:43.578 --> 17:45.813
that this project 
really was only going to get done 


17:45.813 --> 17:47.816
as a result of Jehovah’s spirit, 


17:47.817 --> 17:51.787
we saw our brothers transform themselves. 


17:51.787 --> 17:56.725
They recognized that we were, 
first and foremost, spiritual men. 


17:56.725 --> 17:58.560
We needed Jehovah’s blessing. 


17:58.560 --> 18:00.895
So before a meeting started, 


18:00.895 --> 18:03.398
the brothers would get together 
and say a prayer. 


18:03.398 --> 18:04.966
It was clear to everyone 


18:04.967 --> 18:07.502
that it was only going to be 
as a result of Jehovah’s spirit 


18:07.502 --> 18:09.672
that this project 
was going to get done.


18:09.672 --> 18:12.809
These overseers 
quickly became known, 


18:12.808 --> 18:16.845
not for their trade skills, 
but for being shepherds. 


18:16.845 --> 18:20.648
They looked out for the brothers and sisters; 
they cared about them. 


18:20.648 --> 18:23.651
So as a committee, we assigned 
shepherding calls to ourselves


18:23.652 --> 18:25.654
—three to four a month—


18:25.653 --> 18:29.156
and along with other shepherding 
within our departments. 


18:29.157 --> 18:31.360
But you would see these 
dear brothers and sisters 


18:31.360 --> 18:33.695
come in at the end of the day 


18:33.695 --> 18:38.433
for a shepherding call 
—dirt or grease from head to toe, cold, 


18:38.433 --> 18:41.136
gloves on, ear warmers, 


18:41.137 --> 18:43.472
huge smiles. 


18:43.472 --> 18:46.742
You could just feel 
that Jehovah was just lifting us up 


18:46.742 --> 18:48.744
and moving us along for another day. 


18:48.743 --> 18:49.978
It was quite an experience.


18:49.978 --> 18:54.148
It was as if Jehovah was telling us, 
‘Spirituality is more important


18:54.148 --> 18:57.051
—and each other—
than accomplishing the work.’ 


18:57.052 --> 19:00.689
And that really helped us to see 
where our priorities should be.


19:00.688 --> 19:03.025
We found that as long as we 
looked out for the friends


19:03.025 --> 19:05.827
—spiritually and emotionally—
as best we could, 


19:05.827 --> 19:09.064
they did far and above anything 
we could have ever hoped for. 


19:09.063 --> 19:11.098
It really was a wonderful example 


19:11.098 --> 19:13.635
—how they responded 
to a spiritual atmosphere. 


19:13.635 --> 19:15.903
Troy, 
how about the local brothers and sisters? 


19:15.903 --> 19:17.973
They had a good share too.


19:17.973 --> 19:20.475
Yeah, the local brothers and sisters 
in the congregations 


19:20.475 --> 19:23.178
surrounding the project 
were tremendous.


19:23.178 --> 19:24.980
Quite a few would come 
early in the morning 


19:24.980 --> 19:28.850
to help guide the buses 
to their parking spots, 


19:28.850 --> 19:32.087
to provide safe walkways, 
to direct traffic and parking. 


19:32.087 --> 19:36.192
And they would get up very early
—freezing cold temperatures. 


19:36.192 --> 19:39.027
They would work, have breakfast, 
and then they would have to go off 


19:39.027 --> 19:42.097
to their secular work 
and take care of their daily lives. 


19:42.097 --> 19:44.900
It was really a good example 
of self-sacrifice. 


19:44.900 --> 19:48.237
Another thing that they did, 
which was just outstanding, 


19:48.237 --> 19:51.840
is that we had up to 700 trips 


19:51.840 --> 19:54.142
to the airport on a given weekend


19:54.142 --> 19:56.679
—volunteers coming, volunteers going. 


19:56.678 --> 19:59.981
And it was constant for years at a time, 


19:59.982 --> 20:03.819
and yet most of those airport runs were done


20:03.818 --> 20:06.888
by our local friends, 
even using their own vehicles.


20:06.888 --> 20:09.123
Now, you brothers 
poured yourselves out on the project. 


20:09.123 --> 20:11.626
You personally saw 
Jehovah’s hand 


20:11.627 --> 20:13.795
helping you just when 
you needed it the most. 


20:13.795 --> 20:15.197
Could you share a few of those experiences?


20:15.197 --> 20:18.800
I remember an instance 
where we were meeting 


20:18.800 --> 20:22.837
with a Governing Body member 
on something else. 


20:22.837 --> 20:27.109
And in the conversation, 
it just lent itself to the question, 


20:27.108 --> 20:32.046
‘Just what was it that made him 
or the rest of the Governing Body 


20:32.047 --> 20:36.985
so convinced that this project 
was going to get done on time?’ 


20:36.985 --> 20:39.053
And he explained 


20:39.053 --> 20:41.590
that during the acquisition of the property, 


20:41.590 --> 20:44.558
they had established terms in the acquisition 


20:44.558 --> 20:47.661
that for them was sort of a coal test. 


20:47.662 --> 20:50.332
And Jehovah fulfilled the test 


20:50.332 --> 20:53.935
exactly as they expected. 


20:53.935 --> 20:57.705
And from that point on, 
he mentioned that he himself 


20:57.705 --> 21:01.577
and every one of the members 
of the Governing Body 


21:01.577 --> 21:03.612
were firmly convinced 


21:03.612 --> 21:06.749
that it was Jehovah’s will 
to move from Brooklyn to Warwick. 


21:06.748 --> 21:09.350
I needed to transmit that confidence 


21:09.350 --> 21:11.953
to the brothers on the project as well.


21:11.953 --> 21:15.556
We were getting ready 
to step off the bridge, so to speak, 


21:15.557 --> 21:18.000
on some big decisions that we 
weren’t going to be able to retract; 


21:19.493 --> 21:21.530
big dollars 
that were going to be spent 


21:21.530 --> 21:24.633
for product that we 
weren’t going to be able to send back.


21:24.633 --> 21:27.768
We needed more faith.


21:27.768 --> 21:29.805
I can remember two instances in particular 


21:29.805 --> 21:34.108
where I personally was discouraged, 
and you could kind of see it in our family. 


21:34.108 --> 21:38.946
In both those times, a Governing Body 
member showed up unscheduled 


21:38.947 --> 21:42.184
and visited and made 
personal expressions to us


21:42.183 --> 21:43.651
—expressions to the family—


21:43.652 --> 21:46.355
and it was just what we 
needed to keep us going.


21:46.355 --> 21:48.857
But now, 
let’s change thought a little bit. 


21:48.857 --> 21:51.894
We also talked 
about how you saw Jehovah’s hand 


21:51.893 --> 21:53.361
in how the work was accomplished.


21:53.362 --> 21:57.132
Jehovah caused our brothers to become 


21:57.132 --> 21:59.769
not only good tradesmen 


21:59.768 --> 22:02.470
but world-class, expert tradesmen.


22:02.470 --> 22:05.773
It was very common to see them 
take off their hard hats 


22:05.773 --> 22:07.775
and say a group prayer. 


22:07.775 --> 22:10.078
They realized it was a part of their worship 


22:10.078 --> 22:12.246
and it facilitated Jehovah’s hand 


22:12.247 --> 22:14.582
to be expressed through their work as well.


22:14.582 --> 22:16.250
Didn’t you notice, Rick, 


22:16.250 --> 22:18.587
they felt a real need to have 


22:18.587 --> 22:20.889
Jehovah’s spirit to be able to do 
what they needed to do. 


22:20.888 --> 22:24.258
So they would look for an opportunity to pray 


22:24.258 --> 22:27.161
before they tried to accomplish something.


22:27.162 --> 22:29.164
That feeling that they really cared 


22:29.163 --> 22:32.266
and that it was part of their 
worship was even reflected 


22:32.267 --> 22:36.472
in the prayerful attitude 
with which they went about the work.


22:36.472 --> 22:39.975
We would often inform 
the family of a difficult challenge 


22:39.975 --> 22:43.178
or problem that we were facing, 
either as a committee or as a project. 


22:43.178 --> 22:45.080
We would ask them to pray about it. 


22:45.080 --> 22:49.117
And they would come back and tell us, 
“I’ve been praying about this.” 


22:49.117 --> 22:53.189
And then we would hear that their families 
back home were praying about it. 


22:53.188 --> 22:57.225
And we would regularly get cards and letters 


22:57.225 --> 23:00.362
from the field, family worship projects


23:00.362 --> 23:02.764
—the kids would draw pictures 
and send them to us. 


23:02.763 --> 23:06.266
And they put care packages 
—hundreds of them—together. 


23:06.267 --> 23:09.772
We even got cards and letters 
from all over the world


23:09.772 --> 23:12.240
—Japan, Australia, and Europe. 


23:12.240 --> 23:16.210
One sister from Europe sent 
about 65 pounds (30 kg) 


23:16.210 --> 23:18.913
of Swiss chocolate 
for the family to enjoy.


23:18.913 --> 23:22.450
And Rick, do you remember 
our infamous Friday afternoon 


23:22.450 --> 23:25.487
design, coordination, 
and construction meeting? 


23:25.487 --> 23:28.190
Every time after prayer, 
we’d start the same way: 


23:28.190 --> 23:32.527
“We don’t have what we need, brothers, 
to work next week. 


23:32.527 --> 23:36.130
We don’t have sufficient enough drawings.” 


23:36.130 --> 23:39.633
Rick would be there working; 
he’d be back and forth 


23:39.633 --> 23:42.603
e-mailing with other ones; 
he’d be getting stuff sent in. 


23:42.603 --> 23:45.906
We would conclude that meeting 
at 5:00 p.m. on a Friday 


23:45.907 --> 23:48.844
every time with: 
“You know what? 


23:48.843 --> 23:51.111
We have enough 
to work until next Friday.” 


23:51.112 --> 23:53.080
And there, poor Rick, 
we’d go again 


23:53.080 --> 23:55.417
the following Friday, 
and we’d start back up again. 


23:55.417 --> 23:59.720
But Jehovah would give us 
what we needed as if he was telling us: 


23:59.720 --> 24:01.723
‘Don’t worry. 
I’ve got this. 


24:01.723 --> 24:04.591
I’ve got it under control. 
Just keep working.’


24:04.592 --> 24:07.629
You also mentioned 
some comments regarding the use 


24:07.628 --> 24:10.431
of the construction groups 
and how that came about. 


24:10.432 --> 24:13.902
We had the most qualified people 


24:13.902 --> 24:17.805
you could ever find there 
—ready to go to work. 


24:17.805 --> 24:19.808
We simply didn’t have enough of them. 


24:19.808 --> 24:21.476
It was a matter of numbers. 


24:21.477 --> 24:26.482
And so the committee charged a couple of us 


24:26.482 --> 24:29.550
to look in and see what we could do 


24:29.550 --> 24:32.853
to mobilize the nation in an organized way. 


24:32.853 --> 24:35.056
All we had was a Saturday afternoon. 


24:35.057 --> 24:38.327
And I thought, ‘This isn’t enough time; 
you can’t organize this effort.’ 


24:38.327 --> 24:40.529
We sat down at 1:30 p.m. 


24:40.528 --> 24:42.530
By 3:00 p.m., 


24:42.530 --> 24:46.133
what would become known 
as the Warwick Construction Group effort


24:46.133 --> 24:48.135
—Jehovah built it! 


24:48.135 --> 24:51.807
He laid it out in front of us 
how each building would be cared for. 


24:51.807 --> 24:53.809
Yeah, did we adjust a few things 
as we went along? 


24:53.808 --> 24:56.410
Absolutely! 
But that was the framework.


24:56.410 --> 24:58.980
We divided the country up 
into 11 different areas. 


24:58.980 --> 25:01.950
We appointed three brothers in each area 
that would help to identify 


25:01.950 --> 25:04.953
the volunteers and bring them 
—reach out to the volunteers, 


25:04.953 --> 25:06.988
tell them we need them, 
explain the work ahead of time.


25:06.988 --> 25:09.590
And it really was an amazing arrangement. 


25:09.590 --> 25:14.162
Of the 27,000 volunteers that we had on-site, 


25:14.162 --> 25:17.099
21,000 were organized and sent to Warwick 


25:17.098 --> 25:19.500
by these 11 construction groups. 


25:19.500 --> 25:22.637
So they would do any initial training 


25:22.637 --> 25:24.639
that they needed to do and get organized 


25:24.638 --> 25:27.775
so that they could come to Warwick 
and hit the ground running.


25:27.775 --> 25:31.747
Do you remember when we had 
the challenge with pipe insulation? 


25:31.747 --> 25:35.417
How many miles of pipes do we have?


25:35.417 --> 25:38.387
Hundreds of miles of pipes to insulate. 


25:38.387 --> 25:42.324
That was a trade that really didn’t exist 
among the brotherhood in the United States


25:42.323 --> 25:45.293
—at least not nearly 
the number we would need. 


25:45.293 --> 25:47.861
And so our construction group brothers said: 


25:47.862 --> 25:50.165
“Well, how hard can it be? 


25:50.165 --> 25:52.900
We’ll put on training programs.” 


25:52.900 --> 25:56.437
And so one or two, I think, came to Bethel; 
saw how it was done. 


25:56.437 --> 25:59.374
The group started putting on training 
in the field 


25:59.373 --> 26:02.276
at a Kingdom Hall or at a brother’s home. 


26:02.277 --> 26:05.814
And they trained about 2,000 volunteers 


26:05.813 --> 26:08.850
on how to do pipe insulation
—mostly sisters. 


26:08.850 --> 26:11.987
And they did all of that work, 


26:11.987 --> 26:15.157
and they did a really professional job at it.


26:15.157 --> 26:17.925
I think that also speaks 


26:17.925 --> 26:19.928
of the role 
the sisters played on our project. 


26:19.928 --> 26:21.528
The ones that were assigned there. 


26:21.528 --> 26:22.930
The ones in the field that were coming in. 


26:22.930 --> 26:24.532
They played a tremendous role. 


26:24.532 --> 26:28.035
We saw Jehovah’s spirit on them 
in helping us resolve problems,


26:28.035 --> 26:29.637
in accomplishing the work, 
and so forth.


26:29.637 --> 26:32.707
So with our training programs 
and orientation, 


26:32.707 --> 26:35.410
the brothers quickly understood 


26:35.410 --> 26:39.013
that safety and spirituality 
is a personal expression 


26:39.013 --> 26:41.448
between them and Jehovah, first.


26:41.448 --> 26:43.818
Safety is a spiritual value. 


26:43.818 --> 26:46.520
It’s something that we owe 
our brothers and sisters; 


26:46.520 --> 26:50.758
we owe our families; 
we owe to Jehovah, who is the Source of life.


26:50.758 --> 26:53.193
We had many nonbelievers 
involved on this project. 


26:53.193 --> 26:56.130
How did they even get to see 
Jehovah’s hand in this?


26:56.130 --> 27:00.768
We were meeting with different officials 
on a particular aspect of the project, 


27:00.768 --> 27:05.000
and we had a bit of a difference 
of opinion as to what would be needed. 


27:06.040 --> 27:08.543
But we really were not able 


27:08.543 --> 27:11.846
to reach an agreement with the officials. 


27:11.847 --> 27:15.884
At that point, 
we realized that taking the secular, 


27:15.883 --> 27:18.586
technical approach wasn’t going to work. 


27:18.587 --> 27:23.124
We pushed the plans aside, 
said a silent prayer, 


27:23.123 --> 27:25.626
and then just asked the officials: 


27:25.627 --> 27:28.730
“What can we do to address your concerns? 


27:28.730 --> 27:31.298
What would you like to see us do?” 


27:31.298 --> 27:33.468
That changed the tone of the discussion. 


27:33.468 --> 27:36.403
It changed 
from a technical-based discussion 


27:36.403 --> 27:40.041
to “We’re here 
to work together as neighbors, 


27:40.042 --> 27:42.044
to come to a common accord.” 


27:42.043 --> 27:45.313
And we eventually worked out 
a compromise that met their concerns. 


27:45.313 --> 27:46.748
A few weeks later, 


27:46.748 --> 27:49.316
we were back in front of the same officials 


27:49.317 --> 27:51.319
but on a totally different subject. 


27:51.318 --> 27:54.888
But before we could even present 
what we were there to talk about, 


27:54.888 --> 27:57.658
they stopped us 
and they just wanted to commend us 


27:57.658 --> 28:00.228
for how good 
the last meeting we had went. 


28:00.228 --> 28:03.063
And we were looking at each other 
because we didn’t think it went that well. 


28:03.063 --> 28:05.333
But they pointed out how 


28:05.333 --> 28:08.201
they felt that they were dignified 


28:08.202 --> 28:12.007
and they really appreciated 
the way we worked with them. 


28:12.007 --> 28:15.310
And so it became clear 
to us that this project 


28:15.310 --> 28:18.413
wasn’t entirely 
about technical issues, 


28:18.413 --> 28:21.850
but really about manifesting 
Jehovah’s hand 


28:21.850 --> 28:25.000
through the fruitage of the spirit 
as we dealt with the officials.


28:26.453 --> 28:31.458
We had a fuel truck that was 
in a local shop getting repaired. 


28:31.458 --> 28:34.361
And a fuel truck is critical for our project 


28:34.362 --> 28:37.432
because at four o’clock in the morning, 
4:30 a.m., our brothers are out there to fuel 


28:37.432 --> 28:39.967
the equipment so we can get 
the work done that day. 


28:39.967 --> 28:42.470
They called to go pick it up 
and the gentleman told them: 


28:42.470 --> 28:44.705
“Sorry, we’re closed. 
Well, what project are you on?” 


28:44.705 --> 28:46.775
We said, “Well, 
we’re with the Warwick project here 


28:46.775 --> 28:48.410
with Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
with Watchtower.” 


28:48.410 --> 28:50.545
He goes: “Oh, Watchtower. 
Oh, no problem. 


28:50.545 --> 28:53.415
“I’m going to leave the gate open; 
I’m going to show you where the keys are; 


28:53.415 --> 28:56.050
I’ll have it there for you, 
and you can take the vehicle.” 


28:56.050 --> 28:58.185
He said, “I trust you people.”


28:58.185 --> 29:00.655
One of the bus drivers, 
he showed up late one morning, 


29:00.655 --> 29:03.558
and then he explained 
why he was late. 


29:03.558 --> 29:05.793
He had been assigned 
the wrong bus that morning, 


29:05.793 --> 29:08.996
and his dispatcher made him 
come back and switch buses. 


29:08.997 --> 29:10.999
He said: 
“I was so mad at him. 


29:10.998 --> 29:13.300
“I told him: 
‘These people are working for God. 


29:13.300 --> 29:14.735
“‘They’re not getting paid; 


29:14.735 --> 29:17.472
they have to get to work on time; 
they have to do this work.’” 


29:17.472 --> 29:18.907
He then told the friends, he said: 


29:18.907 --> 29:21.509
“I know I’m going to be 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses one day. 


29:21.508 --> 29:24.145
I’m going to serve my God, Jehovah.” 


29:24.145 --> 29:26.480
And then he sat down, 
and he drove the friends to work.


29:26.480 --> 29:27.982
A brother was out in the ministry. 


29:27.982 --> 29:29.484
He knocks on a gentleman’s door. 


29:29.483 --> 29:31.251
The gentleman comes to the door, 
and he starts his presentation, 


29:31.252 --> 29:34.289
and the gentleman interrupts him 
and says, “Have you been to Warwick?” 


29:34.288 --> 29:36.958
And the brother steps back: 
“Well, no. No one’s allowed at Warwick. 


29:36.958 --> 29:38.860
It’s under construction.” 


29:38.860 --> 29:40.262
He goes: 
“No, I’ve been there. 


29:40.262 --> 29:42.830
“I worked there, 
and it was very clean, organized, 


29:42.830 --> 29:45.433
“and the people were 
the friendliest people I have ever seen. 


29:45.433 --> 29:49.770
It was the best experience of my life 
to work on that project.”


29:49.770 --> 29:53.073
One of the jobs 
was to pull in this main feeder, 


29:53.073 --> 29:57.645
this main electrical line into the complex
—very technical piece. 


29:57.645 --> 30:01.282
And so we had that scheduled 
for December 24, 


30:01.282 --> 30:04.385
and there was a little bit of an aversion 
on the part of the contractors 


30:04.385 --> 30:07.188
that wanted to be able to monitor 
when this was going in. 


30:07.188 --> 30:10.925
And we said: “No, I’m sorry, 
this is the date we need to do this. 


30:10.925 --> 30:13.093
We’re on a day-to-day schedule 
that we need to accomplish.” 


30:13.093 --> 30:14.228
“Well, who’s going to do it?” 


30:14.228 --> 30:17.431
“Well, as you know, 
we use women a lot on this site, 


30:17.432 --> 30:18.934
and this is a crew of sisters.” 


30:18.933 --> 30:20.301
“Well, I can’t believe that. 


30:20.302 --> 30:23.337
“That’s a heavy line, 
and that can’t be striking the ground. 


30:23.337 --> 30:24.805
It’s fragile until it gets into the conduit.” 


30:24.805 --> 30:27.375
And he said: 
“Well, I wasn’t working tomorrow. 


30:27.375 --> 30:30.110
I’m going to call my wife, 
and I’m going to come in tomorrow anyway.” 


30:30.110 --> 30:33.147
Sure enough, he came in 
and spent a couple of hours there. 


30:33.147 --> 30:37.885
Our sisters, as usual, did phenomenal work
—pulled the line in, got it done.


30:37.885 --> 30:39.887
Do you remember how long 
it took them to do the work?


30:39.887 --> 30:41.722
Two hours! 
They had it pulled in. 


30:41.722 --> 30:44.559
Two hours, yeah, it was just phenomenal. 


30:44.558 --> 30:46.326
He just shook his head and went home.


30:46.327 --> 30:49.997
We hired the largest contractor 
in that part of New York State 


30:49.997 --> 30:52.500
to perform a significant amount 
of work on-site. 


30:52.500 --> 30:56.337
And toward the end of the project, 
the head of that company told us, he said: 


30:56.337 --> 30:59.040
“When you first came to us and you described 


30:59.040 --> 31:01.342
“what you were going to build 
and the size of it, 


31:01.342 --> 31:05.280
“and then you told us the schedule 
that you were hoping to meet, 


31:05.280 --> 31:07.982
and then you told us you 
were going to do it with volunteers,” 


31:07.982 --> 31:10.150
he said, “we were happy 
to take your money. 


31:10.150 --> 31:13.855
“But when you left, 
we were literally laughing at you. 


31:13.855 --> 31:16.823
“We knew there was 
no way you could ever do 


31:16.823 --> 31:19.193
“this much construction 
in that short of a time


31:19.193 --> 31:22.963
“—let alone with volunteers—
and that this was going to be a disaster. 


31:22.963 --> 31:24.965
We’re not laughing anymore.” 


31:24.965 --> 31:27.635
So they could see Jehovah’s hand 
on that project.


31:27.635 --> 31:31.973
Well, we thank all of you for those very, 
very encouraging experiences. 


31:31.973 --> 31:35.543
It makes us think of Isaiah 59:1 


31:35.543 --> 31:39.646
which reminds us that Jehovah’s hand 
is not too short to accomplish his will, 


31:39.647 --> 31:42.717
and this is truly evident on this project. 


31:42.717 --> 31:45.820
And I know you brothers would, 
as well as all of us, 


31:45.820 --> 31:47.822
like to thank all who had a share in this


31:47.822 --> 31:50.392
—all those who physically 
came here to volunteer, 


31:50.392 --> 31:52.894
the local brothers and sisters 
who supported us, 


31:52.893 --> 31:56.230
all those from home, 
and everybody with their prayers. 


31:56.230 --> 31:58.098
We truly appreciate that. 


31:58.098 --> 32:01.501
And we’d also like to thank you 
five brothers for the sacrifices 


32:01.502 --> 32:04.439
that you and your wives 
made during this project. 


32:04.438 --> 32:06.673
And another evidence for me 


32:06.673 --> 32:09.310
that Jehovah’s hand was in this project is: 


32:09.310 --> 32:11.312
You five brothers are all friends. 


32:11.312 --> 32:14.015
And just interacting with one another 
and being with you, 


32:14.015 --> 32:17.252
you can see that that’s evidence 
of Jehovah’s spirit. 


32:17.252 --> 32:21.789
But, ultimately, our thanks goes 
to Jehovah for what took place, 


32:21.788 --> 32:26.026
because we know he ultimately 
was behind the success of this project. 


32:26.027 --> 32:29.564
And we’re very thankful 
that all of us had a chance to witness 


32:29.563 --> 32:33.000
Jehovah’s hand in action in what took place.


32:39.840 --> 32:43.812
Well, that certainly was 
a beautiful experience, wasn’t it? 


32:43.812 --> 32:46.414
And for those of us that are visiting here, 


32:46.413 --> 32:49.183
if you meet someone 
who worked on the project, 


32:49.183 --> 32:51.218
make sure to ask them, 


32:51.218 --> 32:53.386
“How did you see Jehovah’s hand 


32:53.387 --> 32:55.990
in helping you personally 
and in the project?” 


32:55.990 --> 33:00.000
And you may be surprised at what stories 
you learn by asking that question. 


33:01.328 --> 33:04.298
Well, at this point, what we’re going to do 
is something a little different, 


33:04.298 --> 33:07.168
an interactive exam, or test, 


33:07.168 --> 33:11.805
to see who qualifies 
to remain in the auditorium. 


33:11.805 --> 33:14.575
Now, what we’d like 
you to do is first of all, 


33:14.575 --> 33:16.477
you have to answer the question: 


33:16.477 --> 33:20.114
How many facilities 
are being dedicated today? 


33:20.113 --> 33:23.550
Then list them in alphabetical order. 


33:23.550 --> 33:26.820
Well, you know 
we’re not going to do that to you. 


33:26.820 --> 33:29.890
But that little worry 
that you felt will be allayed 


33:29.890 --> 33:31.992
when you watch the next video 


33:31.992 --> 33:36.000
which tells you about the facilities 
that are going to be dedicated.


33:40.402 --> 33:43.805
To support the Kingdom work, 
expansion has recently 


33:43.805 --> 33:46.173
been underway 
within the United States. 


33:46.173 --> 33:50.143
This involves the construction 
of the new world headquarters 


33:50.143 --> 33:54.015
at Warwick along with 
15 other buildings being dedicated 


33:54.015 --> 33:57.685
at the 2017 annual meeting.


33:57.685 --> 34:00.422
Let’s visit each site 


34:00.422 --> 34:02.624
and see how these buildings


34:02.623 --> 34:05.325
affect us in our Kingdom service 


34:05.325 --> 34:08.000
and ultimately bring praise to Jehovah.


34:09.197 --> 34:13.667
Videos have become 
an important tool in our worship, 


34:13.667 --> 34:16.437
and so the need 
to produce them faster 


34:16.437 --> 34:20.274
and in greater quantity 
has risen dramatically.


34:20.273 --> 34:23.543
Five years ago, 
the department produced 


34:23.543 --> 34:27.000
one feature film each year 
along with a handful of smaller videos. 


34:28.448 --> 34:31.818
During 2016, that number grew 


34:31.818 --> 34:35.000
to more than 350 productions.


34:38.960 --> 34:41.728
The existing facilities in Patterson 


34:41.728 --> 34:44.831
consisted of three smaller studios. 


34:44.832 --> 34:47.302
To produce more content simultaneously, 


34:47.302 --> 34:52.640
a larger production space 
with multiple stages was needed.


34:52.640 --> 34:56.177
In early 2015, on Mount Ebo Road, 


34:56.177 --> 34:59.347
a large building less than five miles away


34:59.347 --> 35:01.415
from Patterson was acquired.


35:01.415 --> 35:04.585
Originally built 
as a pharmaceutical warehouse, 


35:04.585 --> 35:08.422
the building had more than 
70,000 square feet (6,503 sq m) 


35:08.422 --> 35:10.659
of open space.


35:10.658 --> 35:12.860
Work began to convert the warehouse 


35:12.860 --> 35:17.063
into one large soundstage 
and two smaller stages. 


35:17.063 --> 35:21.668
Renovations were completed 
in December 2016.


35:21.668 --> 35:25.371
The request for videos is certainly 
not slowing down; it’s increasing. 


35:25.372 --> 35:29.010
So we have scheduled for 2017 


35:29.010 --> 35:32.980
around 420 videos that will be used 


35:32.980 --> 35:35.683
in various aspects of the organization. 


35:35.683 --> 35:40.020
So we have seen the need 
to have increased personnel 


35:40.020 --> 35:44.625
and increased facilities 
to accommodate all these requests. 


35:44.625 --> 35:47.195
So we can see 
that Jehovah has raised up 


35:47.195 --> 35:51.098
brothers and sisters, 
or “gifts in men” and women, 


35:51.098 --> 35:54.201
that have been able to help produce 
the beautiful music we have 


35:54.202 --> 35:58.005
and the videos that are touching 
minds and hearts.


35:58.005 --> 36:00.708
Just one mile away from Mount Ebo, 


36:00.708 --> 36:02.843
a 12,000-square-foot (1,114 sq m) building 


36:02.843 --> 36:05.880
was purchased and converted 
into a carpentry shop 


36:05.880 --> 36:09.150
for building props and sets.


36:09.150 --> 36:13.387
The Mountain View Apartments 
were also purchased and renovated, 


36:13.387 --> 36:18.525
providing housing 
for 100 Bethel family members.


36:18.525 --> 36:22.630
From the oversight of congregations 
and meeting arrangements 


36:22.630 --> 36:27.100
to territory assignments 
and other aspects of the preaching work, 


36:27.100 --> 36:30.403
Kingdom activities are overseen 
by the Branch Committee 


36:30.403 --> 36:34.000
with direction provided 
by the Service Department.


36:36.910 --> 36:41.948
In the United States branch, 
there was a need for expanded facilities 


36:41.948 --> 36:45.118
to house these departments at Wallkill.


36:45.118 --> 36:48.188
The work for the Wallkill expansion project 


36:48.188 --> 36:52.426
was basically completed 
in November of 2015. 


36:52.427 --> 36:55.597
It involved new construction 
for residence buildings, 


36:55.597 --> 36:59.534
the new F Garage, 
and the new office building. 


36:59.533 --> 37:03.536
So between the new 
and the renovated facilities, 


37:03.537 --> 37:07.107
it was over 
1,118,000 square feet (103,865 sq m).


37:07.107 --> 37:09.710
You have to remember, too, 
that at the same time 


37:09.710 --> 37:12.380
all the departments 
were still running, you know. 


37:12.380 --> 37:15.883
Meanwhile, all these buildings 
were going up around us. 


37:15.883 --> 37:17.985
I’m sure it didn’t appear 
this way to the workers, 


37:17.985 --> 37:20.822
but to us it was like it was 
on a high-speed video 


37:20.822 --> 37:22.790
at the rate that it went up. 


37:22.790 --> 37:25.258
It was incredible!


37:25.258 --> 37:28.295
It wasn’t just their skills 
and expertise that they brought. 


37:28.295 --> 37:31.665
It was their zeal; 
it was their joy; 


37:31.665 --> 37:34.835
it was their positive attitude 
that they were able to maintain


37:34.835 --> 37:36.970
—even despite the heavy workload. 


37:36.970 --> 37:39.507
And that engenders appreciation 


37:39.507 --> 37:43.945
and zeal among all of those 
who’ve come in contact with them.


37:43.945 --> 37:46.247
Many are taking advantage of tools 


37:46.247 --> 37:50.685
such as JW Library and the JW Language app 


37:50.685 --> 37:54.000
to read, study, and teach the Bible.


37:57.458 --> 38:00.628
The increased use of technologies like these 


38:00.628 --> 38:03.163
has created the need 
for more computer engineers 


38:03.163 --> 38:08.000
and other personnel to design, 
develop, and test this software. 


38:09.203 --> 38:12.873
Work space and housing 
for these volunteers is now being provided 


38:12.873 --> 38:17.378
at the Rivercrest apartment complex 
in Fishkill.


38:17.378 --> 38:20.948
Another important concern 
of the United States branch 


38:20.948 --> 38:25.285
involves caring for senior members 
of the Bethel family. 


38:25.285 --> 38:28.188
To meet that need, work was completed 


38:28.188 --> 38:32.025
in 2016 on Congregate North and South.


38:32.025 --> 38:35.730
Congregate living is really home care. 


38:35.730 --> 38:39.400
Home care for the most precious ones 
among our Bethel family.


38:39.400 --> 38:42.370
We’re surrounded by 
many wonderful brothers and sisters 


38:42.370 --> 38:45.572
who are very hard working 
and care so much about us. 


38:45.572 --> 38:48.075
And this has touched my heart.


38:48.075 --> 38:49.810
The blessings are being able to be


38:49.810 --> 38:51.878
with friends that we’ve known for years. 


38:51.878 --> 38:54.481
It’s like a reunion that doesn’t stop. 


38:54.482 --> 38:57.719
Jehovah has really taken good care 
of all of them.


38:57.718 --> 39:01.621
The care that our dear older ones 
receive is outstanding. 


39:01.622 --> 39:04.759
And it’s true that we have people who care. 


39:04.758 --> 39:08.495
But there’s a reason: 
It reflects Jehovah’s view of older ones. 


39:08.495 --> 39:10.497
He says at Isaiah 46:4: 


39:10.497 --> 39:12.834
“Until you grow old . . . 


39:12.833 --> 39:15.401
I will carry you.” 


39:15.402 --> 39:18.572
And that’s how those who have been trained 


39:18.572 --> 39:20.909
by Jehovah treat the older ones. 


39:20.908 --> 39:24.000
So it’s really a loving atmosphere 
that they are in.


39:28.115 --> 39:30.683
To receive and store building materials, 


39:30.683 --> 39:33.686
a 220,000-square-foot (20,438 sq m) 
warehouse


39:33.687 --> 39:38.125
was purchased in 2014 
in Montgomery, New York. 


39:38.125 --> 39:41.062
At the Montgomery Warehouse, 
materials were staged 


39:41.062 --> 39:44.932
and residential bathrooms 
for Warwick were prefabricated


39:44.932 --> 39:47.300
—speeding up construction on-site. 


39:47.300 --> 39:51.038
The warehouse continues to be used 
as a storage facility 


39:51.038 --> 39:54.000
for both the U.S. branch 
and the world headquarters.


39:55.810 --> 39:58.712
In 2014, two hotels were purchased: 


39:58.712 --> 40:02.049
Newburgh Center A and Newburgh Center B. 


40:02.048 --> 40:05.185
Being centrally located 
between all three sites, 


40:05.185 --> 40:08.955
these hotels have been ideal 
for housing temporary workers 


40:08.955 --> 40:12.827
and hosting guests visiting 
the Bethel facilities.


40:12.827 --> 40:15.529
These hotels were a great help 
for the workers. 


40:15.528 --> 40:17.798
They were going to be closer now 
to the project. 


40:17.798 --> 40:21.135
Before, with that long commute 
from Brooklyn on the bus, 


40:21.135 --> 40:23.170
it was tiring by the time they got to work. 


40:23.170 --> 40:26.240
But now they were closer, 
so they could get a little more rest 


40:26.240 --> 40:29.843
in the evenings and the mornings 
and be more productive. 


40:29.843 --> 40:32.000
These workers are lovable. 
You have to love them. 


40:33.013 --> 40:35.015
You think about all the sacrifices. 


40:35.015 --> 40:38.452
They left homes, sold homes, and left jobs, 


40:38.452 --> 40:41.989
businesses, family, friends, their pets. 


40:41.988 --> 40:43.823
You thank them, but they thank you. 


40:43.823 --> 40:46.193
They thank you for the privilege of coming, 


40:46.193 --> 40:48.828
even though they’re the ones 
that made so many sacrifices. 


40:48.828 --> 40:51.000
So they’re an encouragement 
to the rest of us.


40:53.967 --> 40:57.170
The plan to relocate 
the world headquarters to Warwick 


40:57.170 --> 40:59.407
goes back more than eight years 


40:59.407 --> 41:03.277
when we first purchased 
this 253-acre (102 ha) property 


41:03.277 --> 41:06.947
50 miles (80 km) northwest of Brooklyn.


41:06.947 --> 41:09.350
Some of the reasons that Brooklyn 
was so advantageous 


41:09.350 --> 41:11.952
no longer have such a key role for us. 


41:11.952 --> 41:14.555
And then, just the fact of living in a city 


41:14.555 --> 41:17.023
that continues to get bigger and bigger 


41:17.023 --> 41:20.093
created more and more complications 
and more costs. 


41:20.093 --> 41:22.328
But I often think, even so, 


41:22.328 --> 41:25.298
the real reason we moved out of Brooklyn 


41:25.298 --> 41:28.635
is what the Governing Body 
has said from the beginning 


41:28.635 --> 41:32.740
—that they are convinced 
Jehovah’s spirit directed them 


41:32.740 --> 41:36.243
to move out of Brooklyn 
and to come up here to Warwick, New York. 


41:36.243 --> 41:38.245
And we’re looking forward to— 
At some point in time, 


41:38.245 --> 41:40.882
we’re going to look back and we’re going 
to see what all the other reasons are 


41:40.882 --> 41:43.950
why Jehovah directed that to take place.


41:43.950 --> 41:48.155
The Warwick property included
a number of abandoned buildings 


41:48.155 --> 41:51.258
that needed to be demolished and removed. 


41:51.258 --> 41:54.861
Once the site was cleared 
and plans were approved, 


41:54.862 --> 41:58.832
construction began on July 29, 2013, 


41:58.832 --> 42:01.000
and moved at a remarkable pace.


42:02.135 --> 42:05.372
About 4,000 a day were coming to the site. 


42:05.372 --> 42:08.275
Over 27,000 of our brothers 
and sisters worked here. 


42:08.275 --> 42:10.743
Then you had everybody in Bethel 
—from the Governing Body 


42:10.743 --> 42:14.248
all the way down to departments—
everybody was united 


42:14.248 --> 42:16.450
in making this project a success. 


42:16.450 --> 42:18.452
And there were challenges, 


42:18.452 --> 42:21.155
but they would be settled in peace and love 


42:21.155 --> 42:24.692
and all the qualities of Jehovah’s spirit. 


42:24.692 --> 42:26.594
That is a modern-day miracle. 


42:26.593 --> 42:28.961
Especially when you think 
about the world we are living in 


42:28.962 --> 42:31.865
that is so fragmented and the lack of unity. 


42:31.865 --> 42:34.235
And so you look at that, 
and it just makes you so proud 


42:34.235 --> 42:35.970
to be part of this organization.


42:35.970 --> 42:40.140
I remember the first time 
visiting Warwick after the completion. 


42:40.140 --> 42:42.442
I call it a happy/sad moment: 


42:42.442 --> 42:47.214
happy because now the buildings were going 
to be used for the intended purpose 


42:47.213 --> 42:50.416
but sad because you didn’t see 
the high-vis vests anymore. 


42:50.417 --> 42:52.720
It was a beautiful scene 


42:52.720 --> 42:54.755
with all those colorful vests, 
and now you didn’t see them, 


42:54.755 --> 42:55.990
so it was sad. 


42:55.990 --> 42:57.157
You get choked up. 


42:57.157 --> 42:59.327
You realize that behind every vest 


42:59.327 --> 43:01.629
there was a beautiful Kingdom story, 


43:01.628 --> 43:03.000
and you miss them.


43:04.298 --> 43:07.400
The environment here at Warwick 
is just beautiful. 


43:07.400 --> 43:09.470
It’s quiet; it’s refreshing.


43:09.470 --> 43:11.605
And it makes me really appreciate 


43:11.605 --> 43:13.740
Jehovah’s creation around us. 


43:13.740 --> 43:16.000
It’s beautiful to be here, 
and I thank Jehovah for the privilege.


43:17.010 --> 43:20.580
Warwick is a complex of eight buildings 


43:20.580 --> 43:24.885
—more than a million and a half 
square feet (139,354 sq m) of construction. 


43:24.885 --> 43:28.522
Bethel housing is provided 
in four residence buildings 


43:28.522 --> 43:32.225
with 569 rooms along with another residence 


43:32.225 --> 43:36.130
in nearby Sterling Forest 
with another 21 rooms. 


43:36.130 --> 43:40.500
And just a short distance away 
is the Tuxedo facility. 


43:40.500 --> 43:42.637
Computer Department Engineering 


43:42.637 --> 43:45.939
and the Broadcasting studio are located here, 


43:45.938 --> 43:49.543
where the monthly broadcast 
is produced and now made available 


43:49.543 --> 43:52.000
in over 130 languages.


43:53.780 --> 43:55.948
The Office/Services Building 


43:55.948 --> 43:59.000
primarily serves as the hub 
for most world headquarters functions. 


44:01.188 --> 44:04.458
The building also includes three exhibits, 


44:04.458 --> 44:08.361
where visitors can take self-guided tours: 


44:08.362 --> 44:11.299
“The Bible and the Divine Name,” 


44:11.298 --> 44:15.468
which features rare Bibles 
and highlights how God’s name 


44:15.468 --> 44:18.638
has been preserved in the Scriptures; 


44:18.638 --> 44:22.710
the exhibit “A People for Jehovah’s Name,” 


44:22.710 --> 44:25.645
a visual history of Jehovah’s Witnesses; 


44:25.645 --> 44:28.000
and “World Headquarters—Faith in Action,” 


44:29.015 --> 44:31.552
which explains how Witnesses are organized 


44:31.552 --> 44:37.000
to study, teach, and live 
by what we learn in the Bible.


44:39.560 --> 44:42.328
When you travel anywhere 
in the United States branch 


44:42.328 --> 44:44.798
or internationally, for that matter, 


44:44.798 --> 44:47.666
there’s someone who has worked on Warwick. 


44:47.667 --> 44:50.604
And the feeling that you get is 


44:50.603 --> 44:53.240
that Warwick 
is not the world headquarters; 


44:53.240 --> 44:55.342
it’s our world headquarters.


44:55.342 --> 44:58.012
I’ve heard a number say 
that when they go back home, 


44:58.012 --> 44:59.747
they’re never going to be the same. 


44:59.747 --> 45:03.284
Some have simplified, so they’ve moved 
from a big house to an apartment. 


45:03.283 --> 45:06.018
Others have started pioneering, 
so that’s what they’re going to do. 


45:06.018 --> 45:08.688
It’s really been a witness to the Witnesses.


45:08.688 --> 45:11.925
Jehovah looks for opportunities 
to bless his people. 


45:11.925 --> 45:13.527
That makes him happy. 


45:13.527 --> 45:15.129
And now you turn it around, 


45:15.128 --> 45:17.296
and you look at all the work 
that’s gone into this 


45:17.297 --> 45:21.535
—when he sees all those who volunteered 
to come on the project, 


45:21.535 --> 45:24.838
all of our brothers and sisters 
around the world who made donations, 


45:24.838 --> 45:28.875
those who included it in their prayers, 
those who helped others to come— 


45:28.875 --> 45:30.877
how proud that must make Jehovah! 


45:30.877 --> 45:34.749
And he’s just looking to bless them for that. 


45:34.748 --> 45:38.051
I sometimes try to imagine 
the conversations in heaven 


45:38.052 --> 45:41.122
between the angels and the kings in heaven 


45:41.122 --> 45:44.459
and how they’re so proud 
of all these workers down here. 


45:44.458 --> 45:46.960
And no doubt many of them 
were involved in the project. 


45:46.960 --> 45:50.530
We think of the workers here on earth, 
but how about the workers in heaven? 


45:50.530 --> 45:53.067
They may have been involved 
more than a few times 


45:53.067 --> 45:55.802
with safety issues and with legal matters. 


45:55.802 --> 45:59.474
So Jehovah was proud of everyone
—his universal family—


45:59.473 --> 46:02.000
both in heaven and on earth 
with these projects. 


46:03.643 --> 46:06.446
I feel that it’s going 
to build up the spirituality 


46:06.447 --> 46:08.582
of our brothers and sisters as they come. 


46:08.582 --> 46:11.252
And as we know, they’re coming 
from all over the world, 


46:11.252 --> 46:15.255
and that’s only going 
to further advance the work. 


46:15.255 --> 46:19.527
These buildings are beautiful, 
and it’s a beautiful setting. 


46:19.527 --> 46:21.529
That brings praise to Jehovah. 


46:21.528 --> 46:24.531
But what will bring the greatest praise 
is how these buildings, 


46:24.532 --> 46:26.500
these tools, will be used


46:26.500 --> 46:31.205
—to honor his name, 
to bring attention to his Kingdom, 


46:31.205 --> 46:33.640
to spearhead the preaching work. 


46:33.640 --> 46:37.243
What these buildings will help 
the Governing Body accomplish 


46:37.243 --> 46:40.000
will bring the greatest praise to Jehovah.


46:48.022 --> 46:50.924
So now we will be passing out those tests. 


46:50.923 --> 46:52.425
No. 


46:52.425 --> 46:55.695
No, now is the time 
for an interactive part of our program 


46:55.695 --> 47:00.400
where we have an opportunity 
to raise our voices in praise to Jehovah. 


47:00.400 --> 47:02.568
So if you’d like to stand, if you’re able, 


47:02.568 --> 47:06.840
we’re going to sing 
our new dedication song at this time. 


47:06.840 --> 47:08.875
And remember that’s entitled 


47:08.875 --> 47:12.000
“A Place That Will Bring You Praise.”


50:22.935 --> 50:25.538
What a beautiful song 
—sung beautifully. 


50:25.538 --> 50:27.740
If you’d like to take your seats, 


50:27.740 --> 50:29.810
we’ve now arrived at the time


50:29.810 --> 50:33.313
for a highlight of our program
—the dedication talk.


50:33.313 --> 50:37.383
And this is going to be given to us 
by the longest-serving member 


50:37.383 --> 50:40.453
of the current Governing Body, 
Brother Gerrit Lösch. 


50:40.453 --> 50:46.000
And the title of his talk is 
“Expansion That Glorifies Jehovah.”


50:50.297 --> 50:54.769
Modern-day worship of Jehovah 
began in a small way. 


50:54.768 --> 50:57.703
It calls to mind the scripture that says, 


50:57.703 --> 51:00.606
according to Zechariah 4:10: 


51:00.607 --> 51:04.745
“Who has despised 
the day of small beginnings?” 


51:04.745 --> 51:07.747
What is the context of the scripture? 


51:07.747 --> 51:11.519
In the year 537 before our Common Era, 


51:11.518 --> 51:16.055
Jehovah moved Persian King Cyrus
—who had conquered Babylon—


51:16.055 --> 51:21.060
to release the Israelites 
that were held captive there for 70 years, 


51:21.060 --> 51:25.565
opening the way for them 
to return to Jerusalem and Judah. 


51:25.565 --> 51:27.800
They were to restore true worship 


51:27.800 --> 51:32.472
and rebuild the temple 
that Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed. 


51:32.472 --> 51:36.577
How many exiles returned 
to Jerusalem from Babylon 


51:36.577 --> 51:39.745
in 537 B.C.E.? 


51:39.745 --> 51:44.283
According to Ezra 2:64, 
about 50,000. 


51:44.283 --> 51:49.288
The footnote in the sixth edition 
of Isaac Leeser’s translation of the Bible 


51:49.288 --> 51:53.626
suggests that including women and children, 


51:53.627 --> 51:57.000
the number amounted to about 200,000. 


51:58.732 --> 52:01.902
In the seventh month of the year 537 B.C.E., 


52:01.902 --> 52:03.937
the altar was set up. 


52:03.937 --> 52:06.405
And in the following year, 536 B.C.E., 


52:06.405 --> 52:09.308
the foundation of the new temple was laid. 


52:09.308 --> 52:11.343
But after laying the foundation, 


52:11.343 --> 52:15.848
they neglected to rebuild 
the temple on that foundation. 


52:15.848 --> 52:20.853
Enemies round about also 
discouraged them from doing so. 


52:20.853 --> 52:24.490
The enemies succeeded 
to place a ban on the work 


52:24.490 --> 52:26.527
about 15 years later 


52:26.527 --> 52:31.000
in 522 before our Common Era.


52:32.065 --> 52:34.633
Two years after that, in 520 B.C.E.


52:34.633 --> 52:37.970
—stirred up by the prophets 
Haggai and Zechariah—


52:37.970 --> 52:40.673
Governor Zerubbabel 
and Joshua the high priest 


52:40.673 --> 52:45.678
courageously resumed the construction 
of the temple despite the ban. 


52:45.678 --> 52:47.680
Jehovah proclaimed that: 


52:47.680 --> 52:51.685
“The hands of Zerubbabel 
have laid the foundation of this house, 


52:51.685 --> 52:54.720
“and his own hands will finish it. 


52:54.720 --> 52:59.292
. . . For who has despised 
the day of small beginnings?”


52:59.292 --> 53:02.529
—Zechariah 4:9, 10. 


53:02.528 --> 53:06.966
The rebuilding of Jehovah’s temple 
at Jerusalem had a modest beginning, 


53:06.967 --> 53:09.569
yes, but it was not to be despised. 


53:09.568 --> 53:12.671
After all, 
it involved true worship


53:12.672 --> 53:16.142
—pure worship of Jehovah. 


53:16.142 --> 53:20.647
The year 520 B.C.E. 
saw this “day of small beginnings,” 


53:20.647 --> 53:22.649
but in 515 B.C.E., 


53:22.648 --> 53:26.151
22 years after the return from Babylon 


53:26.152 --> 53:29.924
and 5 years 
after the construction project was resumed, 


53:29.923 --> 53:32.125
the temple was completed. 


53:32.125 --> 53:35.362
The former exiles held the inauguration, 


53:35.362 --> 53:39.699
or we could say dedication 
of this house with joy 


53:39.698 --> 53:43.236
—Ezra 6:13-16—


53:43.237 --> 53:47.874
and this resulted in Jehovah’s praise. 


53:47.873 --> 53:51.000
He was glorified by the rebuilt temple.


53:52.412 --> 53:55.982
There were also small beginnings 
for the Christian congregation 


53:55.982 --> 54:00.987
at Pentecost 33 of our Common Era. 


54:00.987 --> 54:04.959
And Jesus related this illustration 


54:04.958 --> 54:12.000
at Matthew 13:31, 32: 


54:17.303 --> 54:20.906
“The Kingdom of the heavens 
is like a mustard grain 


54:20.907 --> 54:23.544
“that a man took 
and planted in his field. 


54:23.543 --> 54:26.813
“It is, in fact, 
the tiniest of all the seeds, 


54:26.813 --> 54:28.615
“but when it has grown, 


54:28.615 --> 54:32.618
“it is the largest of the vegetable plants 
and becomes a tree, 


54:32.618 --> 54:37.000
so that the birds of heaven come 
and find lodging among its branches.” 


54:38.625 --> 54:43.228
What’s the meaning 
of Jesus’ illustration of the mustard grain? 


54:43.228 --> 54:46.733
The grain itself represents 
the Kingdom message 


54:46.733 --> 54:49.901
as well as what results 
from the preaching of that message


54:49.902 --> 54:52.205
—the Christian congregation. 


54:52.205 --> 54:56.242
Like the mustard grain 
that is “the tiniest of all the seeds,” 


54:56.242 --> 54:59.412
the Christian congregation 
had small beginnings 


54:59.412 --> 55:01.614
in 33 of our Common Era. 


55:01.613 --> 55:06.351
However, within a few decades, 
the congregation grew rapidly. 


55:06.352 --> 55:09.955
It expanded beyond all expectations. 


55:09.955 --> 55:12.725
Jesus tells us that “the birds of heaven” 


55:12.725 --> 55:16.228
were able to “find lodging 
among its branches.” 


55:16.228 --> 55:21.233
These figurative birds 
picture righthearted individuals 


55:21.233 --> 55:24.070
who find spiritual food, shade, and shelter 


55:24.070 --> 55:27.507
within the Christian congregation.


55:27.507 --> 55:31.644
There were also small beginnings 
in modern times. 


55:31.643 --> 55:34.846
Consider our first headquarters. 


55:34.847 --> 55:38.919
In modern times, 
Bible Students, as we were called, 


55:38.918 --> 55:43.890
had headquarters offices first 
at 101 Fifth Avenue in Pittsburgh, 


55:43.890 --> 55:47.360
and thereafter at 44 Federal Street, 


55:47.360 --> 55:50.497
Allegheny, Pennsylvania. 


55:50.497 --> 55:54.900
By the late 1880’s, 
they built their own structure. 


55:54.900 --> 55:58.605
Completed in 1889 at Arch Street, 


55:58.605 --> 56:02.000
it was known as the Bible House. 


56:03.610 --> 56:05.612
Because of continued expansion, 


56:05.612 --> 56:09.715
headquarters was transferred 
to Brooklyn, New York, 


56:09.715 --> 56:13.953
in the years 1908-1909. 


56:13.953 --> 56:17.390
In 1908, the old “Plymouth Bethel,” 


56:17.390 --> 56:21.427
13-17 Hicks Street, Brooklyn, 
was purchased. 


56:21.427 --> 56:25.030
It belonged 
to the Plymouth Congregational Church. 


56:25.030 --> 56:28.167
Also, 124 Columbia Heights, close by, 


56:28.167 --> 56:30.604
was purchased from the Plymouth Church. 


56:30.603 --> 56:33.205
It soon became the new home 


56:33.205 --> 56:37.610
of our headquarters staff 
of —at that time— 30 persons, 


56:37.610 --> 56:41.413
and they called it Bethel, 
meaning “House of God.” 


56:41.413 --> 56:44.383
“Bethel” was the name the Plymouth Church 


56:44.383 --> 56:48.320
had given to their building on Hicks Street. 


56:48.320 --> 56:50.490
The remodeled Hicks Street building 


56:50.490 --> 56:53.527
then became known 
as the Brooklyn Tabernacle. 


56:53.527 --> 56:56.864
It housed offices and an auditorium. 


56:56.863 --> 56:59.498
On January 31, 1909, 


56:59.498 --> 57:01.633
350 persons were present 


57:01.633 --> 57:05.000
for the dedication 
of the new headquarters. 


57:06.638 --> 57:10.643
But there were also small beginnings 
in a different sense 


57:10.643 --> 57:14.580
in 1919 of our Common Era. 


57:14.580 --> 57:19.418
The statement at Zechariah 4:10 
about “small beginnings” 


57:19.418 --> 57:23.456
applied after the Israelites 
had returned from Babylon.


57:23.457 --> 57:26.025
Was there a parallel in modern times? 


57:26.025 --> 57:27.527
Yes. 


57:27.527 --> 57:31.297
In our century, 
for Jehovah’s anointed Christians, 


57:31.297 --> 57:35.169
it was a “day of small beginnings” in 1919, 


57:35.168 --> 57:37.836
when they were completely freed 


57:37.837 --> 57:40.774
from domination by Babylon the Great 


57:40.773 --> 57:43.776
—the world conglomerate
of false religion—


57:43.777 --> 57:47.247
in order to restore true worship. 


57:47.247 --> 57:49.249
Already in the years before, 


57:49.248 --> 57:54.253
they had progressively cleansed 
themselves from Babylon the Great. 


57:54.253 --> 57:57.390
From 1914 to 1919, 


57:57.390 --> 58:01.260
the brothers lived 
through a number of crises and tests, 


58:01.260 --> 58:04.163
but this came to an end in 1919. 


58:04.163 --> 58:06.165
The Memorial of Christ’s death 


58:06.165 --> 58:09.935
was celebrated on Sunday, April 13, 1919, 


58:09.935 --> 58:14.940
with 17,961 attending in many lands. 


58:14.940 --> 58:18.745
This was, of course, 
a lot less than the number of returnees 


58:18.745 --> 58:21.047
from literal Babylon. 


58:21.047 --> 58:24.217
And of these 18,000, 


58:24.217 --> 58:28.000
about 4,000 also reported field service. 


58:29.188 --> 58:31.456
Many looked down on the brothers. 


58:31.457 --> 58:36.129
Yes, there were again small beginnings, 
but still they were approved by Jehovah, 


58:36.128 --> 58:40.700
and therefore he caused expansion ever since. 


58:40.700 --> 58:44.137
There is expansion in the material sense. 


58:44.137 --> 58:46.639
In order to meet together in worship, 


58:46.638 --> 58:50.610
last year about 1,000 properties 
were purchased 


58:50.610 --> 58:54.713
and new Kingdom Halls 
constructed on them. 


58:54.713 --> 58:57.550
In addition, there were many more 


58:57.550 --> 59:02.000
where major or minor renovations were done. 


59:03.388 --> 59:05.725
Branch offices are being expanded 


59:05.725 --> 59:09.028
and also newly built 
remote translation offices, 


59:09.028 --> 59:13.365
Bible school facilities, and Assembly Halls. 


59:13.365 --> 59:19.705
In the United States, 
we now have 47 active Assembly Halls. 


59:19.705 --> 59:23.008
Also, there is expansion in numbers. 


59:23.008 --> 59:25.345
In the Democratic Republic of Congo, 


59:25.345 --> 59:28.147
there were almost 1.2 million 


59:28.147 --> 59:31.350
who attended the Memorial this year. 


59:31.350 --> 59:34.420
In Mexico, without Central America, 


59:34.420 --> 59:38.992
there were about 2.2 million who attended. 


59:38.992 --> 59:41.727
Worldwide, about 20 million 


59:41.727 --> 59:45.000
attended the Memorial 
of Christ’s death last year. 


59:46.698 --> 59:51.703
Each weekend, 
an average of 5,300 new ones 


59:51.703 --> 59:55.875
are getting baptized 
and becoming our brothers and sisters. 


59:55.875 --> 1:00:00.947
Our worldwide family and brotherhood grows.


1:00:00.947 --> 1:00:05.452
But our numerical expansion in itself 
is not proof that we have the truth. 


1:00:05.452 --> 1:00:09.589
Other religions have many more members 
and some grow quickly. 


1:00:09.588 --> 1:00:13.425
There are about 1.5 billion Muslims 
in the world, 


1:00:13.425 --> 1:00:16.628
second only to the number 
of named Christians. 


1:00:16.628 --> 1:00:19.098
But numbers alone prove nothing. 


1:00:19.098 --> 1:00:21.766
Truth is not measured in numbers. 


1:00:21.767 --> 1:00:25.605
But the combination 
of true teaching, true love, 


1:00:25.605 --> 1:00:28.473
high moral standards, neutrality, 


1:00:28.473 --> 1:00:31.876
carrying and sanctifying God’s holy name


1:00:31.877 --> 1:00:33.880
—together with the increase—


1:00:33.880 --> 1:00:38.000
that does prove beyond a doubt 
that Jehovah has chosen us as his people.


1:00:40.753 --> 1:00:44.356
At Isaiah 60:22, 


1:00:44.357 --> 1:00:48.929
there’s this prophecy that was foretold, 


1:00:48.928 --> 1:00:51.000
and it says: 


1:00:52.598 --> 1:00:55.535
“The little one will become a thousand 


1:00:55.535 --> 1:00:58.370
“and the small one a mighty nation. 


1:00:58.370 --> 1:01:02.942
I myself, Jehovah, 
will speed it up in its own time.” 


1:01:02.942 --> 1:01:05.745
Who is that “mighty nation”? 


1:01:05.745 --> 1:01:10.683
It’s the great crowd 
and the anointed together. 


1:01:10.683 --> 1:01:15.320
They constitute 
a combined “mighty nation,” 


1:01:15.320 --> 1:01:17.557
although they 
are relatively few when compared 


1:01:17.557 --> 1:01:19.859
to the present total world population 


1:01:19.858 --> 1:01:22.928
of more than 7.5 billion, 


1:01:22.928 --> 1:01:25.000
as of March of this year.


1:01:27.133 --> 1:01:31.736
Many who visit us at Warwick, 
Wallkill, or Patterson say, 


1:01:31.737 --> 1:01:34.307
“Oh, you live here like in a paradise.” 


1:01:34.307 --> 1:01:36.642
And those saying this may have in mind 


1:01:36.642 --> 1:01:39.479
the loving fellowship that we enjoy 


1:01:39.478 --> 1:01:42.448
and also the beautiful surroundings. 


1:01:42.448 --> 1:01:46.618
And the fact is that we do live in a paradise


1:01:46.618 --> 1:01:49.688
—a spiritual paradise. 


1:01:49.688 --> 1:01:53.558
But what about you visitors 
and all those who are watching this program 


1:01:53.558 --> 1:01:56.495
by streaming and otherwise? 


1:01:56.495 --> 1:02:01.500
The good news is that you 
are also in the spiritual paradise. 


1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:04.003
All of our worldwide brotherhood 


1:02:04.003 --> 1:02:08.340
live in this spiritual paradise.


1:02:08.340 --> 1:02:11.210
Now, what is the spiritual paradise? 


1:02:11.210 --> 1:02:14.680
It involves our relationship with Jehovah. 


1:02:14.680 --> 1:02:19.418
It involves the spiritual food 
that we enjoy served by the faithful slave. 


1:02:19.418 --> 1:02:22.888
It also involves 
the loving relationship with our brothers 


1:02:22.888 --> 1:02:26.158
in the congregation 
and our worldwide brotherhood. 


1:02:26.158 --> 1:02:29.561
It includes personal blessings from Jehovah 


1:02:29.562 --> 1:02:32.899
that he bestows upon us in everyday life. 


1:02:32.898 --> 1:02:34.900
The spiritual paradise 


1:02:34.900 --> 1:02:39.172
is the spiritually secure, 
prosperous environment 


1:02:39.172 --> 1:02:43.075
or realm of activity 
in which we worship Jehovah. 


1:02:43.075 --> 1:02:45.243
No matter where we live on earth, 


1:02:45.243 --> 1:02:50.148
we are in this paradise 
as long as we actively support 


1:02:50.148 --> 1:02:55.988
the worship of Jehovah 
and endeavor to display the new personality. 


1:02:55.988 --> 1:03:00.225
The spiritual paradise began in a limited way 


1:03:00.225 --> 1:03:04.097
in 33 of our Common Era at Pentecost. 


1:03:04.097 --> 1:03:06.932
It underwent changes during the centuries 


1:03:06.932 --> 1:03:10.135
but was restored in 1919. 


1:03:10.135 --> 1:03:15.140
The spiritual paradise relates 
to the divine approval of the anointed 


1:03:15.140 --> 1:03:19.045
that became evident that year in 1919. 


1:03:19.045 --> 1:03:21.680
In comparison with the first century, 


1:03:21.680 --> 1:03:26.018
the anointed enjoy 
increased spiritual prosperity 


1:03:26.018 --> 1:03:28.586
since that time. 


1:03:28.587 --> 1:03:32.492
And since the 1930’s, 


1:03:32.492 --> 1:03:37.497
those with an earthly hope 
also enter the spiritual paradise. 


1:03:37.497 --> 1:03:41.900
And ultimately, the spiritual paradise 
will be in full existence, 


1:03:41.900 --> 1:03:45.237
in perfection, 
in the new world. 


1:03:45.237 --> 1:03:49.000
Do we appreciate that spiritual paradise?


1:03:59.185 --> 1:04:03.588
Satan will try to destroy 
our spiritual paradise. 


1:04:03.588 --> 1:04:06.891
He thinks he can succeed 
because we seem vulnerable. 


1:04:06.892 --> 1:04:11.630
He may try to disrupt 
the flow of spiritual food 


1:04:11.630 --> 1:04:15.702
or break up our unity 
or stop us from zealously preaching


1:04:15.702 --> 1:04:18.804
—all elements of the spiritual paradise. 


1:04:18.803 --> 1:04:20.806
Through political governments, 


1:04:20.807 --> 1:04:25.712
he will try to efface true worshippers 
and true worship from the earth, 


1:04:25.712 --> 1:04:28.347
but he will not succeed. 


1:04:28.347 --> 1:04:32.084
He will be thrown 
into an abyss for a thousand years, 


1:04:32.083 --> 1:04:35.688
and after that 
he will be crushed out of existence. 


1:04:35.688 --> 1:04:39.491
What about the governments 
that he controls now? 


1:04:39.492 --> 1:04:44.497
They will already be crushed at Armageddon
—forever. 


1:04:44.497 --> 1:04:48.234
The Messianic Kingdom 
will take control of the earth, 


1:04:48.233 --> 1:04:53.171
which eventually will become 
a perfect, literal paradise, 


1:04:53.172 --> 1:04:55.609
and then the spiritual paradise 


1:04:55.608 --> 1:05:00.000
and the physical paradise 
will exist concurrently.


1:05:02.080 --> 1:05:05.517
The expansion 
of the spiritual paradise since 1919 


1:05:05.517 --> 1:05:09.055
was paralleled by material expansion. 


1:05:09.055 --> 1:05:11.957
Let me take you back on history lane. 


1:05:11.957 --> 1:05:16.329
First, let’s talk about our printing efforts. 


1:05:16.328 --> 1:05:21.333
In 1920, we started with a rotary press 
at Myrtle Avenue, New York. 


1:05:21.333 --> 1:05:24.936
In 1922, 
the printery was relocated 


1:05:24.937 --> 1:05:27.607
to 18 Concord Street. 


1:05:27.607 --> 1:05:32.010
From 1927 to 1986, 


1:05:32.010 --> 1:05:34.680
additional printery buildings were bought 


1:05:34.680 --> 1:05:37.000
and erected on Adams Street. 


1:05:38.450 --> 1:05:42.120
But what about residence 
and office expansion? 


1:05:42.120 --> 1:05:44.723
On October 10, 1960, 


1:05:44.723 --> 1:05:48.060
there was the dedication of a new residence 


1:05:48.060 --> 1:05:52.832
and office building at 107 Columbia Heights; 


1:05:52.832 --> 1:05:57.837
630 brothers attended 
in the ground-floor Kingdom Hall. 


1:05:57.837 --> 1:06:01.074
The new building, 
Brother Franz said, 


1:06:01.073 --> 1:06:03.708
reminds us of the psalmist’s words: 


1:06:03.708 --> 1:06:09.000
that everyone in Jehovah’s temple 
would speak his glory. 


1:06:10.482 --> 1:06:15.454
In 1969, 
the 119 Columbia Heights residence was built 


1:06:15.453 --> 1:06:18.223
and dedicated on May 2. 


1:06:18.223 --> 1:06:20.760
In the same year, 
the complex was bought 


1:06:20.760 --> 1:06:23.828
from Squibb Pharmaceuticals, 


1:06:23.828 --> 1:06:28.833
and it served as world headquarters 
until we moved here to Warwick. 


1:06:28.833 --> 1:06:32.671
The address was 25-30 Columbia Heights, 


1:06:32.672 --> 1:06:37.577
and it was dedicated on March 15, 1982. 


1:06:37.577 --> 1:06:41.814
Later, buildings number 48 and 50 


1:06:41.813 --> 1:06:46.218
were also joined to the number 30 building. 


1:06:46.218 --> 1:06:50.790
Close by is the 85 Jay Street lot, 


1:06:50.790 --> 1:06:54.793
a whole city block that was used for parking. 


1:06:54.793 --> 1:06:57.730
Then, September 18, 1995, 


1:06:57.730 --> 1:07:01.267
there was another 
important dedication program. 


1:07:01.267 --> 1:07:04.670
Seventeen residences had been added 


1:07:04.670 --> 1:07:09.208
since the previous dedication 
of the Bethel residence 


1:07:09.208 --> 1:07:12.210
on May 2, 1969. 


1:07:12.210 --> 1:07:14.480
Among the added residences 


1:07:14.480 --> 1:07:18.450
there was the Towers Hotel 
that we bought in 1975, 


1:07:18.450 --> 1:07:22.422
the Bossert Hotel, 
Standish Hotel, Sliver building, 


1:07:22.422 --> 1:07:26.259
the 108 Joralemon Street building, 


1:07:26.258 --> 1:07:29.561
the 30-story Sands Street building, 


1:07:29.562 --> 1:07:32.432
and the 97 Columbia Heights building


1:07:32.432 --> 1:07:37.000
—formerly there was 
the Margaret Hotel on that property. 


1:07:38.237 --> 1:07:40.907
The 360 Furman Street building, 


1:07:40.907 --> 1:07:44.944
which housed our shipping department 
and some other departments, 


1:07:44.943 --> 1:07:49.948
was purchased by us on March 15, 1983, 


1:07:49.948 --> 1:07:52.551
and was totally renovated. 


1:07:52.552 --> 1:07:58.924
It had a million square feet (93,000 sq m) 
of floor space. 


1:07:58.923 --> 1:08:03.995
As of this date, most of our properties
—almost all of them—


1:08:03.995 --> 1:08:06.032
have already been sold, 


1:08:06.032 --> 1:08:08.967
and this more than covered the expenses 


1:08:08.967 --> 1:08:11.000
needed to build headquarters here.


1:08:17.308 --> 1:08:21.180
Well, what about expansion at Wallkill? 


1:08:21.180 --> 1:08:23.448
In 1963, 


1:08:23.448 --> 1:08:26.818
the farm at Wallkill 
was purchased from brothers. 


1:08:26.818 --> 1:08:31.056
It is 75 miles or 120 kilometers 
away from New York City. 


1:08:31.057 --> 1:08:33.225
New residence buildings were completed 


1:08:33.225 --> 1:08:37.730
in 1968, 1971, and 1973. 


1:08:37.730 --> 1:08:40.933
The large printery 
was eventually built in 1973 


1:08:40.933 --> 1:08:44.035
and expanded in 1975. 


1:08:44.035 --> 1:08:47.807
In 2004,
printing in New York was discontinued,


1:08:47.807 --> 1:08:51.477
and all printing 
was consolidated at Wallkill. 


1:08:51.477 --> 1:08:53.779
On May 15, 2005, 


1:08:53.778 --> 1:08:56.315
there was the dedication program 


1:08:56.315 --> 1:09:01.000
for the expanded Wallkill complex 
and facilities. 


1:09:02.453 --> 1:09:06.291
Today, we also dedicate a new residence, 


1:09:06.292 --> 1:09:10.295
a new parking garage, 
a new office building at Wallkill, 


1:09:10.295 --> 1:09:13.432
as well as the Montgomery Warehouse, 


1:09:13.432 --> 1:09:19.372
and two nearby hotels and a diner 
that you saw before in the video. 


1:09:19.372 --> 1:09:23.542
Wallkill has become the national headquarters 


1:09:23.542 --> 1:09:25.879
for the United States branch, 


1:09:25.878 --> 1:09:30.148
and most of the Branch Committee members 
live at Wallkill. 


1:09:30.148 --> 1:09:35.888
Warwick is the worldwide headquarters 
—so that’s the difference. 


1:09:35.888 --> 1:09:39.658
But there was also 
a complex built at Patterson 


1:09:39.658 --> 1:09:43.595
in the mid-1990’s 
with offices, residences, 


1:09:43.595 --> 1:09:46.165
and theocratic schools. 


1:09:46.165 --> 1:09:51.170
And on May 19, 1999, 


1:09:51.170 --> 1:09:54.000
was the dedication program. 


1:09:55.107 --> 1:09:59.912
Recently, 
the Mount Ebo video studios on Route 22, 


1:09:59.912 --> 1:10:04.850
close to Patterson, were added 
and also another building. 


1:10:04.850 --> 1:10:10.000
Now, Patterson is also considered 
as part of world headquarters. 


1:10:11.057 --> 1:10:15.560
Also, the Tuxedo building 
that we bought from the paper company 


1:10:15.560 --> 1:10:18.330
and where our broadcasting studio is now, 


1:10:18.330 --> 1:10:20.933
is part of world headquarters. 


1:10:20.933 --> 1:10:25.000
It’s situated just about 10 minutes 
from here on the same country road.


1:10:26.438 --> 1:10:30.475
Finally, we also dedicate 
the Rivercrest complex 


1:10:30.475 --> 1:10:32.878
that was bought in Fishkill, 


1:10:32.878 --> 1:10:35.000
where several hundred Bethelites live.


1:10:36.315 --> 1:10:38.483
Today, we will focus on the dedication 


1:10:38.483 --> 1:10:43.088
of our beautiful world headquarters complex 
at Warwick. 


1:10:43.088 --> 1:10:45.790
Now, why was it built here? 


1:10:45.790 --> 1:10:49.127
Well, we trust that it was Jehovah 


1:10:49.127 --> 1:10:53.632
that wanted us to build it here. 


1:10:53.632 --> 1:10:55.969
Well, what we learn from ancient times 


1:10:55.968 --> 1:11:00.838
is that according to 2 Kings 23:27, 


1:11:00.838 --> 1:11:05.000
Jehovah was the one who chose 
Jerusalem as a center of worship. 


1:11:06.245 --> 1:11:08.247
And in our time, 


1:11:08.247 --> 1:11:13.219
our world headquarters is a center 
that promotes true worship worldwide, 


1:11:13.218 --> 1:11:17.000
and we believe it was chosen by Jehovah. 


1:11:18.690 --> 1:11:22.628
All the expansion 
that we talked about glorifies Jehovah. 


1:11:22.628 --> 1:11:24.630
The apostle Paul had the right attitude. 


1:11:24.630 --> 1:11:26.898
He wrote at 1 Thessalonians 2:6: 


1:11:26.898 --> 1:11:29.901
“Nor have we been seeking glory from men.” 


1:11:29.902 --> 1:11:34.000
Yes, we seek Jehovah’s glory, 
not our own glory. 


1:11:35.340 --> 1:11:39.878
He is the one that caused and blessed 
the construction of our complexes. 


1:11:39.878 --> 1:11:42.146
I’m sure you agree. 


1:11:42.147 --> 1:11:46.552
Jehovah is the one who blessed 
the rebuilding of the physical temple 


1:11:46.552 --> 1:11:48.854
in the times of Zerubbabel. 


1:11:48.853 --> 1:11:53.325
And Jehovah said back then, 
according to Isaiah 60:7: 


1:11:53.325 --> 1:11:57.000
“I will beautify my glorious house.” 


1:11:58.297 --> 1:12:02.769
Now, the prophecy about the “glorious house” 
in our time refers, 


1:12:02.768 --> 1:12:07.038
not to the literal structures 
of world headquarters, 


1:12:07.038 --> 1:12:11.843
but to our spiritual temple. 


1:12:11.843 --> 1:12:14.880
Many would come, 
according to prophecy, 


1:12:14.880 --> 1:12:18.050
and worship in that spiritual temple. 


1:12:18.050 --> 1:12:23.055
It is a figurative ‘house of prayer 
for all the nations,’ 


1:12:23.055 --> 1:12:27.058
according to Isaiah 56:7.


1:12:27.058 --> 1:12:29.561
Revelation 7:9 prophesies 


1:12:29.562 --> 1:12:33.465
about ‘a great crowd out of all the nations.’ 


1:12:33.465 --> 1:12:36.868
Now, what is their role and position? 


1:12:36.868 --> 1:12:40.838
Well, let’s look at it in the Bible 


1:12:40.838 --> 1:12:45.000
in Revelation chapter 7. 


1:12:51.050 --> 1:12:54.720
And in verse 9, it says: 


1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:58.757
“After this I saw, and look! a great crowd, 


1:12:58.757 --> 1:13:00.892
“which no man was able to number, 


1:13:00.892 --> 1:13:04.430
“out of all nations and tribes 
and peoples and tongues, 


1:13:04.430 --> 1:13:07.933
“standing before the throne 
and before the Lamb, 


1:13:07.933 --> 1:13:09.935
“dressed in white robes; 


1:13:09.935 --> 1:13:12.000
and there were palm branches 
in their hands.” 


1:13:14.272 --> 1:13:18.444
It says that they 
‘stand before the throne of God.’ 


1:13:18.443 --> 1:13:22.013
Does this mean that they go to heaven? 


1:13:22.013 --> 1:13:23.348
No. 


1:13:23.348 --> 1:13:26.818
The earth is called God’s “footstool” 


1:13:26.818 --> 1:13:29.286
—Isaiah 66:1. 


1:13:29.287 --> 1:13:31.290
So even on earth, 


1:13:31.290 --> 1:13:35.860
the great crowd stands 
before the throne of Jehovah. 


1:13:35.860 --> 1:13:37.930
The great crowd consists of Christians 


1:13:37.930 --> 1:13:40.865
with the hope to live forever 
in Paradise on earth. 


1:13:40.865 --> 1:13:43.802
Revelation 7:15 says about them: 


1:13:43.802 --> 1:13:47.139
“They are rendering him 
sacred service day and night.” 


1:13:47.138 --> 1:13:48.440
Where? 


1:13:48.440 --> 1:13:50.575
In front of the temple? 


1:13:50.575 --> 1:13:54.000
No, it says: 
“In his temple.” 


1:13:55.547 --> 1:13:59.350
Where, exactly, 
is the great crowd serving? 


1:13:59.350 --> 1:14:02.087
Yes, all of us, 
no matter what hope we have, 


1:14:02.087 --> 1:14:05.657
serve Jehovah 
in the spiritual temple 


1:14:05.657 --> 1:14:10.695
because we all worship Jehovah 
based on Jesus’ sacrifice.


1:14:10.695 --> 1:14:13.898
So, what is the spiritual temple? 


1:14:13.898 --> 1:14:15.400
True or false? 


1:14:15.400 --> 1:14:18.570
It’s the same as the spiritual paradise. 


1:14:18.570 --> 1:14:20.072
False. 


1:14:20.072 --> 1:14:23.575
Or it refers to anointed Christians. 


1:14:23.575 --> 1:14:25.577
False, again. 


1:14:25.577 --> 1:14:30.049
The temples in Bible times 
constituted a provision 


1:14:30.048 --> 1:14:33.618
or arrangement for worshipping Jehovah. 


1:14:33.618 --> 1:14:38.623
So the spiritual temple 
is also an arrangement of worship 


1:14:38.623 --> 1:14:41.893
based on Jesus’ perfect ransom sacrifice, 


1:14:41.893 --> 1:14:45.496
and all who worship Jehovah 
based on his sacrifice 


1:14:45.497 --> 1:14:48.334
are in the spiritual temple. 


1:14:48.333 --> 1:14:52.736
Now, the spiritual paradise, 
on the other hand, 


1:14:52.737 --> 1:14:55.574
refers to a condition 


1:14:55.573 --> 1:14:58.410
that allows us to serve Jehovah 


1:14:58.410 --> 1:15:02.000
with his approval 
and in peace with our brothers. 


1:15:03.215 --> 1:15:06.585
We can enhance the beauty 
of the spiritual paradise 


1:15:06.585 --> 1:15:09.922
and extend its borders 
by making disciples 


1:15:09.922 --> 1:15:13.925
and also by displaying 
the Christian personality. 


1:15:13.925 --> 1:15:17.762
All in the spiritual paradise 
sing Jehovah’s praise without letup. 


1:15:17.762 --> 1:15:19.965
It is as if they preach day and night. 


1:15:19.965 --> 1:15:22.567
Isaiah 62:6 goes on to say: 


1:15:22.567 --> 1:15:25.870
“Continuously, 
all day long and all night long, 


1:15:25.870 --> 1:15:27.873
“they should not be silent. 


1:15:27.873 --> 1:15:32.000
You who make mention of Jehovah, 
do not rest.” 


1:15:33.312 --> 1:15:36.815
Yes, we are determined not to be silent, 


1:15:36.815 --> 1:15:39.000
not to rest mentioning Jehovah. 


1:15:41.118 --> 1:15:45.823
At chapter 60, verse 6, 
in Isaiah, we read: 


1:15:45.823 --> 1:15:49.126
“They will proclaim the praises of Jehovah.” 


1:15:49.127 --> 1:15:52.965
By preaching the good news 
and by our expressions in Kingdom Halls, 


1:15:52.965 --> 1:15:56.167
we all contribute to Jehovah’s praise. 


1:15:56.167 --> 1:15:59.672
Praising Jehovah is one 
of the primary objectives 


1:15:59.672 --> 1:16:03.209
of our meeting attendance 
and our preaching activity. 


1:16:03.208 --> 1:16:06.176
We understand that we 
do not primarily preach 


1:16:06.177 --> 1:16:08.914
to save people’s lives. 


1:16:08.913 --> 1:16:13.118
Jehovah’s praise is more important 
than the salvation of people. 


1:16:13.118 --> 1:16:14.118
Why? 


1:16:14.118 --> 1:16:17.121
Because Jehovah 
is more important than people. 


1:16:17.122 --> 1:16:21.860
At Hebrews 13:15, it says: 


1:16:21.860 --> 1:16:25.797
“Through him [Christ] 
let us always offer to God 


1:16:25.797 --> 1:16:29.669
“a sacrifice of praise, 


1:16:29.668 --> 1:16:31.736
“that is, the fruit of our lips 


1:16:31.737 --> 1:16:34.000
that make public declaration to his name.”


1:16:36.375 --> 1:16:39.310
Nobody can stop the expansion. 


1:16:39.310 --> 1:16:42.813
Even dictatorial governments, 
including communist governments, 


1:16:42.813 --> 1:16:46.183
could not stop 
the expansion of God’s organization. 


1:16:46.183 --> 1:16:49.120
Hitler could not; Stalin could not; 


1:16:49.120 --> 1:16:53.725
Trujillo in the Dominican Republic could not; 


1:16:53.725 --> 1:16:56.428
Mussolini in Italy could not; 


1:16:56.428 --> 1:16:59.263
Ceausescu of Romania could not; 


1:16:59.263 --> 1:17:01.666
Mao Tse-tung could not; 


1:17:01.667 --> 1:17:05.904
Enver Hoxha, 
dictator of communist Albania, could not. 


1:17:05.903 --> 1:17:10.000
Nobody can because Jehovah is with us. 


1:17:11.275 --> 1:17:13.312
What about the former Soviet Union 


1:17:13.312 --> 1:17:19.785
that included Ukraine, 
Moldova, Belarus, and Russia? 


1:17:19.785 --> 1:17:24.588
In 1991, 
there were less than 50,000 publishers 


1:17:24.588 --> 1:17:26.991
in the former Soviet Union. 


1:17:26.992 --> 1:17:32.597
Now they are approaching 400,000 publishers. 


1:17:32.597 --> 1:17:36.869
Imagine that increase, or expansion. 


1:17:36.868 --> 1:17:41.540
Within the period from 1991 to 1998, 


1:17:41.540 --> 1:17:46.210
a total of 220,492 were baptized 


1:17:46.210 --> 1:17:48.547
in the former Soviet Union. 


1:17:48.547 --> 1:17:52.650
In 1990, 
in Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, 


1:17:52.650 --> 1:17:54.987
there was just one congregation. 


1:17:54.987 --> 1:17:57.000
Now there are about 75. 


1:17:58.957 --> 1:18:03.529
And 1993 saw the largest baptism 
of true Christians ever. 


1:18:03.528 --> 1:18:07.798
It happened also in Kiev, Ukraine, 
at the convention


1:18:07.798 --> 1:18:11.000
—7,402 were baptized. 


1:18:13.003 --> 1:18:15.873
Restrictions cannot stop the work. 


1:18:15.873 --> 1:18:17.875
Jehovah promised: 


1:18:17.875 --> 1:18:20.745
“I will oppose those who oppose you, 


1:18:20.745 --> 1:18:23.815
and I will save your own sons.”


1:18:23.815 --> 1:18:27.000
—Isaiah 49:25.


1:18:28.887 --> 1:18:31.322
Shortly before Armageddon, 
prophecy shows 


1:18:31.322 --> 1:18:34.192
that we will be attacked 
by a coalition of nations 


1:18:34.192 --> 1:18:39.564
or governments directed 
by Satan and the demons. 


1:18:39.563 --> 1:18:41.966
We do not need to fear, though. 


1:18:41.967 --> 1:18:45.670
Jehovah will protect his people 
during the great tribulation, 


1:18:45.670 --> 1:18:49.140
and it stands to reason 
that he will also protect 


1:18:49.140 --> 1:18:51.977
the physical headquarters. 


1:18:51.977 --> 1:18:54.645
At Zechariah 2:8, he says: 


1:18:54.645 --> 1:18:58.000
“Whoever touches you 
touches the pupil of my eye.” 


1:18:59.417 --> 1:19:01.420
Zechariah 2:5: 


1:19:01.420 --> 1:19:04.790
“‘And I will become to her,’ 
declares Jehovah, 


1:19:04.790 --> 1:19:07.692
“‘a wall of fire all around [in protection],


1:19:07.692 --> 1:19:11.000
and I will become the glory in her midst.’”


1:19:13.063 --> 1:19:18.001
Yes, our headquarters 
bring glory to Jehovah. 


1:19:18.002 --> 1:19:21.907
These headquarters facilities 
and related buildings 


1:19:21.907 --> 1:19:24.675
were built to glorify 
and praise Jehovah. 


1:19:24.675 --> 1:19:28.813
Isaiah 43:21 says: 


1:19:28.813 --> 1:19:33.818
“The people whom I formed for myself 
[What for?] 


1:19:33.818 --> 1:19:38.223
so that they might declare my praise.” 


1:19:38.223 --> 1:19:43.228
Isaiah 43:21
—good to remember that text. 


1:19:43.228 --> 1:19:48.065
It shows that the purpose 
why Jehovah has formed us as his people 


1:19:48.065 --> 1:19:52.603
is to glorify and praise him. 


1:19:52.603 --> 1:19:57.408
And so, what is the purpose 
of the Christian congregation in general? 


1:19:57.408 --> 1:20:00.345
Well, again, to bring praise to Jehovah. 


1:20:00.345 --> 1:20:03.448
What’s the purpose of Warwick headquarters? 


1:20:03.448 --> 1:20:05.483
To praise Jehovah. 


1:20:05.483 --> 1:20:07.918
Ephesians 1:12 encourages us 


1:20:07.918 --> 1:20:11.000
to “serve for the praise of his glory.” 


1:20:12.490 --> 1:20:15.860
May this new complex 
and the other buildings 


1:20:15.860 --> 1:20:18.128
that we dedicate today 


1:20:18.128 --> 1:20:22.633
glorify and praise 
our dear heavenly Father, Jehovah. 


1:20:22.633 --> 1:20:26.571
It is now appropriate 
that we say a dedication prayer 


1:20:26.572 --> 1:20:30.942
to dedicate all the buildings 
that have not been dedicated yet. 


1:20:30.942 --> 1:20:32.944
And Brother Leon Weaver, 


1:20:32.943 --> 1:20:35.880
who serves 
on the Branch Committee in the United States, 


1:20:35.880 --> 1:20:39.000
will now represent us in prayer.


1:20:47.058 --> 1:20:49.560
With this prayer and your consent, 


1:20:49.560 --> 1:20:54.000
I now declare all of our new buildings 
as dedicated to Jehovah. 


1:20:55.300 --> 1:20:59.670
And we thank all of you 
for your contributions in various ways 


1:20:59.670 --> 1:21:04.000
—manual labor, 
financial contributions, and prayers. 


1:21:05.643 --> 1:21:10.515
Now, what is the opposite 
of “the day of small beginnings”? 


1:21:10.515 --> 1:21:13.285
The day of a big finish? 


1:21:13.285 --> 1:21:16.755
Well, is the dedication of our headquarters 


1:21:16.755 --> 1:21:19.490
the big finish, or ending? 


1:21:19.490 --> 1:21:21.492
No ending is in sight. 


1:21:21.492 --> 1:21:23.495
It is all relative. 


1:21:23.495 --> 1:21:27.798
In the new world, we might even consider 
the dedication of Warwick 


1:21:27.798 --> 1:21:30.068
as a small beginning 


1:21:30.068 --> 1:21:33.971
in comparison with the huge work 
that will be accomplished 


1:21:33.972 --> 1:21:37.209
in Paradise to teach billions, 


1:21:37.208 --> 1:21:40.000
because billions will be resurrected. 


1:21:41.045 --> 1:21:43.047
Isaiah 11:9 says: 


1:21:43.047 --> 1:21:46.819
“The earth will certainly be filled 
with the knowledge of Jehovah 


1:21:46.818 --> 1:21:49.000
as the waters cover the sea.”


1:21:51.055 --> 1:21:54.625
Yes, we have a glorious God, 


1:21:54.625 --> 1:21:57.362
and Jehovah has a glorious name. 


1:21:57.362 --> 1:21:59.364
We have the glorious good news, 


1:21:59.363 --> 1:22:02.600
and we have a glorious hope for the future. 


1:22:02.600 --> 1:22:06.003
When Solomon inaugurated the temple, 


1:22:06.003 --> 1:22:08.740
the glory of Jehovah filled the house. 


1:22:08.740 --> 1:22:11.308
Today, the spiritual temple 


1:22:11.308 --> 1:22:16.213
in which millions of us find ourselves in 


1:22:16.213 --> 1:22:19.985
is also filled with Jehovah’s glory. 


1:22:19.985 --> 1:22:24.855
At Isaiah 26:12, 


1:22:24.855 --> 1:22:27.000
it says: 


1:22:29.593 --> 1:22:33.665
“O Jehovah, you will grant us peace, 


1:22:33.665 --> 1:22:37.635
“because everything we have done 


1:22:37.635 --> 1:22:41.138
you have accomplished for us.” 


1:22:41.138 --> 1:22:45.976
Yes, we want to give credit 
and praise to Jehovah God. 


1:22:45.977 --> 1:22:48.714
Even opposers come to realize 


1:22:48.713 --> 1:22:52.883
that Jehovah’s blessing 
was involved in the construction, 


1:22:52.883 --> 1:22:56.620
as was the case 
in the days of Nehemiah. 


1:22:56.620 --> 1:22:58.823
Nehemiah 6:16 says: 


1:22:58.823 --> 1:23:03.595
“They realized [the opposers] 
that it was with our God’s help 


1:23:03.595 --> 1:23:07.032
that this work had been done.” 


1:23:07.032 --> 1:23:10.769
And this is in line with 1 Peter 4:11: 


1:23:10.768 --> 1:23:12.803
“So that in all things 


1:23:12.803 --> 1:23:16.373
“God may be glorified 
through Jesus Christ. 


1:23:16.373 --> 1:23:21.111
“The glory and the might 
are his forever and ever. 


1:23:21.112 --> 1:23:22.780
Amen.” 


1:23:22.780 --> 1:23:26.117
Revelation 5:13 agrees with this, saying: 


1:23:26.117 --> 1:23:30.555
“To the One sitting on the throne 
and to the Lamb 


1:23:30.555 --> 1:23:32.757
“be the blessing and the honor 


1:23:32.757 --> 1:23:37.729
and the glory and the might 
forever and ever.” 


1:23:37.728 --> 1:23:40.000
Hallelujah!


1:23:50.875 --> 1:23:52.877
Thank you very much, Brother Lösch, 


1:23:52.877 --> 1:23:55.747
for helping us to focus on the real meaning 


1:23:55.747 --> 1:23:58.000
of the dedication of these facilities.


1:24:00.218 --> 1:24:04.788
The thousands that attended in person 
or were tied in for that event 


1:24:04.788 --> 1:24:07.625
thoroughly enjoyed the dedication program. 


1:24:07.625 --> 1:24:12.297
And now millions more of you 
have been able to enjoy the same experience.


1:24:12.297 --> 1:24:14.299
I know, I know, 


1:24:14.298 --> 1:24:16.666
you can’t wait to see 
the rest of the program. 


1:24:16.667 --> 1:24:19.437
So I’m happy to inform you 
that the spiritual portion 


1:24:19.437 --> 1:24:21.439
of the annual meeting program 


1:24:21.438 --> 1:24:24.508
will be posted later this month 
in two installments 


1:24:24.508 --> 1:24:27.645
in the Video On Demand section of our site. 


1:24:27.645 --> 1:24:31.750
Part 2 will be posted 
on Monday, January 15. 


1:24:31.750 --> 1:24:35.387
Part 3 is to be posted 
on Monday, January 29. 


1:24:35.387 --> 1:24:37.989
So by the end of the month, 
you will have heard talks 


1:24:37.988 --> 1:24:41.091
from five members 
of the Governing Body. 


1:24:41.092 --> 1:24:45.164
We are well-fed spiritually, 
that is for sure.


1:24:45.163 --> 1:24:47.898
Well, that’s all for now. 


1:24:47.898 --> 1:24:51.368
This program 
is from the studio of JW Broadcasting 


1:24:51.368 --> 1:25:02.163
at the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
