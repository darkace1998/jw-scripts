Greetings!

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:05.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting®

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
for January 2025.

00:00:27.298 --> 00:00:29.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
In last month’s broadcast, we shared

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.345 line:10% position:50% align:center
Part 1 of the 2024 annual meeting.

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:36.390 line:10% position:50% align:center
It included uplifting talks and videos.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there is more to share!

00:00:38.851 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy Part 2 of the annual meeting.

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:46.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next part of our program relates

00:00:46.483 --> 00:00:51.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the remarkable response we’ve seen
to Jehovah’s mercy

00:00:51.447 --> 00:00:55.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressed to those who had been
removed from the congregation.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a video entitled
<i>Blessings of Jehovah’s Mercy.</i>

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:02.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy.

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:19.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.101 line:10% position:50% align:center
has prayerfully considered

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:22.770 line:10% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah’s mercy

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.355 line:10% position:50% align:center
could be better reflected

00:01:24.355 --> 00:01:25.898 line:10% position:50% align:center
when dealing with wrongdoers

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:27.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation.

00:01:27.274 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his love, Jehovah wants sinners

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:34.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become reconciled to him
if at all possible.

00:01:34.782 --> 00:01:37.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t want anyone to be destroyed,

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:40.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he appeals to them to repent.

00:01:41.246 --> 00:01:42.414 line:10% position:50% align:center
And we see these pictures,

00:01:42.414 --> 00:01:43.999 line:10% position:50% align:center
you know, these illustrations

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:45.334 line:10% position:50% align:center
(might be a drawing or something),

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.211 line:10% position:50% align:center
that show a shepherd

00:01:47.211 --> 00:01:49.046 line:10% position:50% align:center
going after that one lost sheep.

00:01:49.046 --> 00:01:50.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you think: ‘That’s really nice.

00:01:50.506 --> 00:01:52.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, in concept, oh, that’s good.’

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:55.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not just an academic concept.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:57.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s reality.

00:01:57.346 --> 00:01:59.807 line:10% position:50% align:center
The fact that He loves people in this way,

00:01:59.807 --> 00:02:02.184 line:10% position:50% align:center
even those who’ve been removed

00:02:02.184 --> 00:02:04.103 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the congregation,

00:02:04.103 --> 00:02:08.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
just gives me an opportunity
to reflect that same love that Jehovah has

00:02:08.565 --> 00:02:10.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
and extend that to others as well.

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:14.113 line:10% position:50% align:center
The elders in our circuit

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:16.991 line:10% position:50% align:center
promptly responded to the adjustments.

00:02:16.991 --> 00:02:18.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once they heard the update

00:02:18.826 --> 00:02:20.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we got the printed direction,

00:02:20.828 --> 00:02:23.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers promptly met together.

00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:25.040 line:10% position:50% align:center
With the fellow elders,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.209 line:10% position:50% align:center
we all discussed how we can help

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.294 line:10% position:50% align:center
all these ones in our territory

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:31.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have been removed
from the congregation,

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we visited them.

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were grateful
that they were not forgotten;

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:37.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re still remembered.

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:41.140 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s heartwarming to hear reports

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.725 line:10% position:50% align:center
of how Jehovah has blessed

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:44.518 line:10% position:50% align:center
congregation elders

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:46.520 line:10% position:50% align:center
as they search for those

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have been removed from the congregation.

00:02:49.606 --> 00:02:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in the first four months

00:02:52.568 --> 00:02:56.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the <i>2024 Governing Body Update #2,</i>

00:02:56.822 --> 00:03:01.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the South Africa and Philippines
branch territories combined,

00:03:01.785 --> 00:03:06.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 1,200
have come back to the congregation.

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in the United States branch territory,

00:03:10.044 --> 00:03:15.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 5,000 brothers and sisters
have been welcomed back.

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:18.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Brazil branch territory,

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 5,200 publishers
have been reinstated.

00:03:22.723 --> 00:03:26.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the Central America branch territory,

00:03:26.226 --> 00:03:29.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 5,300 individuals

00:03:29.688 --> 00:03:32.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
have come back to the congregation.

00:03:32.024 --> 00:03:34.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
The numbers are exciting,

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:38.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can’t overlook
that each of these dear ones

00:03:38.113 --> 00:03:40.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
have returned to Jehovah,

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah loves them!

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:46.080 line:10% position:50% align:center
One man came to mind

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.915 line:10% position:50% align:center
because he’s deaf and blind

00:03:47.915 --> 00:03:51.085 line:10% position:50% align:center
and he’d been away from Jehovah for 45 years.

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:52.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prayed with him.

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:55.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
We asked him where he was with things,

00:03:55.005 --> 00:03:57.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he said: “I want to be back.

00:03:57.132 --> 00:03:58.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to be back in the family.”

00:03:58.717 --> 00:04:00.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what he said.

00:04:00.302 --> 00:04:03.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s been studying regularly
and attending the meetings ever since then,

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:05.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was reinstated about a month later.

00:04:05.557 --> 00:04:08.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I tactile signed
that announcement for him that night, I said:

00:04:08.602 --> 00:04:10.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You’re back in the family.

00:04:10.604 --> 00:04:12.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re one of Jehovah’s Witnesses again.”

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:14.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he was just overjoyed at that.

00:04:15.442 --> 00:04:17.653 line:10% position:50% align:center
There is a pioneer sister in our circuit

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:19.530 line:10% position:50% align:center
who was asked to conduct a study

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.989 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a young mom

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s trying to make her way back to Jehovah.

00:04:23.492 --> 00:04:27.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was so excited after the first study.

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:29.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said that first study went so well.

00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:32.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems like everyone in the congregation

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:35.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
is very happy
just to have this arrangement in place.

00:04:35.838 --> 00:04:38.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister told me that it made her so happy

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:42.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see that young mom
who’s studying smiling again.

00:04:42.678 --> 00:04:45.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
She hadn’t seen it in a long time.

00:04:45.097 --> 00:04:47.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one experience that is exciting

00:04:47.516 --> 00:04:51.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that there’s this man
who’s been removed for over 30 years,

00:04:51.186 --> 00:04:54.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he started coming
to the meetings early this year,

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would sit at the back
and not talk to anyone.

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:02.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
But eventually, after this arrangement
had been made available,

00:05:02.948 --> 00:05:05.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we visited him, he was so excited

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he said, “I didn’t know what to do
to come back to the congregation.”

00:05:10.706 --> 00:05:12.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we are visiting him.

00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:15.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he says he felt like a heavy weight

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been lifted off his shoulders.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he has been reinstated.

00:05:19.673 --> 00:05:22.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
A young man
whom I studied the Bible with

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
came into the truth under great difficulty,

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:27.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so we thought of him immediately.

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
And right away, I sent him a message,

00:05:30.851 --> 00:05:33.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I still had
his phone number, and said,

00:05:33.604 --> 00:05:35.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please watch this Governing Body update.”

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:37.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I sent him the link.

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:42.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the next day,
I received a reply to this message,

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was a photo of a letter

00:05:44.364 --> 00:05:47.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he had written
to the congregation’s body of elders,

00:05:47.367 --> 00:05:49.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking to be reinstated.

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:52.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wrote back very excitedly and said,

00:05:52.206 --> 00:05:54.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you actually watched the update?”

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:59.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, “Yes, since yesterday,
I’ve watched this update six times.”

00:06:01.048 --> 00:06:03.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, of course,
our hearts were absolutely overflowing,

00:06:03.842 --> 00:06:06.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was even—

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:10.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were even happier
when about a month later,

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was writing us to say,
“I have finally been reinstated.”

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:18.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister who was asked

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:20.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
 to conduct a study with a person says,

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:23.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s the greatest gift I’ve ever gotten

00:06:23.612 --> 00:06:28.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to study with someone
who has been removed from the congregation.”

00:06:28.492 --> 00:06:33.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
So her experience of crying with her,

00:06:33.413 --> 00:06:37.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
telling her that she liked her bag,

00:06:37.125 --> 00:06:40.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the student saying,
“I bought this bag years ago

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:44.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I could go out in service
when I got ready, when I was reinstated”

00:06:44.883 --> 00:06:49.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed her that she had
been trying for a long time to come back

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:51.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just did not know how.

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:55.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the student now realizes that

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:58.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is Jehovah who is helping her,

00:06:58.438 --> 00:07:01.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she feels grateful
to be helped to come back.

00:07:02.526 --> 00:07:05.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sitting in on that Bible study

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
with someone who was removed
from the congregation

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing the benefit

00:07:10.075 --> 00:07:13.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me to see
the depth of Jehovah’s mercy,

00:07:13.412 --> 00:07:18.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
because this young man
has been removed from the congregation

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
for nine years

00:07:20.043 --> 00:07:23.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has wanted
to come back, he mentioned,

00:07:23.005 --> 00:07:26.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he just didn’t have the strength

00:07:26.216 --> 00:07:28.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make steps to come back.

00:07:28.385 --> 00:07:31.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
One person had been removed
from the congregation

00:07:31.555 --> 00:07:33.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
some 17 years ago,

00:07:33.724 --> 00:07:36.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on his own,

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:39.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was watching JW Broadcasting®.

00:07:40.522 --> 00:07:42.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw the update.

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:45.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, “This is— It’s time to come home.”

00:07:52.492 --> 00:07:54.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so he called the Kingdom Hall,

00:07:54.911 --> 00:07:58.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
he left a voicemail,
and the brothers

00:07:58.457 --> 00:07:59.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
received his message.

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:01.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
They reached right out to him.

00:08:01.877 --> 00:08:04.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Bible study was started,

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:07.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and very happily he too has progressed

00:08:07.924 --> 00:08:10.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
to being reinstated.

00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:13.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his parents were able to fly in

00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:17.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be there at the Kingdom Hall
that night he was reinstated.

00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:20.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
He later said, “This is truly a homecoming.”

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:25.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel like it helps us to see
another side of Jehovah

00:08:25.901 --> 00:08:27.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
as our Father.

00:08:29.279 --> 00:08:32.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you see
how much he loves his children.

00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:37.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he allows us to have a part
in helping them to come back to him.

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we get to reflect his mercy too;
it’s such a privilege.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:47.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 1979, my father was removed
from the congregation

00:08:47.964 --> 00:08:50.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was eight.

00:08:50.592 --> 00:08:52.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can grow up thinking,

00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:55.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘OK, maybe, you know,

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:57.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
my dad will come back.’

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:02.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a decade goes by,
two decades go by, three decades go by.

00:09:02.104 --> 00:09:04.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you don’t want to lose hope,

00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:08.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it does tend to make you think

00:09:08.568 --> 00:09:11.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
that maybe this person
might not ever come back.

00:09:11.488 --> 00:09:13.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
I get a phone call.

00:09:13.407 --> 00:09:16.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a friend of mine
I’ve known for many years.

00:09:16.701 --> 00:09:19.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and another brother
went to go see my dad,

00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:23.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he even accepted a study.

00:09:24.876 --> 00:09:28.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this point, I said, “Wow!”

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “That’s—

00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:35.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s—That’s great,”

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
because most of my childhood

00:09:38.515 --> 00:09:41.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my entire adult life,

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have not known a father
who was serving Jehovah.

00:09:46.523 --> 00:09:51.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should never ever underestimate

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:57.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
the lengths Jehovah will go
to save one sheep,

00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
one sheep.

00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:01.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, yeah, it’s—

00:10:07.502 --> 00:10:09.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, it’s—

00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:16.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you weren’t a believer
in Jehovah’s mercy before—

00:10:16.928 --> 00:10:18.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one will ever be able to say,

00:10:18.847 --> 00:10:20.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
when everything is over
in this system of things,

00:10:20.348 --> 00:10:21.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah didn’t care enough,

00:10:21.892 --> 00:10:25.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
he didn’t make the efforts,
and he didn’t send anybody out.

00:10:25.812 --> 00:10:27.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, you can’t—

00:10:27.314 --> 00:10:28.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
You really can’t say that

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah is making sure

00:10:32.027 --> 00:10:35.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the extra effort was made.

00:10:54.508 --> 00:10:57.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very touching indeed.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it wasn’t just a one-time invitation.

00:11:25.872 --> 00:11:29.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
In imitation of our Father, Jehovah,
the elders continue

00:11:29.709 --> 00:11:32.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to render assistance to those

00:11:32.045 --> 00:11:34.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have been removed from the congregation.

00:11:34.214 --> 00:11:36.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
They continue to reach out to them.

00:11:36.716 --> 00:11:39.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah is more than just a God of mercy.

00:11:39.094 --> 00:11:42.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the connection with his righteousness

00:11:42.264 --> 00:11:44.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his justice?

00:11:44.432 --> 00:11:47.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Kenneth Cook
 will now discuss the theme

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:50.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Help to Tear Down and Build Up.”

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we certainly have learned much
during the past few years

00:11:55.068 --> 00:11:57.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding Jehovah’s mercy, haven’t we?

00:11:57.737 --> 00:12:01.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, even just today we’ve highlighted

00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:05.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we now have
a broader understanding of Jehovah’s mercy

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the great tribulation.

00:12:07.539 --> 00:12:12.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
The May 2024 <i>Watchtower</i>  stated this:

00:12:12.085 --> 00:12:14.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even after the great tribulation starts,

00:12:14.838 --> 00:12:19.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is possible that some who see
the destruction of ‘Babylon the Great’

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:22.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will recall that Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:25.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“had long spoken of this event.

00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Might some who see these events
have a change of heart?”

00:12:29.394 --> 00:12:31.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
(End of quote)

00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:33.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it could be.

00:12:33.064 --> 00:12:36.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if so, we’ll be happy for them, won’t we?

00:12:37.319 --> 00:12:40.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then there’s Jehovah’s mercy
in welcoming repentant ones

00:12:40.989 --> 00:12:43.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
back into the congregation again.

00:12:43.491 --> 00:12:46.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve been highlighting this and properly so.

00:12:46.036 --> 00:12:47.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful thing!

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:51.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
The August 2024 <i>Watchtower</i>  stated:

00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:55.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah does not condone
unrepentant wrongdoing.

00:12:55.754 --> 00:12:59.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, he does not turn his back
on wrongdoers.

00:12:59.382 --> 00:13:01.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He wants them to return.

00:13:01.384 --> 00:13:04.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s feelings
toward repentant wrongdoers

00:13:04.721 --> 00:13:09.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
are expressed at Hosea 14:4.”

00:13:10.727 --> 00:13:12.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he says toward such repentant ones,

00:13:12.937 --> 00:13:15.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
here as quoted in the article:

00:13:15.148 --> 00:13:17.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will heal their unfaithfulness.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:20.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will love them of my own free will,

00:13:20.445 --> 00:13:23.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my anger has turned away.”

00:13:24.366 --> 00:13:27.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article continued:
“What a strong incentive for elders

00:13:27.619 --> 00:13:32.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to respond to any signs of repentance.

00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And what a strong incentive
for those who have left Jehovah

00:13:36.586 --> 00:13:39.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
to return without delay.”

00:13:39.214 --> 00:13:40.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
(End of quote)

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:45.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, throughout the Scriptures,
we see Jehovah’s warm appeal to wrongdoers,

00:13:45.845 --> 00:13:48.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
urging them to repent.

00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:53.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Zechariah 1:3,
we read that Jehovah told his prophet:

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:57.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Say to them, ‘This is what
Jehovah of armies says:

00:13:57.232 --> 00:14:00.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Return to me,” declares Jehovah of armies,

00:14:00.902 --> 00:14:03.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will return to you.”’”

00:14:04.239 --> 00:14:08.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does our increased understanding
of Jehovah’s mercy here

00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:13.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
mean that his righteous and just standards
have somehow been changed?

00:14:15.166 --> 00:14:17.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, in line with our theme,

00:14:17.502 --> 00:14:20.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
what things should we properly tear down

00:14:20.463 --> 00:14:23.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what things
should we desire to build up?

00:14:25.093 --> 00:14:28.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to Ecclesiastes 3:3,

00:14:28.847 --> 00:14:32.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s Scriptural to do both as needed.

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with the opening comment
from verse 1,

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:37.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 3 reads in part:

00:14:37.939 --> 00:14:40.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is an appointed time
for everything, . . .

00:14:40.775 --> 00:14:45.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
a time to tear down and a time to build up.”

00:14:47.115 --> 00:14:49.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, to answer our questions,

00:14:49.617 --> 00:14:53.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s examine Jehovah’s love
of righteousness,

00:14:53.288 --> 00:14:55.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
justice, and mercy.

00:14:56.332 --> 00:15:00.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 33:5, the inspired writer highlights

00:15:00.837 --> 00:15:04.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
“loves righteousness and justice.”

00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:09.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, Jesus’ words recorded
at Matthew 9:13 highlight

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:14.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘Jehovah wants mercy, not sacrifice.’

00:15:15.185 --> 00:15:19.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Jehovah loves
each of these qualities,

00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:24.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does he balance
what he righteously chooses to tear down

00:15:24.027 --> 00:15:27.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
with what he mercifully
chooses to build up?

00:15:28.907 --> 00:15:33.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does so by knowing
how these qualities work together.

00:15:33.328 --> 00:15:35.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some things just go together.

00:15:35.371 --> 00:15:38.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s just make it everyday real life.

00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:42.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate: For some people,
an ice cream sundae

00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:45.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not complete
unless it includes chocolate sauce,

00:15:45.799 --> 00:15:50.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
whipped cream, sprinkles, and what else?

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:52.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cherry on top, right?

00:15:53.556 --> 00:15:56.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
The combination is what defines it.

00:15:57.477 --> 00:16:01.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, far more importantly,
on a spiritual level,

00:16:01.689 --> 00:16:05.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love of righteousness
and our acts of justice

00:16:05.109 --> 00:16:09.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
must include mercy whenever possible.

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:13.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah requires that we uphold
all of his righteous standards.

00:16:14.619 --> 00:16:17.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to answer a question from earlier,

00:16:17.247 --> 00:16:19.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 1:17 tells us

00:16:19.332 --> 00:16:23.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah “does not vary or change.”

00:16:23.253 --> 00:16:25.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
And quoting Jehovah himself,

00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:28.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Malachi 3:6 says:

00:16:28.925 --> 00:16:32.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am Jehovah; I do not change.”

00:16:33.054 --> 00:16:35.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, Jehovah doesn’t change,

00:16:35.139 --> 00:16:38.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his standards
as to what is right and wrong

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
have not changed.

00:16:40.979 --> 00:16:43.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why recent adjustments

00:16:43.064 --> 00:16:47.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our view of God’s mercy are just that

00:16:47.277 --> 00:16:51.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
—adjustments to our view
or understanding.

00:16:52.115 --> 00:16:54.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you been able to adjust?

00:16:54.951 --> 00:16:58.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus too loves righteousness,
justice, and mercy.

00:16:58.538 --> 00:17:01.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like his Father, he does not change.

00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:05.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 13:8 says of Jesus

00:17:05.628 --> 00:17:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he “is the same yesterday
and today, and forever.”

00:17:11.885 --> 00:17:15.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that what Jesus did
while he was on earth

00:17:15.305 --> 00:17:19.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
teaches us about his thinking now, right now.

00:17:20.351 --> 00:17:25.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Jesus displayed intense love
for righteousness and justice

00:17:25.231 --> 00:17:27.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
by driving out the money changers

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:31.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the temple area on two occasions.

00:17:31.404 --> 00:17:34.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
The money changers
were extorting the people,

00:17:34.324 --> 00:17:38.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were turning Jehovah’s house
into a house of commerce,

00:17:38.369 --> 00:17:41.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus hated that.

00:17:41.164 --> 00:17:43.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
He hated it.

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:47.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ zeal for what is right
moved him to act,

00:17:47.837 --> 00:17:51.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in doing so, he also demonstrated

00:17:51.007 --> 00:17:53.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
his merciful concern for the people.

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:58.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Above all, we see in such actions
the love that Jesus has

00:17:58.765 --> 00:18:01.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the pure worship of his Father.

00:18:01.643 --> 00:18:04.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because Jesus doesn’t change,

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:09.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still has the same desire
to drive out what is bad.

00:18:10.777 --> 00:18:14.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the wickedness of this world increases,

00:18:14.072 --> 00:18:19.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that Jehovah and his Son
will always do what is right,

00:18:19.077 --> 00:18:22.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is just, and what is merciful.

00:18:23.081 --> 00:18:26.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Exodus 34:6, 7,

00:18:26.584 --> 00:18:30.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find a summary
of Jehovah’s balanced qualities.

00:18:30.713 --> 00:18:33.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it reads in part:

00:18:33.341 --> 00:18:38.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, Jehovah,
a God merciful and compassionate,

00:18:38.179 --> 00:18:43.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
“slow to anger and abundant
in loyal love and truth,

00:18:43.184 --> 00:18:46.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“showing loyal love to thousands,

00:18:46.187 --> 00:18:50.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pardoning error and transgression and sin,

00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:55.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he will by no means
leave the guilty unpunished.”

00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:58.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, knowing that Jehovah

00:18:58.658 --> 00:19:01.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will by no means
leave the guilty unpunished,”

00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:04.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
what things should we, then,
help to tear down

00:19:04.497 --> 00:19:08.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
or send away from the congregations?

00:19:08.793 --> 00:19:10.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,

00:19:10.795 --> 00:19:15.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that Jehovah is “merciful
and compassionate” as stated there,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:18.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
what things should we, then, help to build up

00:19:18.594 --> 00:19:21.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
and welcome back into the congregation?

00:19:22.932 --> 00:19:27.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll look at an interesting account
in Zechariah chapter 5

00:19:27.186 --> 00:19:30.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as some other accounts
and find some answers.

00:19:30.857 --> 00:19:34.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we do, look for the lessons
that we can apply

00:19:34.444 --> 00:19:39.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our efforts to show
righteousness, justice, and mercy.

00:19:39.449 --> 00:19:41.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, first of all,

00:19:41.659 --> 00:19:46.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
what should we tear down and send out?

00:19:46.372 --> 00:19:50.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
The concept of tearing down
is not difficult to see

00:19:50.585 --> 00:19:53.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we think of it in terms of a building.

00:19:53.629 --> 00:19:57.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some houses are just beyond repair,

00:19:57.175 --> 00:20:00.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for this reason, they must be torn down.

00:20:00.428 --> 00:20:05.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
The house in this illustration
makes that point, doesn’t it?

00:20:05.058 --> 00:20:07.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think you’re going to fix that one.

00:20:08.603 --> 00:20:12.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have that in mind as we consider
what Zechariah saw.

00:20:12.648 --> 00:20:14.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Zechariah was a prophet

00:20:14.817 --> 00:20:19.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was favored with seeing
some amazing God-given visions.

00:20:19.238 --> 00:20:22.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what he said describes real conditions

00:20:22.658 --> 00:20:25.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
that existed in Israel at the time.

00:20:25.870 --> 00:20:28.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Zechariah 5:2,

00:20:28.331 --> 00:20:31.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read that an angel asks Zechariah:

00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:33.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What do you see?”

00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:36.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zechariah replies that he sees

00:20:36.297 --> 00:20:40.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
a very large “flying scroll,” depicted here.

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
The flying scroll is written on both sides

00:20:44.388 --> 00:20:48.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and contains a curse that tears down
the houses of wickedness,

00:20:48.893 --> 00:20:50.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving evil exposed.

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
One side of the scroll
targets those who steal.

00:20:56.192 --> 00:21:01.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
The other side targets those
who lie or who make false oaths.

00:21:01.989 --> 00:21:05.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the house is consumed, or torn down,

00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:08.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
he next sees an ephah container.

00:21:08.037 --> 00:21:11.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
It contains a figurative woman
referred to as “Wickedness,”

00:21:11.415 --> 00:21:14.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is trying to escape.

00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:16.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
She is exposed,

00:21:16.129 --> 00:21:18.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the angel treats her appropriately

00:21:18.673 --> 00:21:21.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
by throwing her back into the container

00:21:21.134 --> 00:21:23.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thrusting a heavy lead weight over it.

00:21:24.971 --> 00:21:29.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
The container with Wickedness
is then removed from the land

00:21:30.977 --> 00:21:34.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
—exposed, restrained, removed.

00:21:34.897 --> 00:21:39.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
The angel’s actions leave no doubt
about how Jehovah views such things.

00:21:39.902 --> 00:21:43.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons can we take away
from the vision?

00:21:44.157 --> 00:21:49.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first we see that Jehovah
does not tolerate wickedness,

00:21:49.162 --> 00:21:52.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as lying and stealing.

00:21:52.165 --> 00:21:54.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find Scriptural examples of this

00:21:54.625 --> 00:21:57.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
in how Jehovah dealt with greedy Achan

00:21:57.503 --> 00:22:01.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what happened
with Ananias and Sapphira.

00:22:01.883 --> 00:22:04.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know those accounts, don’t we?

00:22:04.427 --> 00:22:09.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word lists many things
that Jehovah does not tolerate.

00:22:09.307 --> 00:22:11.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,

00:22:11.309 --> 00:22:16.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 6:16-19

00:22:16.189 --> 00:22:19.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaks of Jehovah’s hatred
for ‘a lying tongue,

00:22:19.901 --> 00:22:23.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘hands that shed innocent blood,

00:22:23.196 --> 00:22:26.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘a heart plotting wicked schemes,

00:22:26.449 --> 00:22:31.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a false witness who lies
with every breath,’ and so forth.

00:22:32.330 --> 00:22:34.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Revelation 21:8

00:22:34.582 --> 00:22:37.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
speaks of everlasting destruction

00:22:37.376 --> 00:22:42.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those who unrepentantly practice
what is immoral.

00:22:43.841 --> 00:22:47.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, next we learn from Zechariah’s vision

00:22:47.094 --> 00:22:51.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah uses his faithful angels
to expose wickedness.

00:22:51.849 --> 00:22:53.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson?

00:22:53.851 --> 00:22:58.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Treat wickedness
like Jehovah and his faithful angels do

00:22:58.022 --> 00:23:01.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
by tearing it down, exposing it,

00:23:01.567 --> 00:23:04.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
and removing it from the congregation

00:23:04.695 --> 00:23:07.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
—expose and remove.

00:23:07.073 --> 00:23:10.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not want
the conduct of unrepentant ones

00:23:10.201 --> 00:23:13.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take up residence in our congregations.

00:23:13.162 --> 00:23:18.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why since sin is still on the earth,

00:23:18.084 --> 00:23:20.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders will continue to remove

00:23:20.544 --> 00:23:23.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
unrepentant ones from the congregation.

00:23:24.423 --> 00:23:28.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, while there are things
that we must send out

00:23:28.386 --> 00:23:30.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the congregation,

00:23:30.388 --> 00:23:32.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom must we help to build up

00:23:32.765 --> 00:23:35.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and welcome back into the congregation?

00:23:38.437 --> 00:23:43.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
When wrongdoing
is removed from among Jehovah’s people

00:23:43.442 --> 00:23:47.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they are united together
in clean and pure worship,

00:23:47.738 --> 00:23:51.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sees this
and his people are blessed.

00:23:52.827 --> 00:23:56.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Malachi 3:16 tells us

00:23:56.163 --> 00:24:00.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he is ‘paying attention
and he is listening

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:02.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who properly fear him.’

00:24:02.712 --> 00:24:06.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
He places their names
in his “book of remembrance.”

00:24:06.465 --> 00:24:08.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege!

00:24:08.592 --> 00:24:11.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even so, to keep his blessing,

00:24:11.637 --> 00:24:15.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must also imitate his mercy

00:24:15.224 --> 00:24:19.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remain ready
to welcome back repentant ones.

00:24:20.438 --> 00:24:23.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the concept of tearing down,

00:24:23.316 --> 00:24:26.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
the concept of building up
is not difficult to picture

00:24:26.569 --> 00:24:29.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you think of it in terms of a building.

00:24:29.905 --> 00:24:31.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some houses are in bad shape,

00:24:31.907 --> 00:24:35.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they are not beyond repair,
like the one we saw earlier.

00:24:35.953 --> 00:24:40.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can be restored,
as illustrated on screen.

00:24:40.166 --> 00:24:42.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s in bad shape, but look at that.

00:24:42.668 --> 00:24:44.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be fixed up.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind,

00:24:46.672 --> 00:24:50.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to welcoming back
and building up repentant ones,

00:24:50.926 --> 00:24:52.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are helped to do this

00:24:52.762 --> 00:24:57.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we imitate Jesus
and the faithful angels.

00:24:57.391 --> 00:25:01.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have not only witnessed
Jehovah’s mercy from the start,

00:25:01.562 --> 00:25:04.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they have developed
this quality themselves.

00:25:04.482 --> 00:25:06.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is what we mean:

00:25:06.484 --> 00:25:09.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
When humans were first created,

00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:13.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
mercy was not needed
because humans were perfect.

00:25:14.033 --> 00:25:19.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only after the rebellion,
when the first imperfect child was born,

00:25:19.038 --> 00:25:21.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
did this aspect of Jehovah’s love

00:25:21.499 --> 00:25:24.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
and compassion become evident.

00:25:25.544 --> 00:25:29.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus and the angels
witnessed Jehovah’s great love in action

00:25:29.924 --> 00:25:34.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he extended mercy
to humans who were born in sin.

00:25:35.179 --> 00:25:40.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn, these faithful angels
imitated their heavenly Father

00:25:40.142 --> 00:25:44.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showed mercy in helping to build up
repentant ones on earth.

00:25:44.939 --> 00:25:49.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Jesus showed mercy to Peter
—didn’t he?—

00:25:49.777 --> 00:25:54.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to the woman
who poured perfumed oil on his feet.

00:25:55.449 --> 00:25:58.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used powerful illustrations

00:25:58.369 --> 00:26:01.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us understand
the depth of God’s mercy

00:26:01.997 --> 00:26:05.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just read the parable
of the lost son who returned.

00:26:05.418 --> 00:26:08.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke chapter 15
makes the point, doesn’t it?

00:26:09.713 --> 00:26:12.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
So like Jesus and the faithful angels,

00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:17.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
we desire to imitate
Jehovah’s precious qualities—all of them.

00:26:17.138 --> 00:26:22.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why we seek to welcome back
and build up repentant ones.

00:26:22.143 --> 00:26:25.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do this in harmony with the direction

00:26:25.229 --> 00:26:27.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the congregations have received.

00:26:27.857 --> 00:26:30.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, regarding this direction,

00:26:30.609 --> 00:26:33.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
one person who was removed
from the congregation

00:26:33.487 --> 00:26:36.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
wrote to the Governing Body,
and this is what he said:

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fact that friends can now say a simple,

00:26:41.954 --> 00:26:45.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“heartfelt greeting blows my mind.

00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:49.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have felt like a walking plague,
walking into the Kingdom Hall,

00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:54.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as many friends avoided eye contact
and would clear out of the way.

00:26:54.175 --> 00:26:56.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I get it;

00:26:56.218 --> 00:27:00.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that was our understanding
up until that time.

00:27:00.347 --> 00:27:05.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is an amazing
one and only true God.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:09.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His love is always being manifested
as in this case

00:27:09.273 --> 00:27:13.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to direct you brothers
to announce this new arrangement.

00:27:13.444 --> 00:27:16.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
I look forward to receiving
a visit from the elders.”

00:27:18.491 --> 00:27:22.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what a fine expression that was!

00:27:23.245 --> 00:27:25.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things do change over time.

00:27:25.706 --> 00:27:28.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like that repentant one, he gets it.

00:27:28.542 --> 00:27:30.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
And see, we get it.

00:27:30.336 --> 00:27:33.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is helping us
to understand why these changes come.

00:27:33.839 --> 00:27:36.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we comply, and we love it.

00:27:36.383 --> 00:27:39.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have considered,
Jehovah’s qualities of love and mercy,

00:27:39.762 --> 00:27:42.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
though, have not changed,

00:27:42.181 --> 00:27:45.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our understanding
of his marvelous qualities,

00:27:45.684 --> 00:27:47.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, this has improved.

00:27:47.978 --> 00:27:51.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each of us must work to learn
the depth of his love and mercy

00:27:51.982 --> 00:27:55.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then show
the depth of these things ourselves.

00:27:55.945 --> 00:27:57.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,

00:27:57.988 --> 00:28:02.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s standards of righteousness
and justice have not changed.

00:28:03.619 --> 00:28:07.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each of us must work to uphold
his standards of right and wrong.

00:28:07.331 --> 00:28:09.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the angel in Zechariah’s prophecy,

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:12.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders today
must protect Jehovah’s people

00:28:12.878 --> 00:28:17.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
by exposing, restraining, and sending out

00:28:17.174 --> 00:28:19.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is bad from the congregation.

00:28:19.343 --> 00:28:21.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in summary,

00:28:21.345 --> 00:28:26.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
while we do not hesitate
to tear down wickedness and send it away,

00:28:26.308 --> 00:28:29.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
we desire to do all that we can

00:28:29.311 --> 00:28:34.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring back and build up those
who return to Jehovah.

00:28:40.197 --> 00:28:41.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Ken.

00:28:41.949 --> 00:28:45.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful talk illustrating
Jehovah’s mercy

00:28:45.578 --> 00:28:49.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love yet also his justice
and righteousness!

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all continue to work hard
to reflect those qualities in our life.

00:28:54.587 --> 00:28:57.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, earlier in our program,
we saw a trailer for the video 

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>
<i>—The Greatest Act of Love,</i>

00:29:00.092 --> 00:29:02.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it ended with the words “Coming Soon.”

00:29:04.054 --> 00:29:06.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, soon has arrived.

00:29:07.391 --> 00:29:09.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now enjoy—

00:29:16.567 --> 00:29:18.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now enjoy the full-length epic episode 

00:29:18.902 --> 00:29:22.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>
<i>—The Greatest Act of Love.</i>

00:31:44.965 --> 00:31:46.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:31:48.427 --> 00:31:50.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you go.

00:31:51.388 --> 00:31:52.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks!

00:31:57.478 --> 00:32:01.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, soon we’re having the Memorial,
and you have to come!

00:32:01.607 --> 00:32:03.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the most important event.

00:32:04.193 --> 00:32:06.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
This invite is for you and your mom.

00:32:07.404 --> 00:32:09.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can tell you more about it at our study.

00:32:09.239 --> 00:32:11.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, thanks.

00:32:11.742 --> 00:32:12.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bye!

00:32:12.534 --> 00:32:14.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you later, Sophia!

00:32:15.412 --> 00:32:17.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right, Camille.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, let’s move on to the next paragraph.

00:32:19.833 --> 00:32:21.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you mind reading?

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:22.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, sure.

00:32:22.836 --> 00:32:25.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many people hope for good things to happen,

00:32:25.297 --> 00:32:26.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they cannot be sure
that their hope . . .”

00:32:26.882 --> 00:32:28.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:32:30.636 --> 00:32:32.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now it’s your turn!

00:32:32.721 --> 00:32:34.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:32:34.097 --> 00:32:36.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Life was perfect.

00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:38.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam and Eve disobeyed Jehovah.

00:32:39.186 --> 00:32:41.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lost their perfect life and died.

00:32:41.688 --> 00:32:43.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right!

00:32:43.065 --> 00:32:46.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, nobody was perfect,

00:32:47.861 --> 00:32:49.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
so everyone would grow old and die.

00:32:51.156 --> 00:32:54.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus came to earth
and taught everyone about Jehovah.

00:32:54.743 --> 00:32:56.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave his life.

00:32:56.787 --> 00:32:58.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
He died for us.

00:32:58.247 --> 00:33:02.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right, so that in the future
nobody will have to die.

00:33:04.336 --> 00:33:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has anybody ever given you a special gift?

00:33:07.256 --> 00:33:08.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:33:20.686 --> 00:33:22.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you think they gave it to you?

00:33:23.689 --> 00:33:25.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because she loved me.

00:33:25.399 --> 00:33:26.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right!

00:33:26.692 --> 00:33:29.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah and Jesus gave us the greatest gift.

00:33:29.903 --> 00:33:31.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
It cost a lot.

00:33:31.905 --> 00:33:34.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they gave it to us because they love us

00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:37.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they want us to live forever.

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about my grandma?

00:33:40.747 --> 00:33:42.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their gift is for her too!

00:33:44.668 --> 00:33:47.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s somebody in the Bible
I would like you to meet.

00:33:47.462 --> 00:33:49.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s a lot like you.

00:33:50.132 --> 00:33:52.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke chapter 7.

00:33:54.761 --> 00:33:57.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
She lived in a city called Nain.

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had a husband

00:34:05.188 --> 00:34:07.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a son.

00:35:05.415 --> 00:35:10.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then her husband died.

00:35:17.010 --> 00:35:19.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
She still had her son to keep her company.

00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then her son died too.

00:35:49.584 --> 00:35:51.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
They both died?

00:35:52.796 --> 00:35:57.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was already a widow,
and now she was all alone.

00:36:03.265 --> 00:36:06.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day of the funeral,
Jesus came to Nain

00:36:07.519 --> 00:36:08.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he saw the widow.

00:36:33.045 --> 00:36:34.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stop weeping.

00:36:51.313 --> 00:36:54.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young man, I say to you, get up!

00:37:15.629 --> 00:37:17.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:37:17.339 --> 00:37:19.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you think Jesus
brought him back to life?

00:37:20.467 --> 00:37:22.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:37:22.302 --> 00:37:25.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he loved them.

00:37:25.138 --> 00:37:27.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah!

00:37:27.057 --> 00:37:28.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves all of us.

00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:31.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves you.

00:37:31.186 --> 00:37:33.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why he died for us.

00:37:33.605 --> 00:37:35.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah brought Jesus back to life.

00:37:37.067 --> 00:37:39.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, Jesus will resurrect people,

00:37:39.986 --> 00:37:43.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because he died for us,
we can all live forever!

00:37:44.157 --> 00:37:46.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the greatest gift anyone could give us.

00:37:48.245 --> 00:37:51.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we go to the Memorial,
it’s a way to say thank you.

00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:53.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.

00:37:53.834 --> 00:37:55.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope my mom wants to come too.

00:38:03.635 --> 00:38:05.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom!

00:38:05.053 --> 00:38:06.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, baby.

00:38:06.429 --> 00:38:08.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we get ready for the Memorial?

00:38:09.307 --> 00:38:11.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, honey.

00:38:11.101 --> 00:38:13.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a long day.
I’m so sorry.

00:38:13.103 --> 00:38:14.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t think we can make it.

00:38:22.571 --> 00:38:26.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Can’t wait to see you tonight.
Let us know if you need a ride.”

00:38:28.034 --> 00:38:29.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Sophia’s mom.

00:38:31.955 --> 00:38:33.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom, we can do this!

00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:40.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s do it!

00:38:41.256 --> 00:38:42.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:38:44.217 --> 00:38:45.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mommy?

00:38:45.468 --> 00:38:47.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, my little princess?

00:38:47.804 --> 00:38:49.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m glad you’re studying the Bible.

00:38:49.681 --> 00:38:51.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me too.

00:38:53.393 --> 00:38:56.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this time,
we’ll have the passing of the wine.

00:39:03.403 --> 00:39:05.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we all go home tonight,

00:39:06.489 --> 00:39:11.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about what Jesus’ sacrifice
means to you.

00:39:32.682 --> 00:39:34.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:39:42.525 --> 00:39:44.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom!

00:39:50.075 --> 00:39:51.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come with me.

00:40:44.045 --> 00:40:45.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zoe,

00:40:49.592 --> 00:40:51.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
turn around.

00:40:53.179 --> 00:40:55.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zoe!

00:40:56.808 --> 00:40:58.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grandma?

00:40:59.728 --> 00:41:01.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s you!

00:41:03.106 --> 00:41:05.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
My baby girl!

00:41:06.985 --> 00:41:08.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
I missed you.

00:41:08.945 --> 00:41:10.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grandma is here now.

00:41:21.541 --> 00:41:24.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has shown love in many ways.

00:41:26.504 --> 00:41:29.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when he gave Jesus’ life for us,

00:41:30.258 --> 00:41:34.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was the greatest act of love.

00:41:49.861 --> 00:41:53.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s remarkable how
even Caleb and Sophia videos

00:41:53.531 --> 00:41:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
can touch our emotions.

00:41:55.658 --> 00:42:00.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was not brought to you
by artificial intelligence, just so you know.

00:42:00.413 --> 00:42:04.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters, dear brothers
and sisters, in Audio/Video Services

00:42:04.417 --> 00:42:07.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
devoted thousands of hours.

00:42:07.462 --> 00:42:10.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wish to express thanks to them.

00:42:10.048 --> 00:42:12.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, we express thanks to Jehovah

00:42:12.509 --> 00:42:14.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this touching video portrayal.

00:42:25.397 --> 00:42:28.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Steve,
I think part of that applause was for you.

00:42:31.194 --> 00:42:36.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next part of our program relates
to the cherished hope of living forever.

00:42:36.032 --> 00:42:38.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lett has been

00:42:38.201 --> 00:42:41.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
experiencing a little bit of back pain,
but he is improving,

00:42:41.454 --> 00:42:44.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he just wanted us to relate that
before his next talk.

00:42:44.457 --> 00:42:46.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he will discuss the theme 

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Everlasting Life! Possible? Boring?”

00:42:52.757 --> 00:42:54.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lett, you have our attention.

00:42:57.846 --> 00:43:00.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news that we preach

00:43:00.682 --> 00:43:03.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
has many facets, many aspects,

00:43:03.977 --> 00:43:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
like a gorgeous, multifaceted diamond.

00:43:08.731 --> 00:43:10.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, what is one facet

00:43:10.817 --> 00:43:13.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we especially enjoy
teaching people about?

00:43:14.487 --> 00:43:19.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact that faithful humans
under Kingdom rule

00:43:19.325 --> 00:43:22.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
will never grow old and die.

00:43:22.996 --> 00:43:25.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike Adam and Eve
who threw away the privilege

00:43:25.915 --> 00:43:28.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
to eat of “the tree of life”
and live forever,

00:43:28.877 --> 00:43:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithful humans
will be granted life without end.

00:43:34.507 --> 00:43:37.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, sometimes when we discuss

00:43:37.635 --> 00:43:40.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
this aspect of the good news,

00:43:40.430 --> 00:43:43.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
people will bring up a couple of questions.

00:43:43.558 --> 00:43:46.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
One, they may say:

00:43:46.311 --> 00:43:49.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is everlasting life really possible?

00:43:49.814 --> 00:43:52.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just seems like it’s too good to be true.”

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:57.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
And two, “If I actually do live forever,

00:43:57.697 --> 00:44:02.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
will life not eventually become boring?”

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:06.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s discuss
those two questions during our talk.

00:44:06.539 --> 00:44:09.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first, how can we be sure

00:44:09.959 --> 00:44:14.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everlasting life will become a reality?

00:44:15.256 --> 00:44:19.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first and foremost reason

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:24.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
is because the God
“who cannot lie” has promised it.

00:44:24.682 --> 00:44:27.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 21:4, Jehovah says

00:44:27.435 --> 00:44:31.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “he will wipe out every tear . . . ,

00:44:31.856 --> 00:44:34.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and death will be no more.”

00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:38.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, in effect,
he publicly signs that promise

00:44:38.988 --> 00:44:40.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the next verse, verse 5.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:44.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Write, for these words

00:44:44.744 --> 00:44:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
are faithful and true.”

00:44:46.955 --> 00:44:51.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words: ‘Write it down
where everyone can see what I’ve promised,

00:44:51.209 --> 00:44:54.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and I certify it will happen.

00:44:54.087 --> 00:44:56.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guarantee it will.’

00:44:57.257 --> 00:44:59.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s a question:

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
What evidence do we have

00:45:01.844 --> 00:45:05.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans originally were designed
to live forever?

00:45:06.432 --> 00:45:10.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think about the first book
of the Bible, the introductory book.

00:45:10.895 --> 00:45:15.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first two humans were told
that if they ate

00:45:15.817 --> 00:45:18.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
from “the tree of the knowledge
of good and bad,”

00:45:18.778 --> 00:45:21.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would “certainly die.”

00:45:21.155 --> 00:45:23.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is implied?

00:45:23.157 --> 00:45:26.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they didn’t eat
—they were faithful, obedient—

00:45:26.911 --> 00:45:28.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would still be alive.

00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:30.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would never die.

00:45:30.415 --> 00:45:33.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
How old would Adam be now?

00:45:33.543 --> 00:45:37.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little over 6,000 years old
and Eve a little bit younger.

00:45:37.797 --> 00:45:39.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would they look?

00:45:39.841 --> 00:45:43.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as beautiful, handsome,

00:45:43.011 --> 00:45:46.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
perfect as the day they were created.

00:45:46.222 --> 00:45:48.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would be their health condition?

00:45:48.891 --> 00:45:52.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would feel just as healthy and vibrant

00:45:52.353 --> 00:45:55.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the day they were created.

00:45:55.189 --> 00:46:00.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know that they did sin
and they died as Jehovah said,

00:46:00.194 --> 00:46:03.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his original purpose
was for them to live,

00:46:03.489 --> 00:46:06.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that purpose will be fulfilled

00:46:06.492 --> 00:46:09.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
as scriptures in the Bible certainly verify.

00:46:10.330 --> 00:46:13.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s another line of reasoning

00:46:13.708 --> 00:46:17.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we were originally designed
to live forever?

00:46:17.128 --> 00:46:21.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think about
the astounding capacity

00:46:21.132 --> 00:46:23.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the human brain.

00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:27.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, scientists in recent years
are finding out more and more

00:46:27.096 --> 00:46:30.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the brain has much more capacity
than they previously thought

00:46:30.433 --> 00:46:32.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
even just a couple of years ago.

00:46:32.477 --> 00:46:35.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what a recent study
had to say about this.

00:46:35.563 --> 00:46:40.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said, “The average adult human
brain’s memory capacity

00:46:40.568 --> 00:46:43.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is estimated to be

00:46:43.821 --> 00:46:48.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
2.5 million gigabytes.”

00:46:48.284 --> 00:46:51.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you want to compare that
with a smartphone,

00:46:51.245 --> 00:46:56.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
the average smartphone is 150 gigabytes

00:46:56.167 --> 00:47:00.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
—2.5 million gigabytes, the brain;

00:47:00.421 --> 00:47:03.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
150, a smartphone.

00:47:04.258 --> 00:47:06.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
No comparison.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:09.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, that study went on
to say that “the brain

00:47:09.013 --> 00:47:12.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“would never run out of storage capacity

00:47:12.850 --> 00:47:17.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because new memories
keep replacing old ones.

00:47:17.188 --> 00:47:22.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
That happens
because new neural connections are formed.”

00:47:22.193 --> 00:47:27.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the brain was obviously designed
to last forever

00:47:27.156 --> 00:47:29.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
—never to fill up.

00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t give me your name.

00:47:31.244 --> 00:47:33.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t give me any more information.

00:47:33.287 --> 00:47:35.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
My brain is full.
I can’t take it.’

00:47:37.750 --> 00:47:40.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it will never reach that point.

00:47:40.044 --> 00:47:42.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brain can always take more.

00:47:42.088 --> 00:47:44.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made it that way.

00:47:44.590 --> 00:47:48.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to get
a little, maybe, idea

00:47:48.302 --> 00:47:51.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the capacity of the human brain?

00:47:51.639 --> 00:47:55.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the tremendous download

00:47:55.059 --> 00:47:58.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus received at his baptism

00:47:58.438 --> 00:48:02.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
—eons of time—

00:48:02.066 --> 00:48:04.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
the memory of that all downloaded.

00:48:04.277 --> 00:48:08.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
The human brain
that Jesus had was able to hold that.

00:48:08.072 --> 00:48:10.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a human brain
—perfect but a human brain.

00:48:10.908 --> 00:48:12.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brain, obviously,

00:48:12.952 --> 00:48:16.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a very, very big place

00:48:16.497 --> 00:48:19.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very, very small space, isn’t it?

00:48:20.376 --> 00:48:22.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
That certainly is the case.

00:48:22.837 --> 00:48:25.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s our intriguing question:

00:48:26.174 --> 00:48:29.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would Jehovah create us

00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:33.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a super brain, super capacity,

00:48:33.181 --> 00:48:37.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re only designed
to live 70 or 80 years?

00:48:37.310 --> 00:48:39.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wouldn’t even make sense, would it?

00:48:39.604 --> 00:48:42.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would be like making a smartphone

00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:45.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a 2.5 million gigabyte capacity,

00:48:45.902 --> 00:48:50.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that the user would only use
a few hundred gigabytes in his whole lifetime

00:48:50.907 --> 00:48:54.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
or like building an automobile

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a million horsepower engine,

00:48:58.039 --> 00:49:00.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing the owner would only use

00:49:00.458 --> 00:49:03.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few hundred horsepower during his life.

00:49:03.711 --> 00:49:05.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wouldn’t make sense, would it?

00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:10.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brain, obviously, loudly proclaims

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:14.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans were designed to live forever.

00:49:14.931 --> 00:49:18.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s get one more line of reasoning
that we were designed to live forever.

00:49:18.893 --> 00:49:22.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go to Ecclesiastes, please,

00:49:22.396 --> 00:49:27.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 3:11.

00:49:27.401 --> 00:49:30.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll read the <i>A</i> part.

00:49:30.154 --> 00:49:32.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “He [Jehovah]

00:49:32.323 --> 00:49:36.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has made everything beautiful in its time.

00:49:37.078 --> 00:49:39.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has even put

00:49:39.539 --> 00:49:42.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
“eternity

00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:44.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their heart.”

00:49:44.418 --> 00:49:46.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does that mean?

00:49:46.462 --> 00:49:48.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah has implanted

00:49:48.756 --> 00:49:52.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the hearts of humans the desire,

00:49:52.051 --> 00:49:57.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
the strong craving, to live eternally
—to live forever.

00:49:57.056 --> 00:49:59.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about it.

00:49:59.267 --> 00:50:04.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it true that when death
lurks at a person’s door,

00:50:04.272 --> 00:50:08.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see that they keep trying
to live, don’t they?

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:10.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will pursue doctors and medicine.

00:50:10.736 --> 00:50:14.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will endure
all kinds of difficult treatments.

00:50:14.574 --> 00:50:15.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want to live.

00:50:15.741 --> 00:50:20.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a person was asked
to pick the day on which he wished to die,

00:50:20.705 --> 00:50:23.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
most would keep pushing that day

00:50:23.499 --> 00:50:26.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
farther and farther into the future,
wouldn’t they?

00:50:26.335 --> 00:50:29.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want to keep living.

00:50:29.881 --> 00:50:33.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout history,
humans have looked for the fountain of youth,

00:50:33.759 --> 00:50:37.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
the medicine, an elixir,
or a potion to keep them living.

00:50:37.555 --> 00:50:40.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the search certainly continues today.

00:50:40.224 --> 00:50:43.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, here’s our intriguing question:

00:50:43.144 --> 00:50:47.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would Jehovah create humans
with that strong desire

00:50:47.315 --> 00:50:50.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
if they’re only meant to live 70 or 80 years?

00:50:50.234 --> 00:50:52.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would actually be cruel, wouldn’t it?

00:50:52.236 --> 00:50:54.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be kind of like
(if you think of this illustration)

00:50:54.363 --> 00:50:58.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
tying a dog on a 20-foot (6 m) chain

00:50:58.743 --> 00:51:03.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and putting a juicy steak 21 (6.5 m) feet

00:51:03.205 --> 00:51:06.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the post where that chain was secured.

00:51:06.918 --> 00:51:08.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
The dog could see that steak,

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could smell that steak,
but he couldn’t get a bite of it, could he?

00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:13.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would be cruel.

00:51:13.758 --> 00:51:17.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know Jehovah
is definitely not a cruel God.

00:51:17.970 --> 00:51:21.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a very loving heavenly Father.

00:51:21.933 --> 00:51:25.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the foregoing
is just a few reasoning points

00:51:25.311 --> 00:51:30.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humans were designed
and will live forever.

00:51:30.232 --> 00:51:33.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s get that second question:

00:51:33.235 --> 00:51:36.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do some people reason

00:51:36.405 --> 00:51:39.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
that living forever would be boring?

00:51:39.992 --> 00:51:42.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, some reason
that if everyone lives forever,

00:51:42.954 --> 00:51:45.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re all perfect,

00:51:45.081 --> 00:51:50.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
so will they not all eventually become
carbon copies of each other

00:51:50.086 --> 00:51:53.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
with variety being lost?

00:51:54.131 --> 00:51:56.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that reasoning is not sound.

00:51:56.884 --> 00:51:59.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our publication <i>Is This Life All There Is?</i>

00:51:59.971 --> 00:52:02.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
addressed that shallow reasoning.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what it said.

00:52:03.975 --> 00:52:07.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said: “Life in human perfection

00:52:07.103 --> 00:52:12.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not mean that everyone will be doing
all things equally well

00:52:12.066 --> 00:52:15.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and with the same intense interest.

00:52:15.027 --> 00:52:19.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What the Bible holds forth is the promise
of life without sickness and death.

00:52:20.783 --> 00:52:25.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Healthy people today are not all alike, 

00:52:25.121 --> 00:52:29.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so why should anyone conclude
that bodily and mental perfection

00:52:29.583 --> 00:52:33.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“would make people
virtual copies of one another?

00:52:33.629 --> 00:52:37.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
“People will still vary as to personality.

00:52:37.258 --> 00:52:40.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They will have
varying preferences as to work,

00:52:40.344 --> 00:52:43.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“building, home decoration, landscaping,

00:52:43.848 --> 00:52:46.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“food and drink, entertainment,

00:52:46.517 --> 00:52:49.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fine arts and [so forth].”

00:52:50.229 --> 00:52:52.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, think about this:

00:52:52.565 --> 00:52:56.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is nothing
—absolutely nothing—boring

00:52:56.569 --> 00:53:00.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah or any of his creation.

00:53:00.781 --> 00:53:05.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
I personally can’t think of any two things
that are exactly identical,

00:53:05.494 --> 00:53:09.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
even so-called identical twins
that you’re looking at here.

00:53:10.207 --> 00:53:12.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice their teeth are different.

00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:18.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their freckle pattern is different;

00:53:18.382 --> 00:53:21.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
their fingerprints are different;
their personalities are different.

00:53:21.844 --> 00:53:23.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are certainly not identical.

00:53:23.929 --> 00:53:26.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, there are no two dogs,

00:53:26.932 --> 00:53:30.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
no two trees, no two tigers,

00:53:30.144 --> 00:53:33.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
no two things I can think of
that are exactly alike.

00:53:33.814 --> 00:53:36.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about zebras for a moment.

00:53:36.692 --> 00:53:38.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you look at this herd of zebras;

00:53:38.694 --> 00:53:41.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
it looks like they’re basically
all striped the same.

00:53:41.947 --> 00:53:46.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
No two zebras on the planet
are striped exactly the same.

00:53:47.703 --> 00:53:50.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
And scientists even think

00:53:50.081 --> 00:53:54.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this is how a baby zebra

00:53:54.126 --> 00:53:57.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
recognizes and finds
his mother in a big herd.

00:53:57.963 --> 00:54:02.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
He memorizes her unique striping pattern.

00:54:03.094 --> 00:54:05.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it amazing what evolution can do?

00:54:11.727 --> 00:54:15.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you believe that,
I’ve got a bridge to sell you.

00:54:16.607 --> 00:54:20.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing what Jehovah has done!

00:54:20.027 --> 00:54:23.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or think about snowflakes for a moment.

00:54:24.281 --> 00:54:28.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out of the trillions of snowflakes

00:54:28.119 --> 00:54:31.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fall in one large snowstorm,

00:54:31.497 --> 00:54:33.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
no two are alike

00:54:33.916 --> 00:54:37.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
—amazing!—
even though all of them are six-sided,

00:54:37.128 --> 00:54:38.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you can see here.

00:54:38.587 --> 00:54:42.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re hexagonal, but no two are alike.

00:54:42.174 --> 00:54:44.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing boring about Jehovah.

00:54:44.301 --> 00:54:47.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can be sure that humans

00:54:47.596 --> 00:54:51.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are the work of the hands of a God
of that kind of infinite variety

00:54:51.517 --> 00:54:55.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
will never become
carbon copies of one another.

00:54:55.938 --> 00:55:00.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s another reason, though,
that people think (some of them)

00:55:00.442 --> 00:55:03.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
that living forever would be boring.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:08.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
They think that finally you would learn
everything there is to learn,

00:55:08.075 --> 00:55:11.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
you would do everything there is to do,

00:55:11.036 --> 00:55:13.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
and life would cease to be stimulating.

00:55:13.873 --> 00:55:16.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would become drab and uninteresting.

00:55:16.959 --> 00:55:20.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, again, such reasoning is not sound.

00:55:20.838 --> 00:55:25.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, to repeat something
that is pleasurable

00:55:25.843 --> 00:55:27.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not boring, is it?

00:55:27.887 --> 00:55:29.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, think about eating.

00:55:29.889 --> 00:55:33.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most people eat
over a thousand meals in a year.

00:55:33.767 --> 00:55:36.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the man who is 40 years old

00:55:36.020 --> 00:55:38.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has eaten over 40,000 meals

00:55:38.606 --> 00:55:41.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
more bored than the 20-year-old

00:55:41.692 --> 00:55:43.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s eaten 20,000 meals?

00:55:43.986 --> 00:55:46.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, that certainly is not the case.

00:55:46.697 --> 00:55:48.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about apples.

00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:53.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many varieties of apples
have you personally tasted?

00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:58.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe a couple of dozen:
Fuji, Gala, Rome, McIntosh,

00:55:58.125 --> 00:56:02.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Red and Golden Delicious,
Granny Smith, Jonathan, Winesap.

00:56:02.713 --> 00:56:04.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’ve tried a couple dozen.

00:56:05.758 --> 00:56:08.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Studies show there are

00:56:08.093 --> 00:56:13.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 7,500 varieties of apples
grown on the earth.

00:56:13.098 --> 00:56:15.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you sample one apple every day,

00:56:15.976 --> 00:56:18.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would take you over 20 years

00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:21.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to sample the varieties
that are grown on the earth today,

00:56:21.565 --> 00:56:25.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
not speaking of new ones
that may be developed in the new world.

00:56:25.361 --> 00:56:27.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’ll take you over 20 years.

00:56:27.238 --> 00:56:32.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you could go back 20 years later
and eat that first one you sampled.

00:56:33.285 --> 00:56:35.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’d be like a brand new variety,
wouldn’t it?

00:56:39.959 --> 00:56:43.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing boring
about Jehovah’s creation.

00:56:43.837 --> 00:56:46.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about this too—another example:

00:56:46.340 --> 00:56:50.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you take a wonderful vacation
in a beautiful part of the earth

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you go back into the same area

00:56:53.347 --> 00:56:55.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you take another vacation that’s similar—

00:56:55.516 --> 00:56:57.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
are you bored?

00:56:57.101 --> 00:56:58.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:56:58.227 --> 00:57:01.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Repeating pleasurable things is not boring.

00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:06.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also remember
that you will never learn it all.

00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:10.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will never do it all
—learn it or do it all.

00:57:10.364 --> 00:57:13.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to Ecclesiastes chapter 3.

00:57:13.909 --> 00:57:16.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this time, let’s read the entire verse,

00:57:16.829 --> 00:57:19.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 11:

00:57:19.623 --> 00:57:24.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He [Jehovah]
has made everything beautiful in its time.

00:57:24.628 --> 00:57:29.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has even put eternity in their heart;

00:57:29.008 --> 00:57:33.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yet mankind [now look at that word]

00:57:33.053 --> 00:57:38.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will never [never] find out the work

00:57:38.058 --> 00:57:41.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the true God
has made from start to finish.”

00:57:41.979 --> 00:57:43.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah says
that you’ll never learn it all.

00:57:43.981 --> 00:57:45.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll never do it all.

00:57:45.566 --> 00:57:47.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long would it take you

00:57:47.568 --> 00:57:52.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn to play all the musical instruments
that exist today,

00:57:52.406 --> 00:57:55.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn to play them well.

00:57:55.034 --> 00:57:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
People spend their whole life
learning to play one instrument, don’t they?

00:57:59.038 --> 00:58:03.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they die, they wish
they had more time to develop that skill.

00:58:03.083 --> 00:58:07.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about new instruments,
even ones invented in the new world?

00:58:07.212 --> 00:58:12.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
You brothers, imagine living
100 years with a beard,

00:58:14.136 --> 00:58:16.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
100 years with just a mustache,

00:58:17.014 --> 00:58:21.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
100 years with a goatee,
and 100 years clean-shaven.

00:58:22.227 --> 00:58:26.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then go back and repeat that process
with different variations.

00:58:28.025 --> 00:58:30.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine living for 100 years

00:58:30.444 --> 00:58:34.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a beautiful house that you built
in the mountains (you and your family)

00:58:34.656 --> 00:58:37.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then trading that house

00:58:37.242 --> 00:58:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a house that a family
built on the seashore.

00:58:41.622 --> 00:58:43.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you live in that house for 100 years.

00:58:43.749 --> 00:58:47.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you continue the trading process
all around the planet Earth

00:58:47.169 --> 00:58:49.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
until finally you get back
to that original house

00:58:49.797 --> 00:58:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you built in the mountains,

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:55.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now it’s greatly improved

00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:57.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
—remodeled and beautiful.

00:58:57.262 --> 00:58:58.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
You live there another 100 years.

00:58:58.597 --> 00:59:01.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
You start that process again.

00:59:01.433 --> 00:59:03.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, just think about
some of these things.

00:59:03.435 --> 00:59:07.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine learning
about all the millions of varieties of fish,

00:59:07.606 --> 00:59:11.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
amphibians, mammals, birds, insects.

00:59:11.276 --> 00:59:14.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
I read about one man who studied fleas

00:59:16.448 --> 00:59:21.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
—22 years he spent studying fleas.

00:59:21.036 --> 00:59:23.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is a flea expert.

00:59:25.374 --> 00:59:27.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
He probably doesn’t know much
about anything else,

00:59:27.376 --> 00:59:31.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he knows about fleas—22 years.

00:59:33.507 --> 00:59:37.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine getting to know

00:59:37.386 --> 00:59:40.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciate every human

00:59:40.806 --> 00:59:43.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
among the billions
who will be living on the earth

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:45.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
—getting to know and appreciate
every one of them,

00:59:45.769 --> 00:59:49.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
learning from their talents
and their experiences,

00:59:49.398 --> 00:59:52.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
coming to regard them as a dear friend.

00:59:52.651 --> 00:59:56.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s just one example: Wouldn’t you like
to spend some time with Noah’s wife?

00:59:56.155 --> 01:00:00.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that I’d like to know,
“What is your name?”

01:00:02.327 --> 01:00:04.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right now, all we know
is Sister Noah, right?

01:00:05.914 --> 01:00:08.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And how were you and your husband

01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:13.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“able to protect your sons
from the evil influence that was around you?

01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:16.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What was it like
in those years before the Flood?

01:00:16.842 --> 01:00:18.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it like to come out of the ark?”

01:00:18.844 --> 01:00:22.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
You could spend a lot of time
with Noah’s wife, couldn’t you?

01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:24.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine learning

01:00:24.433 --> 01:00:26.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
about all (each one)

01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:30.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the more than 200 billion stars

01:00:30.564 --> 01:00:32.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Milky Way galaxy.

01:00:32.858 --> 01:00:36.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then after you do that,
you could go to the next galaxy.

01:00:36.695 --> 01:00:39.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they estimate there are more galaxies

01:00:39.948 --> 01:00:42.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
than there are individual stars
in the Milky Way galaxy.

01:00:42.993 --> 01:00:45.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you think of that,
it gives you a headache, doesn’t it?

01:00:46.497 --> 01:00:48.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of time could be used there.

01:00:48.499 --> 01:00:51.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even more impossible,

01:00:51.043 --> 01:00:53.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
imagine learning about Jehovah.

01:00:53.879 --> 01:00:56.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout all eternity,

01:00:56.173 --> 01:01:00.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will learn more and more
fascinating things about our God

01:01:00.511 --> 01:01:03.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and never begin to learn it all.

01:01:03.138 --> 01:01:05.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we could go on and on,

01:01:05.265 --> 01:01:07.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
but hopefully
we could use some of these points

01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:11.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we ever encounter someone
who brings up that reasoning,

01:01:11.730 --> 01:01:14.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is it really possible to live forever?”

01:01:14.274 --> 01:01:18.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not only possible,
but it’s guaranteed, isn’t it?

01:01:18.070 --> 01:01:22.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it definitely will not be boring.

01:01:22.074 --> 01:01:25.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
And hopefully all of us
appreciate even more

01:01:25.661 --> 01:01:27.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
this marvelous prize

01:01:27.913 --> 01:01:30.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has invited humans

01:01:30.832 --> 01:01:33.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach out and take hold of.

01:01:33.961 --> 01:01:36.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t miss it.
Don’t miss it.

01:01:36.255 --> 01:01:40.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reach out and take hold of the real life.

01:01:54.856 --> 01:01:58.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
As always, you’ve given us
much to think about, Brother Steve

01:01:58.235 --> 01:02:00.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
—many thought-provoking illustrations
as well.

01:02:00.404 --> 01:02:01.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much.

01:02:03.282 --> 01:02:06.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
At last year’s annual meeting,
we received a new brochure 

01:02:06.493 --> 01:02:09.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Love People—Make Disciples.</i>

01:02:09.121 --> 01:02:11.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we embraced
a new approach to our ministry.

01:02:12.874 --> 01:02:14.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
How’s it going for you?

01:02:15.085 --> 01:02:18.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following video
will share a few experiences

01:02:18.088 --> 01:02:20.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
related to our new approach to the ministry.

01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

01:02:34.438 --> 01:02:37.899 line:10% position:50% align:center
Did I enjoy memorizing presentations?

01:02:38.317 --> 01:02:40.027 line:10% position:50% align:center
No.

01:02:40.277 --> 01:02:41.695 line:10% position:50% align:center
I think I just got used

01:02:41.695 --> 01:02:43.238 line:10% position:50% align:center
to memorizing presentations.

01:02:43.238 --> 01:02:45.657 line:10% position:50% align:center
It was something we did since we were kids.

01:02:45.657 --> 01:02:49.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found that it was kind of hit-or-miss
in the way that people responded.

01:02:49.161 --> 01:02:50.704 line:10% position:50% align:center
Sometimes they responded well;

01:02:50.704 --> 01:02:51.788 line:10% position:50% align:center
sometimes they didn’t

01:02:51.788 --> 01:02:52.914 line:10% position:50% align:center
because maybe

01:02:52.914 --> 01:02:54.583 line:10% position:50% align:center
that wasn’t a subject that interested them.

01:02:54.583 --> 01:02:56.585 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I was feeling kind of unsure,

01:02:56.585 --> 01:02:58.211 line:10% position:50% align:center
like what to do,

01:02:58.211 --> 01:03:00.547 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’d probably just bail out with,

01:03:00.547 --> 01:03:02.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, I don’t want to take
too much of your time right now,”

01:03:02.799 --> 01:03:05.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “It was nice talking with you,”
and “Maybe some other time.”

01:03:09.056 --> 01:03:11.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I read and studied the brochure completely.

01:03:11.892 --> 01:03:14.645 line:10% position:50% align:center
Honestly, I thought, ‘I got this.’

01:03:14.645 --> 01:03:16.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
I didn’t.

01:03:16.396 --> 01:03:20.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we first got this brochure,
I was very intimidated

01:03:20.317 --> 01:03:24.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was so used to the method
that we used before.

01:03:24.029 --> 01:03:25.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was at the airport,

01:03:25.739 --> 01:03:29.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the guy behind me
was complaining about the heat in Florida

01:03:29.618 --> 01:03:33.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the only reason why he was there
was because of a funeral.

01:03:33.497 --> 01:03:35.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stopped him, and I said:

01:03:35.374 --> 01:03:39.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Excuse me, I overheard you saying
that you were here for a funeral.

01:03:39.419 --> 01:03:41.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who died?”

01:03:41.004 --> 01:03:42.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, “My mother-in-law.”

01:03:42.589 --> 01:03:46.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I remembered that I had a magazine
about comfort for those who grieve,

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:49.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I pulled the magazine out.

01:03:49.388 --> 01:03:51.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the conversation was done.

01:03:51.682 --> 01:03:56.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my mind, I said: ‘Wah-wah.
He ain’t going to talk no more.’

01:03:56.645 --> 01:03:58.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t.

01:03:58.730 --> 01:04:01.191 line:10% position:50% align:center
I love our new approach

01:04:01.191 --> 01:04:04.027 line:10% position:50% align:center
because people can see Jehovah’s people

01:04:04.027 --> 01:04:09.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
as loving, caring people, not just preachers.

01:04:09.074 --> 01:04:11.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because there’s no agenda necessarily

01:04:11.827 --> 01:04:15.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you’re not trying to leave
a specific publication—

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:17.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
you feel more relaxed.

01:04:17.165 --> 01:04:19.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
And oftentimes, the conversation
is naturally going to go there.

01:04:19.793 --> 01:04:22.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes it doesn’t lead
to opening up to a scripture.

01:04:22.504 --> 01:04:26.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s just talking
about their crazy situation at work

01:04:26.383 --> 01:04:28.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
or something else going on in their family,

01:04:28.427 --> 01:04:31.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s OK because I made a friend.

01:04:31.471 --> 01:04:35.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this lady— I was about to pay,
and she had these . . .

01:04:35.934 --> 01:04:37.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . very colorful nails . . .

01:04:37.227 --> 01:04:39.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . long, colorful, decorated nails.

01:04:39.312 --> 01:04:41.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s like she wanted me
to say something about her nails.

01:04:41.857 --> 01:04:43.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, she definitely wanted
to make a statement with them.

01:04:43.525 --> 01:04:44.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

01:04:44.985 --> 01:04:47.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I said, “Girl, your nails look good.”

01:04:47.529 --> 01:04:51.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she was like,
“Oh, well, my nails have a meaning.”

01:04:51.158 --> 01:04:52.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m like, “They do?”

01:04:52.784 --> 01:04:55.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she’s like,
“Yeah, I want to support . . .

01:04:55.328 --> 01:04:57.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“. . . Domestic Violence . . .

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . Domestic Violence Awareness Month.”

01:04:59.499 --> 01:05:02.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m like, “Whoa!
You really care about people.”

01:05:02.377 --> 01:05:03.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.
We went to the website.

01:05:03.587 --> 01:05:04.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we showed the website.

01:05:04.629 --> 01:05:08.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the feature article for that month
was literally about domestic abuse,

01:05:08.842 --> 01:05:12.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she got to see some Bible principles,
and she took that with her.

01:05:12.179 --> 01:05:14.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we had a good conversation.

01:05:14.389 --> 01:05:16.683 line:10% position:50% align:center
My wife and I were working together in a territory,

01:05:16.683 --> 01:05:18.560 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we were walking back to our cars.

01:05:18.560 --> 01:05:22.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw a man across the street
on the block that was already done,

01:05:22.939 --> 01:05:25.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we asked him
how his week had been going.

01:05:25.817 --> 01:05:28.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
That led to us asking
what sort of work he did.

01:05:28.612 --> 01:05:32.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just from that bit of interest
(he really appreciated it),

01:05:32.657 --> 01:05:34.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
he loved what we had to say.

01:05:34.534 --> 01:05:38.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so he actually just asked,
out of the blue, for a study

01:05:38.205 --> 01:05:41.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
after we showed him
the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  brochure.

01:05:41.082 --> 01:05:44.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s attended many meetings
and been a good return visit.

01:05:44.669 --> 01:05:46.880 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I entered a shop,

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:50.050 line:10% position:50% align:center
I started a conversation with the owner.

01:05:50.050 --> 01:05:54.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked, “How long
have you been doing this job?”

01:05:54.137 --> 01:05:56.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
We talked about a lot of things.

01:05:56.848 --> 01:05:59.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then naturally she started expressing

01:05:59.976 --> 01:06:02.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
how she always had questions about life.

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:05.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
I then offered a Bible study,

01:06:05.315 --> 01:06:07.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she accepted the offer with interest.

01:06:08.985 --> 01:06:12.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
From then on,
we have been studying each week.

01:06:12.155 --> 01:06:14.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
And about five months have passed,

01:06:14.574 --> 01:06:17.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we continue to enjoy the discussions.

01:06:17.994 --> 01:06:21.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was walking through a park one day,
and I saw a family,

01:06:21.832 --> 01:06:24.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we had a beautiful conversation.

01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:27.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked a few questions,
and by listening to them,

01:06:27.128 --> 01:06:30.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was really able to hear
the concerns of their heart

01:06:30.715 --> 01:06:33.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the future for their daughter.

01:06:33.718 --> 01:06:36.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
I offered a Bible study.

01:06:36.054 --> 01:06:38.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s been studying now every week,

01:06:38.265 --> 01:06:42.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she attended the convention
for the first time this year.

01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:44.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she’s been attending meetings.

01:06:47.524 --> 01:06:49.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
By us showing them some love,

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:53.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
they might feel like
they might be worthy of more love

01:06:53.154 --> 01:06:55.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just from us but from their Creator.

01:06:55.949 --> 01:06:58.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has really helped me to view them

01:06:58.493 --> 01:07:03.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a potential servant of Jehovah,
as one of our brothers and sisters.

01:07:03.748 --> 01:07:05.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t want to be that obstacle.

01:07:05.709 --> 01:07:10.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me listen; let me be patient;
let me be humble

01:07:10.088 --> 01:07:13.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wait to see what’s the right time.

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
But my goal is still the same:

01:07:15.093 --> 01:07:17.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to talk about my God, Jehovah

01:07:18.555 --> 01:07:20.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just not so fast.

01:07:33.153 --> 01:07:35.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may all of us continue
to show love for people

01:07:35.530 --> 01:07:38.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue to try to make disciples.

01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:44.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier this year, we received the soundtrack
to last year’s convention drama, 

01:07:45.874 --> 01:07:48.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Commit Your Way to Jehovah</i>.

01:07:48.627 --> 01:07:51.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you found this
to be inspiring and encouraging?

01:08:00.347 --> 01:08:02.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you’ll be happy to know
that the Governing Body

01:08:02.432 --> 01:08:05.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
has approved of preparing
multiple soundtracks

01:08:05.602 --> 01:08:08.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
for <i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

01:08:11.691 --> 01:08:13.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to hear a sample?

01:08:20.283 --> 01:08:24.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s listen to some audio excerpts
of this soundtrack. 

01:12:53.139 --> 01:12:55.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
The music for
<i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>

01:12:55.183 --> 01:12:57.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
is very important to the Governing Body,

01:12:57.644 --> 01:13:01.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so we’re happy
to share these excerpts with you.

01:13:01.272 --> 01:13:03.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll be happy to know
that the release of the first soundtrack

01:13:03.983 --> 01:13:06.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
to <i>gnj </i> (<i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>)
will be in the late spring

01:13:06.027 --> 01:13:08.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
or early summer of 2025.

01:13:09.822 --> 01:13:13.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the time has come
for the concluding part of our program,

01:13:14.577 --> 01:13:17.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s a special treat.

01:13:18.539 --> 01:13:20.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s all I’m going to say.

01:13:21.542 --> 01:13:24.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother David Splane will now give the talk

01:13:24.545 --> 01:13:26.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give Jehovah Glory.”

01:13:28.049 --> 01:13:31.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I don’t have to tell you

01:13:31.386 --> 01:13:34.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
that many people today

01:13:34.013 --> 01:13:37.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
are totally self-absorbed.

01:13:39.185 --> 01:13:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
They spend a lot of time on the Internet

01:13:42.146 --> 01:13:44.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a lot of time on social media

01:13:44.774 --> 01:13:47.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
talking about themselves

01:13:47.277 --> 01:13:49.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talking about their own accomplishments.

01:13:50.697 --> 01:13:53.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s in contrast with Jehovah’s people

01:13:53.449 --> 01:13:55.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah’s people

01:13:55.827 --> 01:13:59.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
are concerned with giving God glory.

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:04.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is in line
with what we read at Psalm 96:8.

01:14:04.585 --> 01:14:09.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is the only text
we’re going to read during this talk,

01:14:09.090 --> 01:14:11.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I am going to have a look

01:14:11.592 --> 01:14:14.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
at three words in the phrase
that we’re going to be reading.

01:14:14.595 --> 01:14:16.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, please, let’s look it up.

01:14:16.222 --> 01:14:18.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a moment to find it.

01:14:18.599 --> 01:14:22.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re like me, sometimes it takes
a little while to find things in the Bible.

01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:28.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 96:8

01:14:29.152 --> 01:14:31.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and it’s just the first clause,

01:14:31.571 --> 01:14:33.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first phrase,
that we’re going to look at.

01:14:33.990 --> 01:14:38.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Give Jehovah the glory

01:14:38.619 --> 01:14:42.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
due his name.”

01:14:42.123 --> 01:14:47.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give Jehovah the glory due his name.”

01:14:47.128 --> 01:14:49.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what were the circumstances

01:14:50.923 --> 01:14:54.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
during which these words were first spoken?

01:14:56.054 --> 01:15:01.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were first spoken
on a very happy occasion

01:15:01.851 --> 01:15:05.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a special, spiritual occasion.

01:15:05.104 --> 01:15:06.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were first spoken—

01:15:06.522 --> 01:15:08.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re part of a song,

01:15:08.524 --> 01:15:12.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that song was first composed by David

01:15:12.111 --> 01:15:15.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was bringing the ark of the covenant

01:15:15.490 --> 01:15:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
back to Jerusalem.

01:15:17.533 --> 01:15:21.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you can imagine the joy
with which these words were spoken.

01:15:21.746 --> 01:15:23.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, eventually,

01:15:23.748 --> 01:15:27.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
that song became
part of the theocratic songbook

01:15:27.001 --> 01:15:31.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Israelites used
when they were praising Jehovah.

01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:37.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re going to focus on three words
in this phrase that I just read

01:15:38.054 --> 01:15:43.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“glory,” “due,” and “name.”

01:15:43.059 --> 01:15:45.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give Jehovah the glory

01:15:45.937 --> 01:15:49.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
due his name.”

01:15:49.148 --> 01:15:52.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when you think of the word “glory,”

01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:56.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
what comes to your mind?

01:15:57.156 --> 01:16:01.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re like me,
you probably think of a blinding light,

01:16:01.536 --> 01:16:05.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
a light that’s so intense
that you have to shield your eyes.

01:16:06.207 --> 01:16:09.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you might think
of the words of the apostle John

01:16:09.502 --> 01:16:13.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he wrote that “God is light.”

01:16:14.424 --> 01:16:16.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so you might ask yourself,

01:16:16.926 --> 01:16:21.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How could an imperfect person like me

01:16:21.556 --> 01:16:25.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
give God glory?’

01:16:26.727 --> 01:16:30.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it all comes together

01:16:30.314 --> 01:16:33.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we appreciate
what the Scriptures mean by “glory.”

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:35.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s be really simple.

01:16:37.071 --> 01:16:40.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Glory” in the Scriptures means

01:16:40.491 --> 01:16:44.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“anything that makes someone

01:16:44.829 --> 01:16:48.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
or something impressive.”

01:16:49.834 --> 01:16:51.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to repeat that.

01:16:51.502 --> 01:16:55.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Scriptures, “glory” means

01:16:55.089 --> 01:16:58.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“anything that makes someone

01:16:58.092 --> 01:17:01.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
or something impressive.”

01:17:02.889 --> 01:17:06.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with that simple definition in mind,

01:17:06.559 --> 01:17:11.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
we realize that we can bring glory to God
in our preaching work

01:17:11.439 --> 01:17:15.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we tell others how wonderful Jehovah is,

01:17:15.151 --> 01:17:17.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
how impressive he is.

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:22.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have many reasons to boast in our God.

01:17:22.909 --> 01:17:25.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our God is merciful and compassionate.

01:17:25.786 --> 01:17:27.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our God is empathetic.

01:17:27.413 --> 01:17:31.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we feel hurt, he feels hurt.

01:17:31.501 --> 01:17:33.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our God is humble.

01:17:33.544 --> 01:17:37.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
He shows concern for widows and orphans

01:17:37.215 --> 01:17:40.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
and others
who are often neglected by society.

01:17:42.261 --> 01:17:44.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also bring glory to Jehovah

01:17:44.805 --> 01:17:47.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we give him credit
for our accomplishments.

01:17:47.850 --> 01:17:49.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
David did that.

01:17:49.477 --> 01:17:51.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what David said?

01:17:51.521 --> 01:17:56.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By God’s power I can scale a wall.”

01:17:57.693 --> 01:18:01.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can give glory to God
without saying a word.

01:18:03.074 --> 01:18:04.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the heavens.

01:18:04.742 --> 01:18:07.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does the Bible say about the heavens?

01:18:07.620 --> 01:18:10.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no speech,

01:18:10.039 --> 01:18:12.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and there are no words;

01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:15.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
their voice is not heard.”

01:18:15.878 --> 01:18:19.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, what does the psalm continue to say?

01:18:19.340 --> 01:18:23.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The heavens are declaring the glory of God.”

01:18:23.844 --> 01:18:28.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t help but be impressed
by Jehovah’s creation.

01:18:29.433 --> 01:18:31.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, so much for glory.

01:18:31.978 --> 01:18:34.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give Jehovah the glory

01:18:34.605 --> 01:18:38.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
due [due] his name.”

01:18:39.527 --> 01:18:44.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we give someone his due
when we give him what’s rightfully his.

01:18:44.490 --> 01:18:47.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah has an absolute right

01:18:47.535 --> 01:18:49.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive glory from men.

01:18:49.704 --> 01:18:53.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re reminded of what the 24 elders said

01:18:53.332 --> 01:18:58.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Revelation 4:11.

01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:01.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said: “You are worthy, Jehovah our God,

01:19:01.549 --> 01:19:04.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receive the glory.”

01:19:06.137 --> 01:19:11.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give Jehovah the glory due his name.”

01:19:11.976 --> 01:19:14.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about God’s name?

01:19:14.604 --> 01:19:18.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we were thrilled when we
first learned that God has a name.

01:19:18.608 --> 01:19:22.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that prompted some of us
to study the Bible and come into the truth.

01:19:23.195 --> 01:19:28.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if learning that God has a name
had that effect on you,

01:19:28.117 --> 01:19:32.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t you think that it could also have
that effect on people in your territory?

01:19:33.164 --> 01:19:36.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you asked people
in your territory recently,

01:19:36.083 --> 01:19:38.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Would you like to see
God’s name in the Bible?”

01:19:38.419 --> 01:19:42.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Have you ever seen
God’s name in the Bible?”

01:19:42.548 --> 01:19:45.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
That could lead to some
very interesting discussions.

01:19:46.927 --> 01:19:51.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
A missionary is serving in a country
where most of the people believe in God.

01:19:51.140 --> 01:19:53.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re either Catholic or Muslim,
but they all believe in God.

01:19:53.851 --> 01:19:56.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t know much about Him,

01:19:56.103 --> 01:19:58.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I like the way he reasons with them.

01:19:58.481 --> 01:20:02.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “When you want
to become friends with someone,

01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:04.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the first thing you do
is introduce yourself.

01:20:04.904 --> 01:20:09.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You tell him your name, he tells you his,
and you become friends.

01:20:09.909 --> 01:20:12.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, we all want to be friends of God.

01:20:12.620 --> 01:20:15.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So a good first step

01:20:15.456 --> 01:20:17.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to find out his name.”

01:20:17.708 --> 01:20:21.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he reads God’s name in the Bible.

01:20:22.421 --> 01:20:27.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
We give God glory
when we defend his name and his reputation.

01:20:28.010 --> 01:20:30.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does the name mean?

01:20:30.554 --> 01:20:35.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, many scholars say
it means “He Causes to Become.”

01:20:35.101 --> 01:20:37.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that Jehovah can cause us

01:20:37.645 --> 01:20:40.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become whatever he wants us to be.

01:20:41.565 --> 01:20:45.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
So think about what we heard earlier

01:20:45.903 --> 01:20:48.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this program today.

01:20:49.532 --> 01:20:52.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he wants us to become a missionary,

01:20:52.410 --> 01:20:55.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he wants us to work in construction,

01:20:55.830 --> 01:21:00.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
if he wants us to be a special pioneer
or to serve at Bethel,

01:21:00.835 --> 01:21:02.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Jehovah can give us the strength

01:21:02.837 --> 01:21:05.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he can give us the ability to do that.

01:21:05.381 --> 01:21:09.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all we have to do
is put our trust in him.

01:21:09.885 --> 01:21:13.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, like the heavens,
we can sometimes give God glory

01:21:13.723 --> 01:21:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
without saying a word.

01:21:15.725 --> 01:21:17.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

01:21:17.351 --> 01:21:19.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
By our fine conduct.

01:21:20.604 --> 01:21:23.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many unbelievers
have come into the truth,

01:21:23.107 --> 01:21:26.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes after being
violently opposed for years,

01:21:26.485 --> 01:21:31.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the conduct
of their Christian mate and children?

01:21:31.115 --> 01:21:35.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many unbelievers have been impressed
by the way we take care of one another

01:21:35.119 --> 01:21:37.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and others when disaster strikes?

01:21:38.497 --> 01:21:43.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we think about the words of Jesus
in the Sermon on the Mount.

01:21:43.002 --> 01:21:46.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
When people ‘see our fine works,

01:21:46.380 --> 01:21:50.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
they give glory to our Father in heaven.’

01:21:51.677 --> 01:21:54.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is also glorified when his servants

01:21:54.346 --> 01:21:57.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
respond to the leading of his spirit
in their Christian life,

01:21:57.767 --> 01:22:02.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they become more humble,
more loving, more trustworthy.

01:22:03.522 --> 01:22:05.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you’re an appointed man,

01:22:05.691 --> 01:22:09.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
have the elders found you
to be more reasonable,

01:22:09.445 --> 01:22:13.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
more tactful,
more yielding over the years?

01:22:14.074 --> 01:22:17.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they see those changes in us,
our brothers and sisters

01:22:17.828 --> 01:22:21.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t fail to give credit to Jehovah God,

01:22:21.707 --> 01:22:24.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah God is praised.

01:22:24.752 --> 01:22:27.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in 2025,

01:22:27.129 --> 01:22:29.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s give serious thought

01:22:29.465 --> 01:22:32.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
 to ways we can give God glory.

01:22:32.718 --> 01:22:35.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to remind us, those words,

01:22:35.471 --> 01:22:37.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
the words of Psalm 96:8,

01:22:37.932 --> 01:22:42.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
are going to be posted
in our Kingdom Halls as our yeartext.

01:22:42.478 --> 01:22:44.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the yeartext again?

01:22:44.563 --> 01:22:46.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 96:8:

01:22:46.732 --> 01:22:51.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give Jehovah the glory due his name.”

01:22:55.574 --> 01:23:06.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
[Applause]

01:23:06.627 --> 01:23:08.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s a poem

01:23:08.796 --> 01:23:12.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled “Give Jehovah Glory.”

01:23:13.050 --> 01:23:14.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m going to read it to you.

01:23:14.718 --> 01:23:17.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t usually (we don’t) do poetry
in our publications

01:23:17.763 --> 01:23:19.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it’s too hard to translate,

01:23:19.431 --> 01:23:22.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this is a good one,
and I’m going to read it to you.

01:23:22.351 --> 01:23:26.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s entitled “Give Jehovah Glory.”

01:23:28.566 --> 01:23:32.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who is like you, O Jehovah,

01:23:32.486 --> 01:23:34.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“High on your heavenly throne?

01:23:35.739 --> 01:23:38.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How could I ever repay you

01:23:38.450 --> 01:23:41.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all of the love you have shown?

01:23:42.079 --> 01:23:44.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I look up to the heavens,

01:23:44.164 --> 01:23:47.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Power and glory I see.

01:23:47.918 --> 01:23:50.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who then am I, O Jehovah,

01:23:50.713 --> 01:23:54.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That you would show favor to me?

01:23:55.843 --> 01:23:58.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My life is yours, O Jehovah.

01:23:58.846 --> 01:24:01.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May all I do bring you praise.

01:24:01.557 --> 01:24:03.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Gladly I’ll speak of your goodness

01:24:03.559 --> 01:24:05.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And tell of your glorious ways.

01:24:06.604 --> 01:24:09.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Serving you, Great God, Jehovah,

01:24:09.857 --> 01:24:12.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fills me with honor and pride.

01:24:13.485 --> 01:24:17.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are my strength and my glory.

01:24:17.448 --> 01:24:20.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Forever may you be my Guide.

01:24:20.451 --> 01:24:23.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oceans and valleys below me,

01:24:23.329 --> 01:24:25.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sun, moon, and stars up above

01:24:25.956 --> 01:24:29.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Fill me with joy and with wonder

01:24:29.543 --> 01:24:33.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And show me your unending love.

01:24:33.088 --> 01:24:36.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Majesty, wisdom, and beauty:

01:24:36.759 --> 01:24:39.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These are the things that I see.

01:24:39.970 --> 01:24:43.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How could I not give you glory

01:24:43.223 --> 01:24:46.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
For making it all come to be?”

01:24:47.519 --> 01:25:00.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
[Applause]

01:25:01.617 --> 01:25:04.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those words were composed

01:25:04.453 --> 01:25:07.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a very happy occasion,

01:25:08.582 --> 01:25:11.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
a spiritual occasion.

01:25:11.961 --> 01:25:14.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re part of a song,

01:25:14.797 --> 01:25:17.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
an original song

01:25:17.091 --> 01:25:22.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was composed
specially for this annual meeting.

01:25:22.096 --> 01:25:24.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
And guess what?

01:25:26.183 --> 01:25:28.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guess what?

01:25:29.019 --> 01:25:32.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are going to sing that song

01:25:32.022 --> 01:25:34.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the conclusion of this meeting.

01:25:50.374 --> 01:25:52.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said to the Governing Body, “Are you sure?”

01:25:52.876 --> 01:25:54.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they said, “Oh, yes!”

01:25:54.878 --> 01:25:57.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have tremendous confidence

01:25:57.506 --> 01:26:00.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your musical ability.

01:26:01.885 --> 01:26:04.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just so you know,

01:26:04.179 --> 01:26:07.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body
has decided that from now on

01:26:07.474 --> 01:26:10.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
a new original song based on the yeartext

01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:14.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be featured
at each annual meeting.

01:26:15.024 --> 01:26:26.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
[Applause]

01:26:26.452 --> 01:26:28.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers in music services

01:26:28.662 --> 01:26:31.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
are busy working on the one for 2026.

01:26:33.208 --> 01:26:35.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, during the past two months,

01:26:35.419 --> 01:26:39.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
the music team
and Translation Services all around the world

01:26:39.798 --> 01:26:42.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been working feverishly to translate,

01:26:42.801 --> 01:26:45.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
record, and mix the song.

01:26:45.721 --> 01:26:48.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result of their efforts,

01:26:48.015 --> 01:26:52.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
when this talk is released on October 14,

01:26:53.854 --> 01:26:58.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
the song will be released simultaneously
with the English

01:26:58.484 --> 01:27:02.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
in over 400 languages.

01:27:16.752 --> 01:27:21.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s see how those words sound

01:27:21.757 --> 01:27:23.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they’re put to music.

01:27:23.550 --> 01:27:26.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember, we’re going to be singing
this song at the conclusion of the meeting,

01:27:26.845 --> 01:27:31.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we don’t want anybody just moving
the lips with no sound coming out.

01:27:31.809 --> 01:27:35.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a reason why we call it a song.

01:27:36.897 --> 01:27:40.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
So pay attention and enjoy

01:27:40.025 --> 01:27:42.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give Jehovah Glory.”

01:32:50.752 --> 01:32:54.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
You sure are an encouraging group
with all of this applause!

01:32:54.131 --> 01:32:56.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know that’s why we’re going overtime.

01:32:58.260 --> 01:33:02.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now,
if you’re listening in in your room,

01:33:02.681 --> 01:33:06.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the time comes to sing,
be sure to join in.

01:33:06.143 --> 01:33:08.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the Lord is listening,

01:33:08.728 --> 01:33:13.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
so don’t think that just because you’re
in private that you shouldn’t join in.

01:33:13.024 --> 01:33:15.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we all want to join in,
and this is a way

01:33:15.444 --> 01:33:19.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can give additional glory to Jehovah.

01:33:19.197 --> 01:33:21.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in 2025,

01:33:21.575 --> 01:33:24.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s pay special attention

01:33:24.035 --> 01:33:27.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ways we can give God glory.

01:33:27.289 --> 01:33:30.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
He certainly is worthy.

01:33:38.049 --> 01:33:41.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray that this program
has strengthened your faith

01:33:41.470 --> 01:33:46.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will encourage each one of us
to remain steadfast in Jehovah’s service

01:33:46.391 --> 01:33:49.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have
“plenty to do in the work of the Lord.”

01:33:49.769 --> 01:33:52.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be assured that the Governing Body
loves each of you,

01:33:52.939 --> 01:33:56.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are truly interested
in your everlasting welfare

01:33:56.485 --> 01:33:58.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one of Jehovah’s precious sheep.

01:33:59.696 --> 01:34:04.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a joy to share this beautiful program
with all of you!

01:34:04.534 --> 01:34:07.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s conclude
with this month’s video postcard,

01:34:07.913 --> 01:34:11.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
which takes us to Armenia.

01:34:11.082 --> 01:34:14.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Armenia lies east of Türkiye

01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:18.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and south of the Caucasus mountain range.

01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:22.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yerevan, its capital,
enjoys a magnificent view

01:34:22.511 --> 01:34:26.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Mount Ararat, where,
according to tradition,

01:34:26.264 --> 01:34:28.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Noah’s ark came to rest.

01:34:28.517 --> 01:34:31.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Armenia is even more mountainous

01:34:31.144 --> 01:34:34.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
than Switzerland with deep river valleys,

01:34:34.356 --> 01:34:37.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
forests, and extinct volcanoes.

01:34:37.901 --> 01:34:41.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 3,000 plant species thrive

01:34:41.238 --> 01:34:42.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this small country.

01:34:42.822 --> 01:34:45.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Farms produce a variety of crops:

01:34:45.116 --> 01:34:47.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
pomegranates,

01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:49.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
cherries, peaches,

01:34:49.871 --> 01:34:52.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 50 different types of apricots,

01:34:52.332 --> 01:34:55.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
which are sometimes called Armenian apples.

01:34:55.961 --> 01:34:58.004 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have been active

01:34:58.004 --> 01:35:01.341 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Armenia since 1975,

01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:03.385 line:10% position:50% align:center
when the country was still part

01:35:03.385 --> 01:35:05.595 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Soviet Union.

01:35:05.595 --> 01:35:06.680 line:10% position:50% align:center
For many years,

01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:08.181 line:10% position:50% align:center
congregation meetings were held

01:35:08.181 --> 01:35:11.309 line:10% position:50% align:center
in homes and it was not possible

01:35:11.309 --> 01:35:14.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
to hold assemblies or conventions here.

01:35:14.563 --> 01:35:16.648 line:10% position:50% align:center
But beginning in 1989,

01:35:16.648 --> 01:35:19.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Witnesses in Armenia were invited

01:35:19.985 --> 01:35:23.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend international conventions
in other countries,

01:35:23.196 --> 01:35:27.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
including this one in Kyiv, Ukraine,

01:35:27.117 --> 01:35:29.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1993.

01:35:29.661 --> 01:35:32.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
That same year, authorities began imprisoning

01:35:32.664 --> 01:35:35.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers for their neutrality.

01:35:35.166 --> 01:35:39.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the next 20 years,
more than 500 brothers

01:35:39.629 --> 01:35:44.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
were sentenced to prison terms
of up to three years.

01:35:44.134 --> 01:35:48.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in 2011,
the European Court of Human Rights

01:35:48.471 --> 01:35:52.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
upheld the right to refuse military service

01:35:52.225 --> 01:35:55.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on conscientious objection.

01:35:55.729 --> 01:35:57.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the first time

01:35:57.480 --> 01:36:00.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the court recognized
that conscientious objection

01:36:00.859 --> 01:36:05.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
to military service
based on one’s religious beliefs

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be protected
under the right of freedom of thought,

01:36:09.659 --> 01:36:12.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
conscience, and religion.

01:36:12.495 --> 01:36:14.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
By November 2013,

01:36:14.539 --> 01:36:17.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
all imprisoned brothers had been released.

01:36:18.710 --> 01:36:21.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, more than 11,000 publishers

01:36:21.421 --> 01:36:25.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 2,480 pioneers

01:36:25.592 --> 01:36:28.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
serve in Armenia.

01:36:28.053 --> 01:36:31.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
They preach in seven languages,

01:36:31.598 --> 01:36:34.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Persian, Kurdish Kurmanji,

01:36:34.142 --> 01:36:38.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hindi, and Russian Sign Language.

01:36:38.229 --> 01:36:42.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
On December 7, 1988,

01:36:42.025 --> 01:36:46.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
an earthquake devastated
Armenia’s northern region.

01:36:46.655 --> 01:36:50.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
It claimed some 25,000 lives

01:36:50.283 --> 01:36:53.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and left half a million people homeless.

01:36:53.745 --> 01:36:57.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
The quake destroyed the town of Spitak,

01:36:57.415 --> 01:36:59.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
which has since recovered,

01:36:59.459 --> 01:37:03.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
though some evidence of the quake remains.

01:37:03.254 --> 01:37:05.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through it all, our brothers

01:37:05.298 --> 01:37:08.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sisters continued diligently
to share the good news.

01:37:10.053 --> 01:37:12.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 44 publishers

01:37:12.222 --> 01:37:17.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 18 regular pioneers
in the Spitak Congregation

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:20.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
send us their warm love and greetings.

01:37:20.647 --> 01:37:24.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:37:24.484 --> 01:37:27.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
