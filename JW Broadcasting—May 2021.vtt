Welcome, brothers and sisters.

00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:07.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:07.323 --> 00:00:10.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll review who the May 2020 <i>Watchtower</i>

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:13.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
identified as “the king of the north,”

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:15.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll learn how knowing this

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:18.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affects each one of us.

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:21.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll also see
how perseverance helps us

00:00:21.504 --> 00:00:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reach our spiritual goals.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll debut an exciting new series

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:31.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made especially for teenagers.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:38.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for May 2021.

00:00:58.808 --> 00:01:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My theme is “‘The King of the North’
in the Time of the End.”

00:01:03.546 --> 00:01:06.683 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, the Russian government

00:01:06.683 --> 00:01:09.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has persecuted our brothers and sisters

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:11.321 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who live in that country.

00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:15.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve heard reports
about the police invading Kingdom Halls

00:01:15.091 --> 00:01:17.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and breaking up meetings.

00:01:17.393 --> 00:01:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The government has labeled
Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an “extremist group.”

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:27.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has seized our properties
and imprisoned our brothers.

00:01:27.137 --> 00:01:29.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch a brief video

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:31.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reviews some of the trials

00:01:31.274 --> 00:01:34.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people in Russia have faced.

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On April 20, 2017,

00:01:38.548 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court
of the Russian Federation criminalized

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:43.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the activity of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:46.956 --> 00:01:49.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of July 4, 2019,

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:53.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
authorities have progressively
seized 131 of the properties

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:56.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
owned by Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:58.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an additional 60 properties
subject to confiscation.

00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:00.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the seized properties

00:02:00.737 --> 00:02:02.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the former
Russia branch complex in Solnechnoye.

00:02:05.441 --> 00:02:08.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time of filming,
the Russian authorities continue

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their aggressive attack
on Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:14.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As of August 17, 2020,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were 42 Witnesses
who were in pretrial detention

00:02:16.886 --> 00:02:19.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or sentenced to prison,

00:02:19.322 --> 00:02:22.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
32 who were under house arrest,

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:25.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 169 who were not allowed
to leave their hometown.

00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:28.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All have been charged with organizing,

00:02:28.431 --> 00:02:31.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
participating in, or financing the activity

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a so-called “extremist” organization.

00:02:34.771 --> 00:02:38.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At least 380 Witnesses were,
at the time, under investigation

00:02:38.808 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ranging in age from 19 to 89 years old.

00:02:43.713 --> 00:02:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What has this meant
for the individuals affected?

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,

00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:50.520 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on June 3, 2018,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.023 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Brother Sergey Klimov was arrested.

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:55.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Local authorities initiated

00:02:55.992 --> 00:02:57.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
criminal charges against him,

00:02:57.827 --> 00:03:00.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
placing him
in pretrial detention for two months.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This detention was extended seven times,

00:03:04.067 --> 00:03:06.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
separating him from his wife and family

00:03:06.135 --> 00:03:08.304 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for a year and five months,

00:03:08.304 --> 00:03:10.740 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
before he was finally tried and sentenced.

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.110 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On November 5, 2019,

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.547 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he was sentenced to six years in prison.

00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:24.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two of our dear young people in Russia,

00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:27.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Yegor Baranov
and Sister Darya Dulova,

00:03:27.257 --> 00:03:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are courageously facing criminal conviction

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:31.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and potential long-term imprisonment.

00:03:33.196 --> 00:03:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Baranov is only 19 years old.

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the authorities raided her home,
Sister Dulova was only 18 years old.

00:03:43.106 --> 00:03:45.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of the Newsroom on jw.org,

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are informed of updated news events.

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This page includes links to name lists

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Witnesses
currently imprisoned for their faith,

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which can help us include
them specifically in our prayers.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Russia
are resolved to remain loyal to Jehovah

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite any opposition,

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they put their confidence
in him in the assurance

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:07.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is on their side!

00:04:20.276 --> 00:04:22.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shouldn’t surprise us

00:04:22.278 --> 00:04:25.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this powerful government
has been persecuting

00:04:25.581 --> 00:04:29.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our peaceful,
law-abiding brothers and sisters.

00:04:29.585 --> 00:04:31.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:36.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because that government
is fulfilling Bible prophecy!

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:40.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find Daniel chapter 11.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 40, it refers
to what the Bible calls

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:46.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north.”

00:04:46.235 --> 00:04:50.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of that “king,” Daniel 11:41 says:

00:04:50.506 --> 00:04:55.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He will also enter
into the land of the Decoration,

00:04:55.445 --> 00:05:00.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many lands will be made to stumble.”

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Russia and its allies

00:05:03.486 --> 00:05:07.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are filling the role
of the king of the north.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel foretold that this king would enter

00:05:10.293 --> 00:05:12.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the land of the Decoration,”

00:05:12.328 --> 00:05:16.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning that he would interfere
in a significant way

00:05:16.032 --> 00:05:19.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the activities of God’s people.

00:05:19.202 --> 00:05:22.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed in the May 2020 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia and its allies
are not the first political power

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:28.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to act as the king of the north,

00:05:28.745 --> 00:05:32.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they may well be the last.

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:36.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this program, we will do three things:

00:05:36.019 --> 00:05:36.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First,

00:05:36.953 --> 00:05:40.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll briefly trace
the fulfillment of the prophecy

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:44.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:47.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we’ll look at how that prophecy

00:05:47.463 --> 00:05:50.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being fulfilled today.

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:54.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, we’ll discuss
how knowing this information

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:57.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should affect the decisions that we make.

00:05:58.508 --> 00:06:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Herman van Selm,
a helper to the Writing Committee,

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us review
some of the key points of the prophecy

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:09.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:06:10.386 --> 00:06:14.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Herman,
for helping me with this presentation.

00:06:14.057 --> 00:06:16.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a pleasure to be with you, Ken.

00:06:16.793 --> 00:06:19.395 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for inviting me.

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:22.665 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s briefly trace

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:26.369 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how the prophecy has been fulfilled so far.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.772 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The prophecy in Daniel chapter 11 mentions

00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:32.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north”
and “the king of the south.”

00:06:32.608 --> 00:06:35.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why are they described like that?

00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, initially,

00:06:37.213 --> 00:06:41.350 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
these powers were located north and south

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the literal land of Israel,

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:46.022 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
thus the names king of the north

00:06:46.022 --> 00:06:47.356 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and king of the south.

00:06:48.458 --> 00:06:52.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These powers could be viewed as two thrones.

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:55.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over time, those thrones have been occupied

00:06:55.264 --> 00:06:57.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by various political powers

00:06:57.266 --> 00:07:01.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these rival kings compete
for world domination.

00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about Jehovah’s people?

00:07:03.973 --> 00:07:08.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are right at the center
of this conflict.

00:07:09.312 --> 00:07:12.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s start at the beginning.

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ken,

00:07:13.316 --> 00:07:17.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is the origin
of the kings of the north and of the south?

00:07:18.788 --> 00:07:21.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The kings of the north and of the south

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
both rose from the empire

00:07:23.593 --> 00:07:26.696 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
established by Alexander the Great.

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:29.132 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One line of kings ruled over Egypt,

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:31.267 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which is south of Israel.

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.769 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And that dynasty was the first

00:07:33.769 --> 00:07:37.340 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to fill the role of king of the south.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.976 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
During this period, another line of kings

00:07:39.976 --> 00:07:42.845 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
ruled an area north of Israel

00:07:42.845 --> 00:07:45.081 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and those kings filled the role

00:07:45.081 --> 00:07:47.083 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of king of the north.

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:50.453 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Then the Roman Empire took over

00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:52.788 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
as king of the north.

00:07:53.856 --> 00:07:57.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed in the May 2020 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:07:57.093 --> 00:07:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s people are the focal point

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:03.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the prophecy
recorded in Daniel chapter 11.

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The angel who spoke with Daniel
said that the prophecy

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:12.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would help him
“understand what will befall your people”

00:08:12.008 --> 00:08:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, the nation of Israel.

00:08:16.812 --> 00:08:19.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what, in fact, happened?

00:08:19.182 --> 00:08:24.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Jewish nation
was God’s people until 33 C.E.

00:08:24.153 --> 00:08:26.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after that, a change occurred.

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:29.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah poured out his holy spirit

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:30.593 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on Christ’s followers.

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.261 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And from then on,

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.664 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the congregation of true Christians

00:08:34.664 --> 00:08:36.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became God’s people.

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:16 refers to them

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the Israel of God.”

00:08:45.274 --> 00:08:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That point is significant

00:08:47.877 --> 00:08:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the kings of the north and south
can only be identified

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when there is a clearly defined group
of God’s people on earth.

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is that the case?

00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:02.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because, as we just considered,

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the angel had told Daniel

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the prophecy centers on God’s people.

00:09:08.564 --> 00:09:11.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the second century C.E.,

00:09:11.367 --> 00:09:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true Christians were overgrown

00:09:14.303 --> 00:09:17.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by weedlike false Christians.

00:09:17.273 --> 00:09:19.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his illustration
of the wheat and the weeds,

00:09:19.809 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus foretold that this would happen.

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:24.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That illustration is recorded

00:09:24.847 --> 00:09:29.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 13:36-43.

00:09:29.418 --> 00:09:33.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from the second century onward,

00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:37.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can no longer identify
an organized group of true Christians.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, as we considered, for that same reason,

00:09:40.263 --> 00:09:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also cannot identify

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:45.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north
and the king of the south.

00:09:45.568 --> 00:09:50.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the 1870’s, a group of Bible students

00:09:50.072 --> 00:09:53.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began to separate itself
from false Christians.

00:09:53.476 --> 00:09:54.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This group,

00:09:54.744 --> 00:09:57.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which included Charles T. Russell,

00:09:57.146 --> 00:09:58.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rejected teachings

00:09:58.781 --> 00:10:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were not based on the Bible.

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:03.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the first-century Christians,

00:10:03.953 --> 00:10:05.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they promoted the truths

00:10:05.955 --> 00:10:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught in God’s Word.

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:11.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now this group underwent a development

00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:15.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is foretold at Malachi 3:1.

00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:18.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the “messenger”

00:10:18.134 --> 00:10:21.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would “clear up a way” before Jehovah.

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as events that followed prove,

00:10:24.907 --> 00:10:28.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this group clearly had God’s backing.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So from the 1870’s onward,

00:10:30.646 --> 00:10:34.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when true Christians began
to organize themselves as a group,

00:10:34.917 --> 00:10:38.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can again identify the political powers

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that fill the roles of the king of the north

00:10:41.324 --> 00:10:43.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and king of the south.

00:10:43.526 --> 00:10:46.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that time in history,

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:49.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Britain was the dominant political force

00:10:49.932 --> 00:10:51.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it filled the role

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the south.

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:57.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amazingly, it was also in the 1870’s

00:10:57.807 --> 00:11:00.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the German Empire emerged

00:11:00.176 --> 00:11:02.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and soon began to challenge Britain

00:11:02.478 --> 00:11:04.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for world domination.

00:11:04.513 --> 00:11:07.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This political power now filled the role

00:11:07.783 --> 00:11:09.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north.

00:11:09.919 --> 00:11:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 11:25, 26 indicate

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:17.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the two kings would clash

00:11:17.126 --> 00:11:21.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the king of the north
would lose many soldiers in the battle.

00:11:21.497 --> 00:11:25.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is exactly what happened

00:11:25.267 --> 00:11:26.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during World War I.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was during that war

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:31.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Britain and its close ally,

00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:33.342 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the United States,

00:11:33.342 --> 00:11:35.911 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
forged a special bond.

00:11:35.911 --> 00:11:38.147 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So from this point on,

00:11:38.147 --> 00:11:39.949 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
during these last days,

00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:42.218 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Anglo-American power

00:11:42.218 --> 00:11:44.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has been the king of the south.

00:11:45.888 --> 00:11:48.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That brings us to our second point:

00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:52.762 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How has Daniel chapter 11 been fulfilled

00:11:52.762 --> 00:11:54.997 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from that time onward

00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:57.199 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
until recent times?

00:11:57.199 --> 00:11:59.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During World War I,

00:11:59.368 --> 00:12:02.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north
and the king of the south

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:07.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecuted those of God’s people
who refused to fight in the war.

00:12:07.743 --> 00:12:10.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The king of the south even threw into jail

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who were taking the lead
in the preaching work.

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:17.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s take a closer look
at the king of the north.

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has the political power filling that role

00:12:20.489 --> 00:12:23.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
changed during the last days?

00:12:23.259 --> 00:12:26.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how has it treated God’s people?

00:12:26.862 --> 00:12:29.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The identity of the king of the north

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:32.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has changed three times during the last days.

00:12:32.902 --> 00:12:37.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting in the 1870’s
through to the end of the second world war,

00:12:37.673 --> 00:12:39.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the German Empire

00:12:39.675 --> 00:12:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filled the role of the king of the north.

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:47.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the period leading up to
and including World War II,

00:12:47.116 --> 00:12:50.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it persecuted God’s people without mercy,

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning thousands of our brothers

00:12:53.823 --> 00:12:56.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and killing hundreds of them.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:00.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who replaced the German Empire
as the king of the north?

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.799 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That’s an important question, Herman.

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:05.401 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After World War II,

00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:08.037 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union took on that role.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:10.506 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It also attacked God’s people,

00:13:10.506 --> 00:13:14.276 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning them or sending them into exile.

00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:18.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, Ken, Daniel 11:34 says

00:13:18.681 --> 00:13:21.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they—that is, God’s people—

00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:24.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be “given a little help.”

00:13:24.587 --> 00:13:27.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the significance of that statement?

00:13:27.356 --> 00:13:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This passage points forward to the time

00:13:30.159 --> 00:13:33.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the Soviet Union collapsed.

00:13:33.028 --> 00:13:36.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although God’s people suffered terribly
under that government,

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were “given a little help.”

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:41.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what way?

00:13:41.737 --> 00:13:44.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the USSR collapsed,

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s people there could worship freely
for a number of years.

00:13:48.777 --> 00:13:51.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, though, Russia and its allies

00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:55.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took on the role of the king of the north.

00:13:55.684 --> 00:13:59.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like the other powers
that filled the role of king of the north,

00:13:59.822 --> 00:14:04.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this government has continued to oppress
God’s people.

00:14:04.627 --> 00:14:07.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the following video

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:09.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that outlines what has happened.

00:14:14.770 --> 00:14:16.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel received a prophecy

00:14:16.772 --> 00:14:18.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the coming of two rivals:

00:14:18.774 --> 00:14:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the king of the north”

00:14:20.643 --> 00:14:23.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “the king of the south.”

00:14:23.045 --> 00:14:25.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has it been fulfilled?

00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:34.823 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the late 1800’s, the German Empire

00:14:34.823 --> 00:14:36.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:14:36.859 --> 00:14:38.327 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That government brought

00:14:38.327 --> 00:14:39.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
its “power and . . . heart

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:40.963 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“against the king of the south

00:14:40.963 --> 00:14:43.532 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with a large army.”

00:14:43.532 --> 00:14:45.734 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, its navy was

00:14:45.734 --> 00:14:48.203 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the second largest on earth.

00:14:50.072 --> 00:14:53.208 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Who became the king of the south?

00:14:53.208 --> 00:14:55.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The alliance between Britain

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.413 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the United States.

00:14:57.413 --> 00:14:59.415 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He fought during World War I

00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:01.417 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“with an exceedingly large

00:15:01.417 --> 00:15:03.319 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and mighty army.”

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:05.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He “swept away” and “humbled”

00:15:05.721 --> 00:15:07.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the king of the north.

00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:10.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But that was not the end

00:15:10.492 --> 00:15:12.595 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the king of the north.

00:15:12.595 --> 00:15:14.730 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He turned his attention to and then hurled

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.733 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“denunciations against the holy covenant.”

00:15:19.335 --> 00:15:21.604 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He removed “the constant feature”

00:15:21.604 --> 00:15:23.606 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by limiting the freedom of God’s people

00:15:23.606 --> 00:15:26.408 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to preach,

00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:28.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
imprisoning many,

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:30.679 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and even killing hundreds

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:31.914 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of God’s anointed ones

00:15:31.914 --> 00:15:33.916 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and their fellow workers.

00:15:36.018 --> 00:15:38.520 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After Germany was defeated in World War II,

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.556 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet Union

00:15:40.556 --> 00:15:42.625 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
became the king of the north.

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.627 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It worked with the king of the south

00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:47.029 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to “put in place the disgusting thing

00:15:47.029 --> 00:15:49.531 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that causes desolation”

00:15:49.531 --> 00:15:51.734 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the United Nations.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.812 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Beginning in the early 1900’s,

00:16:03.812 --> 00:16:06.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Soviet government tried to eliminate

00:16:06.115 --> 00:16:08.751 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
religion in the lands under its control,

00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:11.887 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fulfilling the words

00:16:11.887 --> 00:16:13.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that he would “show no regard

00:16:13.455 --> 00:16:15.658 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for the God of his fathers.”

00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:22.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He gave glory, not to the God of heaven,

00:16:22.564 --> 00:16:25.434 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but “to the god of fortresses.”

00:16:26.468 --> 00:16:28.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As prophesied,

00:16:28.070 --> 00:16:29.905 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
he used this military might

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:31.440 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
against the king of the south

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:35.010 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by engaging “with him in a pushing.”

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.078 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Anglo-America competed

00:16:36.078 --> 00:16:37.179 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with the Soviet Union

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.148 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for world domination,

00:16:39.148 --> 00:16:41.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fighting in and supporting wars

00:16:41.283 --> 00:16:43.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and political struggles around the globe.

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:51.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991,

00:16:51.994 --> 00:16:54.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was unclear who would fill the role
of the king of the north.

00:16:55.664 --> 00:16:57.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a time, God’s people there

00:16:57.733 --> 00:17:00.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been able to preach
and worship peacefully.

00:17:01.637 --> 00:17:04.673 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But in recent years, Russia and its allies

00:17:04.673 --> 00:17:07.609 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have pushed back at the king of the south.

00:17:07.609 --> 00:17:09.611 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Both kings have accused each other

00:17:09.611 --> 00:17:12.781 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of destructive cyber and economic attacks.

00:17:13.649 --> 00:17:16.051 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But the king of the north has not limited

00:17:16.051 --> 00:17:18.387 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
his attacks to the king of the south.

00:17:18.387 --> 00:17:20.456 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As foretold, he also entered

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:23.859 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“into the land of the Decoration”

00:17:23.859 --> 00:17:26.061 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—our realm of spiritual activity.

00:17:27.496 --> 00:17:29.565 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, Russian authorities continue

00:17:29.565 --> 00:17:31.800 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to attack true worship.

00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:36.672 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We expect such persecution,

00:17:36.672 --> 00:17:40.042 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but we also expect it to end.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:00.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our King, Jesus Christ,

00:18:00.395 --> 00:18:03.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is more powerful than any human government.

00:18:05.868 --> 00:18:10.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon he will destroy
not only the kings of the north and the south

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but all of his enemies,

00:18:13.442 --> 00:18:17.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will deliver God’s loyal people.

00:18:47.009 --> 00:18:51.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a powerful and touching video!

00:18:51.547 --> 00:18:55.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are our brothers and sisters coping
with the current persecution?

00:18:55.818 --> 00:18:57.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look.

00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what you’re going to see
will break your heart

00:19:01.924 --> 00:19:04.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also strengthen your faith.

00:19:06.862 --> 00:19:08.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 6:00 a.m.,

00:19:08.864 --> 00:19:10.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my husband and I were woken up

00:19:10.866 --> 00:19:13.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a loud bang on the door.

00:19:13.202 --> 00:19:15.270 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As soon as my husband had opened the door,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:17.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
people burst in shouting,

00:19:17.339 --> 00:19:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Everyone on the floor!”

00:19:19.208 --> 00:19:21.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw them taking my husband into the kitchen

00:19:21.877 --> 00:19:23.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and heard them

00:19:23.445 --> 00:19:25.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very aggressively
ordering him to do something.

00:19:25.447 --> 00:19:27.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I heard some noise, and I realized

00:19:27.850 --> 00:19:30.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was being beaten.

00:19:30.385 --> 00:19:32.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My husband, Feliks, and I

00:19:32.554 --> 00:19:35.357 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were on our way back from the shopping mall

00:19:35.357 --> 00:19:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the car park.

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:38.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A jeep with tinted windows

00:19:38.293 --> 00:19:40.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
blocked our path, and people

00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with weapons
jumped out, shouting:

00:19:42.164 --> 00:19:44.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On the ground!
Don’t move!”

00:19:45.234 --> 00:19:47.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were thrown against the vehicle.

00:19:47.636 --> 00:19:50.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks was sent
to a pretrial detention facility,

00:19:50.672 --> 00:19:52.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he spent a year.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:57.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the very first bang on the door,

00:19:57.012 --> 00:20:01.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began praying to Jehovah
for wisdom, calmness,

00:20:01.316 --> 00:20:04.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for holy spirit
so that I could make the right decisions

00:20:04.186 --> 00:20:05.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and act in the right way.

00:20:05.454 --> 00:20:07.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for the whole day, I was praying.

00:20:07.623 --> 00:20:09.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah answered all my prayers,

00:20:09.591 --> 00:20:12.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt that he was close at my side.

00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:19.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before each court hearing
when I was very afraid

00:20:19.201 --> 00:20:22.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and felt overwhelmed by emotion
and couldn’t calm myself down,

00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:24.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was prayer

00:20:24.873 --> 00:20:26.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helped me to settle down.

00:20:28.243 --> 00:20:30.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they took us for interrogation,

00:20:30.946 --> 00:20:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started panicking and, at that moment,

00:20:34.216 --> 00:20:37.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I needed
to meditate on something positive.

00:20:37.185 --> 00:20:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought,

00:20:39.221 --> 00:20:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I need to sing our songs.’

00:20:41.223 --> 00:20:44.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just one song came into my mind:

00:20:44.626 --> 00:20:46.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Will Make You Strong.”

00:20:46.628 --> 00:20:48.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really strengthened me.

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:51.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words
about how Jehovah gave his Son for us

00:20:51.867 --> 00:20:54.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
show he loves us and will never leave us.

00:20:56.872 --> 00:20:58.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters

00:20:58.907 --> 00:21:01.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray and tell me

00:21:01.243 --> 00:21:03.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they are praying for me.

00:21:03.378 --> 00:21:05.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives me the feeling that I am part

00:21:05.814 --> 00:21:07.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a large family.

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the interrogation,

00:21:12.087 --> 00:21:13.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was sent home.

00:21:13.822 --> 00:21:15.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband and I

00:21:15.757 --> 00:21:18.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to stick to our spiritual routine.

00:21:19.428 --> 00:21:23.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We continue to conduct family worship,
and we are always in the ministry.

00:21:24.266 --> 00:21:27.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
constantly support us.

00:21:27.836 --> 00:21:29.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They write kind words;

00:21:29.438 --> 00:21:32.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they commend us;

00:21:32.407 --> 00:21:34.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they send us
encouraging scriptures from the Bible.

00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:40.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In September 2019, Feliks was found guilty

00:21:40.949 --> 00:21:43.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sentenced to three years
in a general regime colony.

00:21:45.988 --> 00:21:48.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he and the other brothers arrived there,

00:21:48.924 --> 00:21:50.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were beaten up by officers
from the colony.

00:21:54.329 --> 00:21:55.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks told me

00:21:55.664 --> 00:21:57.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he prayed
while he was being beaten,

00:21:59.267 --> 00:22:02.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he noticed that at that moment,
he stopped feeling the pain.

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:08.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While he is behind bars,

00:22:08.443 --> 00:22:11.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feliks tries to conduct
family worship with me by letters.

00:22:13.248 --> 00:22:16.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He picks certain themes
and some specific questions.

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:19.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I do research

00:22:19.187 --> 00:22:21.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the publications
and send back what I find.

00:22:24.459 --> 00:22:27.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture at Isaiah chapter 30
really strengthens me,

00:22:27.629 --> 00:22:30.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says that “your strength will be

00:22:30.932 --> 00:22:33.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in keeping calm and showing trust.”

00:22:34.336 --> 00:22:36.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although I tend to worry,

00:22:37.739 --> 00:22:40.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that calmness is expressed

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:42.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by fully trusting in Jehovah.

00:22:44.613 --> 00:22:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have become stronger
because thanks to Jehovah,

00:22:47.749 --> 00:22:51.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way, I have developed almost a shell

00:22:51.486 --> 00:22:53.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against the difficulties

00:22:53.488 --> 00:22:54.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that used to scare me.

00:22:54.523 --> 00:22:56.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That confidence and faith help me.

00:22:56.558 --> 00:22:58.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with me,

00:22:58.627 --> 00:23:00.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will remain

00:23:00.162 --> 00:23:01.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
close by me,

00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:03.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will be made stronger thanks to him,

00:23:03.865 --> 00:23:07.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will get through these trials.

00:23:10.439 --> 00:23:13.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we develop courage

00:23:13.275 --> 00:23:16.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like our brothers and sisters in Russia?

00:23:16.445 --> 00:23:19.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we must be convinced

00:23:19.714 --> 00:23:24.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the prophecies in the Bible
are trustworthy.

00:23:24.219 --> 00:23:26.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a topic discussed

00:23:26.254 --> 00:23:29.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother David Splane of the Governing Body

00:23:29.057 --> 00:23:32.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the following Morning Worship program.

00:23:33.628 --> 00:23:35.063 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you’d just

00:23:35.063 --> 00:23:37.099 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
take a look at today’s text,

00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:42.537 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Come and witness

00:23:42.537 --> 00:23:46.808 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the activities of Jehovah”—witness.

00:23:47.642 --> 00:23:49.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, according to a dictionary,

00:23:49.644 --> 00:23:54.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a witness is someone
who has personal knowledge of something.

00:23:54.449 --> 00:23:58.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can we be Witnesses of Jehovah?

00:23:58.653 --> 00:24:01.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What personal knowledge

00:24:01.356 --> 00:24:04.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we have of his activities?

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:08.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, first of all,
we can testify to the fact

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can see into the future.

00:24:10.732 --> 00:24:14.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he does that,
he is right 100 percent of the time.

00:24:14.503 --> 00:24:18.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second, we know that no one can prevent

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:21.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah foresees from coming true.

00:24:21.243 --> 00:24:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of Jehovah’s prophecies come true.

00:24:25.814 --> 00:24:28.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, to illustrate the first point,

00:24:28.316 --> 00:24:30.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah can see into the future,

00:24:30.519 --> 00:24:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider two remarkable prophecies

00:24:33.989 --> 00:24:38.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
concerning the destruction
of Jerusalem and its temple.

00:24:38.994 --> 00:24:42.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we know that
through the prophet Jeremiah,

00:24:42.197 --> 00:24:45.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah foretold
that Jerusalem and the temple

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be destroyed by the Babylonians.

00:24:47.202 --> 00:24:49.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it come true?

00:24:49.237 --> 00:24:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely—in 607 B.C.E.

00:24:53.008 --> 00:24:55.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah went further.

00:24:55.143 --> 00:24:58.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that Jerusalem would be rebuilt.

00:24:58.847 --> 00:25:02.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will rebuild the ancient ruins;

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:05.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they will raise up
the desolated places of the past,

00:25:05.654 --> 00:25:09.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will restore the devastated cities.”

00:25:09.824 --> 00:25:13.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And true worship would also be restored.

00:25:13.361 --> 00:25:16.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was quite a level of knowledge.

00:25:16.464 --> 00:25:18.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there’s more.

00:25:18.466 --> 00:25:20.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah went further.

00:25:20.502 --> 00:25:22.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also indicated

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:26.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the spiritual revival wouldn’t last.

00:25:26.508 --> 00:25:28.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is remarkable.

00:25:28.743 --> 00:25:31.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s implied by what we read
in the second part

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Daniel 9:26.

00:25:34.749 --> 00:25:36.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to have a look at this.

00:25:36.851 --> 00:25:39.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to be reading

00:25:39.754 --> 00:25:42.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two parts of this verse,

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:44.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s quite interesting

00:25:44.092 --> 00:25:47.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Daniel 9:26.

00:25:49.664 --> 00:25:52.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, what’s our objective here?

00:25:52.467 --> 00:25:56.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s to see that Jerusalem and its temple

00:25:56.238 --> 00:26:00.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be destroyed a second time

00:26:00.508 --> 00:26:02.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that true worship would not last.

00:26:02.677 --> 00:26:06.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says in the second part of verse 26:

00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:11.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And the people of a leader who is coming

00:26:11.253 --> 00:26:15.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will destroy the city and the holy place.”

00:26:15.991 --> 00:26:18.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when these words were written,

00:26:18.593 --> 00:26:22.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple
were already in ruins.

00:26:22.097 --> 00:26:24.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah doesn’t say,

00:26:24.199 --> 00:26:27.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Nebuchadnezzar has destroyed
the city and its temple.’

00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:31.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“The people of a leader who is coming.”

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Roman general Titus in 70 C.E.

00:26:35.477 --> 00:26:38.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will destroy the city and the holy place.”

00:26:38.346 --> 00:26:40.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order for that prophecy to be fulfilled,

00:26:40.615 --> 00:26:44.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple
would have to be rebuilt

00:26:44.719 --> 00:26:48.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then destroyed a second time.

00:26:48.356 --> 00:26:53.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that is quite a level of knowledge
—quite a level of information.

00:26:53.161 --> 00:26:55.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what would make this necessary?

00:26:55.897 --> 00:27:00.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why, when the Jews
came back to the Promised Land

00:27:00.902 --> 00:27:04.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were intent
on restoring true worship,

00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:06.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why would this fail?

00:27:06.341 --> 00:27:10.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why would Jerusalem and the temple
be destroyed a second time?

00:27:10.278 --> 00:27:15.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of it is due to what we find
in the first part of verse 26:

00:27:16.418 --> 00:27:19.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Messiah will be cut off.”

00:27:20.889 --> 00:27:25.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah foretold, foresaw,

00:27:25.427 --> 00:27:27.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that when the Messiah came,

00:27:27.696 --> 00:27:30.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Jews would reject him.

00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:32.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would be cut off.

00:27:32.834 --> 00:27:35.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because of that, partly because of that,

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:38.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jerusalem and the temple would be destroyed,

00:27:38.907 --> 00:27:41.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it happens, in 70 C.E.

00:27:41.976 --> 00:27:44.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.

00:27:44.779 --> 00:27:46.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think about that a minute.

00:27:46.981 --> 00:27:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Messiah comes first
and Jerusalem and the temple

00:27:51.353 --> 00:27:54.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are destroyed after that in 70 C.E.

00:27:54.889 --> 00:27:56.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:27:56.958 --> 00:28:01.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means that the Messiah
comes before 70 C.E.

00:28:01.730 --> 00:28:04.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we might ask our Jewish friends,

00:28:04.132 --> 00:28:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why are you still waiting for the Messiah?

00:28:07.369 --> 00:28:11.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
70 C.E. has come and gone.

00:28:11.539 --> 00:28:16.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Messiah came,
and he too proved to be a true prophet.

00:28:16.544 --> 00:28:20.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a remarkable prophecy of Jesus
is found in the Sermon on the Mount.

00:28:20.582 --> 00:28:25.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s have a look at it and consider
the implications of this prophecy.

00:28:25.587 --> 00:28:27.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Matthew chapter 7,

00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verses 22 and 23,

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:37.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an amazing prophecy.

00:28:37.832 --> 00:28:41.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, imagine: At this point, Jesus’ teachings

00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:43.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have not spread beyond Israel.

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:48.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice verses 22 and 23:

00:28:48.276 --> 00:28:51.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Many will say to me on that day:

00:28:51.279 --> 00:28:55.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Lord, Lord,
did we not prophesy in your name,

00:28:55.016 --> 00:28:57.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and expel demons in your name,

00:28:57.152 --> 00:29:00.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and perform many powerful works
in your name?’

00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:03.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And then I will declare to them:
‘I never knew you!

00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:08.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get away from me,
you workers of lawlessness!’”

00:29:08.329 --> 00:29:09.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, isn’t that amazing?

00:29:09.998 --> 00:29:11.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jesus had simply predicted

00:29:11.866 --> 00:29:13.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his teachings would spread
throughout the earth,

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:16.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might say, “Well, there’s
nothing remarkable about that.”

00:29:16.604 --> 00:29:18.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus is saying something different.

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is foretelling

00:29:20.775 --> 00:29:25.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a great apostasy from his teachings.

00:29:25.146 --> 00:29:28.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus is foretelling the birth of Christendom

00:29:28.850 --> 00:29:33.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
300 years before the event.

00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:37.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jesus foresees that many

00:29:37.025 --> 00:29:40.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to turn away from the truth.

00:29:40.161 --> 00:29:42.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by the end of the first century,

00:29:42.096 --> 00:29:45.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that apostasy was already at work, wasn’t it?

00:29:45.133 --> 00:29:47.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were sects

00:29:47.068 --> 00:29:51.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the sect of Nicolaus,
for example, and other sects.

00:29:51.439 --> 00:29:55.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now they’re on the cusp
of the great darkness,

00:29:55.810 --> 00:30:00.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great apostasy, that’s going to set in
from the second century on.

00:30:00.114 --> 00:30:03.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with this in mind, what does Jehovah do?

00:30:03.852 --> 00:30:07.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He makes an amazing statement

00:30:07.822 --> 00:30:10.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Revelation 14—

00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:15.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘144,00 will be on Mount Zion with the Lamb.’

00:30:15.597 --> 00:30:20.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were nowhere near 144,000
in the truth in the first century.

00:30:20.168 --> 00:30:25.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here Jehovah is saying
there are going to be 144,000 in heaven

00:30:25.039 --> 00:30:27.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the Lamb at the end.

00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:29.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But not only that, he goes further.

00:30:29.310 --> 00:30:32.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s going to be
a ‘great crowd that no man can number.’

00:30:32.814 --> 00:30:35.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could that ever come true?

00:30:35.183 --> 00:30:38.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ours is the God of true prophecy.

00:30:38.987 --> 00:30:41.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s prophecy.

00:30:41.422 --> 00:30:43.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the second point?

00:30:43.658 --> 00:30:47.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is that no one
can prevent prophecy from being fulfilled.

00:30:47.662 --> 00:30:50.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Devil would love
to prevent that from taking place.

00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:52.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about Revelation 14.

00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:55.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the Devil could make the number

00:30:55.603 --> 00:30:58.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one short of 144,000,

00:30:58.373 --> 00:31:01.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d be happy because he would show

00:31:01.175 --> 00:31:05.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was inaccurate
in what he foretold.

00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:07.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s one
of the reasons why the Devil

00:31:07.115 --> 00:31:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has made war on the remnant
of the seed of the woman,

00:31:11.819 --> 00:31:14.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if at all possible, to prevent that number

00:31:14.822 --> 00:31:18.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 144,000 from coming to pass.

00:31:18.660 --> 00:31:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, he’s going to fail.

00:31:21.529 --> 00:31:24.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about the prophecy in the Bible

00:31:24.065 --> 00:31:29.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that America and Britain
would become a dual world power?

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Britain wouldn’t become a world power

00:31:31.539 --> 00:31:33.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at all if France
had anything to say about it.

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:36.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France and Britain were sworn enemies.

00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:39.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for many, many, years,

00:31:39.113 --> 00:31:42.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France was much richer
and much more powerful

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:45.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than Britain was.

00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:49.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally,
at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815,

00:31:49.023 --> 00:31:51.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
France had one last chance

00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prevent Britain
from becoming a world power.

00:31:55.229 --> 00:31:57.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And France should have won that battle.

00:31:57.832 --> 00:32:01.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything was stacked against the British.

00:32:01.235 --> 00:32:03.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was a driving rain,

00:32:03.938 --> 00:32:07.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fatal miscalculation
on the part of Napoleon,

00:32:07.842 --> 00:32:11.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a few other factors
that foiled their attempt.

00:32:11.379 --> 00:32:13.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Britain did become a world power.

00:32:13.615 --> 00:32:16.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at the end of the 19th century,

00:32:16.184 --> 00:32:20.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s quite true that the sun
never set on the British Empire.

00:32:21.856 --> 00:32:26.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, America and Britain
were supposed to become a dual world power,

00:32:26.294 --> 00:32:30.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Britain wasn’t the least bit interested
in sharing its power with America.

00:32:30.965 --> 00:32:35.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It tried to prevent America
from separating as a colony.

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:38.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a long war,

00:32:38.606 --> 00:32:41.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there were mistakes made on both sides.

00:32:41.275 --> 00:32:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But finally, America gained
its independence from Britain.

00:32:44.912 --> 00:32:46.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we find?

00:32:46.314 --> 00:32:48.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years after that,

00:32:48.316 --> 00:32:52.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Britain is sharing its power with America.

00:32:52.253 --> 00:32:55.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are a dual world power.

00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:59.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fighters against God will never prevail.

00:32:59.627 --> 00:33:03.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We serve “the God of true prophecy.”

00:33:03.297 --> 00:33:07.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And “what he foretells comes to be.”

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:11.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve discussed,

00:33:11.572 --> 00:33:15.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each detail of the prophecy
recorded at Daniel chapter 11

00:33:15.943 --> 00:33:18.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has come true so far.

00:33:18.312 --> 00:33:20.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must have confidence

00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:23.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the remaining events
described in that prophecy

00:33:23.751 --> 00:33:25.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also come true.

00:33:25.853 --> 00:33:30.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are living in the last days
of the time of the end.

00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:34.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, the nations will fulfill the prophecy

00:33:34.295 --> 00:33:37.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 5:3:

00:33:37.165 --> 00:33:40.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whenever it is that they are saying,

00:33:40.902 --> 00:33:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Peace and security!’

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:47.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“then sudden destruction
is to be instantly on them,

00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:50.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just like birth pains on a pregnant woman,

00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:54.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will by no means escape.”

00:33:54.749 --> 00:33:56.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then “sudden destruction”

00:33:56.984 --> 00:34:00.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes upon all parts of Satan’s system.

00:34:00.655 --> 00:34:03.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see on the screen,

00:34:03.057 --> 00:34:05.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel 12:1 says:

00:34:05.727 --> 00:34:09.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During that time Michael will stand up,

00:34:09.297 --> 00:34:13.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the great prince who is standing
in behalf of your people.

00:34:13.367 --> 00:34:18.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there will occur a time of distress
such as has not occurred

00:34:18.072 --> 00:34:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since there came to be a nation
until that time.

00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:26.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And during that time
your people will escape,

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:30.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everyone who is found written down
in the book.”

00:34:31.252 --> 00:34:34.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That leads us into our third point:

00:34:34.555 --> 00:34:37.325 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How should knowing the information

00:34:37.325 --> 00:34:39.060 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we have just discussed

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.830 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
affect the decisions that we make?

00:34:42.830 --> 00:34:46.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what we have reviewed
is not just interesting history;

00:34:46.801 --> 00:34:49.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a dramatic prelude

00:34:49.203 --> 00:34:52.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what will soon happen here on earth.

00:34:52.707 --> 00:34:56.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given his people this knowledge

00:34:56.110 --> 00:34:58.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can act on it.

00:34:58.112 --> 00:35:00.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It should influence the choices we make.

00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:04.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:35:04.318 --> 00:35:08.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how one young brother makes decisions

00:35:08.122 --> 00:35:12.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on his understanding
of Daniel’s prophecy.

00:35:14.829 --> 00:35:18.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was my best friend, Lucas,

00:35:18.065 --> 00:35:19.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were kids.

00:35:19.734 --> 00:35:21.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was me, Oscar.

00:35:22.737 --> 00:35:25.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew exactly what we wanted to do

00:35:25.106 --> 00:35:27.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we grew up:

00:35:27.108 --> 00:35:28.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneer!

00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:30.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go to Bethel!

00:35:30.077 --> 00:35:31.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Build Kingdom Halls!

00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:34.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We kept those goals.

00:35:34.582 --> 00:35:36.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when graduation came,

00:35:36.617 --> 00:35:39.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were ready.

00:35:44.559 --> 00:35:48.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our little business needed
just a few more accounts.

00:35:48.229 --> 00:35:51.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we’d have enough for us
and to help our families.

00:35:54.202 --> 00:35:55.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally!

00:35:55.236 --> 00:35:58.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Day one of the service year

00:35:59.707 --> 00:36:02.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and two new pioneers!

00:36:04.545 --> 00:36:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where we live, . . .

00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:08.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please don’t call me ever again!

00:36:09.817 --> 00:36:12.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . finding spiritual interest is tough.

00:36:25.566 --> 00:36:27.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We already have cleaners.
Thanks.

00:36:27.235 --> 00:36:30.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finding enough work
was harder than we thought.

00:36:31.806 --> 00:36:34.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few months in,
I was sure

00:36:34.008 --> 00:36:36.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would help
if we just stuck it out.

00:36:37.945 --> 00:36:40.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sorry, Oscar.
Can’t make it today.

00:36:40.314 --> 00:36:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something came up.
Lucas.

00:36:45.119 --> 00:36:48.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What came up
was an opportunity for more money,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:52.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at what cost?

00:36:55.496 --> 00:36:57.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you quitting, or what?

00:36:58.165 --> 00:37:01.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, I’m not quitting.

00:37:01.669 --> 00:37:03.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneering or our business?

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:07.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither, but you know the struggle here.

00:37:07.808 --> 00:37:11.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most brothers can afford
to pioneer for a year, two tops.

00:37:11.445 --> 00:37:14.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, it’s not full-time while I’m training.

00:37:14.515 --> 00:37:17.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a backup plan.

00:37:51.052 --> 00:37:53.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Lucas stopped pioneering?

00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe he’s right.

00:38:04.031 --> 00:38:06.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s just being practical.

00:38:09.103 --> 00:38:13.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, is it wrong to quit
if you think it’s not working?

00:38:15.443 --> 00:38:18.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I struggled with the same question
when I pioneered.

00:38:20.614 --> 00:38:23.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever you decide,

00:38:23.417 --> 00:38:25.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you can tell Jehovah your reason

00:38:25.953 --> 00:38:28.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a clean conscience,

00:38:28.289 --> 00:38:30.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then it’s the right decision for you.

00:38:32.026 --> 00:38:35.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why would I keep going
when it’s so difficult?

00:38:39.767 --> 00:38:42.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Since all these things
are to be dissolved in this way,

00:38:42.603 --> 00:38:45.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“consider what sort of people
you ought to be

00:38:45.072 --> 00:38:48.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in holy acts of conduct
and deeds of godly devotion.”

00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:07.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really is “the last days,”

00:39:07.828 --> 00:39:10.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people need “the good news.”

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:13.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’ll only hear it

00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:17.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we keep up our “deeds of godly devotion”

00:39:17.304 --> 00:39:19.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as best we can.

00:39:22.343 --> 00:39:26.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to endure and only stop pioneering

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if my circumstances left no other choice.

00:39:30.484 --> 00:39:34.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I prayed to see the blessings.

00:39:41.328 --> 00:39:43.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after a while,

00:39:43.364 --> 00:39:46.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned that a little perseverance,

00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:49.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s spirit, can be contagious.

00:39:57.211 --> 00:40:00.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you want to do
when you grow up?

00:40:00.848 --> 00:40:02.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pioneer.

00:40:02.183 --> 00:40:03.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And go to Bethel?

00:40:03.484 --> 00:40:04.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yep!

00:40:04.218 --> 00:40:05.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then maybe build Kingdom Halls.

00:40:05.786 --> 00:40:06.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You in?

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:07.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:40:17.031 --> 00:40:19.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That young brother was trying to figure out

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what to do with his life.

00:40:21.602 --> 00:40:25.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made a good decision
because he allowed Bible prophecy

00:40:25.573 --> 00:40:27.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to influence his thinking.

00:40:27.675 --> 00:40:30.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that teens everywhere

00:40:30.144 --> 00:40:33.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face many challenges, and we feel for you.

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, I was once a teenager,

00:40:36.117 --> 00:40:39.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I can’t even imagine
some of the situations

00:40:39.253 --> 00:40:41.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you find yourselves in.

00:40:41.489 --> 00:40:44.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the Governing Body loves you,

00:40:44.058 --> 00:40:46.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want to help.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’m very happy to announce a new series

00:40:49.396 --> 00:40:52.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“My Teen Life.”

00:40:52.466 --> 00:40:54.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll hear from Witnesses

00:40:54.668 --> 00:40:57.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who share the challenges
they faced in their teens

00:40:57.872 --> 00:41:01.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they overcame them
with Jehovah’s help.

00:41:01.208 --> 00:41:03.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The interviews are candid;

00:41:03.244 --> 00:41:05.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the issues are real.

00:41:05.246 --> 00:41:07.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the first episode.

00:41:16.357 --> 00:41:17.925 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Well, when I was a teenager,

00:41:17.925 --> 00:41:19.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t see any benefit

00:41:19.527 --> 00:41:20.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in talking to my parents

00:41:20.928 --> 00:41:23.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they
liked different things than I liked.

00:41:25.566 --> 00:41:27.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought, ‘Well, what’s the point?’

00:41:27.635 --> 00:41:31.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I also wanted to be an adult.

00:41:31.071 --> 00:41:33.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to feel like an adult
and be treated like an adult.

00:41:33.707 --> 00:41:36.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember when my mom
used to pick me up from school.

00:41:36.577 --> 00:41:38.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wanted to show personal interest in me,

00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:41.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so she’d ask me:
“Oh, how are your friends doing?

00:41:41.148 --> 00:41:42.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How was school today?

00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:43.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have a lot of homework?”

00:41:43.984 --> 00:41:47.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I just thought that she was being nosy.

00:41:47.288 --> 00:41:49.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always had my earphones on.

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:52.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whenever my parents
were trying to talk to me,

00:41:52.226 --> 00:41:56.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was my chance
to just pop them in and ignore them.

00:41:57.898 --> 00:41:59.099 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The way my parents grew up wasn’t

00:41:59.099 --> 00:42:00.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the same way that I grew up.

00:42:00.467 --> 00:42:01.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They grew up in a different country;

00:42:01.969 --> 00:42:04.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spoke a different language;
they grew up in a different time.

00:42:07.007 --> 00:42:11.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re talking to somebody
who doesn’t speak your language natively,

00:42:11.078 --> 00:42:14.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
oftentimes you won’t be able
to explain things from your heart.

00:42:14.114 --> 00:42:15.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so I had that challenge.

00:42:15.783 --> 00:42:19.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wasn’t able to talk directly
to my parents heart to heart.

00:42:19.153 --> 00:42:21.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so there was always this frustration

00:42:21.522 --> 00:42:24.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in trying to really convey how I felt.

00:42:24.258 --> 00:42:28.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt like I
wasn’t really getting through to my parents.

00:42:28.095 --> 00:42:31.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to my first pioneer school,
I learned a lot about Jehovah’s qualities.

00:42:31.699 --> 00:42:35.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of them was
how he was a very approachable Person.

00:42:35.636 --> 00:42:38.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought to myself,
‘Am I an approachable person?’

00:42:40.274 --> 00:42:42.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought about how
I acted in the ministry

00:42:42.443 --> 00:42:45.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then at the meetings and then at home.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:49.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized that at home
I had a lot of things I needed to fix.

00:42:49.483 --> 00:42:51.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like it was two different worlds
I was living in.

00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:54.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One was when I was at school with my peers;

00:42:54.955 --> 00:42:57.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I was understood.

00:42:57.057 --> 00:43:00.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at home,
I kind of just withdrew to myself.

00:43:00.461 --> 00:43:04.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t try to communicate with them
because it didn’t seem worth the effort.

00:43:04.164 --> 00:43:06.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to figure out problems in my own way.

00:43:06.233 --> 00:43:08.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was kind of trial and error.

00:43:11.872 --> 00:43:15.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I developed a lot of bad habits

00:43:15.075 --> 00:43:17.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that today I’m still trying to overcome.

00:43:17.845 --> 00:43:20.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’d been able
to communicate with them more,

00:43:20.748 --> 00:43:23.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I’d been able to connect
with them and ask for their help

00:43:23.817 --> 00:43:26.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and get their support
and have them on my team,

00:43:26.887 --> 00:43:28.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things would have gone a lot better.

00:43:28.922 --> 00:43:31.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I really wish I had.

00:43:31.258 --> 00:43:33.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus, who was a perfect human being

00:43:33.694 --> 00:43:37.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who had perfect judgment,
didn’t make decisions on his own.

00:43:37.364 --> 00:43:39.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always looked to his Father for guidance.

00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:41.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that got me thinking,

00:43:41.268 --> 00:43:42.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, if Jesus did that,

00:43:42.703 --> 00:43:43.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘there has to be something good

00:43:43.771 --> 00:43:45.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in it for me too.’

00:43:45.039 --> 00:43:48.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What really helped me was Colossians 4:6.

00:43:48.242 --> 00:43:51.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew I needed to speak
more graciously in the family.

00:43:52.012 --> 00:43:55.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized
that I was speaking very defensively

00:43:55.849 --> 00:43:58.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I needed
to be more approachable to my parents.

00:43:58.352 --> 00:44:01.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I first tried to talk with them,
of course,

00:44:01.188 --> 00:44:04.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was awkward and I didn’t want to talk
about anything personal

00:44:04.391 --> 00:44:06.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I wasn’t used to it.

00:44:06.627 --> 00:44:09.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thought I could maybe
ask them about themselves

00:44:09.797 --> 00:44:13.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—ask them how their day was
or what they liked from the meetings.

00:44:13.434 --> 00:44:15.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I just tried to show more interest in them

00:44:15.636 --> 00:44:17.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of focusing on myself.

00:44:17.604 --> 00:44:18.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think that’s what got

00:44:18.872 --> 00:44:19.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the conversations going 

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:20.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and got me comfortable

00:44:20.941 --> 00:44:22.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to really talk with them.

00:44:22.242 --> 00:44:26.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so focused on how my parents
weren’t understanding me

00:44:26.246 --> 00:44:29.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I wasn’t really trying
to understand them.

00:44:31.318 --> 00:44:33.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I thought about my parents,

00:44:33.454 --> 00:44:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about how much work
it takes to be a parent.

00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:39.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From when I was a baby, for many years,

00:44:39.793 --> 00:44:42.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were working day and night
to try to care for me.

00:44:42.062 --> 00:44:46.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They never demanded a thank you
or anything from me.

00:44:46.066 --> 00:44:48.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were really self-sacrificing.

00:44:48.302 --> 00:44:52.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I imagined:
‘If I had to work that much for somebody,

00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:56.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘how would I feel if they
didn’t really say thank you?

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Or how would I feel

00:44:58.579 --> 00:45:00.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘if this person whom I worked so hard for

00:45:00.981 --> 00:45:03.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t really view me as their friend?’

00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:06.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later on, as I got older and started

00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:09.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that communication going with my parents,

00:45:09.356 --> 00:45:13.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that taking their advice
and really listening to their opinions

00:45:13.494 --> 00:45:15.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and always letting them know

00:45:15.662 --> 00:45:18.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I’m going to do
and where I’m going to go

00:45:18.499 --> 00:45:21.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a mature thing to do.

00:45:21.301 --> 00:45:22.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heart oftentimes

00:45:22.936 --> 00:45:25.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes the driver’s seat, and it directs us

00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:27.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where it thinks it should go.

00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:30.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And oftentimes it goes
in the wrong direction,

00:45:30.611 --> 00:45:33.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we sometimes get hurt.

00:45:33.313 --> 00:45:35.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we look back and say,
“I wish I hadn’t done that.”

00:45:35.983 --> 00:45:37.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our parents have been there.

00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:42.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What they’re trying to do
for us now is to tell us,

00:45:42.456 --> 00:45:44.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t let your heart
take the driver’s seat.”

00:45:44.691 --> 00:45:47.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I could talk to my teenage self,

00:45:47.227 --> 00:45:51.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would tell myself to see
my mom and dad more like coaches, 

00:45:51.498 --> 00:45:54.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I used to think
they were always trying to criticize me

00:45:54.468 --> 00:45:56.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and point out my faults.

But, really, they’re just trying to help me,

00:45:59.306 --> 00:46:02.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they want me to have a happy life.

00:46:02.376 --> 00:46:05.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really wish I knew that as a teenager.

00:46:05.012 --> 00:46:07.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I’m glad I learned that now.

00:46:27.334 --> 00:46:29.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope that you’ll enjoy and benefit

from future episodes of “My Teen Life.”

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This new series is another way

00:46:35.476 --> 00:46:38.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body prepares Jehovah’s people

00:46:38.345 --> 00:46:40.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cope with today’s challenges

00:46:40.914 --> 00:46:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to be ready for what’s coming.

00:46:44.318 --> 00:46:48.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible prophecy shows that in the near future,

00:46:48.255 --> 00:46:53.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the nations will turn
on all false religions and wipe them out.

00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:57.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, they will launch
a final attack on God’s people.

00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:01.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a mistake that will be!

00:47:01.101 --> 00:47:04.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As discussed in the <i>Pure Worship</i> book,

00:47:04.438 --> 00:47:07.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will respond to that attack

00:47:07.307 --> 00:47:10.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by unleashing his rage on the nations.

00:47:10.911 --> 00:47:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the dust of Armageddon settles,

00:47:13.714 --> 00:47:16.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those with the earthly hope can look forward

00:47:16.216 --> 00:47:20.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a thousand years
of genuine peace and security,

00:47:20.687 --> 00:47:24.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working under the rule of God’s Kingdom.

00:47:24.191 --> 00:47:26.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before that time comes,

00:47:26.693 --> 00:47:30.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will continue to face
trials and opposition,

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:32.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can endure.

00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:34.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many modern-day examples

00:47:34.735 --> 00:47:37.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can imitate right now.

00:47:37.204 --> 00:47:39.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those examples can help all of us

00:47:39.773 --> 00:47:42.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be prepared, to stand firm,

00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:46.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to remain fully united in the faith.

This month’s original song

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:52.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled “One United People”

00:47:52.386 --> 00:47:55.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encourages us to do just that.

00:48:17.077 --> 00:48:30.591 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We watch the storm clouds gather.
We’ve seen the signs before.

00:48:30.591 --> 00:48:43.704 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The wind of persecution
Is no stranger to our door.

00:48:43.704 --> 00:48:56.850 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We will face each test with courage,
With Jehovah standing near.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:49:09.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And ‘no weapon formed against us’
Will give any cause for fear.

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:17.037 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We are
one united people,

We wait with calm assurance
For Jehovah, the Most High—

00:50:10.724 --> 00:50:23.937 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The God of our salvation
Whose love will never die.

00:50:23.937 --> 00:50:37.050 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He will never leave his people,
And his spirit makes us strong.

00:50:37.050 --> 00:50:50.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
No, our enemies won’t break us.
To Jehovah we belong!

00:50:51.965 --> 00:50:58.638 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We are

For Jehovah

00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:24.931 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We stand firm together;
Unafraid we face the crowd.

00:51:24.931 --> 00:51:37.778 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And these hearts that beat within us
We have given to our God.

00:51:39.713 --> 00:51:46.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are

The stirring theme of this year’s convention

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:30.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “Powerful By Faith!”

00:52:30.497 --> 00:52:32.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will learn what faith is,

00:52:32.899 --> 00:52:34.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why it is essential,

00:52:34.935 --> 00:52:37.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can acquire it.

00:52:37.270 --> 00:52:39.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a preview.

00:52:41.508 --> 00:52:45.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be hard to put faith
in something you cannot see.

00:52:46.913 --> 00:52:49.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But real faith is not blind.

00:52:51.418 --> 00:52:53.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Real faith is based on facts,

00:52:54.554 --> 00:52:56.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on realities,

00:52:58.525 --> 00:53:00.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on truth.

00:53:02.729 --> 00:53:04.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gives us courage and strength,

00:53:07.434 --> 00:53:09.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helps us to endure.

00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:15.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When life gets hard, it provides peace.

00:53:15.508 --> 00:53:19.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reminds us of our purpose,

00:53:19.145 --> 00:53:21.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it brings us real joy.

from our brothers and sisters in Belarus.

00:53:57.017 --> 00:54:01.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Belarus is an Eastern European nation
that borders Russia.

00:54:02.222 --> 00:54:04.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s known as

00:54:04.224 --> 00:54:08.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the “blue-eyed” country
because it is dotted

00:54:08.228 --> 00:54:11.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with more than 10,000 lakes.

00:54:11.364 --> 00:54:16.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of Europe’s
most ancient trees, as well as

can be found here.

00:54:22.108 --> 00:54:24.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Castles, some dating

from the 16th century, are popular sites.

00:54:28.181 --> 00:54:31.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Nesvizh Castle.

00:54:31.985 --> 00:54:36.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look up at the ceiling of its chapel,
you’ll see Jehovah’s name

in the form of the Tetragrammaton.

00:54:40.093 --> 00:54:44.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Belarus was part of the Soviet Union,

00:54:44.097 --> 00:54:48.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
faced strong government opposition.

Some of our brothers
were exiled to far-away Siberia.

in Belarus.

00:55:05.085 --> 00:55:07.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a zealous pioneer spirit here.

00:55:07.821 --> 00:55:11.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Twenty percent of the publishers

00:55:11.358 --> 00:55:13.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are in full-time service.

00:55:14.494 --> 00:55:17.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is how our brothers share the good news

in the city of Brest.

They enjoy many aspects

of public witnessing.

00:55:23.536 --> 00:55:28.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are our brothers and sisters

of 74 Bible studies each month.

It helps all of us

to face the future with confidence.

Please enjoy.

00:56:36.876 --> 00:56:39.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

in the house of the great King Nebuchadnezzar.

Be strong, my son.

00:56:53.393 --> 00:56:55.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a new land with new laws.

00:56:55.728 --> 00:56:57.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon they’ll want us to worship their gods.

Jehovah is in Israel.

He had a dream,

00:57:13.480 --> 00:57:14.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no one can tell him what it is.

00:57:14.914 --> 00:57:17.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone is to be executed by dawn.

00:57:17.617 --> 00:57:19.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have until morning.

00:57:19.719 --> 00:57:21.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To do what?

00:57:21.654 --> 00:57:22.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Jerusalem.

00:57:24.624 --> 00:57:26.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They burned down Jehovah’s house!

00:57:27.927 --> 00:57:30.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As long as Jehovah exists,

00:57:30.163 --> 00:57:32.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have hope.

00:57:32.765 --> 00:57:35.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interpretations belong to my God, Jehovah.

00:57:35.401 --> 00:57:38.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows your dream and what it means.

Where is your God?
