We welcome all of you

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:07.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the June 2020 edition
of JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:27.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The 148th class

00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:29.429 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.532 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
graduated on March 14, 2020.

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.001 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This was the exciting culmination

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of five months
of intensive Bible instruction

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the students.

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What parting words of encouragement
would they receive

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:44.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Governing Body and other brothers?

00:00:44.577 --> 00:00:46.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very happy to share with you

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first part of that graduation program.

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:51.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Enjoy!

00:00:53.686 --> 00:00:58.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme of my opening talk
to you dear Gilead students,

00:00:58.691 --> 00:01:00.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and really for all of us,

00:01:00.693 --> 00:01:05.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “Imitate Jesus’ Modesty.”

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:08.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, first we ask,
What is modesty?

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a common definition
found in our publications is

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:16.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘being aware of our own limitations.’

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus, of course, set a perfect example

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in always being aware

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his own limitations.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:28.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Undoubtedly, Jesus was very familiar

00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:32.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah’s thinking on this quality,

00:01:32.192 --> 00:01:36.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as is expressed at Micah 6:8,

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:39.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was written about 700 years
before Jesus came to the earth.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he certainly would have been
familiar with this.

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, if you recall, the question is asked,

00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:48.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What is Jehovah requiring of you?”

00:01:48.541 --> 00:01:50.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then part of the answer is

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:55.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to walk in modesty with your God!”

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:59.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s an exclamation point
after that expression.

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:03.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would not just like to see it in us;

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s requiring it.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:07.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is Jehovah requiring of you?

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew it was not optional,

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:13.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a requirement,
that we be modest in walking with our God.

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:18.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, since Jesus
is our perfect role model,

00:02:18.104 --> 00:02:21.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s discuss four areas

00:02:21.107 --> 00:02:24.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which we can imitate his modesty.

00:02:24.077 --> 00:02:27.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know
that’ll be helpful to you dear students

00:02:27.147 --> 00:02:29.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—really, for all of us.

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:32.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one, Jesus was always aware

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:36.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he had authority limitations.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you remember
the account in Matthew chapter 20,

00:02:41.761 --> 00:02:44.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when James and John tried to use their mother

00:02:44.797 --> 00:02:49.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get some special positions
in the Kingdom for them.

00:02:49.802 --> 00:02:53.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, they had her say to Jesus:

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Give the word that these two sons 
of mine may sit down,

00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:02.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“one at your right hand and one at your left,

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your Kingdom.”

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that?

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was Jesus’ answer?

00:03:07.654 --> 00:03:11.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To sit down
at my right hand and my left

00:03:11.925 --> 00:03:15.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is not mine to give,

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but it belongs to those

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s interesting.

00:03:22.268 --> 00:03:24.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus gave many gifts, didn’t he?

00:03:24.437 --> 00:03:26.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave a lot of wine

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a newly married couple
at their wedding feast.

00:03:28.975 --> 00:03:33.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave the gift of healing 
to thousands, probably.

00:03:33.246 --> 00:03:36.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He fed thousands; he gave them food.

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:40.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave a widow her son back after he died.

00:03:40.153 --> 00:03:43.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jesus knew to give away

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:47.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the second and third
highest positions in the Kingdom

00:03:47.493 --> 00:03:50.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was beyond the scope of his authority.

00:03:50.196 --> 00:03:53.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he acknowledged that very clearly, 
didn’t he?

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s a fine lesson for us, isn’t it?

00:03:55.602 --> 00:03:59.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many things
that are within the scope of our authority,

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:03.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can go ahead
and take the initiative and do those things.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:06.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there are many other things
that are outside the scope of our authority.

00:04:06.412 --> 00:04:08.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you wives,

00:04:08.448 --> 00:04:11.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know there are many things in the family

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:14.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that have to be decided by the husband

00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not within your authority.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:20.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You brothers know there are many decisions

00:04:20.727 --> 00:04:24.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are made in the congregation
that can’t be made by you;

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it must be made by the body of elders.

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all know that in our Bethel department

00:04:29.002 --> 00:04:33.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are many things
that require permission from our overseer.

00:04:33.406 --> 00:04:36.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If some of you brothers here in the class

00:04:36.643 --> 00:04:39.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
end up later serving on Branch Committees,

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:44.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then you’ll need to clearly learn
the parameters of your authority

00:04:44.617 --> 00:04:49.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what you can handle and what really needs 
to be handled by the Branch Committee

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:53.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe even taken
to the Governing Body.

00:04:53.192 --> 00:04:55.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In areas such as the foregoing,

00:04:55.561 --> 00:05:00.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us need to carefully learn
what falls within our authority

00:05:00.233 --> 00:05:03.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what falls outside of our authority.

00:05:03.202 --> 00:05:05.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we’re in doubt,

00:05:05.204 --> 00:05:07.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s better to check, isn’t it?

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:09.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s better to check if we’re in doubt.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t have the attitude

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:14.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s easier to get
forgiveness than permission.

00:05:14.881 --> 00:05:18.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not a good attitude, is it?

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:23.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, another aspect 
of Jesus having authority limitations—

00:05:23.156 --> 00:05:26.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up to John chapter 12,

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here’s an interesting thought
that Jesus made.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 12:49
—he said:

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:39.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I have not spoken

00:05:39.072 --> 00:05:41.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of my own initiative,

00:05:41.941 --> 00:05:44.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the Father who sent me

00:05:44.377 --> 00:05:47.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“has himself given me a commandment

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:51.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what to say and what to speak.”

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you could say according to that

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:57.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus had
speaking-authority limitations, didn’t he?

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:59.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had no authority to go

00:05:59.859 --> 00:06:03.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beyond what his Father had taught him.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:05.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had no authority to teach others things

00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:09.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that originated in his own mind and heart.

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wouldn’t go beyond that.

00:06:11.037 --> 00:06:13.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had authority limitations.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:15.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, even more so,
shouldn’t that be true of us?

00:06:15.842 --> 00:06:20.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have no authority
to give our opinions on matters,

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to make sure when we speak

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:27.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what we say
is solidly based on the Scriptures

00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what’s been provided
by the faithful slave.

00:06:30.323 --> 00:06:35.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s go to our second area
where we can learn modesty from Jesus:

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:40.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always remembered
his lesser importance

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:45.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
compared 
to Jehovah’s much greater importance.

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:49.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How unlike Satan the Devil!

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:54.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you could say he has
not one modest bone in his spirit body,

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:57.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
figuratively speaking, of course

00:06:57.417 --> 00:07:00.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no modesty in Satan the Devil.

00:07:00.753 --> 00:07:05.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus refused to accept titles
that belonged to Jehovah.

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why do you call me good?

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:12.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is good except one, God.”

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:16.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always gave the credit
—the glory—to Jehovah.

00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:20.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “The Son cannot do 
a single thing of his own initiative,

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:23.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but only what he sees the Father doing.”

00:07:23.709 --> 00:07:25.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never boasted.

00:07:25.711 --> 00:07:29.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was always willing
to put Jehovah’s will ahead of his own will.

00:07:29.816 --> 00:07:31.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He made the comment:

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:35.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Father, if it is not possible

00:07:35.354 --> 00:07:38.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for this to pass away unless I drink it,

00:07:38.624 --> 00:07:41.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let your will take place.”

00:07:41.494 --> 00:07:43.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about this:

00:07:43.496 --> 00:07:46.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He never tried to draw attention to himself

00:07:46.132 --> 00:07:49.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of high-sounding vocabulary

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:52.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even by means of his dress and grooming.

00:07:52.038 --> 00:07:56.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, if he would have had
some unusual dress or grooming,

00:07:56.275 --> 00:08:00.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would Judas have needed to kiss him
to identify which one he was?

00:08:00.246 --> 00:08:01.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could’ve said,

00:08:01.581 --> 00:08:04.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one you’re looking for
is the only one in the group

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:07.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wearing a bright purple robe,”

00:08:07.186 --> 00:08:12.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “He’s the only one in the group
that has a handlebar mustache.”

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:14.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wouldn’t have had to kiss him
to identify him.

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you look at the pictures
in our publications

00:08:16.496 --> 00:08:18.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jesus and the Twelve,

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:22.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be hard to describe
which one he was.

00:08:22.935 --> 00:08:27.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He modestly blended in
with all of the others.

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what a fine example for us!

00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:33.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When others try to praise us,
including our Bible students,

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:37.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should modestly redirect that praise

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to where it belongs.

00:08:39.986 --> 00:08:44.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should always give credit to Jehovah
for what we accomplish.

00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:47.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, we accomplish it, 
but we give Jehovah the credit.

00:08:47.994 --> 00:08:50.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 4:7:

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:54.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you have that you did not receive?

00:08:54.767 --> 00:08:57.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, in fact, you did receive it,

00:08:57.503 --> 00:09:01.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do you boast 
as though you did not receive it?”

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:06.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in harmony (or in the same vein)
with that scripture,

00:09:06.245 --> 00:09:08.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we try hard not to boast,

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:11.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remembering Proverbs 27:2:

00:09:11.984 --> 00:09:14.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let someone else praise you,

00:09:14.587 --> 00:09:17.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not your own mouth.”

00:09:17.456 --> 00:09:20.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do our best
to put Jehovah’s preferences

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ahead of our own preferences.

00:09:22.562 --> 00:09:25.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We endeavor not to draw
attention to ourselves

00:09:25.197 --> 00:09:28.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by high-sounding vocabulary

00:09:28.234 --> 00:09:32.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even immodest dress and grooming.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:36.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s go to a third area
where we can learn modesty from Jesus:

00:09:36.642 --> 00:09:38.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew there were some things

00:09:38.978 --> 00:09:42.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was not entitled to know,

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least not at the time.

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:48.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open up to Matthew chapter 24, please.

00:09:48.154 --> 00:09:50.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re familiar with this scripture,

00:09:50.189 --> 00:09:54.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but at Matthew 24:36,
notice Jesus’ words:

00:09:54.293 --> 00:09:59.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Concerning that day
and hour nobody knows,

00:09:59.231 --> 00:10:02.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“neither the angels of the heavens

00:10:02.034 --> 00:10:04.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“nor the Son,

00:10:04.704 --> 00:10:07.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but only the Father.”

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about it, if Jesus was content

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:16.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with having knowledge limitations
concerning confidential things,

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:20.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then even more so
shouldn’t that be the case with us?

00:10:20.953 --> 00:10:25.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should strive very hard
not to ever try to get to know

00:10:25.658 --> 00:10:28.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confidential things
we’re not entitled to know.

00:10:28.594 --> 00:10:32.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we certainly shouldn’t reveal
confidential things.

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a protection it is!

00:10:34.333 --> 00:10:37.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was thinking,
for you dear wives of elders,

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:39.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if someone asked you
about a certain confidential matter,

00:10:39.639 --> 00:10:41.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you know anything about this?”

00:10:41.641 --> 00:10:45.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you know, which you shouldn’t,
it’s very awkward, isn’t it?

00:10:45.511 --> 00:10:47.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You either have to be untruthful

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:51.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you have to reveal that your husband
didn’t keep confidentiality.

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:56.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you don’t know,
as should be the case,

00:10:56.288 --> 00:10:58.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now with a clear conscience

00:10:58.424 --> 00:11:01.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can answer that question
with a resounding no.

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:05.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No, I do not know anything about that.”

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:09.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You dear elders would not try to obtain

00:11:09.335 --> 00:11:11.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confidential information
in the congregation

00:11:11.771 --> 00:11:15.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at Bethel you’re not entitled to know.

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:19.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Jesus,
all of us should be content

00:11:19.045 --> 00:11:21.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to wait for information

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:24.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be revealed to us
at the proper time.

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about it, in some cases,

00:11:26.152 --> 00:11:29.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may mean that we will have to be content

00:11:29.021 --> 00:11:31.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to never know certain things.

00:11:31.957 --> 00:11:34.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s get to our last area,

00:11:34.226 --> 00:11:37.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this fourth area
we can learn modesty from Jesus,

00:11:37.296 --> 00:11:39.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that is:

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:41.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was always aware

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:46.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his need to fully rely on Jehovah.

00:11:46.772 --> 00:11:49.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though he was perfect,

00:11:49.275 --> 00:11:52.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he did not rely on his own strength.

00:11:52.311 --> 00:11:55.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open, please, to Hebrews chapter 5.

00:11:55.247 --> 00:11:59.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a beautiful scripture
about this perfect Son of God

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:01.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what is said about him.

00:12:01.854 --> 00:12:05.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hebrews 5:7:

00:12:05.024 --> 00:12:08.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During his life on earth,

00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:11.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Christ offered up supplications

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and also petitions,

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:17.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and notice] with strong outcries

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:19.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and tears,

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:23.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to the One who was able
to save him out of death,

00:12:23.642 --> 00:12:28.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was favorably heard
for his godly fear.”

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, isn’t that interesting?

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:32.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During his life on earth”

00:12:32.384 --> 00:12:35.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(and it didn’t say
just a few times or one or two times)

00:12:35.087 --> 00:12:38.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—during his life,
he petitioned, and it’s plural.

00:12:38.924 --> 00:12:41.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he gave supplication, again plural.

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:44.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what were the intensities

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:47.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those supplications and petitions?

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:51.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With strong outcries and tears”

00:12:51.804 --> 00:12:55.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he called for help from Jehovah,
and Jehovah heard him.

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:58.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean,
if you think of the word “outcry,”

00:12:58.344 --> 00:13:01.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that means “a cry out loud”
—doesn’t it?—

00:13:01.747 --> 00:13:04.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a strong outcry,

00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:07.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very loud cry out loud.

00:13:07.486 --> 00:13:09.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you add tears to that.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:12.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really indicates the intensity

00:13:12.291 --> 00:13:16.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how he really called
on Jehovah to help him.

00:13:16.228 --> 00:13:18.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an interesting thought, isn’t it?

00:13:18.831 --> 00:13:20.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,

00:13:20.833 --> 00:13:24.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah sent
Jesus’ younger angelic brothers

00:13:24.303 --> 00:13:26.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to come and help him in times of need,

00:13:26.305 --> 00:13:29.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t say:
“Well, I don’t need help.

00:13:29.275 --> 00:13:34.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[pridefully] I’m OK. I’ve got this.”

00:13:34.013 --> 00:13:36.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he knew he needed help.

00:13:36.515 --> 00:13:41.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he graciously accepted it
and appreciated that help.

00:13:41.287 --> 00:13:42.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about this:

00:13:42.855 --> 00:13:45.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even with Jehovah’s help,

00:13:45.124 --> 00:13:49.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was modestly realistic
of what he expected of himself.

00:13:49.261 --> 00:13:50.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever thought about that?

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:54.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,
he was still modestly realistic

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could only accomplish so much.

00:13:56.368 --> 00:13:58.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
during his three-and-a-half-year ministry,

00:13:58.838 --> 00:14:02.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he knew there were only so many
he could reach—only so many people.

00:14:02.541 --> 00:14:04.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, wisely, what did he do?

00:14:04.677 --> 00:14:08.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He modestly trained and entrusted others
to do the preaching work

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even said about them
as recorded at John 14:12

00:14:12.318 --> 00:14:17.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would ‘do works 
<i>greater </i> than his works.’

00:14:17.189 --> 00:14:19.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would reach
a greater number of people,

00:14:19.425 --> 00:14:23.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a greater area,
a greater period of time.

00:14:23.596 --> 00:14:28.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think about this,
if the perfect Son of God

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feared to rely on his own strength,

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should be scared to death to do that.

00:14:34.073 --> 00:14:36.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not rely on our own strength.

00:14:36.809 --> 00:14:39.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never should we pridefully hold back

00:14:39.345 --> 00:14:43.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from supplicating and petitioning Jehovah

00:14:43.115 --> 00:14:47.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with strong outcries and tears.

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:51.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we modestly accept
the help Jehovah provides

00:14:51.223 --> 00:14:53.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through our brothers and sisters.

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:56.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we be modestly realistic

00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:59.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of even what we expect of ourselves.

00:14:59.465 --> 00:15:02.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we imitate Jesus’ modesty,

00:15:02.635 --> 00:15:05.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these four areas we’ve discussed,

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:07.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what a protection it will be!

00:15:07.973 --> 00:15:12.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will protect us
from many snares of the Devil.

00:15:26.492 --> 00:15:28.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we’ll turn our attention

00:15:28.494 --> 00:15:31.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Brother Geoffrey Jackson
of the Governing Body,

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:35.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will develop an intriguing theme.

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His theme is

00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:41.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Accept the Unexpected.”
—Brother Jackson.

00:15:49.615 --> 00:15:53.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Expect the unexpected.

00:15:53.519 --> 00:15:56.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the unexpected
has arrived, hasn’t it?

00:15:56.855 --> 00:16:00.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of us expected
that this graduation program

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:04.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would need to be modified
and changed as it is.

00:16:04.897 --> 00:16:07.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, what have you had to do?

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:12.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve had to accept the unexpected.

00:16:12.004 --> 00:16:14.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s not much you can do.

00:16:14.306 --> 00:16:16.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’d like to commend you students,

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:20.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soon-to-be graduates of this class of Gilead,

00:16:20.045 --> 00:16:22.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you have accepted these changes

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:25.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a fine, positive attitude.

00:16:25.117 --> 00:16:27.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it does highlight to us
—doesn’t it?—

00:16:27.353 --> 00:16:30.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sometimes it can be disappointing

00:16:30.522 --> 00:16:34.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when unexpected things occur.

00:16:34.093 --> 00:16:37.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now soon, you’ll be going
to your assignments,

00:16:37.162 --> 00:16:40.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether back home or to a new assignment.

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:43.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, no doubt, you are going to face

00:16:43.936 --> 00:16:46.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some unexpected things as well.

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:50.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’d just like to discuss
one aspect of this theme.

00:16:50.809 --> 00:16:52.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to take your Bibles

00:16:52.811 --> 00:16:56.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and turn with me to Ecclesiastes chapter 10,

00:16:57.983 --> 00:17:02.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 10:7,

00:17:02.988 --> 00:17:07.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here it describes something
that is unexpected:

00:17:08.827 --> 00:17:12.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have seen servants on horseback

00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:16.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but princes walking
on foot just like servants.”

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:20.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you wouldn’t expect
to see that, would you?

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:23.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how are you going to see that?

00:17:23.509 --> 00:17:26.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, <i>The Watchtower</i>
made a very interesting comment

00:17:26.178 --> 00:17:28.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about this verse that said:

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:31.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Those who have great ability

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:35.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not always receive the recognition.

00:17:35.521 --> 00:17:38.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And those with less ability

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:42.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes receive more honor.”

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:45.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you arrive back full of enthusiasm

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:48.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you’ve enjoyed your Gilead training,

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:51.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no doubt you’re thinking:

00:17:51.336 --> 00:17:54.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m a different person. I’ve changed.’

00:17:54.006 --> 00:17:56.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we hope you have.

00:17:56.909 --> 00:17:59.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you might expect

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:03.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there will be
certain privileges granted to you.

00:18:03.282 --> 00:18:05.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, at the same time,

00:18:05.384 --> 00:18:09.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may see that someone you don’t expect

00:18:09.521 --> 00:18:11.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is given those privileges.

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:16.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may even come up
to you and say: “I’m so surprised!

00:18:16.128 --> 00:18:19.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m shocked they’ve given me this privilege!”

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And outwardly you say, “Hmm,”

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but inwardly you’re saying: “I’m shocked too,

00:18:24.303 --> 00:18:27.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because I’m the one
who is trained at Gilead.

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:31.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surely I should get this privilege.”

00:18:31.376 --> 00:18:33.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you think about it,

00:18:33.579 --> 00:18:36.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember that Jehovah is the one

00:18:36.748 --> 00:18:39.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is backing the work, and at times,

00:18:39.051 --> 00:18:42.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he does the unexpected and, in this case,

00:18:42.421 --> 00:18:46.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives someone we don’t expect a privilege.

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:48.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it for a few moments.

00:18:48.427 --> 00:18:52.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you first came here,
we know and remember your introductions,

00:18:52.998 --> 00:18:55.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and quite a number of you made the comment:

00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:59.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When we received that invitation
to Gilead, we were shocked!

00:18:59.671 --> 00:19:01.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were humbled.

00:19:01.673 --> 00:19:04.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We were amazed, numb all over,

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thinking why we were selected.”

00:19:07.946 --> 00:19:10.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe some of the people
in your congregation and branch

00:19:10.649 --> 00:19:13.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were also saying,
“Why were they accepted?”

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:18.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, maybe
that was an unexpected invitation.

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:21.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here you are about to graduate.

00:19:21.927 --> 00:19:26.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s good to remember
that sometimes others are surprised

00:19:26.231 --> 00:19:28.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about privileges that we’re given.

00:19:28.934 --> 00:19:33.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can help us to accept the unexpected

00:19:33.672 --> 00:19:36.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to others getting privileges?

00:19:36.575 --> 00:19:39.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at two principles
in the Scriptures.

00:19:39.411 --> 00:19:44.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is at Ecclesiastes 6:9,

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:50.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 6:9:

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:53.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Better to enjoy what the eyes see

00:19:53.825 --> 00:19:57.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than to wander after one’s desires.

00:19:57.296 --> 00:20:02.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This too is futility,
a chasing after the wind.”

00:20:02.067 --> 00:20:07.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, in other words, be satisfied
with the privileges you do have.

00:20:07.072 --> 00:20:11.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be looking for other privileges,

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:14.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just not satisfied
with what you’ve already been given.

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:17.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Treasure the privileges you already have.

00:20:17.316 --> 00:20:19.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Included in that is the privilege

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:22.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of coming here to Gilead and being trained.

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:25.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the second principle
we’d like to highlight

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:28.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found in the book of Psalms,

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 119:31, 32:

00:20:35.267 --> 00:20:37.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I cling to your reminders.

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:42.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“O Jehovah, do not let me be disappointed.

00:20:42.107 --> 00:20:45.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will eagerly pursue the way
of your commandments

00:20:45.944 --> 00:20:49.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you make room for it in my heart.”

00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:51.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:53.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be disappointed.

00:20:53.485 --> 00:20:55.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah.

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:57.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in his arrangement.

00:20:57.489 --> 00:21:01.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be that Jehovah is saying to you:

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Look, you’ve already had enough privileges.

00:21:05.397 --> 00:21:07.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You went to Gilead, remember?

00:21:07.666 --> 00:21:11.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Now be happy that I’m letting someone else

00:21:11.837 --> 00:21:14.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have an unexpected privilege.’

00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that can be a test.

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:20.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another thing that will help us
in a situation like that

00:21:20.379 --> 00:21:23.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to remember many
of the accounts in the Scriptures.

00:21:23.415 --> 00:21:26.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of those we like to refer to briefly

00:21:26.885 --> 00:21:30.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that of David killing Goliath.

00:21:30.689 --> 00:21:33.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s think for a few moments.

00:21:33.125 --> 00:21:36.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you were an Israelite soldier

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:40.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before David offered himself
to do this assignment,

00:21:40.999 --> 00:21:43.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would you have expected

00:21:43.368 --> 00:21:47.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take down this giant, Goliath?

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:51.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, probably, first of all,
you would have thought about King Saul

00:21:51.243 --> 00:21:54.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because, after all,
he was head and shoulders taller

00:21:54.379 --> 00:21:59.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the average person
and he was a man experienced in warfare.

00:21:59.117 --> 00:22:01.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you might have expected,

00:22:01.186 --> 00:22:04.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I think King Saul is the one
who will take this on.’

00:22:04.890 --> 00:22:08.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe if you
weren’t thinking of King Saul,

00:22:08.226 --> 00:22:11.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might be thinking of his son Jonathan.

00:22:11.063 --> 00:22:12.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:16.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, remember Jonathan
was a national hero by this time.

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:18.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was the case there at Michmash,

00:22:18.904 --> 00:22:21.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he and his attendant climbed up

00:22:21.473 --> 00:22:26.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and boldly and bravely
appeared before the Philistines.

00:22:26.211 --> 00:22:31.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They killed about 20 of them,
and that was the turning point in the battle.

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:36.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if anyone is going to take on Goliath,
probably you would expect

00:22:36.088 --> 00:22:38.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jonathan would be able to do that.

00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:43.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s just assume
that you were thinking,

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:48.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe the best way to do this
would be with a sling and a stone.’

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:53.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, who would you expect
to actually do this?

00:22:53.171 --> 00:22:56.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Probably Saul and Jonathan.

00:22:56.708 --> 00:22:57.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:22:57.809 --> 00:23:00.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were from the tribe of Benjamin.

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:03.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what do you remember
about the people from Benjamin?

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:06.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were experts with using the sling.

00:23:06.618 --> 00:23:09.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we’re told they could sling a stone

00:23:09.654 --> 00:23:12.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a hairbreadth and would not miss.

00:23:12.758 --> 00:23:15.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in fact, at 1 Chronicles 12:2,

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:20.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says that the brothers of Saul
were experts with the sling.

00:23:21.533 --> 00:23:24.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So not knowing what Jehovah was going to do,

00:23:24.202 --> 00:23:27.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
probably each one of us,
if we were there back then,

00:23:27.172 --> 00:23:31.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have thought that surely
it would be King Saul or maybe Jonathan.

00:23:31.209 --> 00:23:33.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were the most qualified.

00:23:34.346 --> 00:23:37.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why wouldn’t you have expected David?

00:23:37.449 --> 00:23:40.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for a start, David was just a boy.

00:23:40.185 --> 00:23:41.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t a soldier.

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:44.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t have experience in warfare.

00:23:44.256 --> 00:23:46.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, he’d killed a lion and a bear,

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:50.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he really didn’t know
about fighting people in a war.

00:23:50.996 --> 00:23:54.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, he wasn’t impressive in appearance.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:56.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Goliath was shocked

00:23:56.935 --> 00:24:00.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he saw this young man
coming toward him.

00:24:00.372 --> 00:24:05.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third, he wasn’t
from the tribe of Benjamin.

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:09.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, he wasn’t one of these
famous persons who could use the sling.

00:24:09.781 --> 00:24:11.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  made the comment

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:16.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that perhaps because David lived near
where the tribe of Benjamin was,

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:19.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe that’s where he learned
how to use the sling.

00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:21.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the bottom line is

00:24:21.426 --> 00:24:23.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
none of us would have expected

00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:26.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this young man David
would have been used.

00:24:26.498 --> 00:24:30.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was an unexpected event.

00:24:30.235 --> 00:24:35.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, let’s think for a moment
about how others reacted.

00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did King Saul react?

00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:41.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, initially, King Saul was very happy

00:24:41.213 --> 00:24:43.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the fact that David killed Goliath.

00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:45.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened later?

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:48.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That turned into jealousy
—didn’t it?—

00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even into a murderous desire to kill David.

00:24:53.725 --> 00:24:56.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, on the other hand, what about Jonathan?

00:24:56.428 --> 00:25:00.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, Jonathan perhaps
could have been jealous, but he wasn’t.

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:04.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He built a strong relationship
and friendship with David.

00:25:05.804 --> 00:25:09.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can we learn from this account?

00:25:09.207 --> 00:25:12.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, if you come across someone

00:25:12.544 --> 00:25:15.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who gets that ideal privilege

00:25:15.547 --> 00:25:19.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that assignment
that you always secretly have wanted

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:23.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that you
actually modestly think you deserve—

00:25:24.556 --> 00:25:26.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what will you be?

00:25:26.725 --> 00:25:30.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a Saul or a Jonathan?

00:25:30.462 --> 00:25:32.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, brothers and sisters,

00:25:32.898 --> 00:25:36.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s always remember
that Jehovah does the unexpected,

00:25:36.535 --> 00:25:41.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes the unexpected is
giving someone else you don’t expect

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a certain privilege.

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:46.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t stand in the way of Jehovah

00:25:46.111 --> 00:25:49.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he uses someone else
to glorify his name.

00:25:49.314 --> 00:25:53.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, rejoice in the fact
that others are used,

00:25:53.585 --> 00:25:57.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like you are being used,
in an unexpected way.

00:26:02.661 --> 00:26:05.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you very much, Brother Jackson,

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:09.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for living up to our expectations.

00:26:09.234 --> 00:26:12.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You gave, again, an excellent talk.

00:26:12.137 --> 00:26:14.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciate it.

00:26:14.172 --> 00:26:18.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we’re going to get to turn
our attention to Brother James Mantz,

00:26:18.276 --> 00:26:21.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves as a helper
to the Writing Committee,

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:24.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has an interesting theme,

00:26:24.149 --> 00:26:29.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do Privileges Make You Privileged?”

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me say that again.

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:33.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do Privileges Make You Privileged?”
—Brother Mantz.

00:26:34.993 --> 00:26:36.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before coming to Gilead,

00:26:36.995 --> 00:26:41.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of you students enjoyed
many privileges of service.

00:26:41.499 --> 00:26:44.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you served as a regular pioneer,

00:26:44.102 --> 00:26:47.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a special pioneer,
as a construction worker,

00:26:47.606 --> 00:26:49.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as a field missionary.

00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:52.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may have served
in the circuit work or at Bethel,

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:55.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now you’ve enjoyed
the additional privilege

00:26:55.981 --> 00:26:59.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of having five months of intensive training

00:26:59.618 --> 00:27:01.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at Gilead School.

00:27:01.686 --> 00:27:05.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt all of you have appreciated

00:27:05.557 --> 00:27:08.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the fine direction you’ve received.

00:27:08.293 --> 00:27:11.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 28:20 says

00:27:11.663 --> 00:27:15.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “a faithful man
will receive many blessings.”

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt all of you students

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:23.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel richly blessed here
on your graduation day.

00:27:23.008 --> 00:27:25.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very happy for you,

00:27:25.076 --> 00:27:28.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re certainly confident
that there are many more blessings

00:27:28.713 --> 00:27:33.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and privileges that await you
as you go on to your assignments.

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:35.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before you go,

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:38.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d just like to ask one question:

00:27:38.390 --> 00:27:42.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do privileges make you privileged?

00:27:42.727 --> 00:27:46.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We ask this question
because the answer will help you

00:27:46.264 --> 00:27:48.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have a proper view of your Gilead training

00:27:48.967 --> 00:27:52.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also whatever privileges you may receive

00:27:52.570 --> 00:27:54.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you go on to your assignment.

00:27:54.673 --> 00:27:57.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the answer will also help all of us

00:27:57.308 --> 00:28:00.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show modesty and humility

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:04.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whatever assignment
Jehovah sees fit to give us.

00:28:04.883 --> 00:28:08.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do privileges make us privileged?

00:28:08.987 --> 00:28:11.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simple answer is no.

00:28:11.756 --> 00:28:13.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in some languages,

00:28:13.758 --> 00:28:16.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the word “privilege”
can carry the wrong idea.

00:28:16.628 --> 00:28:19.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in English,

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:23.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“privilege” carries the meaning
of entitlement.

00:28:23.034 --> 00:28:25.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may speak of a privileged class

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:29.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people who because of their birth
or because of their wealth

00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:33.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a higher place in society than others.

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:37.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A privilege that we receive
in Jehovah’s organization

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:40.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could even be misunderstood

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:43.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as something given to us
because we’re special

00:28:43.621 --> 00:28:46.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even better than others.

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:49.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The possibility of misunderstanding

00:28:49.961 --> 00:28:52.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is meant by the word “privilege”

00:28:52.230 --> 00:28:55.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is even more pronounced in other languages.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:59.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in Japanese, for many years,

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:04.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we used the word <i>tokken</i>
to translate the word “privilege.”

00:29:04.008 --> 00:29:08.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you look in the dictionary,
that’s the word that you should use.

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:11.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many of us in the Japanese field

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:14.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt a little bit uncomfortable using <i>tokken</i>

00:29:14.753 --> 00:29:19.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that word is formed
by combining two Chinese characters:

00:29:19.758 --> 00:29:22.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>toku</i>  means “special,”

00:29:22.827 --> 00:29:26.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and <i>ken</i>  means “right.”

00:29:26.131 --> 00:29:29.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So literally that would mean

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have a special right
to attend Gilead School.

00:29:32.871 --> 00:29:37.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a special right to serve at Bethel.

00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:41.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that is not the case.

00:29:41.379 --> 00:29:44.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you can imagine our delight

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:48.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we received study article 35

00:29:48.286 --> 00:29:51.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the September 2019 issue
of <i>The Watchtower.</i>

00:29:51.623 --> 00:29:55.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was entitled
“Jehovah Values His Humble Servants.”

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:58.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in a section that was discussing the need

00:29:58.396 --> 00:30:03.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for humility when others
receive privileges of service,

00:30:03.401 --> 00:30:07.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Japanese translators
applied the principle

00:30:07.338 --> 00:30:10.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of meaning-based translation.

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:13.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of using the dictionary meaning

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:16.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and calling the privileges special rights,

00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:19.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they call them <i>hoshinokikai</i>

00:30:19.984 --> 00:30:23.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—opportunities to serve.

00:30:23.454 --> 00:30:25.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were elated.

00:30:25.757 --> 00:30:29.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Privileges are not given as a special right.

00:30:29.460 --> 00:30:32.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, they give us additional opportunities

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:37.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be of service
to Jehovah and to our brothers.

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:40.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So does that mean
we should stop using the word “privilege”?

00:30:40.538 --> 00:30:42.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:45.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we do need
to have a correct understanding

00:30:45.877 --> 00:30:50.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of its meaning in the spiritual setting.

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:52.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way to gain a proper understanding

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:55.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to examine how the word “privilege”

00:30:55.053 --> 00:30:57.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is used in the <i>New World Translation.</i>

00:30:57.655 --> 00:31:01.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Luke 1:43,

00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:04.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elizabeth described a visit from Mary,

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:08.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mother of her Lord, as a “privilege.”

00:31:08.733 --> 00:31:11.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Elizabeth mean
that she had a special right

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:14.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have Mary enter her home?

00:31:14.706 --> 00:31:16.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:31:16.407 --> 00:31:19.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, she viewed the visit

00:31:19.043 --> 00:31:22.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a blessing from Jehovah.

00:31:22.347 --> 00:31:26.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 7:46 speaks of David

00:31:26.618 --> 00:31:29.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asking God “for the privilege of providing

00:31:29.087 --> 00:31:31.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.”

00:31:31.756 --> 00:31:34.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at 2 Corinthians 8:4,

00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:39.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul spoke of Christians
who ‘kept earnestly begging us

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:42.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘for the privilege of having a share

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the relief ministry for the holy ones.’

00:31:45.703 --> 00:31:50.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David and Paul were not talking
about any special right.

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:53.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, they were describing an opportunity

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:57.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work in service to Jehovah
and to their brothers.

00:31:57.882 --> 00:32:00.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s not be misled by the meaning

00:32:00.251 --> 00:32:05.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the world generally attaches
to the word “privilege.”

00:32:05.123 --> 00:32:10.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The direction found
at Luke 17:10 will help us.

00:32:10.128 --> 00:32:12.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to that verse.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:15.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whenever we receive a privilege,

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:18.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or an opportunity to serve,

00:32:18.369 --> 00:32:21.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s remember these words

00:32:21.105 --> 00:32:23.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this counsel of Jesus

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:28.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Luke 17:10.

00:32:28.746 --> 00:32:33.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Likewise, when you
have done all the things assigned to you,

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:36.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“say: ‘We are good-for-nothing slaves.

00:32:36.287 --> 00:32:40.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we have done
is what we ought to have done.’”

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:42.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, this doesn’t mean

00:32:42.894 --> 00:32:47.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should view ourselves
as useless, or worthless.

00:32:47.198 --> 00:32:51.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A note in the <i>Study Bible</i>  explains
that ‘according to the context,

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:54.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘“good-for-nothing” conveys the idea

00:32:54.372 --> 00:32:58.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that the slave would view himself modestly,

00:32:58.376 --> 00:33:03.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as deserving
of some special credit or praise.’

00:33:03.147 --> 00:33:06.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that is how we view ourselves

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:09.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we receive privileges of service.

00:33:09.921 --> 00:33:13.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider
another aspect of privileges.

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:15.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The English dictionary defines privilege

00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:19.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “a right attached specifically

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:22.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a position or office.”

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:26.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, not all privileges of service

00:33:26.170 --> 00:33:30.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involve a specific assignment or a position.

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:36.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The number of positions
in Jehovah’s organization is limited.

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:41.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opportunities to serve are endless.

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:44.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open to Matthew chapter 20;

00:33:44.655 --> 00:33:48.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll read verses 25 to 27

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:51.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because here Jesus clarified the importance

00:33:51.162 --> 00:33:54.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serving over position.

00:33:54.065 --> 00:33:56.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Brother Lett
already explained the setting:

00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:58.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s when the mother of James and John

00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:03.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asked Jesus to give her sons
special positions in the Kingdom.

00:34:03.808 --> 00:34:07.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 25 to 27,

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:10.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is what Jesus said:

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:13.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jesus called them to him and said:

00:34:13.851 --> 00:34:16.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘You know that the rulers of the nations

00:34:16.421 --> 00:34:20.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘lord it over them and the great men
wield authority over them.

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:23.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘This must not be the way among you;

00:34:23.127 --> 00:34:27.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but whoever wants to become great
among you must be your minister,

00:34:27.331 --> 00:34:31.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whoever wants to be first among you
must be your slave.’”

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, instead of seeking
a high position of authority,

00:34:36.641 --> 00:34:41.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christians reach out to minister
to the needs of others

00:34:41.646 --> 00:34:45.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to serve as humble slaves.

00:34:45.049 --> 00:34:49.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, 1 Timothy 3:1

00:34:49.287 --> 00:34:51.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
used to describe a man

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:55.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who “is reaching out
for an office of overseer.”

00:34:55.893 --> 00:34:59.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the revised edition
of <i>The New World Translation</i>  reads:

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:04.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a man is reaching out to be an overseer,

00:35:04.635 --> 00:35:07.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is desirous of a fine work.”

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:11.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This puts the emphasis
not on the office or position

00:35:11.709 --> 00:35:14.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on the qualifications
that are needed by one

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:19.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who exerts himself
to be of service to others.

00:35:19.283 --> 00:35:22.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many opportunities of service

00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:26.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that do not involve
a special appointment or position.

00:35:26.624 --> 00:35:31.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of Bible examples
of hardworking Christian men and women.

00:35:32.430 --> 00:35:37.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dorcas “abounded
in good deeds and gifts of mercy”;

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:40.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joanna, Susanna, and many other women

00:35:40.171 --> 00:35:43.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ministered to Jesus from their belongings;

00:35:43.808 --> 00:35:46.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and while Paul was in prison,

00:35:46.177 --> 00:35:49.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tychicus served as his personal messenger;

00:35:49.714 --> 00:35:52.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark helped Paul in practical ways,

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:54.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps delivering food to him.

00:35:54.585 --> 00:35:56.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you go on to your assignment,

00:35:56.854 --> 00:35:58.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember,

00:35:58.856 --> 00:36:02.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
privileges do not make you privileged

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:07.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whether your privileges come
with an official assignment or not,

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:09.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
humbly carry them out

00:36:09.167 --> 00:36:12.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as opportunities to “slave for Jehovah”

00:36:12.503 --> 00:36:15.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to serve our brothers more fully.

00:36:21.012 --> 00:36:24.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to bring all these Gilead students
on my speaking assignments.

00:36:24.382 --> 00:36:26.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really know how to applaud.

00:36:28.186 --> 00:36:30.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you very much, Brother Mantz,

00:36:30.454 --> 00:36:34.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the “privilege” of hearing that talk.

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:38.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But please be assured 
we’re not going to let that privilege

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:43.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make us feel privileged
in the sense you discussed.

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:45.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, these privileges,
as you mentioned,

00:36:45.436 --> 00:36:49.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are undeserved kindnesses from Jehovah.

00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we turn our attention

00:36:51.242 --> 00:36:56.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Brother James Cauthon,
one of our Gilead instructors.

00:36:56.247 --> 00:37:00.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he spent a lot of time with you dear ones
during the last five months.

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve gotten to know each other quite well,

00:37:02.486 --> 00:37:05.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he’ll only have
one more chance to talk to you.

00:37:05.389 --> 00:37:10.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s going to speak
on the intriguing theme

00:37:10.394 --> 00:37:13.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the Shadows.”

00:37:13.664 --> 00:37:17.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be interested to see
how he develops that.

00:37:19.103 --> 00:37:23.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t the most extraordinary
among the apostles.

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:27.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, he didn’t walk on water.

00:37:27.278 --> 00:37:29.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t receive “the keys of the Kingdom.”

00:37:29.981 --> 00:37:32.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wasn’t one of the “Sons of Thunder.”

00:37:32.850 --> 00:37:35.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t see the transfiguration.

00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:38.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t write a Bible book.

00:37:38.089 --> 00:37:40.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, all together

00:37:40.358 --> 00:37:43.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s only mentioned 12 times
in the Scriptures,

00:37:43.894 --> 00:37:48.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s mostly
when the list of all the apostles is given.

00:37:48.733 --> 00:37:51.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are we talking about?

00:37:51.068 --> 00:37:53.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be Andrew.

00:37:53.904 --> 00:37:57.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See,
Andrew was best known

00:37:57.708 --> 00:38:00.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the brother of Peter.

00:38:00.978 --> 00:38:04.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what he was famous for primarily.

00:38:04.815 --> 00:38:08.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter is mentioned
some 150 times in the Scriptures.

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:13.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it seems that Peter
was always in the limelight,

00:38:13.524 --> 00:38:17.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whereas Andrew
always seemed to be in the shadows.

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:22.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter was extraordinary;
Andrew was ordinary.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:27.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Andrew,
most of us view ourselves

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:30.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as just ordinary.

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:33.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not the valedictorian.

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:35.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not the greatest speaker.

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not “Miss Congeniality.”

00:38:39.016 --> 00:38:42.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just in the shadows.

00:38:42.353 --> 00:38:45.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that how Jehovah sees us?

00:38:45.456 --> 00:38:48.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is that how he saw Andrew?

00:38:49.460 --> 00:38:52.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Andrew the person
for just a minute.

00:38:52.363 --> 00:38:57.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open your Bibles, if you would,
to John chapter 1, please,

00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:59.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John chapter 1.

00:38:59.136 --> 00:39:04.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you begin just following
along with me in verse 35,

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:06.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we see that Andrew

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:09.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a disciple of John the Baptizer.

00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:14.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one day
when he was with John the Baptizer

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:19.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and John said:
“See, the Lamb of God!”

00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:22.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is it that Andrew did immediately?

00:39:22.727 --> 00:39:27.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He immediately left following John

00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:29.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to follow Jesus.

00:39:29.233 --> 00:39:32.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we don’t have a lot of time
for this talk,

00:39:32.002 --> 00:39:34.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what is it—?

00:39:34.004 --> 00:39:38.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jehovah see in Andrew at that point?

00:39:38.376 --> 00:39:43.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have seen
that Andrew wanted to draw close to God

00:39:43.381 --> 00:39:48.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he would be adaptable
and that he would be willing to change

00:39:48.185 --> 00:39:53.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to be able to draw closer to Jehovah
and do his will.

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:57.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah must have loved Andrew
for that attitude.

00:40:00.064 --> 00:40:04.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you follow along in verses 38 and 39,

00:40:04.301 --> 00:40:07.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice that it says:

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:12.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Then Jesus turned,
and saw them following him.’

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:14.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you notice what Jesus said?

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:17.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“What are you looking for?”

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:20.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did Andrew respond to that?

00:40:20.351 --> 00:40:24.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did Andrew say:
‘Well, you know, Lord,

00:40:24.388 --> 00:40:27.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’d like to have a better assignment,

00:40:27.258 --> 00:40:31.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘something that brings a little prestige,
maybe some accolades.

00:40:31.729 --> 00:40:35.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And along with that,
if I had a bigger room,

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:38.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one with a view . . . ’?

00:40:38.502 --> 00:40:40.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he didn’t.

00:40:40.204 --> 00:40:43.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he said was:
‘Lord, where are you staying?’

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:47.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Bible shows us
that Andrew then went with Jesus

00:40:47.978 --> 00:40:50.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stayed with him
till about four o’clock in the afternoon.

00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:55.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that was interesting
because he was really showing

00:40:55.453 --> 00:40:59.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he valued spiritual things
over the mundane things.

00:41:00.391 --> 00:41:03.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then after that time,

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:06.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 40 and 41 say

00:41:06.397 --> 00:41:09.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Andrew ran to find his brother Peter.

00:41:09.667 --> 00:41:11.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said five words

00:41:11.769 --> 00:41:15.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—five words
that would change their lives forever:

00:41:15.239 --> 00:41:18.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have found the Messiah.”

00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:20.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have found the Messiah.”

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:22.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did Andrew know that?

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:26.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Andrew must have been
a man who loved God’s Word.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:28.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have been familiar with it.

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:33.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so in that time that he was with Jesus,

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:36.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could take
what he’d read in the Scriptures

00:41:36.293 --> 00:41:39.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and compare them
with the man in front of him,

00:41:39.063 --> 00:41:41.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he came to that conclusion.

00:41:41.699 --> 00:41:43.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a spiritual man.

00:41:43.968 --> 00:41:46.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loved God’s Word.

00:41:46.003 --> 00:41:48.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as a result of his zeal,

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:52.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he brought his brother Peter to Jesus.

00:41:52.877 --> 00:41:57.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, that’s a little bit
about what we know about Andrew the person.

00:41:57.114 --> 00:41:59.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about Andrew the apostle?

00:41:59.149 --> 00:42:02.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go over to John chapter 6 now,

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:07.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John chapter 6,

00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:11.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll look at verses 40 and 41.

00:42:14.665 --> 00:42:18.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, excuse me, John 6:5-9,

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:21.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and here we see a large crowd of people now

00:42:21.705 --> 00:42:25.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are gathering to see Jesus,
and Jesus wants to feed them.

00:42:25.142 --> 00:42:26.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember the account.

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:31.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so he says to Philip:

00:42:31.081 --> 00:42:33.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You know, I want to feed these people.’

00:42:33.083 --> 00:42:36.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip says:
‘Lord, that’s impossible.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:39.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two hundred denarii wouldn’t feed them all.’

00:42:39.657 --> 00:42:42.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So there were probably
over 5,000 people there.

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:46.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, while he, Philip,
is talking to Jesus,

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:49.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to reason with him,
what is Andrew doing?

00:42:49.333 --> 00:42:51.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew goes through the crowd,

00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:54.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he finds a little boy that has
some fish and some bread,

00:42:54.471 --> 00:42:57.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he brings that little child to Jesus.

00:42:57.474 --> 00:43:01.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Andrew have any idea
what Jesus was going to do?

00:43:01.579 --> 00:43:04.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He couldn’t have known.
There’s no way he could have known.

00:43:06.617 --> 00:43:09.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he must have thought—
He must have seen enough  

00:43:09.954 --> 00:43:13.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know that Jesus could do something,

00:43:13.824 --> 00:43:16.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, of course, he did.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was the lesson?

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:23.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, while Philip saw the problem,
Andrew was looking for a solution.

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:26.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you may notice again that as usual

00:43:26.503 --> 00:43:29.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew is bringing people to Jesus.

00:43:31.675 --> 00:43:33.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as a side point,

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:37.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do you think
that little boy would be talking about

00:43:37.648 --> 00:43:39.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he became my age,

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:42.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yeah, after that miracle he saw?

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:45.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have really been an impactful one.

00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:48.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s go to John chapter 12,

00:43:50.227 --> 00:43:53.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John chapter 12,

00:43:53.497 --> 00:43:56.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look down at verses 20 through 22

00:43:56.433 --> 00:44:00.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now we have a group of Greeks

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:02.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who come to worship at the festival.

00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they approach Philip,
and what do they want to do?

00:44:05.843 --> 00:44:07.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They want to see Jesus.

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:09.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Philip do?

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:11.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip goes to Andrew.

00:44:11.515 --> 00:44:13.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does Andrew do?

00:44:13.017 --> 00:44:16.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew takes Philip,
and they go to Jesus.

00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:19.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, two things.

00:44:19.656 --> 00:44:21.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:

00:44:21.658 --> 00:44:25.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew recognized the channel.

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:27.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t try to circumvent it.

00:44:27.031 --> 00:44:29.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t try to make the decision.

00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:31.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He recognized the channel.

00:44:31.635 --> 00:44:33.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And second,

00:44:33.637 --> 00:44:35.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Andrew was a friend

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:40.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because now he would be a mentor to Philip

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:43.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teach him to go to the channel as well.

00:44:45.149 --> 00:44:49.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Bible doesn’t say much

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Andrew,

00:44:52.856 --> 00:44:56.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can see that Andrew
didn’t think it was all about him.

00:44:56.427 --> 00:44:59.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always had the desire to help others.

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:03.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in this brief discussion,

00:45:03.233 --> 00:45:06.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is there anything really ordinary
about Andrew?

00:45:09.039 --> 00:45:11.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:45:11.875 --> 00:45:16.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while it’s true
that Andrew never walked on water,

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:18.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he never wrote a Bible book,

00:45:18.582 --> 00:45:21.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he also never denied Christ,

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:24.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he never got his mom
to ask for special favors,

00:45:24.288 --> 00:45:27.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was never known
for being a “doubting Andrew,”

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:30.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he never ever was called Satan,

00:45:35.799 --> 00:45:38.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was a force for good
for those around him.

00:45:38.702 --> 00:45:42.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the lessons for the class:

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:45.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be adaptable.

00:45:45.008 --> 00:45:48.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be adaptable to the leanings
of Jehovah’s organization,

00:45:48.812 --> 00:45:51.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if you don’t fully understand them.

00:45:51.682 --> 00:45:53.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two:

00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:57.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t get tripped up by the desire
for the mundane things.

00:45:57.387 --> 00:46:01.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the question
that Jesus asked Andrew:

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:03.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What are you looking for?”

00:46:03.694 --> 00:46:07.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a good reset question for all of us
from time to time.

00:46:07.831 --> 00:46:09.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we looking for?

00:46:09.933 --> 00:46:11.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three:

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:16.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that Jehovah is not limited
in how he can work out problems.

00:46:16.707 --> 00:46:20.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give him the chance to show
what he can do for you,

00:46:20.444 --> 00:46:25.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you may find the answer comes
in some very unexpected ways.

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:29.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, in your assignment,

00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t be quick to pass over
the seemingly ordinary people.

00:46:35.225 --> 00:46:37.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for the “Andrews.”

00:46:37.227 --> 00:46:39.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re in all the congregations.

00:46:39.229 --> 00:46:41.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re in all the Bethels.

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:45.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re like the hidden gems
that are all around us.

00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:50.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acknowledge them;
encourage them;

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:55.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see what they’re contributing,
and say something about it.

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:59.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And those hidden gems
will begin to come out of the shadows,

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:03.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they will shine
in the light of appreciation.

00:47:03.387 --> 00:47:05.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the days to come,

00:47:05.856 --> 00:47:08.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be a steadying force for good.

00:47:08.392 --> 00:47:11.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show loving kindness to all.

00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:16.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Give Jehovah your best,
and give the friends your best,

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:18.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give it with love.

00:47:18.168 --> 00:47:22.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you will never ever be in the shadow

00:47:22.272 --> 00:47:24.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s eyes.

00:47:29.246 --> 00:47:31.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you very much.

00:47:31.682 --> 00:47:35.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciate that talk,
Brother Cauthon,

00:47:35.385 --> 00:47:38.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping us all to be like Andrew.

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:42.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very happy
to serve quietly in the background

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not striving to be in the limelight.

00:47:45.395 --> 00:47:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciate it
—very practical.

00:47:47.931 --> 00:47:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we’re going to turn
our attention to Brother Mark Noumair.

00:47:52.769 --> 00:47:55.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s a helper to the Teaching Committee

00:47:55.072 --> 00:47:57.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also one of our Gilead instructors.

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:59.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You spent a lot of time with him also.

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:02.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he has a booming theme,

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:06.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Will You Thunder for Jehovah?”

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:11.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now from Andrew to John

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:13.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the apostle John;

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:16.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was living at a most critical time

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:19.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the last surviving apostle.

00:48:19.263 --> 00:48:22.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was helping to hold back
a tidal wave of worldly influence

00:48:22.866 --> 00:48:25.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apostate thinking
that was already eroding 

00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:28.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Christian congregation.

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:32.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under divine inspiration,

00:48:32.042 --> 00:48:35.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John wrote
a most vigorous letter to his brothers.

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:40.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can still sense in him
that fiery enthusiasm

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:45.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that earned him his name,
“Son of Thunder.”

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:49.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that letter, the letter
that we’re going to look at right now,

00:48:49.793 --> 00:48:51.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show you

00:48:51.795 --> 00:48:55.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you like John can thunder for Jehovah.

00:48:55.332 --> 00:48:58.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can you do that?
Let’s find out.

00:48:58.268 --> 00:49:01.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to open up now
to 1 John chapter 1.

00:49:01.738 --> 00:49:04.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to read verses 1 and 3,

00:49:04.408 --> 00:49:09.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch how John makes very clear
his objective right from the outset.

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:13.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First John 1:1:

00:49:13.383 --> 00:49:16.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That which was from the beginning,

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:21.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[now, the beginning was Christ Jesus
in his prehuman existence;

00:49:21.291 --> 00:49:23.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he was the firstborn of all creation]

00:49:23.994 --> 00:49:26.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which we have heard,

00:49:26.697 --> 00:49:30.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which we have seen with our eyes,

00:49:30.801 --> 00:49:34.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which we have observed
and our hands have felt [him].”

00:49:34.738 --> 00:49:39.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And notice that John right away wants to grab
the attention of the brothers

00:49:39.343 --> 00:49:42.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to say: ‘Look! We heard him.

00:49:42.546 --> 00:49:45.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘We’ve seen him with our eyes.
We’ve observed him.

00:49:45.148 --> 00:49:46.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve felt him. I touched him.

00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:49.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I laid my head in his chest.’

00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:53.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did John even hear his heartbeat?

00:49:53.991 --> 00:49:58.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the fact is
that these messages were so clear to John,

00:49:58.095 --> 00:50:00.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wanted to make it known.

00:50:00.097 --> 00:50:02.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 3:

00:50:02.132 --> 00:50:06.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That which we have seen and heard,”
again John repeats this.

00:50:06.336 --> 00:50:08.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘His teachings, I saw them—I heard them.

00:50:08.872 --> 00:50:12.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so convinced that God’s powers
are operating through him,’

00:50:12.809 --> 00:50:15.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there in verse 3, John says:

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:19.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are reporting also to you.”

00:50:19.816 --> 00:50:22.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m reporting this to you,’ John said.

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:25.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John had such good reason to thunder.

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:28.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a living link to Christ.

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:32.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers alive at that time
did not have the privilege that John had

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:37.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to walk and to touch
and to be taught by Jesus personally.

00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:41.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But John did,
and he was so moved by these experiences

00:50:41.138 --> 00:50:46.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he wanted to report
these real-life experiences about Christ.

00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:48.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why?

00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:50.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To protect his brothers

00:50:50.113 --> 00:50:54.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to protect his beloved brothers
from the false teachers at that time

00:50:54.518 --> 00:50:58.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were trying to draw them
away from the truth.

00:50:58.188 --> 00:51:00.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, John spoke up against lies

00:51:00.724 --> 00:51:03.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the apostates
and the other false teachers

00:51:03.894 --> 00:51:06.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were spreading in his day.

00:51:06.797 --> 00:51:11.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were telling disgusting lies
about God and Jesus.

00:51:11.635 --> 00:51:16.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They craftily constructed speeches
designed to corrupt the teachings of Christ.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John knew that.
He felt it.

00:51:19.042 --> 00:51:23.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They even claimed to have
secret revelations and superior knowledge.

00:51:23.380 --> 00:51:27.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they boasted that they were
the correctors of the apostles.

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:29.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Liars!

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:32.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And John could not stomach liars.

00:51:32.756 --> 00:51:34.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it is of interest:

00:51:34.291 --> 00:51:38.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out of the 15 times
the Bible used the word “liar,”

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:41.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he used the word eight times.

00:51:41.631 --> 00:51:46.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, John continued to thunder, defend,
and speak out for the truth

00:51:47.604 --> 00:51:51.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he loved the truth,
he loved Christ Jesus,

00:51:51.508 --> 00:51:54.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he loved the Father, Jehovah.

00:51:56.213 --> 00:51:59.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similarly today,

00:51:59.749 --> 00:52:04.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lies and false reports
against the truth abound.

00:52:04.054 --> 00:52:06.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And enemies of the truth use any means

00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:10.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to try to smear
the reputation of Christ’s brothers.

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, what’s the point?

00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:16.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your time here at world headquarters,

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:18.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your time with the Governing Body,

00:52:18.635 --> 00:52:22.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your time with the responsible brothers
from world headquarters

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
convinces you firsthand

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that any negative reports that you hear
about the organization are lies.

00:52:31.281 --> 00:52:33.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now you can thunder for Jehovah

00:52:33.717 --> 00:52:36.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by defending the truth
about those whom Christ appointed

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:39.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take the lead in his organization.

00:52:39.623 --> 00:52:41.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And look what you’ve been able to do.

00:52:41.625 --> 00:52:43.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can say just like John:

00:52:43.093 --> 00:52:45.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Look, I’ve heard. I’ve seen.

00:52:45.162 --> 00:52:46.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve observed. I’ve felt.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:50.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is me.
I’ve had a close-up view.’

00:52:50.100 --> 00:52:54.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an even closer look
than you can have on JW Broadcasting.

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:58.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is one-on-one in the flesh.

00:52:58.675 --> 00:53:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you can say:

00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:05.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ve had a close-up view
of God’s spirit-directed organization.

00:53:05.515 --> 00:53:09.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And now I am reporting to you,

00:53:09.886 --> 00:53:13.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my beloved brothers and sisters,’
in the assignments that you have.

00:53:13.123 --> 00:53:17.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what you can do now
—‘what I’ve seen and I’ve heard.’

00:53:17.093 --> 00:53:20.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in this way,
imagine what you can do

00:53:20.830 --> 00:53:25.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen, stabilize,
and build confidence in your brothers!

00:53:25.635 --> 00:53:27.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is your responsibility now.

00:53:27.804 --> 00:53:30.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This wasn’t coming here to school
just to have a good time.

00:53:30.907 --> 00:53:34.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you did have a good time,
but that wasn’t the objective.

00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:37.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The objective is now that you go out
and you serve your brothers

00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:40.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all of you, each and every one of you,
brother, sister,

00:53:40.617 --> 00:53:42.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
single, married; it doesn’t matter.

00:53:42.919 --> 00:53:47.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your brothers and sisters now deserve
a Gilead graduate’s reward.

00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re going to give it to them.

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:52.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you thunder in doing that.

00:53:55.265 --> 00:54:00.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s go back to the apostle John.

00:54:00.103 --> 00:54:03.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John’s thunder never diminished
to a low rumble.

00:54:03.707 --> 00:54:05.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:08.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did John do
when he was released from prison

00:54:08.445 --> 00:54:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the island of Patmos
at nearly 100 years old?

00:54:11.481 --> 00:54:13.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he do?

00:54:13.583 --> 00:54:15.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, did he say:
‘I’m a weak, old man.

00:54:15.752 --> 00:54:17.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nothing I can do anymore’?

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, no, no.

00:54:19.456 --> 00:54:22.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, he knew the apostasy was coming

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:25.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that oppressive wolves
were already misleading the brothers.

00:54:25.762 --> 00:54:30.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But John said, ‘Not on my watch.’

00:54:31.735 --> 00:54:34.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he would continue to thunder for Jehovah

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:38.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using every fiber of his being

00:54:38.008 --> 00:54:42.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help his brothers
right down to his dying breath.

00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:44.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he do that?

00:54:44.514 --> 00:54:48.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote four Bible books,

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:51.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the portion that we just read here

00:54:51.955 --> 00:54:54.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1 John chapter 1.

00:54:54.958 --> 00:54:56.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t retire.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was still full of fiery enthusiasm,

00:55:00.063 --> 00:55:02.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanting to help his brothers
because he loved the truth.

00:55:04.167 --> 00:55:08.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what helped John
to keep the thunder rolling?

00:55:08.104 --> 00:55:10.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped him?

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knew the final outcome.

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:20.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in 96 C.E.
before his release,

00:55:20.483 --> 00:55:25.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he received that unexpected flash of light
—the Revelation,

00:55:25.488 --> 00:55:27.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vision

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:31.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 144,000 Kingdom conquerors

00:55:31.494 --> 00:55:33.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will rule with Jesus in heaven.

00:55:33.697 --> 00:55:35.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got that.

00:55:35.699 --> 00:55:39.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he was told 
about an integrity-keeping “great crowd

00:55:39.269 --> 00:55:42.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . out of all [the] nations”
that would worship God in truth.

00:55:42.439 --> 00:55:44.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got that.

00:55:44.441 --> 00:55:47.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine
how that strengthened his conviction?

00:55:47.143 --> 00:55:49.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of the apostasy,

00:55:49.813 --> 00:55:54.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said true worship
would not be extinguished.

00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:58.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So think about it.

00:55:58.054 --> 00:56:02.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a prophetic vision of the great crowd

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:07.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouraged John to continue
to fight and defend the truth,

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:09.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about you

00:56:09.232 --> 00:56:14.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you who see not a vision
but the reality of its fulfillment?

00:56:15.772 --> 00:56:18.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, John is seeing the reality from heaven
—true—

00:56:18.775 --> 00:56:22.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have a front-row seat
right here on earth

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:26.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you witness the greatest preaching effort
in history

00:56:26.816 --> 00:56:29.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you watch Jehovah perform
a modern-day miracle

00:56:29.819 --> 00:56:33.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by gathering
‘a great crowd from all the nations.’

00:56:33.957 --> 00:56:36.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what we face now

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in the future,

00:56:38.962 --> 00:56:41.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep the thunder rolling.

00:56:41.865 --> 00:56:43.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:56:43.867 --> 00:56:47.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you know the final outcome.

00:56:47.871 --> 00:56:50.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see it already developing.

00:56:52.308 --> 00:56:56.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John continued to thunder for Jehovah,

00:56:56.579 --> 00:57:01.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he mellowed
through the years of faithful service.

00:57:01.584 --> 00:57:06.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His fiery enthusiasm is now on display
in perfect balance.

00:57:07.657 --> 00:57:12.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man who once wanted
to call down fire from heaven to get results

00:57:12.662 --> 00:57:16.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now uses a force much stronger

00:57:16.199 --> 00:57:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more effective.

00:57:18.301 --> 00:57:20.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is it?

00:57:20.303 --> 00:57:22.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love.

00:57:22.305 --> 00:57:25.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, at 1 John 2:14,

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what he says here.

00:57:27.811 --> 00:57:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just sense the love that he has

00:57:31.414 --> 00:57:33.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he writes verse 14:

00:57:34.717 --> 00:57:37.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I write you, fathers,

00:57:37.120 --> 00:57:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you have come to know him
who is from the beginning.

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I write you, young men,
because you are strong

00:57:45.995 --> 00:57:49.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the word of God remains in you

00:57:49.032 --> 00:57:51.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have conquered the wicked one.”

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:53.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you sense the love?

00:57:53.703 --> 00:57:57.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John is saying,
‘Look, the word of God remains in you.’

00:57:57.607 --> 00:58:01.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used the powerful force of love
to commend his readers

00:58:01.411 --> 00:58:05.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they never lost
their heartfelt appreciation for the truth.

00:58:05.849 --> 00:58:08.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see yourself doing that?

00:58:08.618 --> 00:58:12.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, thunder without love is just noise.

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But be determined
to lovingly commend your brothers

00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:18.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their endurance.

00:58:18.127 --> 00:58:20.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank them for their integrity.

00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:24.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Commend them for their unselfish love.

00:58:24.067 --> 00:58:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Touch their hearts when you speak with them.

00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:31.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers need encouragement,
not criticism.

00:58:34.377 --> 00:58:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as I look at each one of you,

00:58:38.114 --> 00:58:41.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a lot of thoughts
going through my mind.

00:58:41.017 --> 00:58:43.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do.
I mean, here you are—

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, all the memories

00:58:45.021 --> 00:58:47.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are flooding through my mind,
flooding through my heart.

00:58:47.991 --> 00:58:52.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s amazing as I look at you!

00:58:52.161 --> 00:58:54.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can still hear your comments.

00:58:54.597 --> 00:58:56.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know what else I can hear?

00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:59.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can hear each day (when you came to class)

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:01.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you thundered into that classroom.

00:59:01.538 --> 00:59:06.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You did.
We have never seen such a thunderous class.

00:59:06.543 --> 00:59:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There you were each morning
hugging each other,

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:12.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clapping for the morning worship comments,
commending each other.

00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:15.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if you hadn’t seen each other
in three months;

00:59:15.051 --> 00:59:17.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was just last night you saw each other.

00:59:17.654 --> 00:59:19.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, oh no,

00:59:19.656 --> 00:59:24.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you thundered in appreciation
for divine truth

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:26.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for the privilege to be here at school

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:29.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for each other’s
integrity-keeping course.

00:59:29.999 --> 00:59:34.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as you leave,
what do we want you to remember?

00:59:34.737 --> 00:59:38.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to remember
how you can keep the thunder rolling.

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you do that?

00:59:40.443 --> 00:59:42.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to give you three ways.

00:59:42.345 --> 00:59:45.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One, defend the truth.

00:59:47.684 --> 00:59:52.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t allow false reports and lies
about the organization that you love

00:59:52.155 --> 00:59:54.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the organization that you love and cherish,

00:59:54.490 --> 00:59:57.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the very organization
that brought you to these seats.

00:59:58.828 --> 01:00:02.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never allow lies and false reports
to stop you

01:00:02.365 --> 01:00:07.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from reporting
what you have seen and heard firsthand.

01:00:07.003 --> 01:00:10.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two, remember the final outcome.

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True worship will prevail.

01:00:12.709 --> 01:00:16.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You already see it doing so.

01:00:16.045 --> 01:00:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And three, use the powerful force of love.

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:23.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use love to commend
and fortify your brothers.

01:00:23.920 --> 01:00:25.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Encourage them.
Build them up.

01:00:25.922 --> 01:00:27.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use love.

01:00:27.957 --> 01:00:30.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like John, with all your might,

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all your ability,

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:34.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thunder for Jehovah.

01:00:41.070 --> 01:00:44.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was thunderous applause.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You followed his theme right on through.

01:00:46.676 --> 01:00:48.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good.

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we really did appreciate that talk

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping us to be like the apostle John

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:57.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and seeing how
he never lost his enthusiasm

01:00:57.020 --> 01:01:02.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he balanced it
even more so in later years with love.

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:05.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we want to never lose our enthusiasm

01:01:05.928 --> 01:01:08.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—our love—
for Jehovah, Jesus,

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:11.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom,
and spiritual things.

01:01:12.268 --> 01:01:14.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an inspiring program!

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:16.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there’s more to come!

01:01:16.873 --> 01:01:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for Parts 2 and 3 on jw.org®.

01:01:19.976 --> 01:01:22.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll be released in the coming weeks.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:26.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:29.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
