As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we have a wonderful privilege

00:00:06.235 --> 00:00:09.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the privilege of “declaring the good news”!

00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:13.368 line:10% position:50% align:center
But just what does that good news include?

00:00:13.368 --> 00:00:14.995 line:10% position:50% align:center
If we know the answer,

00:00:14.995 --> 00:00:16.621 line:10% position:50% align:center
how will that motivate us

00:00:16.621 --> 00:00:20.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be even more zealous
as we declare the good news?

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:24.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the answers
to those questions.

00:00:24.255 --> 00:00:28.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all,
what is the good news?

00:00:28.217 --> 00:00:31.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get an idea
by looking at how this expression

00:00:31.012 --> 00:00:33.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
is used in the Bible.

00:00:33.056 --> 00:00:37.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we read of “the good news of the Kingdom,”

00:00:37.185 --> 00:00:39.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good news of God,”

00:00:39.354 --> 00:00:42.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good news about Jesus Christ,”

00:00:42.441 --> 00:00:46.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good news
of the undeserved kindness of God,”

00:00:46.487 --> 00:00:48.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good news of peace,”

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the “everlasting good news.”

00:00:52.034 --> 00:00:54.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can say that the good news refers

00:00:54.954 --> 00:00:57.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the rule of God’s Kingdom

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:01.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and salvation by faith in Jesus.

00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:05.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes all the truths
about which Jesus spoke

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the disciples wrote.

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:09.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the prophet Isaiah,

00:01:09.887 --> 00:01:13.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah spoke
about the preaching of the good news.

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:16.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah’s prophecy described the purpose

00:01:16.686 --> 00:01:19.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
and effect of the good news to be preached,

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:23.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly from the time
of Messiah’s coming.

00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:28.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what’s recorded at Isaiah 61:1, 2:

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:33.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The spirit of the Sovereign Lord Jehovah
is upon me,

00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:37.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because Jehovah anointed me
to declare good news to the meek.

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He sent me to bind up the brokenhearted,

00:01:41.588 --> 00:01:44.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to proclaim liberty to the captives

00:01:44.466 --> 00:01:47.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the wide opening of the eyes
to the prisoners,

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:51.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to proclaim the year of Jehovah’s goodwill

00:01:51.056 --> 00:01:54.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the day of vengeance of our God,

00:01:54.518 --> 00:01:57.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
to comfort all who mourn.”

00:01:58.022 --> 00:02:00.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
This good news would have a positive effect

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:02.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
on those who listened to it.

00:02:02.527 --> 00:02:05.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would “bind up the brokenhearted”

00:02:05.071 --> 00:02:07.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “comfort all who mourn.”

00:02:07.824 --> 00:02:09.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is likely the kind of good news

00:02:09.868 --> 00:02:12.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we talk about most in our ministry.

00:02:12.704 --> 00:02:17.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prospect of enjoying everlasting life
in an earthly paradise

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:20.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the rule of God’s Kingdom

00:02:20.087 --> 00:02:22.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides hope to our listeners

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:25.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
and motivates them to love Jehovah.

00:02:26.052 --> 00:02:30.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the good news
also includes something else,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
something that we may not talk about
as readily in our ministry.

00:02:34.478 --> 00:02:38.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may have noticed in Isaiah
the expression

00:02:38.148 --> 00:02:41.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the day of vengeance of our God.”

00:02:41.568 --> 00:02:43.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s more to the good news

00:02:43.571 --> 00:02:46.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just “the year of Jehovah’s goodwill.”

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:49.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see this clearly in the words recorded

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:53.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Revelation 14:6, 7:

00:02:54.082 --> 00:02:58.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I saw another angel flying in midheaven,

00:02:58.253 --> 00:03:00.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he had everlasting good news

00:03:00.714 --> 00:03:03.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to declare to those who dwell on the earth,

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:05.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to every nation and tribe

00:03:05.845 --> 00:03:07.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and tongue and people.

00:03:07.847 --> 00:03:10.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He was saying in a loud voice:

00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:13.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Fear God and give him glory,

00:03:13.394 --> 00:03:17.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because the hour of judgment by him
has arrived,

00:03:17.482 --> 00:03:20.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so worship the One who made the heaven

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:22.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the earth and the sea

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the springs of water.’”

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, the “everlasting good news”

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
also includes a judgment message.

00:03:30.204 --> 00:03:34.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is “the hour of judgment”
mentioned in this verse?

00:03:35.585 --> 00:03:37.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to some reference works,

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:41.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
the original language term
here rendered “judgment”

00:03:41.091 --> 00:03:44.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
refers to a “legal process of judgment,”

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
a “scrutiny of conduct.”

00:03:47.055 --> 00:03:51.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
So God is looking closely at conduct
—how people act.

00:03:51.894 --> 00:03:55.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the basis for judgment.

00:03:55.231 --> 00:03:58.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The hour of judgment”
mentioned in this verse

00:03:58.234 --> 00:04:00.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
includes both the pronouncement

00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:03.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the execution of divine judgment

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
against all false religion
—Babylon the Great—

00:04:07.285 --> 00:04:11.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all other parts
of Satan’s system of things.

00:04:11.748 --> 00:04:15.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Babylon the Great
and this world’s institutions

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
have already been judged.

00:04:18.089 --> 00:04:21.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
their sentence has yet to be carried out.

00:04:21.884 --> 00:04:23.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will that happen?

00:04:23.886 --> 00:04:27.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Toward the end of “the hour of judgment,”

00:04:27.223 --> 00:04:31.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will conclude
at the climax of the last days

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:34.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the destruction
of the present wicked system.

00:04:35.691 --> 00:04:40.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why the actions of people today
matter so much.

00:04:40.237 --> 00:04:43.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s increasingly urgent that we proclaim

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:46.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judgment aspect of the good news to them

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:50.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the time
when God will execute judgment

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:52.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
is fast approaching.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:56.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, though,
can we say that this judgment message

00:04:56.338 --> 00:04:59.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
is good news?

00:04:59.174 --> 00:05:01.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good news for honesthearted ones

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:04.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it means the end of wickedness,

00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:09.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
including all forms
of injustice and violence.

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those who are suffering
as a result of the bad actions of the wicked,

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
this judgment will bring great relief!

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:22.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be a clear demonstration
of Jehovah’s love and justice.

00:05:22.282 --> 00:05:27.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, it will be bad news
for those who stubbornly refuse

00:05:27.204 --> 00:05:31.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live by Jehovah’s righteous standards.

00:05:31.626 --> 00:05:33.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Bible times,

00:05:33.628 --> 00:05:36.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah warned of various acts of judgment

00:05:36.339 --> 00:05:38.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would bring against those

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:42.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
who deliberately disobeyed his commands.

00:05:42.304 --> 00:05:45.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
In each case,
he informed the affected people

00:05:45.516 --> 00:05:47.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
well in advance

00:05:47.518 --> 00:05:49.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
and instructed them to make changes

00:05:49.603 --> 00:05:52.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were in harmony with his will.

00:05:52.732 --> 00:05:55.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
To encourage the right response,

00:05:55.401 --> 00:05:58.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
he often used his loyal servants on earth

00:05:58.238 --> 00:06:00.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
to announce his judgments

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to convey a sense of urgency.

00:06:03.869 --> 00:06:06.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, think of Noah.

00:06:06.663 --> 00:06:08.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
For years,
he fearlessly warned

00:06:08.874 --> 00:06:11.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
the immoral and violent people of his day

00:06:11.752 --> 00:06:14.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a coming global Flood.

00:06:14.171 --> 00:06:18.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also told them 
they needed to do to survive.

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Moses and Aaron?

00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:26.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah used them
to warn Pharaoh and his servants.

00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:30.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
think about the specific warning Jehovah gave

00:06:30.272 --> 00:06:34.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the seventh plague,
a devastating hailstorm.

00:06:34.985 --> 00:06:37.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Exodus 9:18, 19,

00:06:37.989 --> 00:06:39.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
we read that Moses and Aaron

00:06:39.991 --> 00:06:43.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave the people
the time and the information they needed

00:06:43.953 --> 00:06:47.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect themselves from the storm.

00:06:47.248 --> 00:06:49.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah always makes sure

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:54.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people have sufficient opportunity
to heed his warnings.

00:06:54.173 --> 00:06:56.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 3:9 says:

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He does not desire anyone to be destroyed

00:06:59.637 --> 00:07:03.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
but desires all to attain to repentance.”

00:07:03.766 --> 00:07:06.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news we are now preaching
informs people

00:07:06.936 --> 00:07:11.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only of the marvelous hope for the future
that Jehovah offers

00:07:11.441 --> 00:07:15.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also of what we must do
to enjoy that hope.

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:17.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we need to let people know

00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:21.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s soon-to-come judgment.

00:07:21.243 --> 00:07:25.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how the preaching of the good news
is tied to divine judgment

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 24:14:

00:07:28.793 --> 00:07:31.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this good news of the Kingdom

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:34.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be preached in all the inhabited earth

00:07:34.215 --> 00:07:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a witness to all the nations,

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the end will come.”

00:07:40.222 --> 00:07:43.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note how the good news serves as “a witness”

00:07:43.142 --> 00:07:45.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
to everyone who hears it.

00:07:45.394 --> 00:07:47.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Depending on what they do with it,

00:07:47.438 --> 00:07:50.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will result in their eventual acquittal

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:52.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
or condemnation.

00:07:52.902 --> 00:07:56.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as a court takes time
to hear all the facts

00:07:56.156 --> 00:07:58.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to weigh all the evidence,

00:07:58.408 --> 00:08:01.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is wisely using his time now

00:08:01.662 --> 00:08:03.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
to judge people fairly.

00:08:03.872 --> 00:08:08.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both he and Jehovah continue
to analyze the conduct of individuals

00:08:08.627 --> 00:08:12.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they respond
to the good news that we’re preaching.

00:08:13.758 --> 00:08:18.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should what we’ve just considered
about the good news affect us?

00:08:19.013 --> 00:08:21.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
For one thing,
we will not hold back

00:08:21.725 --> 00:08:24.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
from sharing all of the good news.

00:08:24.353 --> 00:08:28.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will talk about the future blessings
God has promised

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:31.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as God’s judgment of the wicked,

00:08:31.068 --> 00:08:33.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will make these blessings possible.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine for a moment
that you knew that a dangerous storm

00:08:38.326 --> 00:08:40.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
was bearing down on where you lived.

00:08:40.745 --> 00:08:42.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would you do?

00:08:42.414 --> 00:08:45.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you try to be
as prepared as possible

00:08:45.292 --> 00:08:48.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you
could successfully weather the storm?

00:08:48.128 --> 00:08:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t you warn your family,
friends, even neighbors

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:54.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and try to help them to do the same?

00:08:54.426 --> 00:08:56.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a similar way,

00:08:56.429 --> 00:08:59.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
we try to help as many people as possible

00:08:59.515 --> 00:09:02.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prepare for the impending execution

00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:05.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s judgments on this world.

00:09:05.397 --> 00:09:07.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
While being tactful,

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:09.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not hold back from letting people know

00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:12.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they need to do to be saved.

00:09:12.487 --> 00:09:15.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we help our Bible students

00:09:15.741 --> 00:09:18.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand what they need to do.

00:09:18.828 --> 00:09:21.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a frank yet kind way,

00:09:21.205 --> 00:09:24.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
we help them to see
what changes they need to make

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:28.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
to harmonize their lives
with Jehovah’s standards.

00:09:29.130 --> 00:09:32.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our new study tool, <i>Enjoy Life Forever!,</i>

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:36.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed to help us do such teaching.

00:09:36.096 --> 00:09:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes several features
to help our Bible students qualify

00:09:40.476 --> 00:09:43.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach the good news as soon as possible.

00:09:44.272 --> 00:09:47.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
at the end of each section,

00:09:47.817 --> 00:09:52.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a review with questions,
some of which are quite pointed.

00:09:52.656 --> 00:09:55.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Considering these questions with our students

00:09:55.992 --> 00:09:58.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help them to see
what they need to do

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply what they’ve been learning
in their Bible study.

00:10:02.416 --> 00:10:06.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll have an opportunity
to watch a video later on in this program

00:10:06.796 --> 00:10:11.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will demonstrate
some of the features in <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:10:11.801 --> 00:10:15.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can use them
to help our Bible students.

00:10:16.598 --> 00:10:19.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding the importance
of the good news

00:10:19.476 --> 00:10:24.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
will also motivate us
to preach and teach it with urgency!

00:10:24.523 --> 00:10:26.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll strive to have a full share

00:10:26.609 --> 00:10:30.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all aspects of the ministry
available to us.

00:10:30.655 --> 00:10:33.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than taking a casual approach,

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:38.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be zealous
and “work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah.”

00:10:38.163 --> 00:10:39.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:10:39.581 --> 00:10:43.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we realize
that people’s lives are at stake;

00:10:43.293 --> 00:10:46.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
they urgently need to hear the good news

00:10:46.255 --> 00:10:48.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and respond to it.

00:10:48.882 --> 00:10:53.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we all have
different circumstances and abilities.

00:10:53.512 --> 00:10:57.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah and Jesus
take this into account.

00:10:57.642 --> 00:11:00.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jesus’ illustration of the talents,

00:11:00.437 --> 00:11:04.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
not all the slaves
were given the same number of talents.

00:11:04.816 --> 00:11:09.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, the talents were distributed
‘according to their ability.’

00:11:09.822 --> 00:11:12.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
This reminds us that Jehovah and Jesus

00:11:12.908 --> 00:11:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
are aware of our personal situations.

00:11:16.579 --> 00:11:18.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
They know what we can reasonably do,

00:11:18.873 --> 00:11:22.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they never expect anything beyond that.

00:11:22.377 --> 00:11:26.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nor do they compare us
to our fellow brothers and sisters.

00:11:26.756 --> 00:11:29.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing this is very comforting

00:11:29.217 --> 00:11:31.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we may not always be able to do

00:11:31.511 --> 00:11:34.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
all that we want to do in the preaching work.

00:11:34.473 --> 00:11:38.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s often the case
with our dear older ones

00:11:38.394 --> 00:11:42.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
and others who cope with serious limitations.

00:11:42.106 --> 00:11:45.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we can all feel confident

00:11:45.151 --> 00:11:48.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
that as long as we do our personal best,

00:11:48.363 --> 00:11:50.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will be pleased with us.

00:11:50.866 --> 00:11:54.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll never ‘forget our work
and the love that we show.’

00:11:55.621 --> 00:11:59.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
So may each of us
continue to do all that we can

00:11:59.375 --> 00:12:03.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the good news
—all of the good news!

00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:08.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so,
we will experience great joy and contentment

00:12:08.676 --> 00:12:12.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we participate
in this lifesaving work,

00:12:12.055 --> 00:12:15.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping as many as possible
before it’s too late.
