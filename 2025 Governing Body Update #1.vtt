00:00:01.397 --> 00:00:03.440 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome to our program.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.860 line:10% position:50% align:center
To begin, here are a few updates

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:07.111 line:10% position:50% align:center
about our relief efforts

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.613 line:10% position:50% align:center
following a number of major disasters

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:11.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have affected our brothers and sisters.

00:00:12.554 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
In early January 2025,

00:00:15.056 --> 00:00:18.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
wildfires erupted
in southern California, United States,

00:00:18.727 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and displaced over 1,100 publishers.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
As of January 23,

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:28.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wildfires have destroyed
91 homes of our brothers

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
and damaged 48 more.

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Disaster Relief Committee
has been appointed

00:00:33.825 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
to coordinate the relief efforts.

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:39.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
And local elders and circuit overseers
are shepherding those affected

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
and assisting with practical needs.

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:44.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent months, Cuba has faced

00:00:44.815 --> 00:00:48.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only hurricanes but also earthquakes.

00:00:48.173 --> 00:00:50.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
These disasters damaged or destroyed

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
nearly 500 homes of our brothers.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Cuba branch has appointed
Disaster Relief Committees

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
to coordinate the response.

00:01:00.185 --> 00:01:02.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers
are providing humanitarian aid

00:01:02.061 --> 00:01:04.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and needed items
as well as repairing homes.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the island of Mayotte,
located off the coast of eastern Africa,

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:12.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are some 130 publishers.

00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
These brothers and sisters
have been dealing with various crises,

00:01:17.097 --> 00:01:20.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
including water shortages,
inflation, and unrest.

00:01:22.207 --> 00:01:26.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then in December 2024,
Cyclone Chido struck the island,

00:01:26.377 --> 00:01:30.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
damaging roads, power lines,
and communications.

00:01:30.048 --> 00:01:34.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cyclone also damaged or destroyed
36 homes of our brothers

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:37.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and heavily damaged
the two Kingdom Halls on the island.

00:01:38.232 --> 00:01:41.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
The France branch
is coordinating relief efforts.

00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:44.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
On December 26,
a team of eight brothers and sisters

00:01:44.562 --> 00:01:47.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
—including the circuit overseer
and a Witness doctor—

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:52.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
arrived in Mayotte
with essential supplies for our brothers.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:56.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, though, on January 13, 2025,

00:01:56.216 --> 00:01:58.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mayotte was struck again,

00:01:58.368 --> 00:02:00.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
this time by a tropical storm.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mozambique was also affected
by Cyclone Chido in December.

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cyclone damaged or destroyed
28 homes of our brothers

00:02:09.462 --> 00:02:11.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as two of our meeting places.

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:14.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,
various parts of the country

00:02:14.592 --> 00:02:18.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been facing severe droughts and unrest.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:21.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please continue to pray
for our brothers and sisters

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:23.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
in these areas
and many other places

00:02:23.997 --> 00:02:26.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they contend with various disasters.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:30.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate the hard work
of the local branches

00:02:30.275 --> 00:02:32.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as all of you
dear brothers and sisters

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are supporting the relief efforts.

00:02:35.342 --> 00:02:38.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for your generous donations
to the worldwide work,

00:02:38.283 --> 00:02:41.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
which allow us to help
our brothers and sisters

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:43.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
during these times of need.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
On December 6, 2024,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
a court in Russia
sentenced four of our sisters

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:52.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
to forced labor for “extremist” behavior.

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:56.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was this so-called extremist behavior?

00:02:56.467 --> 00:03:00.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peacefully meeting together
to discuss the Bible.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:04.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
These sisters were all given sentences
of more than two years.

00:03:04.142 --> 00:03:06.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are, however, appealing the decision.

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:13.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
These sentences are the culmination
of over six years of criminal prosecution

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
of these Christian families.

00:03:15.653 --> 00:03:17.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
The husbands of three of these sisters

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:20.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
are already serving unjust prison sentences.

00:03:23.244 --> 00:03:26.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
On December 18, 2024, in Turkmenistan,

00:03:26.748 --> 00:03:29.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
21-year-old Brother Arslan Vepayev

00:03:29.876 --> 00:03:32.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
was sentenced to two years in prison

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:36.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his personal
conscientious objection to military service.

00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:40.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
On January 8, 2025,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
an appeals court upheld
Arslan’s criminal conviction

00:03:44.515 --> 00:03:48.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
but amended his sentence
to two years of correctional labor.

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, we’re pleased to inform you

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:55.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Arslan was released from prison
and welcomed home by his family.

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Eritrea, you’ll recall
that 23 brothers and sisters

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
were arrested while meeting together
in September 2024.

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:09.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
This included Sister Mizan Gebreyesus,
who is 82 years old.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:15.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re pleased to inform you
that on January 15, 2025,

00:04:15.296 --> 00:04:17.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Mizan was released from prison.

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:20.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
She is now receiving
the medical care she needs.

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:23.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
As reported in our last update,

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:26.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Saron Ghebru
was released from prison

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:28.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
on December 7, 2024.

00:04:28.872 --> 00:04:30.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re very happy to report

00:04:30.957 --> 00:04:32.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she has since given birth,

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:35.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she and her daughter are doing well.

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:39.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please continue to pray
for these dear brothers and sisters

00:04:39.821 --> 00:04:43.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as the over 235
others around the world

00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:45.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are currently
imprisoned for their faith.

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:50.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite disasters and persecution,

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:54.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization
continues to move forward.

00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:57.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s as 2 Timothy 4:5 says:

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You, though,
keep your senses in all things,

00:05:01.363 --> 00:05:05.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“endure hardship,
do the work of an evangelizer,

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:07.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
fully accomplish your ministry.”

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:13.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s words to Timothy encourage us
to endure the hardships of the last days,

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:17.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we remain focused
on ‘fully accomplishing our ministry.’

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:23.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
With this in mind, here are a few recent
initiatives that help us to do just that.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:25.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the world,

00:05:25.408 --> 00:05:29.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
classes of the 2025 Kingdom Ministry School
are being held.

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:32.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
This school provides further training
to circuit overseers,

00:05:32.894 --> 00:05:35.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
elders, and ministerial servants.

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
The objective of the school is to enhance
the brothers’ abilities as shepherds

00:05:40.006 --> 00:05:44.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to help them further imitate Jehovah
in caring for the congregation.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a special feature of this year’s school,

00:05:48.097 --> 00:05:51.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
the baptized wives of elders
and ministerial servants

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:53.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been invited
to attend the final two talks

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:55.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with their husbands.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:06:00.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another blessing for Jehovah’s people
is a new series of seminars

00:06:00.485 --> 00:06:03.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
designed to train
Hospital Information Departments

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
located at branch offices around the world.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:09.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn, these branch offices
will provide training

00:06:09.369 --> 00:06:11.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their local Hospital Liaison Committees.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
The seminar will help these brothers
become even more skillful

00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:17.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
in providing comfort

00:06:17.772 --> 00:06:19.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in assisting brothers and sisters

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:24.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
to obtain high-quality medical care
when facing issues involving blood.

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:26.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are grateful for the hard work

00:06:26.803 --> 00:06:29.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
of more than 50,000 brothers earth wide

00:06:29.847 --> 00:06:32.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
who serve on Hospital Liaison Committees

00:06:32.392 --> 00:06:34.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
or Patient Visitation Groups.

00:06:35.436 --> 00:06:37.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something we can all enjoy

00:06:37.438 --> 00:06:40.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a recent enhancement
to our <i>JW Library</i><b>®</b> app.

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:44.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
This enhancement will make it easier
to use the study pane features in the Bible.

00:06:44.799 --> 00:06:47.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does it work?
Let’s watch.

00:06:48.574 --> 00:06:51.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a recent update to <i>JW Library</i>,

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:55.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
some new features were added
to help with doing research in the Bible.

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in Luke chapter 2,

00:06:58.126 --> 00:07:02.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
the study pane initially shows
all the study content for the entire chapter.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is good for getting an overview

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:08.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
of everything
that is available for a chapter.

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you want to focus on a single verse,

00:07:10.179 --> 00:07:14.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
tap on the verse, then tap the gem button
to see study content for that verse.

00:07:15.514 --> 00:07:18.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study pane displays
your own personal notes first,

00:07:18.938 --> 00:07:22.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed by the <i>Study Bible</i>
notes and pictures,

00:07:22.462 --> 00:07:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
video excerpts,
then the marginal references and footnotes.

00:07:26.863 --> 00:07:31.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, the <i>Research Guide</i>
references are listed individually.

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:34.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
This gives an overview
of the available references,

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:36.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
which can be useful when you already know

00:07:36.685 --> 00:07:39.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
the type of information you are looking for.

00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:41.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it a point from one of the article series

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:45.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
or personal application
from a <i>Watchtower</i>  study article

00:07:45.256 --> 00:07:49.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps information
from <i>Insight on the Scriptures?</i>

00:07:49.343 --> 00:07:53.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Research Guide</i>  includes references
all the way back to 1986.

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:58.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whenever you do research,
start with the most recent references

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:01.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ensure that you have up-to-date
and accurate information.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use the study pane

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enhance your personal Bible reading

00:08:06.506 --> 00:08:09.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to help you
prepare to comment at meetings.

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:13.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re grateful for these helpful study tools

00:08:13.763 --> 00:08:16.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the many ways
that Jehovah is helping us

00:08:16.245 --> 00:08:18.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘fully accomplish our ministry.’

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:22.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another excellent tool that we have

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:26.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the brochure
<i>Love People—Make Disciples.</i>

00:08:26.088 --> 00:08:29.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
This brochure has helped us
become more effective in the ministry.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
It teaches us how to show
personal interest in others

00:08:32.803 --> 00:08:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be adaptable,
which can help us to start conversations.

00:08:38.267 --> 00:08:42.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is learning
how to start a conversation so important?

00:08:43.648 --> 00:08:45.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we want so much to help people

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become disciples
of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:52.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to teach them
about our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:08:53.616 --> 00:08:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with our new approach,

00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:58.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
have you ever felt that you just aren’t sure

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you should say
to begin a conversation?

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:06.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe this is even more the case
when we’re going door to door.

00:09:06.087 --> 00:09:09.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us
to have something meaningful to say?

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Love People </i> brochure
has an excellent appendix

00:09:12.405 --> 00:09:15.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
called “Truths We Love to Teach.”

00:09:15.658 --> 00:09:19.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are the basic truths
that we all know and love

00:09:19.558 --> 00:09:21.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, “God has a name,”

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God cares about your suffering,”

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:27.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “Dead loved ones will be resurrected.”

00:09:27.984 --> 00:09:31.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we use these truths
to start conversations?

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:34.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the appendix mentions.

00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Try introducing a truth

00:09:37.430 --> 00:09:40.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
by asking: ‘Did you know that . . . ?’

00:09:40.705 --> 00:09:44.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or ‘Have you ever heard that . . . ?’

00:09:44.083 --> 00:09:48.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then use the related scripture(s)
to explain that truth.”

00:09:48.129 --> 00:09:49.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how would you do that?

00:09:49.547 --> 00:09:50.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s an example.

00:09:50.965 --> 00:09:53.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some places,
after introducing ourselves,

00:09:53.718 --> 00:09:57.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could open up a conversation
by saying to a person at the door,

00:09:57.471 --> 00:10:00.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you ever heard
that God has a name?”

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:04.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then share the scriptures listed
under the truth that we love to teach.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:07.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s the basic method we could use.

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:11.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course, we need to consider
the person we are speaking to

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then choose the truth
that we think would most interest them.

00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:20.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
The appendix lists 34 of these truths
we love to teach.

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:24.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be effective, I think you’d agree
that we need to spend time

00:10:24.457 --> 00:10:28.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
learning each of these truths
and the scriptures that support them.

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:31.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we have them well in mind,

00:10:31.442 --> 00:10:34.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we are well-prepared
with something meaningful from the Bible

00:10:34.967 --> 00:10:37.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share with all those whom we meet.

00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:41.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how might we work
at learning these truths?

00:10:41.515 --> 00:10:43.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we could make it
a family project.

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:46.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, our children
need to learn these truths too.

00:10:46.645 --> 00:10:50.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way they can learn
to defend their faith.

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to see
how a family might do this?

00:10:53.736 --> 00:10:54.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good!

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:57.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remembered the scripture
from last week.

00:10:57.531 --> 00:11:01.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, our goal is to learn all of these.

00:11:01.869 --> 00:11:06.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s add another truth
we love to teach.

00:11:06.874 --> 00:11:11.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which scriptures show
that God has a name?

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ophelia.

00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:17.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 83 . . .

00:11:17.405 --> 00:11:19.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
83 . . . 

00:11:19.699 --> 00:11:22.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s OK.
You can use the brochure.

00:11:22.577 --> 00:11:25.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look here under the heading “God.”

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:27.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eighteen!
I knew it!

00:11:27.790 --> 00:11:30.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 83:18.

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:31.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, very good.

00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:33.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what does it say?

00:11:34.985 --> 00:11:37.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May people know

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:39.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you,

00:11:39.927 --> 00:11:42.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whose name is Jehovah,

00:11:42.138 --> 00:11:46.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you alone are the Most High

00:11:46.392 --> 00:11:48.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
over all the earth.”

00:11:48.436 --> 00:11:50.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:54.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
You did very well in emphasizing
the key points from that scripture.

00:11:54.650 --> 00:11:55.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alba.

00:11:55.943 --> 00:11:58.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s also Jeremiah 10:10.

00:11:59.572 --> 00:12:00.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good.

00:12:00.052 --> 00:12:02.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the key phrase from that verse

00:12:02.346 --> 00:12:04.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
that teaches us the truth?

00:12:04.348 --> 00:12:07.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Jehovah is truly God.”

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
You got it!

00:12:09.457 --> 00:12:14.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, girls, how can we use
these scriptures to teach this truth,

00:12:14.504 --> 00:12:17.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
God has a name?

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:19.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Alba, what are you thinking?

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:20.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could ask the person,

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you ever heard
that God has a name?”

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:24.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s perfect.

00:12:24.931 --> 00:12:26.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then what could you do?

00:12:26.787 --> 00:12:29.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could show them Psalm 83:18.

00:12:29.665 --> 00:12:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Great job!

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
You girls are doing so well

00:12:33.523 --> 00:12:36.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
at learning the truths that we love to teach

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:38.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the scriptures that go with them.

00:12:41.594 --> 00:12:46.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think all of us,
young and not-so-young, would enjoy that.

00:12:46.807 --> 00:12:49.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not try it
when we’re together with our friends?

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:54.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is, the more we can learn
these truths and practice using them,

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:58.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more effective we will be
in starting simple conversations

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
and teaching Bible truths.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:03.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something else we can do
to prepare for the ministry

00:13:03.407 --> 00:13:06.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
is highlighted in lesson 1
of the <i>Love People</i>  brochure.

00:13:06.639 --> 00:13:08.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point 3 encourages us

00:13:08.662 --> 00:13:11.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
to think about what’s on the minds
of people in the community.

00:13:11.769 --> 00:13:15.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, we could ask ourselves:
‘What is in the news?’

00:13:15.439 --> 00:13:20.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ‘What are my neighbors, coworkers,
or classmates talking about?’

00:13:20.674 --> 00:13:22.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we can ask ourselves:

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Which one of these truths
would fit that situation?’

00:13:27.243 --> 00:13:31.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being adaptable, we imitate
the apostle Paul’s approach to the ministry.

00:13:31.113 --> 00:13:35.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll recall that
at 1 Corinthians 9:22, 23, he said:

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:13:40.569 --> 00:13:45.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that I might
by all possible means save some.

00:13:45.302 --> 00:13:48.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I do all things
for the sake of the good news,

00:13:48.410 --> 00:13:51.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to share it with others.”

00:13:51.747 --> 00:13:53.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s our goal too

00:13:53.916 --> 00:13:58.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to start conversations with people
using topics that will interest them.

00:13:58.796 --> 00:14:03.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that way, we “become
all things to people of all sorts,

00:14:03.968 --> 00:14:08.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that [we] might
by all possible means save some.”

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:13.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah continue to bless all of us

00:14:13.164 --> 00:14:15.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we support one another

00:14:15.187 --> 00:14:18.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and work “shoulder to shoulder”
in his service.

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:24.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,
we love you all very much.

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:26.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:14:26.907 --> 00:14:29.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
