00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:02.690 line:10% position:50% align:center
Young or old,

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.483 line:10% position:50% align:center
we need to consider the topic

00:00:04.483 --> 00:00:06.193 line:10% position:50% align:center
of thinking ability

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:09.613 line:10% position:50% align:center
and how to develop it effectively.

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us can think.

00:00:11.657 --> 00:00:14.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can think about a lot of things

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some good and some bad.

00:00:17.413 --> 00:00:20.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not uncommon, even for an adult,

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:23.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let his mind wander aimlessly.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or a person may spend time thinking

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:29.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
of frivolous matters of little substance.

00:00:29.717 --> 00:00:32.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what can happen to our thinking,

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:35.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it doesn’t always have a positive effect

00:00:35.264 --> 00:00:37.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our life or our future.

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though specifically addressed to a young man,

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:47.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible book of Proverbs
gives sound advice for all of us.

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 1:4 says:

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:55.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To give a young man
[for that matter any of us]

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowledge and thinking ability.”

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:03.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is thinking ability in this verse?

00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:06.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Hebrew word translated “thinking ability”

00:01:06.003 --> 00:01:10.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be used in a bad sense
or in a favorable one.

00:01:10.507 --> 00:01:13.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our mind and thoughts can be directed

00:01:13.385 --> 00:01:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a worthy, upright end
or just the opposite.

00:01:18.724 --> 00:01:21.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we incline our thinking to aspects

00:01:21.143 --> 00:01:23.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s will and purposes,

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll safeguard our own thinking ability,

00:01:27.483 --> 00:01:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
directing it into the right channels.

00:01:31.987 --> 00:01:35.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
How valuable
is that type of thinking process?

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:39.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn to Proverbs 3:21, 22,

00:01:39.578 --> 00:01:43.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
which states: “Safeguard practical wisdom

00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:45.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and thinking ability;

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:48.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will give you life.”

00:01:48.712 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thinking ability
is not in the exclusive realm

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:53.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the studious type.

00:01:53.926 --> 00:01:56.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout our entire life,

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:59.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
we take in information by reading,

00:01:59.264 --> 00:02:01.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing, hearing,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experiencing things.

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:05.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s the way we take in information

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and react to it
that shapes our individual behavior

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and personality.

00:02:12.611 --> 00:02:16.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many persons
have not used their minds for much more

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:19.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
than the essentials of daily living.

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:23.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to succeed in life and in Jehovah’s eyes,

00:02:23.455 --> 00:02:26.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s necessary that we learn to train,

00:02:26.625 --> 00:02:31.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
develop, and guard thinking ability.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider how trained thinking ability

00:02:33.757 --> 00:02:35.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
might protect us

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to using the Internet wisely.

00:02:39.304 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the Internet can be an excellent tool
for gathering knowledge,

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:47.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking ability when properly exercised

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:51.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
will safeguard us from its harmful effects.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, some popular social media sites

00:02:55.696 --> 00:02:57.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
contain short videos

00:02:57.948 --> 00:03:01.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
designed to deliver instant gratification.

00:03:02.828 --> 00:03:07.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the viewer
gets no immediate emotional reward,

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:09.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is tempted to keep scrolling

00:03:09.835 --> 00:03:14.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find material
that will give the desired effect.

00:03:14.048 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over time,
this can lower one’s attention span,

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:21.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
which may impede a person’s ability to learn,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
retain, and recall information.

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:30.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of us would want that to happen to us,
would we?

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, studies have shown

00:03:33.692 --> 00:03:36.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
that those who spend too much
of their time

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:41.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their electronic devices
are more prone to stress, anxiety,

00:03:41.492 --> 00:03:45.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
depression, or other mental health problems.

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:48.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand, thinking ability

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:50.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to work out ways

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:54.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
to control our use of such technology.

00:03:54.588 --> 00:03:59.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, God-oriented thinking ability

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to distinguish truth

00:04:02.638 --> 00:04:07.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
from misleading and false information.

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:09.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, there is wisdom in what is stated

00:04:09.394 --> 00:04:12.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 2:11, 12:

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:15.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thinking ability

00:04:15.776 --> 00:04:19.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will keep watch over you,

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and discernment will safeguard you,

00:04:22.282 --> 00:04:25.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
to save you from the bad course.”

00:04:26.495 --> 00:04:29.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is this so important?

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:32.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thinking ability and discernment

00:04:32.918 --> 00:04:35.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us perception.

00:04:35.671 --> 00:04:38.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perception is closely related

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:41.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our conscience.

00:04:41.593 --> 00:04:45.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we have meditated on
from God’s Word and stored in our mind

00:04:45.931 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
can mold our conscience,

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:49.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is an inner mechanism

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warn us of wrong actions or tendencies.

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:58.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, our thinking watches over us.

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how this is alluded to

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:05.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 5:14:

00:05:05.075 --> 00:05:09.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But solid food belongs to mature people,

00:05:09.079 --> 00:05:13.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who through use
have their powers of discernment

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:16.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, their thinking]
trained to distinguish

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:18.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
both right and wrong.”

00:05:18.589 --> 00:05:22.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us, both young and old,

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:27.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
should think carefully
about the following suggestions:

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:31.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, grow in knowledge of Jehovah.

00:05:32.144 --> 00:05:35.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 9:10 says in part:

00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:38.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Knowledge of the Most Holy One

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
is understanding.”

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:42.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Coming to know Jehovah

00:05:42.738 --> 00:05:46.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a blessing and a protection.

00:05:46.408 --> 00:05:50.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to pray to Jehovah
for insight when we study,

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:54.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
apply ourselves to Bible reading
on a regular basis,

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
and immerse ourselves in the truth.

00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:01.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should talk to Jehovah
in prayer as our closest confidant.

00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:06.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means using our thinking ability

00:06:06.011 --> 00:06:09.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
to convince ourselves that Jehovah’s advice

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the best advice,

00:06:11.141 --> 00:06:13.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
because doing so will 

00:06:13.727 --> 00:06:16.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
safeguard us when we’re tempted,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
tested, or put into a situation

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we know we must say

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:22.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
no.

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:26.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember who we are, what we stand for, 

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to whom we have dedicated our life.

00:06:31.828 --> 00:06:33.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next suggestion:

00:06:33.413 --> 00:06:37.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to continue to enhance
our Christian personality.

00:06:38.627 --> 00:06:42.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is important, but why?

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:44.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because people who love Jehovah

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:49.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
will like and respect us for who we are.

00:06:49.054 --> 00:06:52.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what kind of personality
are we suggesting?

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:54.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note the expression

00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:57.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Christian personality”?

00:06:57.396 --> 00:07:00.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means “Christlike.”

00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:04.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cannot go wrong
by imitating Jesus in any way possible.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:10.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall that 1 Peter 2:21 says:

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this course you were called,

00:07:13.328 --> 00:07:16.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because even Christ suffered for you,

00:07:16.373 --> 00:07:20.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving a model
for you to follow his steps closely.”

00:07:21.962 --> 00:07:24.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ whole way of life

00:07:24.214 --> 00:07:28.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his attitudes, his values,
his interactions with others—

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:31.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
culminated into a personality

00:07:31.763 --> 00:07:36.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should strive to follow closely.

00:07:36.268 --> 00:07:38.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know well how we want to look

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
when dressed for a special occasion.

00:07:41.606 --> 00:07:45.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
We clothe ourselves
with careful attention to details.

00:07:46.778 --> 00:07:51.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 3:10
picks up on the illustration of clothing.

00:07:51.575 --> 00:07:53.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it states:

00:07:54.578 --> 00:07:59.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And clothe yourselves
with the new personality.”

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:02.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, Romans 13:14

00:08:02.794 --> 00:08:06.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us: “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:08:06.882 --> 00:08:11.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not be planning ahead
for the desires of the flesh.”

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to think
about Jesus’ personality constantly.

00:08:16.433 --> 00:08:19.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly does not come naturally to us

00:08:19.186 --> 00:08:21.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
imperfect descendants of Adam.

00:08:21.813 --> 00:08:24.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes real thinking ability.

00:08:24.733 --> 00:08:27.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, in this case,

00:08:27.194 --> 00:08:31.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are not clothing ourselves
just for one special occasion.

00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:35.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is to be our daily wardrobe.

00:08:35.452 --> 00:08:39.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the extent possible,
with our imperfection,

00:08:39.247 --> 00:08:41.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
we continuously work to reflect

00:08:41.958 --> 00:08:44.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ personality.

00:08:45.545 --> 00:08:47.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next suggestion:

00:08:47.047 --> 00:08:51.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Give priority to our priorities.

00:08:51.009 --> 00:08:52.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this mean?

00:08:53.845 --> 00:08:55.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
To accomplish things in life,

00:08:55.847 --> 00:09:00.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must have schedules,
routines, and priorities.

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:02.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, at Bethel,

00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:06.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
much work is accomplished
because of the daily routine

00:09:06.191 --> 00:09:10.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of giving priority
to spiritual matters.

00:09:11.321 --> 00:09:14.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 1:10, Paul said

00:09:14.074 --> 00:09:17.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “make sure of the more important things.”

00:09:18.954 --> 00:09:22.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wholesome thinking ability
will help us to see the value

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:25.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
of organizing our life each day

00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:29.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give priority
to the most important things.

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:32.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next suggestion:

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:34.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep a modest view

00:09:34.636 --> 00:09:38.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our own knowledge and experience.

00:09:38.098 --> 00:09:41.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thinking ability will help us to filter

00:09:41.184 --> 00:09:44.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
the information we let into our mind.

00:09:44.104 --> 00:09:48.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
The real test of whether our thinking ability
has been properly trained

00:09:48.525 --> 00:09:51.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
is how we apply knowledge.

00:09:51.653 --> 00:09:52.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we need to be

00:09:52.737 --> 00:09:54.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
cautious in life,

00:09:54.239 --> 00:09:56.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask questions,

00:09:56.324 --> 00:09:57.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
fact-check,

00:09:57.993 --> 00:10:00.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
get advice, read, study,

00:10:00.579 --> 00:10:03.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learn from Bible principles.

00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:06.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
And once we’ve accumulated knowledge,

00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:08.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
insight, and thinking ability,

00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:12.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
modesty is involved in how we share it.

00:10:13.758 --> 00:10:17.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul said at Romans 12:3:

00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:21.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I tell everyone there among you

00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:25.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not to think more of himself
than it is necessary to think,

00:10:25.937 --> 00:10:29.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to think so as to have a sound mind.”

00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:33.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we need to display a modest outlook

00:10:33.153 --> 00:10:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our acquired thinking ability.

00:10:36.072 --> 00:10:40.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice it said
to think with “a sound mind,”

00:10:40.368 --> 00:10:42.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
not an inflated mind,

00:10:42.746 --> 00:10:46.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
not thinking more of ourselves
than is necessary to think?

00:10:48.585 --> 00:10:51.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way to use thinking ability
in this old world

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to avoid debt.

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:56.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why is this our last point?

00:10:56.218 --> 00:11:00.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because material things
are not the most important things in life.

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:04.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many work themselves to death

00:11:04.351 --> 00:11:06.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain material prosperity.

00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:11.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as Christians,
there’s other work that’s related to worship.

00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:14.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to work ourselves to life,

00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:18.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, focused on everlasting life yet ahead.

00:11:20.158 --> 00:11:22.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true, though, that some money is needed

00:11:22.786 --> 00:11:25.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
to buy the necessities of life.

00:11:25.747 --> 00:11:29.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we’re young
and just starting to earn a living

00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:34.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we’re older
and have been working secularly for years,

00:11:34.005 --> 00:11:38.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to learn to manage and budget money.

00:11:38.885 --> 00:11:42.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
This involves using our thinking ability

00:11:42.138 --> 00:11:45.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
to separate needs from wants

00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:50.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being cautious
about accumulating much debt.

00:11:50.689 --> 00:11:54.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, according to Proverbs 22:7,

00:11:54.818 --> 00:11:58.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the borrower is a slave to the lender.”

00:11:59.781 --> 00:12:04.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
These few suggestions 
are but a sample of areas in life

00:12:04.202 --> 00:12:08.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we need
thinking ability and discernment

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to analyze our situation,

00:12:11.334 --> 00:12:16.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
make decisions, and determine future plans.

00:12:16.047 --> 00:12:20.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always remember the advice
at Proverbs 3:21, 22:

00:12:20.468 --> 00:12:23.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Safeguard practical wisdom

00:12:23.388 --> 00:12:25.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and thinking ability;

00:12:25.807 --> 00:12:27.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will give you life.”

00:12:27.976 --> 00:12:31.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes and—we may add—
even everlasting life

00:12:31.479 --> 00:12:34.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s righteous new world!
