00:00.850 --> 00:03.052
Thank you for joining us, 


00:03.052 --> 00:05.255
and welcome to the program!


00:05.255 --> 00:07.790
It’s our privilege 
to spend the next hour 


00:07.790 --> 00:09.792
with you dear brothers 
and sisters.


00:09.792 --> 00:13.062
Please join us 
on a field trip to Ethiopia 


00:13.062 --> 00:15.865
where we will meet 
Brother Stephanos Demsas. 


00:15.865 --> 00:20.002
Brother Demsas and his wife 
served faithfully for many years 


00:20.002 --> 00:22.005
while the preaching work 
was under ban. 


00:22.005 --> 00:25.342
You will enjoy their experiences.


00:25.342 --> 00:28.000
Have you ever participated 
in a preaching campaign? 


00:29.178 --> 00:32.515
Our team was present 
when one was arranged in Armenia. 


00:32.515 --> 00:35.452
A preaching campaign 
is uplifting and encouraging 


00:35.452 --> 00:38.855
to everyone involved 
as this segment will show.


00:38.855 --> 00:42.692
How would you react 
if one of your loved ones decides 


00:42.692 --> 00:44.227
to leave the truth? 


00:44.227 --> 00:47.964
It truly is heartbreaking, 
to say the least, 


00:47.963 --> 00:51.300
but what Bible principles 
can help us endure 


00:51.300 --> 00:52.968
such a challenge? 


00:52.968 --> 00:55.905
This dramatization will help us. 


00:55.905 --> 00:58.040
This is the November program 


00:58.040 --> 01:01.000
of JW Broadcasting!


01:17.827 --> 01:20.264
We have selected the theme 


01:20.263 --> 01:23.198
“Be a Champion of Truth!” 


01:23.198 --> 01:25.735
You may have heard 
of the word “champion” 


01:25.735 --> 01:28.270
used in the context of sports. 


01:28.270 --> 01:30.273
What is a champion? 


01:30.273 --> 01:32.741
The word 
can have different meanings. 


01:32.742 --> 01:35.479
The word is related 
to the French word champ, 


01:35.478 --> 01:37.480
meaning “field.” 


01:37.480 --> 01:40.883
That word has its origin 
in the Latin word campus, 


01:40.883 --> 01:44.153
also meaning “field” 
or “battlefield.” 


01:44.153 --> 01:47.790
The Bible speaks of 
a champion on a battlefield 


01:47.790 --> 01:51.000
in 1 Samuel 17:4: 


01:53.630 --> 01:57.567
“Then a champion came out 
from the camps of the Philistines; 


01:57.567 --> 02:00.000
his name was Goliath.”


02:01.470 --> 02:04.407
Goliath was a champion 
for a wrong cause, 


02:04.407 --> 02:06.409
namely, 
to take the lead in defeating 


02:06.408 --> 02:08.945
the ancient Israelites in battle. 


02:08.945 --> 02:12.348
In our modern time, 
according to one definition, 


02:12.348 --> 02:15.418
a champion 
is “an ardent defender 


02:15.418 --> 02:17.686
“or supporter of a cause 


02:17.687 --> 02:19.689
or another person.” 


02:19.688 --> 02:22.558
Christians today 
are ardent defenders 


02:22.558 --> 02:25.026
and supporters of the truth.


02:25.027 --> 02:28.765
The Watchtower 
of January 15, 2012, 


02:28.765 --> 02:32.568
said on page 8: 
“Other champions 


02:32.568 --> 02:36.000
of Bible truth rose up 
in the centuries that followed.” 


02:37.140 --> 02:39.608
Years before, 
The Watchtower said: 


02:39.608 --> 02:42.278
“This magazine 
will never shrink in fear 


02:42.278 --> 02:45.615
from championing the truth!” 


02:45.615 --> 02:47.617
“The Watchtower 
has been championing 


02:47.617 --> 02:50.787
‘the cause of Kingdom truth.’”


02:50.787 --> 02:54.257
So, are you a champion? 


02:54.257 --> 02:56.259
In a sports competition, 


02:56.258 --> 02:59.461
only one individual 
gets to be the champion. 


02:59.462 --> 03:01.932
But in the case 
of true Christians, 


03:01.932 --> 03:04.800
all can be champions 
of the truth. 


03:04.800 --> 03:07.670
All Christians 
are to defend the truth 


03:07.670 --> 03:10.873
and become conquerors
—winners.


03:10.873 --> 03:13.275
It’s necessary 
to defend the truth 


03:13.275 --> 03:15.278
because in today’s world 


03:15.278 --> 03:18.280
truth is being attacked 
and distorted. 


03:18.280 --> 03:21.217
We are surrounded 
by a sea of lies 


03:21.217 --> 03:23.687
and misrepresentations. 


03:23.687 --> 03:26.622
How did such lies get started? 


03:26.622 --> 03:28.625
They started in the garden of Eden 


03:28.625 --> 03:31.627
when Satan told Eve lies.


03:31.627 --> 03:34.497
Satan, 
through his deceptive statements, 


03:34.497 --> 03:37.167
became “the father of the lie.” 


03:37.167 --> 03:39.835
All the problems in the world


03:39.835 --> 03:44.240
—all calamities 
(also your personal calamities), 


03:44.240 --> 03:47.677
all wars, 
all diseases, all crimes, 


03:47.677 --> 03:50.880
all unhappiness, 
sorrow, and death


03:50.880 --> 03:53.348
—started with the original lies 


03:53.348 --> 03:55.618
in the garden of Eden. 


03:55.618 --> 03:58.486
Satan is “the father of the lie.” 


03:58.487 --> 04:02.092
But today there are 
many “children” of the lie. 


04:02.092 --> 04:04.227
Every one of us is affected. 


04:04.227 --> 04:07.630
We are surrounded 
by a sea of lies.


04:07.630 --> 04:10.165
A lie is “a false statement 


04:10.165 --> 04:12.702
“deliberately presented 
as being true; 


04:12.702 --> 04:14.704
a falsehood.” 


04:14.703 --> 04:17.906
A lie is the opposite 
of the truth. 


04:17.907 --> 04:20.844
Lying involves 
saying something incorrect 


04:20.843 --> 04:24.446
to a person who is entitled to know 
the truth about a matter. 


04:24.447 --> 04:28.450
But there is also something 
that is called a half-truth. 


04:28.450 --> 04:32.988
The Bible tells Christians 
to be honest with each other. 


04:32.988 --> 04:35.658
“Now that you 
have put away deceit, 


04:35.658 --> 04:38.126
. . . speak truth,” 
wrote the apostle Paul 


04:38.127 --> 04:41.064
at Ephesians 4:25. 


04:41.063 --> 04:44.933
Lies and half-truths 
undermine trust. 


04:44.933 --> 04:47.136
A German proverb says, 


04:47.137 --> 04:49.339
“Who lies once is not believed, 


04:49.338 --> 04:51.740
even if he says the truth.” 


04:51.740 --> 04:53.743
So we need to speak openly 


04:53.743 --> 04:55.778
and honestly with each other, 


04:55.778 --> 04:58.113
not withholding 
bits of information 


04:58.113 --> 05:00.850
that could change 
the perception of the listener 


05:00.850 --> 05:02.885
or mislead him.


05:02.885 --> 05:06.088
As to lies, 
there are different types. 


05:06.088 --> 05:08.490
Some politicians 
have lied about matters 


05:08.490 --> 05:10.693
they wanted to keep secret. 


05:10.693 --> 05:13.963
Companies sometimes lie 
in advertisements 


05:13.963 --> 05:16.498
regarding their products. 


05:16.498 --> 05:18.500
What about the news media? 


05:18.500 --> 05:21.370
Many try to report events truthfully. 


05:21.370 --> 05:23.372
But we should not be gullible 


05:23.372 --> 05:26.175
and believe 
everything newspapers write 


05:26.175 --> 05:28.745
or everything we hear on radio 


05:28.745 --> 05:31.113
or see on television.


05:31.113 --> 05:33.716
Then there are religious lies. 


05:33.717 --> 05:36.119
If Satan is called 
“the father of the lie,” 


05:36.118 --> 05:39.555
then Babylon the Great, 
the global empire of false religion, 


05:39.555 --> 05:42.558
can be called 
the “mother” of the lie. 


05:42.558 --> 05:44.893
Individual false religions 


05:44.893 --> 05:47.763
could be called 
“daughters” of the lie. 


05:47.763 --> 05:50.098
Some lie by saying that sinners 


05:50.098 --> 05:53.168
will get tormented in hell forever. 


05:53.168 --> 05:55.170
Others lie by saying, 


05:55.170 --> 05:57.507
“Once saved, always saved.” 


05:57.507 --> 06:01.177
Again, others lie 
by saying that the earth 


06:01.177 --> 06:03.445
will be burned up 
on Judgment Day 


06:03.445 --> 06:06.448
and all good people 
will go to heaven. 


06:06.448 --> 06:08.785
Some worship idols. 


06:08.785 --> 06:13.000
Paul wrote at Romans 1:25: 


06:14.723 --> 06:17.793
“They exchanged 
the truth of God for the lie 


06:17.793 --> 06:20.128
“and venerated 
and rendered sacred service 


06:20.128 --> 06:24.700
to the creation 
rather than the Creator.”


06:24.700 --> 06:27.170
Then there are many lies 
of a personal nature 


06:27.170 --> 06:29.905
that people express 
in everyday life. 


06:29.905 --> 06:32.642
A businessman 
may get a phone call 


06:32.642 --> 06:35.645
but tell his secretary 
to answer the caller 


06:35.645 --> 06:37.847
by saying he is not in. 


06:37.847 --> 06:40.984
This may be considered 
a small lie. 


06:40.983 --> 06:44.053
There are small lies, 
big lies, 


06:44.053 --> 06:47.223
and malicious lies. 


06:47.223 --> 06:50.493
A child may have broken something 
but when asked initially, 


06:50.493 --> 06:54.363
out of fear of punishment, 
denies having done it. 


06:54.363 --> 06:57.900
This does not make the child 
a malicious liar.


06:57.900 --> 07:01.370
In contrast, 
what if an entrepreneur 


07:01.370 --> 07:03.973
tells his bookkeeper 
to falsify the entries 


07:03.973 --> 07:07.243
in the books 
in order to save on taxes? 


07:07.243 --> 07:09.445
This lying to the tax office 


07:09.445 --> 07:11.713
is certainly a serious lie. 


07:11.713 --> 07:15.250
It is a deliberate attempt 
to mislead somebody 


07:15.250 --> 07:17.453
that has the right to know. 


07:17.453 --> 07:20.790
It also robs the government 
of what they have established 


07:20.790 --> 07:22.992
as legal income. 


07:22.992 --> 07:26.395
We can see 
that not all lies are the same; 


07:26.395 --> 07:28.998
there are small lies, big lies, 


07:28.998 --> 07:31.066
and malicious lies. 


07:31.067 --> 07:33.669
Satan is a malicious liar. 


07:33.668 --> 07:36.471
He is the champion of the lie. 


07:36.472 --> 07:38.740
Since Jehovah hates liars, 


07:38.740 --> 07:41.010
we should avoid all lies, 


07:41.010 --> 07:44.000
not just big or malicious lies.


07:45.213 --> 07:48.016
But can we find the truth? 


07:48.017 --> 07:50.954
Some say, “Truth is relative.” 


07:50.953 --> 07:53.956
It is like saying, 
“This is truth for you, 


07:53.957 --> 07:56.025
and this is truth for me.” 


07:56.025 --> 07:58.093
This claim is not logical 


07:58.093 --> 08:00.428
when it comes to religious truth. 


08:00.428 --> 08:03.631
Either God is a Trinity 
or he’s not. 


08:03.632 --> 08:07.170
Either the soul is mortal 
or it is not. 


08:07.170 --> 08:11.773
Either there is a future paradise 
on earth or there is not. 


08:11.773 --> 08:16.000
Either homosexuality 
is acceptable to God or it is not. 


08:17.680 --> 08:22.000
Either participating in wars 
is permissible or it is not. 


08:23.118 --> 08:25.855
Truth is definite, not relative, 


08:25.855 --> 08:29.258
because Jehovah conveyed 
the truth to his servants. 


08:29.258 --> 08:32.195
Psalm 43:3 says: 


08:32.195 --> 08:35.263
“Send out your light and your truth.” 


08:35.263 --> 08:39.000
Jehovah is a Revealer of truth.


08:40.235 --> 08:43.105
One of several reasons 
why Jesus came into the world 


08:43.105 --> 08:45.440
was to “witness to the truth.” 


08:45.440 --> 08:49.845
At John 18:37b, 


08:49.845 --> 08:52.748
he said: 
“For this I have been born, 


08:52.748 --> 08:54.816
“and for this 
I have come into the world, 


08:54.817 --> 08:57.687
“that I should bear witness 
to the truth. 


08:57.687 --> 09:02.000
Everyone who is on the side 
of the truth listens to my voice.”


09:03.658 --> 09:06.595
So if we listen to Jesus, 
or read in the Bible 


09:06.595 --> 09:09.532
what he taught, 
we can learn the truth. 


09:09.532 --> 09:12.669
Jesus was the personification 
of the truth. 


09:12.668 --> 09:15.136
He said: “I am the way 


09:15.137 --> 09:18.640
and the truth and the life.” 


09:18.640 --> 09:20.777
We can find out what the truth is 


09:20.777 --> 09:23.312
by diligently studying the Bible. 


09:23.312 --> 09:26.582
Truth is that which is a fact. 


09:26.582 --> 09:29.252
For true Christians, 
the entire text 


09:29.252 --> 09:31.587
of the Hebrew 
and Christian Greek Scriptures 


09:31.587 --> 09:33.722
constitutes the truth. 


09:33.722 --> 09:36.692
Psalm 119:160 


09:36.692 --> 09:38.694
says of Jehovah: 


09:38.693 --> 09:42.431
‘The essence 
of your word is truth.’ 


09:42.432 --> 09:44.434
That is why 
it is good to do 


09:44.433 --> 09:47.303
daily Bible reading 
with meditation 


09:47.303 --> 09:50.640
and weekly family worship.


09:50.640 --> 09:54.410
At Matthew 24:45-47, we read 


09:54.410 --> 09:57.480
that for the time of the end, 
Jesus would appoint 


09:57.480 --> 10:01.283
a “faithful and discreet slave,” 
or Governing Body, 


10:01.283 --> 10:03.953
to explain the Bible
to His followers 


10:03.953 --> 10:08.090
and help them to grow 
in understanding of the truth. 


10:08.090 --> 10:10.425
Whereas Jesus’ teachings 


10:10.425 --> 10:13.162
and the written Word of God 
are inspired, 


10:13.162 --> 10:16.432
“the faithful and discreet slave” 
is not inspired, 


10:16.432 --> 10:19.000
although it champions the truth. 


10:20.235 --> 10:22.237
Nevertheless, the faithful slave 


10:22.237 --> 10:24.640
provides spiritual food. 


10:24.640 --> 10:26.742
Whereas in the first century 


10:26.742 --> 10:28.844
there was supernatural knowledge 


10:28.843 --> 10:31.846
available for apostles 
and Bible writers, 


10:31.847 --> 10:34.684
in the time of the end, 
Jehovah does not bestow 


10:34.683 --> 10:38.086
this miraculous gift anymore, 
as explained 


10:38.087 --> 10:41.990
at 1 Corinthians 13:8. 


10:41.990 --> 10:45.527
Although there is 
no divine inspiration today, 


10:45.527 --> 10:48.930
still Jesus leads 
his people progressively 


10:48.930 --> 10:51.600
through the services 
of the faithful slave. 


10:51.600 --> 10:54.803
Jesus trusts 
that the imperfect faithful slave 


10:54.803 --> 10:58.940
will do its best 
to convey spiritual food. 


10:58.940 --> 11:02.000
Do you also trust the slave?


11:03.745 --> 11:06.882
Whereas the truth 
of God’s Word does not change, 


11:06.882 --> 11:10.085
our understanding 
of the truth does change 


11:10.085 --> 11:12.355
because we 
are not perfect yet. 


11:12.355 --> 11:15.290
We understand more 
about the truth today 


11:15.290 --> 11:18.360
than Christians 
in the first century. 


11:18.360 --> 11:22.000
Do we keep up with the progressive
understanding of truth?


11:23.032 --> 11:26.702
Daniel was told: 
“Many will rove about, 


11:26.702 --> 11:30.000
and the true knowledge 
will become abundant.” 


11:31.440 --> 11:33.442
This is a gradual process. 


11:33.442 --> 11:35.912
We are still roving about. 


11:35.912 --> 11:38.780
During the Millennium, 
Jehovah will reveal 


11:38.780 --> 11:41.450
additional truths to mankind. 


11:41.450 --> 11:44.187
At Revelation 20:12, 


11:44.187 --> 11:47.790
it mentions scrolls 
that will be opened. 


11:47.790 --> 11:50.993
The apostle John reports 
that the dead are to be “judged 


11:50.993 --> 11:53.728
“out of those things 
written in the scrolls 


11:53.728 --> 11:56.065
according to their deeds.” 


11:56.065 --> 11:59.535
Evidently, then, 
these scrolls will contain 


11:59.535 --> 12:03.872
additional information for mankind 
during the thousand years. 


12:03.872 --> 12:07.275
It stands to reason 
that after the end of the Millennium, 


12:07.275 --> 12:10.345
there will be 
additional truths to learn. 


12:10.345 --> 12:14.015
Still, 
according to Ecclesiastes 


12:14.015 --> 12:17.853
chapter 3, verse 11: 


12:17.853 --> 12:19.988
“Mankind will never find out 


12:19.988 --> 12:22.691
the work 
that the true God has made.”


12:22.692 --> 12:26.162
But how do we know 
we have the truth? 


12:26.162 --> 12:29.432
At Pentecost 33 
of our Common Era, 


12:29.432 --> 12:33.102
true Christians 
numbered only about 3,000. 


12:33.102 --> 12:35.704
Today, we are millions. 


12:35.703 --> 12:38.040
And on average,
every weekend 


12:38.040 --> 12:41.643
more than 5,000 
are getting baptized. 


12:41.643 --> 12:43.711
But this in itself 


12:43.712 --> 12:46.249
is not proof 
that we have the truth. 


12:46.248 --> 12:49.318
Truth is not measured 
in numbers. 


12:49.318 --> 12:52.521
Why do we know 
we have the truth?


12:52.522 --> 12:55.057
For one, 
because we remain 


12:55.057 --> 12:58.694
in Jesus’ teaching, 
John 8:31. 


12:58.693 --> 13:01.030
Second, 
we know we have the truth 


13:01.030 --> 13:03.365
because of the deep bond of love 


13:03.365 --> 13:07.937
for each other, John 13:35. 


13:07.937 --> 13:11.674
Third, we know we have the truth 
because our conduct 


13:11.673 --> 13:15.276
adheres 
to the high moral standards of truth,


13:15.277 --> 13:17.547
John 15:10. 


13:17.547 --> 13:19.849
Fourth, 
we know we have the truth 


13:19.848 --> 13:23.651
because we remain neutral 
in the controversies of the world, 


13:23.652 --> 13:27.000
as Jesus advised 
at John 17:14. 


13:28.223 --> 13:30.558
Fifth, 
we know we have the truth 


13:30.558 --> 13:33.228
because we are 
God’s name people. 


13:33.228 --> 13:35.630
Acts 15:14 speaks 


13:35.630 --> 13:38.567
of “a people for his name.” 


13:38.567 --> 13:42.437
Jesus said: 
“The truth will set you free.” 


13:42.437 --> 13:46.309
It sets us free from fears
—like the fear of death, 


13:46.308 --> 13:50.445
fear of the future, 
and an exaggerated fear of man. 


13:50.445 --> 13:53.648
It also sets us free 
from false teachings, 


13:53.648 --> 13:57.586
from spiritism, 
and from astrology and magic. 


13:57.587 --> 14:01.524
It frees us from immorality 
and its consequences. 


14:01.523 --> 14:04.460
There are 
no other people on earth 


14:04.460 --> 14:07.797
that are 
as spiritually free as we are. 


14:07.797 --> 14:10.000
Do we appreciate that freedom? 


14:12.067 --> 14:13.535
Truth leads to freedom. 


14:13.535 --> 14:16.138
Second Corinthians 3:17 says: 


14:16.138 --> 14:18.473
“Where the spirit of Jehovah is, 


14:18.473 --> 14:20.943
there is freedom.”


14:20.943 --> 14:25.080
The truth penetrates schools. 
How so? 


14:25.080 --> 14:27.750
By means of our children 
who preach the truth 


14:27.750 --> 14:30.285
to classmates and to teachers. 


14:30.285 --> 14:32.287
Do you go to school? 


14:32.287 --> 14:35.224
Do you champion 
the truth at school? 


14:35.223 --> 14:37.225
How can you do this? 


14:37.225 --> 14:40.997
You do this not only by preaching 
but also by your conduct, 


14:40.997 --> 14:43.032
by your dress and grooming, 


14:43.032 --> 14:45.969
and by taking a stand for the truth 
when others want you 


14:45.968 --> 14:49.438
to participate 
in unchristian practices. 


14:49.438 --> 14:52.975
You also champion the truth 
by remaining honest 


14:52.975 --> 14:55.510
and not cheating 
on your exams. 


14:55.510 --> 14:58.913
And Jehovah 
will love you for that.


14:58.913 --> 15:02.116
The truth 
also penetrates prisons. 


15:02.117 --> 15:04.520
Reports have come in 
from many countries 


15:04.520 --> 15:06.555
telling of the good work 
brothers are doing 


15:06.555 --> 15:09.958
in contacting prisoners 
in various prisons, 


15:09.958 --> 15:13.728
helping some to rehabilitate 
their lives spiritually. 


15:13.728 --> 15:15.830
In a number of such institutions, 


15:15.830 --> 15:17.833
regular meetings are being held 


15:17.833 --> 15:20.701
and several prisoners 
have studied to the point 


15:20.702 --> 15:24.707
of dedication and baptism.


15:24.707 --> 15:28.777
The truth penetrates 
even walls of monasteries. 


15:28.777 --> 15:31.280
In Mexico, in 2009, 


15:31.280 --> 15:34.182
a nun was baptized who, 
because of the truth, 


15:34.182 --> 15:36.985
had left 
her monastery and order, 


15:36.985 --> 15:39.000
although she was 
the mother superior.


15:40.990 --> 15:43.725
The world 
is in utter confusion. 


15:43.725 --> 15:46.262
What a blessing
to know the truth! 


15:46.262 --> 15:48.264
We rejoice in it! 


15:48.263 --> 15:50.465
We have the truth on our lips. 


15:50.465 --> 15:53.235
We have the truth around our hips. 


15:53.235 --> 15:56.572
Ephesians chapter 6 
says that “the belt of truth” 


15:56.572 --> 15:59.140
is fastened around our waists. 


15:59.140 --> 16:02.143
We are ready to teach it. 


16:02.143 --> 16:05.480
We talk the truth, 
and we walk in the truth. 


16:05.480 --> 16:07.482
Those who continue to walk 


16:07.482 --> 16:10.285
in the truth 
will walk in it forever.


16:10.285 --> 16:13.088
Help your students 
to love the truth 


16:13.088 --> 16:15.956
and to live the truth but, 
if necessary, 


16:15.957 --> 16:19.000
to be willing to die 
for the truth and for Jehovah. 


16:20.495 --> 16:22.497
The truth is invincible 


16:22.497 --> 16:25.234
and will conquer 
this wicked world. 


16:25.233 --> 16:28.770
In some countries, 
we may have many enemies 


16:28.770 --> 16:30.905
who may want to silence us. 


16:30.905 --> 16:32.942
But the apostle Paul said 


16:32.942 --> 16:37.000
at 2 Corinthians 13:8: 


16:38.880 --> 16:42.000
“For we can do nothing 
against the truth.”


16:43.685 --> 16:47.655
Neither can our enemies 
suppress the truth. 


16:47.655 --> 16:49.858
Do we appreciate
that we have the truth


16:49.858 --> 16:51.860
—the only truth? 


16:51.860 --> 16:55.463
Is this arrogant to say? 
By no means! 


16:55.463 --> 16:58.333
It would be a sin 
if we would not say so. 


16:58.333 --> 17:00.468
Jesus was not arrogant 
when he said: 


17:00.468 --> 17:03.605
‘I am the truth.’


17:03.605 --> 17:05.940
To know the truth 
is not enough. 


17:05.940 --> 17:08.143
We need to champion it. 


17:08.143 --> 17:11.080
There are still 
many lovers of truth out there; 


17:11.080 --> 17:13.082
search for them. 


17:13.082 --> 17:15.150
Who will help you
in the search? 


17:15.150 --> 17:17.820
According to John 4:23, 


17:17.820 --> 17:20.888
Jesus said that Jehovah 
is searching for ones 


17:20.888 --> 17:23.725
that want to worship in truth. 


17:23.725 --> 17:26.662
The majority 
will not listen to the truth 


17:26.662 --> 17:29.932
because ‘they love the darkness 
rather than the light.’ 


17:29.932 --> 17:33.135
The truth may expose 
their sinful conduct, 


17:33.135 --> 17:35.537
and they 
may not have the humility 


17:35.537 --> 17:38.307
to want 
to repent and change. 


17:38.307 --> 17:42.044
We still have to preach to them
—to warn them. 


17:42.043 --> 17:44.045
Ezekiel was told: 


17:44.045 --> 17:46.848
“You must warn them from me.” 


17:46.848 --> 17:49.000
The principle applies to us as well.


17:51.253 --> 17:54.790
Paul speaks of “the sword 
of . . . God’s word.” 


17:54.790 --> 17:58.327
Use it well 
to champion the truth. 


17:58.327 --> 18:03.499
Train your students 
to be good defenders of it as well. 


18:03.498 --> 18:07.068
The time will come 
in Paradise after the final test 


18:07.068 --> 18:09.236
when it will not be necessary 


18:09.237 --> 18:11.874
to champion, 
or defend, the truth, 


18:11.873 --> 18:15.210
because nobody 
will attack it anymore. 


18:15.210 --> 18:18.047
Right now, 
whether we are adults, 


18:18.047 --> 18:22.750
teenagers, or children, 
let us follow and imitate Jesus


18:22.750 --> 18:25.853
—the greatest Champion of truth! 


18:25.853 --> 18:28.723
To that end, 
keep studying the truth. 


18:28.723 --> 18:30.725
Keep spreading the truth. 


18:30.725 --> 18:34.663
Keep loving the truth 
and Jehovah, the God of truth. 


18:34.663 --> 18:38.133
Hold fast to the truth 
as to a lifeline


18:38.133 --> 18:40.401
—as this is what it is! 


18:40.402 --> 18:44.005
By staying faithful, 
whether you survive Armageddon 


18:44.005 --> 18:46.442
or are resurrected in Paradise, 


18:46.442 --> 18:50.000
you will be a victorious 
champion of the truth!


18:51.913 --> 18:55.350
Let’s now look at some examples 
of how our brothers and sisters 


18:55.350 --> 18:58.187
around the world 
faithfully champion the truth. 


18:58.187 --> 18:59.420
Chris?


18:59.420 --> 19:01.423
Thank you, Brother Lösch. 


19:01.423 --> 19:02.958
When a dear friend or perhaps 


19:02.958 --> 19:05.226
even a family member leaves the truth, 


19:05.227 --> 19:08.230
it can be a very challenging situation. 


19:08.230 --> 19:11.233
It can truly be a test of our faith 


19:11.233 --> 19:13.835
when we see something 
like that take place. 


19:13.835 --> 19:16.070
While watching 
this dramatization, 


19:16.070 --> 19:20.442
pay attention to how the mother
was able to champion the truth 


19:20.442 --> 19:23.000
by remaining 
loyal to Jehovah.


19:36.157 --> 19:39.160
My name is Gabriella. 


19:39.160 --> 19:41.263
Ben and I have always enjoyed 


19:41.263 --> 19:43.665
attending the meetings. 


19:43.665 --> 19:45.667
But lately, 


19:45.667 --> 19:47.702
it’s been difficult. 


19:47.702 --> 19:50.000
Something was missing


19:51.540 --> 19:53.000
—our son.


20:05.787 --> 20:10.000
It was like watching a movie 
of someone else’s family.


20:17.565 --> 20:21.000
I couldn’t believe 
this was happening to us.


20:49.063 --> 20:51.065
Our son, Levi, 


20:51.065 --> 20:55.000
was no longer 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


20:58.940 --> 21:02.110
The elders and friends 
in the congregation 


21:02.110 --> 21:05.280
were so supportive 
and understanding. 


21:05.280 --> 21:08.000
Many of them 
watched Levi grow up, 


21:09.450 --> 21:11.620
give his first talk, 


21:11.620 --> 21:14.000
get baptized.


21:34.977 --> 21:36.979
I was so torn. 


21:36.978 --> 21:41.048
I was disappointed in Levi 
for leaving Jehovah, 


21:41.048 --> 21:44.000
but I was 
more disappointed in myself. 


21:45.687 --> 21:49.000
I felt like we 
failed him somehow.


21:53.328 --> 21:56.665
I kept wondering 
how he was doing. 


21:56.665 --> 21:59.000
Was he OK?


22:07.808 --> 22:11.413
Then, as hard 
as the past few weeks had been, 


22:11.413 --> 22:14.983
it just got harder.


22:14.983 --> 22:16.985
I knew what the Bible said 


22:16.985 --> 22:20.255
about “quit mixing in company 
with anyone”


22:20.255 --> 22:23.592
who is not living 
according to Christian standards. 


22:23.592 --> 22:27.000
But I never thought that scripture 
would one day apply to me.


22:29.765 --> 22:32.367
Later that evening, 
a brother was talking 


22:32.367 --> 22:35.000
about the example 
of Korah’s sons.


22:46.548 --> 22:49.550
Jehovah confirmed that He 
was using Moses 


22:49.550 --> 22:53.755
to lead His people, 
not Korah. 


22:53.755 --> 22:55.857
When the people were told 
to move away 


22:55.857 --> 22:59.694
from the rebels’ tents, 
what would Korah’s sons do? 


22:59.693 --> 23:03.000
Would they put loyalty to family 
ahead of loyalty to Jehovah?


23:10.038 --> 23:12.873
The Bible tells us 
that his sons remained loyal 


23:12.873 --> 23:15.000
to Jehovah 
and were blessed for it.


23:18.280 --> 23:20.882
That night, 
after the meeting, 


23:20.882 --> 23:24.152
I told Ben about the text 
I received from Levi. 


23:24.152 --> 23:27.322
I told him everything


23:27.322 --> 23:30.725
—how I missed Levi so much, 


23:30.725 --> 23:35.230
but that I also wanted to be loyal 
to Jehovah like Korah’s sons. 


23:35.230 --> 23:37.732
Ben admitted that he too 


23:37.732 --> 23:40.000
had been struggling 
with feelings like mine.


23:41.235 --> 23:43.638
But then he said something 


23:43.638 --> 23:45.806
that I hadn’t thought of. 


23:45.807 --> 23:48.944
If we were to stand between Levi 


23:48.943 --> 23:51.011
and the discipline he needs, 


23:51.012 --> 23:53.349
we would, in effect, 
be blocking 


23:53.348 --> 23:55.183
an expression of Jehovah’s love 


23:55.183 --> 23:57.251
from reaching him. 


23:57.252 --> 24:00.355
In fact, 
it’s our very loyalty 


24:00.355 --> 24:04.658
to Jehovah 
that could save his life.


24:04.658 --> 24:06.661
We agreed to continue 
to put our trust 


24:06.662 --> 24:09.000
in Jehovah 
and stay loyal to him.


24:30.318 --> 24:32.720
It’s been five years now, 


24:32.720 --> 24:36.858
and while Levi 
still hasn’t returned to Jehovah, 


24:36.858 --> 24:39.560
I haven’t given up hope on him. 


24:39.560 --> 24:41.997
Until that day, 


24:41.997 --> 24:46.400
I’m staying busy as a regular pioneer 
and focusing my energies 


24:46.400 --> 24:49.000
on helping others 
learn about Jehovah.


24:50.572 --> 24:53.242
I’ve come to experience firsthand 


24:53.242 --> 24:56.979
the truth of Psalm 97:10. 


24:56.978 --> 25:00.000
Jehovah really does guard 
his loyal ones.


25:11.425 --> 25:15.097
What helped Gabriella overcome 
this difficult challenge? 


25:15.097 --> 25:16.565
For example, 


25:16.565 --> 25:19.500
when she received
a text message from her son, 


25:19.500 --> 25:21.502
she applied Scriptural counsel 


25:21.502 --> 25:23.739
to her personal circumstances. 


25:23.738 --> 25:26.206
The good example of Korah’s sons 


25:26.207 --> 25:29.144
gave her added motivation 
so as not to allow 


25:29.143 --> 25:32.846
her feelings for her son 
to dictate her actions. 


25:32.847 --> 25:37.985
Instead, she was firm 
in her loyalty to Jehovah.


25:37.985 --> 25:40.655
Also, her husband, Ben, 
had found an article 


25:40.655 --> 25:42.723
that helped 
the two of them appreciate 


25:42.723 --> 25:45.060
that they should make sure 
not to stand 


25:45.060 --> 25:48.128
between Jehovah 
and their son, Levi. 


25:48.128 --> 25:51.800
Instead, they wanted 
Jehovah’s expression of love 


25:51.800 --> 25:53.868
to reach Levi.


25:53.868 --> 25:56.638
Whenever we 
are faced with a trial, 


25:56.638 --> 25:59.340
we need to remember 
to pray constantly 


25:59.340 --> 26:02.977
to Jehovah for guidance 
and to look for Jehovah’s counsel 


26:02.977 --> 26:05.000
in our literature 
and during our meetings.


26:06.615 --> 26:10.352
The apostle Paul faced 
many challenges in his ministry. 


26:10.352 --> 26:14.555
In 2 Corinthians chapter 11, 
starting in verse 23, 


26:14.555 --> 26:16.958
he enumerates 
over 20 hardships 


26:16.958 --> 26:19.826
that he experienced 
in his ministry.


26:19.827 --> 26:23.365
What helped Paul 
to keep his motivation strong 


26:23.365 --> 26:25.767
despite everything he faced? 


26:25.767 --> 26:28.169
In this morning worship 
from Bethel, 


26:28.168 --> 26:30.171
Brother John Ekrann highlights 


26:30.172 --> 26:33.575
what Paul himself said 
kept him going.


26:33.575 --> 26:35.777
When you look 
at the words in the way 


26:35.777 --> 26:38.847
that the apostle Paul worded things, 


26:38.847 --> 26:42.250
he said: “I live by faith 
in the Son of God, 


26:42.250 --> 26:45.953
who loved me 
and handed himself over for me.” 


26:45.953 --> 26:48.623
And we can really see 
the very personal nature 


26:48.623 --> 26:50.958
of the ransom to the apostle Paul. 


26:50.958 --> 26:52.960
And it’s important for us to do


26:52.960 --> 26:55.563
—as our commenters 
pointed out nicely—


26:55.563 --> 26:58.966
it is important for us 
to personalize the ransom. 


26:58.967 --> 27:02.704
The apostle Paul, in Hebrews 6:5, 


27:02.703 --> 27:05.040
showed the very personal nature; 


27:05.040 --> 27:07.042
he understood the personal nature 


27:07.042 --> 27:10.112
of the Bible and the ransom. 


27:10.112 --> 27:12.814
In Hebrews 6:5, 


27:12.813 --> 27:14.948
he uses this expression: 


27:14.948 --> 27:18.520
“And who have tasted 
the fine word of God 


27:18.520 --> 27:21.222
and powers 
of the coming system of things.” 


27:21.222 --> 27:23.359
Well, it’s interesting 
he used the word “taste.” 


27:23.358 --> 27:25.093
Taste is something very personal. 


27:25.093 --> 27:27.495
Somebody can’t taste 
something for you. 


27:27.495 --> 27:29.563
You have to put it 
in your mouth in order 


27:29.563 --> 27:31.666
to really know 
what it’s going to taste like.


27:31.667 --> 27:33.669
So, too, with the ransom. 


27:33.668 --> 27:36.705
And what practical ways 
can we “taste,” 


27:36.705 --> 27:38.907
or personalize, 
the ransom for us? 


27:38.907 --> 27:41.309
Let’s just consider 
a couple this morning.


27:41.308 --> 27:43.911
One is personal fears. 


27:43.912 --> 27:45.980
‘Does God really love me? 


27:45.980 --> 27:48.048
Am I worthy of love?’ 


27:48.048 --> 27:51.518
Sometimes the “what-ifs” 
and their cousins, the “could-bes,” 


27:51.518 --> 27:54.921
they come to live and never leave. 


27:54.922 --> 27:58.460
You know, if bad things 
or trials or difficulties happen to us, 


27:58.460 --> 28:02.263
we begin to reason, 
‘Well, Jehovah God maybe doesn’t love me.’


28:02.263 --> 28:04.265
There’s really strong reason for us 


28:04.265 --> 28:06.400
to somehow believe 
in cause and effect. 


28:06.400 --> 28:09.437
We see the cause of things and effect,
and so after a while, 


28:09.437 --> 28:12.574
everything that happens to us, 
we begin to look at some cause 


28:12.573 --> 28:15.243
and even begin to think 
that maybe Jehovah 


28:15.243 --> 28:17.645
doesn’t love us. 


28:17.645 --> 28:20.115
Even if we’re a good person 


28:20.115 --> 28:23.385
and bad things happen to us, 
we begin to wonder, 


28:23.385 --> 28:25.820
‘Others my age are healthy.’ 


28:25.820 --> 28:28.890
Some leaving 
or changing assignments, 


28:28.890 --> 28:31.025
you hear everything 
falls into place 


28:31.025 --> 28:33.027
for them within a few weeks. 


28:33.027 --> 28:36.630
‘I’m still looking for a job. 
I’m still looking for work.’ 


28:36.630 --> 28:39.367
In other words, 
do not try to reason 


28:39.367 --> 28:41.770
that just because things 
don’t work out perfectly 


28:41.770 --> 28:43.838
that Jehovah doesn’t love us. 


28:43.838 --> 28:45.038
It’s not true. 


28:45.038 --> 28:47.708
We can still be doing very, 
very good things, 


28:47.708 --> 28:50.711
and yet some difficulties 
can face us.


28:50.712 --> 28:52.714
For example, 
you’re driving down the road, 


28:52.713 --> 28:54.915
obeying all the traffic laws. 


28:54.915 --> 28:57.985
You pull up to a red light, 
you stop, 


28:57.985 --> 29:00.588
it turns green, you go through it, 
and you get broadsided 


29:00.588 --> 29:04.758
by some knucklehead who went 
through the red light on the other side.


29:04.758 --> 29:07.228
Well, that’s not your fault. 


29:07.228 --> 29:09.263
Are you going to say: 
“Well, you know what? 


29:09.263 --> 29:12.266
I’m not going to obey traffic laws anymore.
See, it doesn’t pay!” 


29:12.267 --> 29:13.535
Well, no! 


29:13.535 --> 29:18.072
It was his fault for running 
through the traffic light. 


29:18.072 --> 29:21.777
And sometimes bad, or difficult, 
things can happen to us. 


29:21.777 --> 29:23.779
It’s not our fault 


29:23.778 --> 29:26.246
or it’s not any sign 
that Jehovah doesn’t love us. 


29:26.247 --> 29:28.850
So how can reflecting 
on the ransom help us 


29:28.850 --> 29:31.718
when we have these kinds 
of personal fears?


29:31.718 --> 29:34.655
Well, we could start with, 
Why do we have the ransom? 


29:34.655 --> 29:37.092
Well, because some very bad things 


29:37.092 --> 29:39.094
were happening 
to some good people


29:39.093 --> 29:42.096
—us—
Adam and Eve’s descendants. 


29:42.097 --> 29:44.999
I mean, 
Adam sinned and Eve sinned, 


29:44.998 --> 29:47.001
yet we suffer. 


29:47.002 --> 29:49.670
The ransom is Jehovah’s solution 


29:49.670 --> 29:51.705
for those who appreciate it. 


29:51.705 --> 29:53.708
It’s his way of telling us, 


29:53.708 --> 29:55.710
‘I know bad things are happening, 


29:55.710 --> 29:57.978
and I’m working to fix it.’ 


29:57.978 --> 30:00.481
Yes, when we reflect 
on the reason 


30:00.482 --> 30:03.117
why Jehovah God 
gave us the ransom, 


30:03.117 --> 30:05.587
it helps us to know 
that Jehovah knows we suffer 


30:05.587 --> 30:08.990
from cancer and old age 
and the sins and mistakes of others 


30:08.990 --> 30:11.692
and even our own imperfections. 


30:11.692 --> 30:14.562
See, tasting of the ransom in this way 


30:14.562 --> 30:17.232
means we’ll not get the feeling 


30:17.232 --> 30:20.235
that Jehovah doesn’t love us 
when trials befall us. 


30:20.235 --> 30:22.670
To the contrary, the ransom 


30:22.670 --> 30:26.673
is the greatest expression 
of Jehovah’s and Jesus’ love for us 


30:26.673 --> 30:30.678
and their desire to fix 
the current mess we live in now.


30:30.678 --> 30:32.813
How about, 
let’s consider a second way 


30:32.813 --> 30:35.015
that we could reflect 
on the ransom, 


30:35.015 --> 30:38.553
and that is the death 
of someone close to us. 


30:38.553 --> 30:41.688
Anyone who’s had someone 
very close to them die 


30:41.688 --> 30:44.758
knows the very helpless feeling 
that you have, 


30:44.758 --> 30:48.495
knowing that there’s 
really nothing you can do. 


30:48.495 --> 30:51.732
In that instant when they die, 
your hope


30:51.732 --> 30:55.737
—your faith in the resurrection 
based on the ransom—


30:55.737 --> 30:59.000
becomes more real to you 
than any time in your entire life. 


31:00.475 --> 31:03.510
In Acts 17:31, 


31:03.510 --> 31:06.915
in a beautiful speech 
that the apostle Paul gave, 


31:06.915 --> 31:08.917
he highlights 


31:08.917 --> 31:11.652
that Jesus’ death 


31:11.652 --> 31:14.722
and resurrection and the ransom 
was really a guarantee 


31:14.722 --> 31:16.757
that we have. 


31:16.757 --> 31:20.429
Here in Acts 17:31, 


31:20.428 --> 31:23.598
he says: “Because he has set a day 
on which he purposes 


31:23.598 --> 31:26.300
“to judge the inhabited earth 
in righteousness 


31:26.300 --> 31:28.970
“by a man 
whom he has appointed, 


31:28.970 --> 31:31.638
“and he has provided 
a guarantee 


31:31.638 --> 31:35.175
“to all men 
by resurrecting him 


31:35.175 --> 31:37.212
from the dead.” 


31:37.212 --> 31:39.414
So personalizing the ransom 


31:39.413 --> 31:41.515
and all that it makes possible 


31:41.515 --> 31:45.118
helps us to know that the resurrection is, 
not just possible, 


31:45.118 --> 31:48.121
but that Jehovah 
and Jesus want to resurrect 


31:48.122 --> 31:50.190
our mother, our father, 


31:50.190 --> 31:53.728
our beloved husband or a wife. 


31:53.728 --> 31:56.496
They care about each person 


31:56.497 --> 31:59.434
that has ever lived or died 


31:59.433 --> 32:02.103
and know them 
so intimately and so completely 


32:02.103 --> 32:05.171
that they can resurrect them completely 
with all their memories 


32:05.172 --> 32:08.509
and personality completely 
as we knew them. 


32:08.508 --> 32:10.978
I mean, how much more personal 


32:10.978 --> 32:14.315
could God’s love for us 
become than that?


32:14.315 --> 32:17.952
You know, to bring our loved ones 
back from the dead 


32:17.952 --> 32:20.422
is the ultimate statement 


32:20.422 --> 32:23.224
of Jehovah’s personal interest 


32:23.223 --> 32:26.926
in each and every human being. 


32:26.927 --> 32:30.599
We are not just collateral damage 


32:30.598 --> 32:33.266
in Satan’s war on Jehovah. 


32:33.267 --> 32:35.637
The ransom is the way 


32:35.637 --> 32:38.105
that Jehovah plans 
to undo all the harm 


32:38.105 --> 32:40.107
that Satan has caused 


32:40.107 --> 32:43.177
since the death of Adam and Eve. 


32:43.177 --> 32:46.680
In fact, the resurrection 
is really Jehovah’s way 


32:46.680 --> 32:49.250
of proving all of Satan’s lies 


32:49.250 --> 32:51.385
completely false. 


32:51.385 --> 32:54.055
When you think about it today, 
Satan can perpetrate 


32:54.055 --> 32:56.857
all kinds of lies about what happens 
to people after they die. 


32:56.857 --> 32:58.325
‘They’re going to go here, 
they’re going to go there, 


32:58.325 --> 33:00.928
‘they’re going to go to some afterlife, 
they’re going to go to some paradise, 


33:00.928 --> 33:03.731
they’re going to come back 
as some animal.’ 


33:03.732 --> 33:05.767
But in the new world, 


33:05.767 --> 33:07.969
when the vast majority of people 


33:07.968 --> 33:11.171
have been resurrected, 


33:11.172 --> 33:14.375
that lie isn’t going 
to be sold anymore. 


33:14.375 --> 33:16.643
Each one can tell everyone 


33:16.643 --> 33:18.780
what happened to them 
when they died


33:18.780 --> 33:21.048
—nothing, 


33:21.048 --> 33:23.383
no afterlife. 


33:23.383 --> 33:27.288
Everyone will know 
that it’s nonexistence. 


33:27.288 --> 33:29.490
That lie won’t work. 


33:29.490 --> 33:31.758
See, Jehovah knew 


33:31.758 --> 33:34.628
that we would hurt terribly 


33:34.628 --> 33:36.696
at the death of loved ones, 


33:36.697 --> 33:39.467
so he gave us the ransom 


33:39.467 --> 33:41.669
as his way of telling us, 


33:41.668 --> 33:45.338
‘I know it hurts, 
but please know 


33:45.338 --> 33:49.110
that I have 
the perfect solution in mind.’


33:49.110 --> 33:51.912
Now, we’ve just considered two ways 


33:51.912 --> 33:53.982
to reflect and meditate on the ransom, 


33:53.982 --> 33:56.984
like the apostle Paul did, 
to really personalize it. 


33:56.983 --> 33:59.253
We just talked about personal fears 


33:59.253 --> 34:02.456
and the resurrection, 


34:02.457 --> 34:04.759
the death of someone close to us. 


34:04.758 --> 34:07.161
Imagine how many more ways 


34:07.162 --> 34:09.597
we can benefit today 


34:09.597 --> 34:11.599
from meditating on the ransom 


34:11.598 --> 34:15.000
and how it affects us personally.


34:16.037 --> 34:18.039
As ministers of Jehovah, 


34:18.038 --> 34:20.908
we take part in preaching 
the good news. 


34:20.908 --> 34:23.745
That good news includes 
the wonderful provision 


34:23.745 --> 34:26.580
of the ransom 
Brother Ekrann highlighted. 


34:26.580 --> 34:30.317
Have you ever participated 
in a preaching campaign? 


34:30.317 --> 34:32.854
I’m sure you 
have enjoyed campaigns 


34:32.853 --> 34:35.490
such as inviting 
our neighbors to the Memorial 


34:35.490 --> 34:37.492
or the regional convention. 


34:37.492 --> 34:40.495
On occasion, 
other campaigns are approved 


34:40.495 --> 34:42.863
by the Service Committee 
of the Governing Body 


34:42.863 --> 34:46.966
when there is a specific need 
in an area or language group. 


34:46.967 --> 34:49.204
We bring you a report 


34:49.203 --> 34:52.000
on a special campaign 
in Armenia.


34:55.777 --> 34:59.180
Armenia is an ancient country 
with rich history, 


34:59.180 --> 35:02.000
situated in the lands 
of Mount Ararat.


35:04.485 --> 35:06.887
In the Caucasus region, 
Lake Sevan 


35:06.887 --> 35:09.000
is considered to be 
a prized jewel.


35:13.627 --> 35:15.964
Diversity of its flora and fauna 


35:15.963 --> 35:18.000
contribute to the unique 
and beautiful countryside.


35:21.402 --> 35:23.839
Yerevan, the capital, 


35:23.838 --> 35:27.073
is a modern metropolis 
with picturesque views 


35:27.073 --> 35:30.911
that remind many of Paris 
with its trees, cafés, 


35:30.912 --> 35:33.000
and beautiful water fountains.


35:38.252 --> 35:43.000
Recently, a special three-week 
preaching campaign took place.


35:44.425 --> 35:47.195
Groups of Armenian-speaking 
Jehovah’s Witnesses 


35:47.195 --> 35:48.762
from six different countries 


35:48.762 --> 35:52.000
wholeheartedly responded 
to the invitation.


35:58.005 --> 36:01.508
The main purpose of the campaign 
was to cover as many


36:01.508 --> 36:04.678
of the 512 unassigned territories
as possible 


36:04.678 --> 36:06.846
with the Kingdom good news. 


36:06.847 --> 36:08.850
Thus, an opportunity 


36:08.850 --> 36:12.220
for an interchange 
of encouragement was created 


36:12.220 --> 36:16.000
for both the local friends 
and the campaign participants.


36:17.858 --> 36:20.360
They were warmly greeted 
at the airport 


36:20.360 --> 36:23.000
by local brothers and sisters.


36:28.602 --> 36:32.407
The Witnesses made good use 
of their tablets and smartphones to show


36:32.407 --> 36:36.244
videos from the jw.org website.


36:36.243 --> 36:39.080
Armenia is also currently home 


36:39.080 --> 36:43.083
to over 11,000 Western-Armenian refugees.


36:43.083 --> 36:46.320
A special effort was made 
to share with these individuals 


36:46.320 --> 36:49.457
the positive message of hope
and peace from the Bible


36:49.457 --> 36:52.794
in their native tongue, 
West Armenian.


36:52.793 --> 36:56.163
Metropolitan witnessing 
served as an effective way 


36:56.163 --> 36:58.565
to reach these ones.


36:58.565 --> 37:00.802
It was the first time in my life 


37:00.802 --> 37:03.170
that I participated in public witnessing, 


37:03.170 --> 37:05.172
and it was very encouraging. 


37:05.172 --> 37:07.942
When individuals would approach us 
and show interest, 


37:07.942 --> 37:10.645
I could explain to them 
the truth in their own language. 


37:10.645 --> 37:12.647
It was amazing.


37:12.647 --> 37:14.815
It’s been very heartwarming. 


37:14.815 --> 37:17.485
People have really responded well. 


37:17.485 --> 37:19.120
They were in need of comfort


37:19.120 --> 37:20.688
and the good news, especially those that 


37:20.688 --> 37:22.990
we came for,
the Western Armenians. 


37:22.990 --> 37:25.660
Pretty much every door invited us in, 


37:25.660 --> 37:27.928
and they were very hospitable 
and receptive.


37:27.928 --> 37:30.831
After we heard the announcement 
about the special campaign 


37:30.832 --> 37:34.169
in the Western language 
that’s going to take place in Armenia, 


37:34.168 --> 37:36.170
we said: “We cannot miss this. 


37:36.170 --> 37:38.172
“We have to be there 
and bring our share 


37:38.172 --> 37:41.509
in this very joyful
preaching campaign.”


37:41.508 --> 37:43.810
During the three-week campaign, 


37:43.810 --> 37:45.880
over 15,000 pieces 


37:45.880 --> 37:49.183
of Bible-based literature 
were left with interested ones, 


37:49.183 --> 37:52.000
and over 200 Bible studies 
were started.


37:54.522 --> 37:56.957
We were very happy to see 


37:56.957 --> 37:59.860
how many brothers and sisters 
were ready to come 


37:59.860 --> 38:01.862
for the campaign in Armenia 


38:01.862 --> 38:04.499
from different countries 
around the world.


38:04.498 --> 38:06.500
That response showed 


38:06.500 --> 38:09.870
that Jehovah has blessed our efforts.


38:09.870 --> 38:12.038
Those who came from far and wide 


38:12.038 --> 38:14.141
greatly appreciated the share 


38:14.142 --> 38:16.377
they had in this special event.


38:16.377 --> 38:18.980
Everyone was so happy to see us. 


38:18.980 --> 38:21.048
And when we were giving them a Bible, 


38:21.048 --> 38:24.985
they were so excited to find answers
from their own Bible.


38:24.985 --> 38:27.220
I’m so blessed to be here. 


38:27.220 --> 38:29.223
This has been the best vacation 


38:29.223 --> 38:31.825
that we have had as a family.


38:31.825 --> 38:34.495
The first time I came to Armenia, 


38:34.495 --> 38:36.663
it was in 1982. 


38:36.663 --> 38:38.831
And I looked for the Witnesses, 


38:38.832 --> 38:42.002
and I hardly found just a few. 


38:42.002 --> 38:45.339
But now that I came 
for this campaign, 


38:45.338 --> 38:48.408
we have 11,000 Witnesses! 


38:48.408 --> 38:52.000
I’m really so happy! 
I really want to come back!


38:53.547 --> 38:57.217
It is our hope that Jehovah God 
continues to help 


38:57.217 --> 38:59.720
all sorts of people to be saved 


38:59.720 --> 39:03.000
and come 
to an accurate knowledge of truth.


39:07.395 --> 39:09.397
While we 
enjoy relative freedom 


39:09.397 --> 39:11.665
in many countries 
around the world, 


39:11.665 --> 39:14.202
at times governments 
impose bans 


39:14.202 --> 39:16.737
or restrictions 
on the preaching work. 


39:16.737 --> 39:18.739
Brother Stephanos Demsas 


39:18.738 --> 39:22.543
serves as a special pioneer 
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, 


39:22.543 --> 39:25.411
along with his wife, Leteberhan. 


39:25.412 --> 39:29.350
Their faith was tested 
during many years of adversity. 


39:29.350 --> 39:32.820
What helped them 
champion the truth? 


39:32.820 --> 39:36.000
Their story began 
in what is today Eritrea.


39:43.030 --> 39:45.298
I come from a family 
of nine children. 


39:45.298 --> 39:48.235
I joined the navy in 1956. 


39:48.235 --> 39:49.503
That was during the time 


39:49.503 --> 39:52.171
when Eritrea was part of Ethiopia. 


39:52.172 --> 39:54.242
My brother Gebrehiwot 


39:54.242 --> 39:56.810
asked me to come to Asmara. 


39:56.810 --> 39:59.080
He was studying the Bible 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


39:59.080 --> 40:02.215
I was so impressed 
with what he shared with me 


40:02.215 --> 40:04.485
that for the rest of my vacation, 


40:04.485 --> 40:07.320
Bible study became my priority. 


40:07.320 --> 40:09.590
In time, 
I was discharged from the navy 


40:09.590 --> 40:11.925
and started working 
in Addis Ababa, 


40:11.925 --> 40:13.993
so I was able to continue studying 


40:13.993 --> 40:16.000
the Bible and get baptized. 


40:17.432 --> 40:20.000
Leti was also doing the same.


40:23.437 --> 40:27.509
In 1960, 
I was attending a nursing college. 


40:27.508 --> 40:30.710
There, a nurse shared 
some interesting thoughts 


40:30.710 --> 40:32.880
with me from the Bible. 


40:32.880 --> 40:36.550
Ten other student nurses 
also showed interest. 


40:36.550 --> 40:40.620
But the college 
threatened us with dismissal 


40:40.620 --> 40:44.625
because there was a ban 
on Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


40:44.625 --> 40:46.893
When we were shown from the Bible 


40:46.893 --> 40:49.963
why true Christians are persecuted, 


40:49.963 --> 40:53.566
we renewed our determination. 


40:53.567 --> 40:57.204
Eventually, 
five of us were baptized. 


40:57.203 --> 40:59.340
In time, I met Stephanos, 


40:59.340 --> 41:02.000
and we were married in 1964.


41:03.443 --> 41:05.445
Because of the ban, 


41:05.445 --> 41:08.048
the brothers were meeting 
in small groups. 


41:08.048 --> 41:11.451
Our trust was in Jehovah, 
and we made the preaching work 


41:11.452 --> 41:14.422
a matter of prayer, 
confident that he would help us.


41:14.422 --> 41:16.624
We saw evidence of this 


41:16.623 --> 41:19.726
with the underground production 
of The Watchtower.


41:19.727 --> 41:22.195
Our brothers were of modest means, 


41:22.195 --> 41:25.867
but they used what they had to buy 
a hand-operated duplicating machine 


41:25.867 --> 41:27.802
which was used in our home. 


41:27.802 --> 41:30.170
After returning
from our secular work, 


41:30.170 --> 41:33.773
Leti and I would get busy 
making copies of The Watchtower. 


41:33.773 --> 41:35.910
We would play music
so our neighbors 


41:35.910 --> 41:38.000
wouldn’t hear the sound
of the duplicator.


41:39.880 --> 41:41.882
In 1974, 


41:41.882 --> 41:45.085
Emperor Haile Selassie was deposed. 


41:45.085 --> 41:47.420
This Communist government quickly began 


41:47.420 --> 41:50.090
a campaign called “Red Terror” 


41:50.090 --> 41:53.693
against any supposed political opposer. 


41:53.693 --> 41:57.598
Now, just having a typewriter 
or a duplicating machine 


41:57.598 --> 42:01.000
could put you in prison 
or even have you killed. 


42:02.468 --> 42:04.471
Picking up a paper
from the street 


42:04.472 --> 42:06.740
with something printed on it 
against the government 


42:06.740 --> 42:09.075
could put one’s life in danger. 


42:09.075 --> 42:12.613
It was common 
for people to disappear. 


42:12.613 --> 42:15.348
Sadly, my youngest brother, 


42:15.348 --> 42:17.551
Eyob, was a victim. 


42:17.552 --> 42:20.120
He disappeared on his way home 


42:20.120 --> 42:23.000
and was never seen again.


42:27.060 --> 42:29.697
With the situation
being very dangerous, 


42:29.697 --> 42:31.699
we were quite concerned 


42:31.698 --> 42:34.835
raising our daughter, Janet. 


42:34.835 --> 42:37.638
But as we fully trusted in Jehovah, 


42:37.638 --> 42:40.406
we felt his loving protection.


42:40.407 --> 42:42.744
From time to time,
sections of the city 


42:42.743 --> 42:44.945
were suddenly blockaded.


42:44.945 --> 42:47.982
This happened one morning 
as a translator 


42:47.982 --> 42:51.919
was heading to our home 
to deliver stencils for printing. 


42:51.918 --> 42:54.321
Urgently, he telephoned 


42:54.322 --> 42:56.690
informing us 
that a house-to-house search


42:56.690 --> 42:58.258
was under way. 


42:58.258 --> 43:01.228
Our house was full of publications 


43:01.228 --> 43:04.196
along with a duplicator
and typewriters!


43:04.197 --> 43:06.700
Just after the phone call, 


43:06.700 --> 43:10.000
three soldiers 
entered our compound to search.


43:11.505 --> 43:13.507
At that moment, 


43:13.507 --> 43:17.510
I prayed silently 
that Jehovah would blind them.


43:17.510 --> 43:20.047
Entering the room 
where the duplicator 


43:20.047 --> 43:22.684
and stacks 
of freshly printed literature were, 


43:22.683 --> 43:26.620
one soldier asked, 
“What is all this?” 


43:26.620 --> 43:29.390
“Oh, this is a duplicator that we use 


43:29.390 --> 43:31.392
to print these Bible materials.” 


43:31.392 --> 43:33.394
Completing his search, 


43:33.393 --> 43:35.495
he went outside
to the commander, 


43:35.495 --> 43:38.298
who asked him,
“What did you find?” 


43:38.298 --> 43:40.300
To our utter amazement, 


43:40.300 --> 43:43.037
after seeing everything, 
he answered: 


43:43.037 --> 43:46.974
“Nothing! 
We won’t find anything here.”


43:46.973 --> 43:50.110
In the late 1970’s 
and into the early 80’s, 


43:50.110 --> 43:53.380
another wave 
of vicious persecution occurred. 


43:53.380 --> 43:56.250
A number of faithful brothers 
were imprisoned, 


43:56.250 --> 43:59.620
tortured, and murdered. 


43:59.620 --> 44:02.923
I was taken from my work place 
because of my neutral stand 


44:02.923 --> 44:05.591
and put in prison.


44:05.592 --> 44:09.330
When I think about living through 
those difficult times, 


44:09.330 --> 44:12.867
I am reminded of Isaiah 54:17 


44:12.867 --> 44:14.935
where Jehovah promised us: 


44:14.935 --> 44:18.000
“No weapon formed against you
 will have any success.”


44:20.873 --> 44:22.910
Finally, in 1991, 


44:22.910 --> 44:25.012
a liberal government came to power. 


44:25.012 --> 44:27.547
They gave us legal recognition 


44:27.547 --> 44:30.000
and freedom of worship.


44:31.085 --> 44:33.820
With these difficult, 
dangerous years 


44:33.820 --> 44:37.223
now behind us, 
we were assigned to the circuit work 


44:37.223 --> 44:40.000
in Eritrea and Ethiopia.


44:41.828 --> 44:43.830
By now, Eritrea was becoming 


44:43.830 --> 44:46.467
an independent country, 
and this brought about 


44:46.467 --> 44:48.469
new challenges for the brothers. 


44:48.468 --> 44:50.503
Some young brothers 
were arrested and imprisoned 


44:50.503 --> 44:52.773
because of their Christian stand. 


44:52.773 --> 44:56.043
Paul wrote at Hebrews 13:3: 


44:56.043 --> 44:58.178
“Keep in mind those in prison, 


44:58.178 --> 45:01.348
as though you were imprisoned with them.”


45:01.348 --> 45:03.350
After enjoying the circuit work 


45:03.350 --> 45:07.153
for 15 years, 
we faced another change. 


45:07.153 --> 45:09.790
We were invited to serve at Bethel 


45:09.790 --> 45:12.993
as full-time commuters. 


45:12.993 --> 45:15.795
What has helped us to endure 
through the ban years 


45:15.795 --> 45:18.732
and to adjust to the many changes 


45:18.732 --> 45:21.735
is our spiritual study program.


45:21.735 --> 45:23.737
We’re in full agreement 


45:23.737 --> 45:26.340
with Jeremiah 17:7: 


45:26.340 --> 45:28.342
“Blessed is the man 


45:28.342 --> 45:31.479
who puts his trust in Jehovah.” 


45:31.478 --> 45:34.113
It also brings us much happiness 


45:34.113 --> 45:37.316
to know that our daughter, Janet, 
has been serving 


45:37.317 --> 45:41.455
as a regular pioneer 
for 20 years now.


45:41.455 --> 45:43.990
Each assignment
has had its challenges 


45:43.990 --> 45:46.260
but many rewards and blessings. 


45:46.260 --> 45:48.262
I’m not young anymore; 


45:48.262 --> 45:50.364
I’m 77 years old.


45:50.363 --> 45:52.365
And I’m 74 years old.


45:52.365 --> 45:56.035
We are now serving
as special pioneers. 


45:56.035 --> 45:59.338
When we think about all the changes 
that we’ve been through, 


45:59.338 --> 46:02.541
we realize 
that the words at Isaiah 6:8: 


46:02.542 --> 46:04.545
“Here I am! Send me!” 


46:04.545 --> 46:08.000
are, not just for young people, 
but for all of us.


46:10.783 --> 46:12.886
It is very encouraging to see 


46:12.887 --> 46:15.555
Stephanos 
and Leteberhan’s determination 


46:15.555 --> 46:18.625
to stay faithful to Jehovah, 
come what may. 


46:18.625 --> 46:20.960
We know that Jehovah 
looks with delight 


46:20.960 --> 46:23.563
on their many years of service. 


46:23.563 --> 46:25.765
Some of our brothers in Canada 


46:25.765 --> 46:28.168
underwent similar persecution. 


46:28.168 --> 46:30.370
How did Jehovah help them? 


46:30.370 --> 46:33.907
Pay special attention 
to the numerous acts of courage 


46:33.907 --> 46:36.000
displayed by these 
champions of truth.


46:38.578 --> 46:42.381
Preaching in the province of Quebec 
was a real challenge. 


46:42.382 --> 46:43.917
The Catholic Church 


46:43.917 --> 46:48.989
was present 
in every sphere of public life.


46:48.988 --> 46:52.091
In the early ’40s,
the persecution 


46:52.092 --> 46:54.360
took on quite a bit 


46:54.360 --> 46:56.163
of emphasis. 


46:56.163 --> 46:58.431
Many Witnesses were being arrested. 


46:58.432 --> 47:00.934
Any excuse was used. 


47:00.933 --> 47:03.336
Peddling without a license


47:03.337 --> 47:05.339
—this was a favorite excuse. 


47:05.338 --> 47:07.875
Jehovah’s Witnesses were put in prison 


47:07.875 --> 47:11.110
whenever they were seen 
with religious literature.


47:11.110 --> 47:14.247
It had got so bad in Quebec 


47:14.247 --> 47:18.152
that it was decided to circulate a petition, 


47:18.152 --> 47:21.655
and this petition was circulated 
throughout Canada. 


47:21.655 --> 47:24.525
And it called 
on the government of Quebec 


47:24.525 --> 47:27.327
to put an end 
to this persecution. 


47:27.327 --> 47:29.329
And interestingly, 


47:29.328 --> 47:33.666
some 600,000 people 
signed the petition.


47:33.667 --> 47:36.270
The Witnesses distributed 


47:36.270 --> 47:39.272
a very fiery tract 


47:39.272 --> 47:41.275
called the Burning Hate of Quebec. 


47:41.275 --> 47:42.842
And in this tract, 


47:42.842 --> 47:45.545
they showed 
what was really happening


47:45.545 --> 47:48.082
—the actions of the policemen, 


47:48.082 --> 47:51.819
the illegal arrests, 
the mob action. 


47:51.818 --> 47:53.820
Within four months, 


47:53.820 --> 47:56.990
there were 800 new court cases. 


47:56.990 --> 48:00.127
So here, 
for 400 Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


48:00.127 --> 48:03.530
you had 1,600 court cases.


48:03.530 --> 48:05.532
The seriousness 


48:05.532 --> 48:09.002
of the court cases increased, 
in that now 


48:09.002 --> 48:13.074
they were accusing 
the brothers of sedition. 


48:13.073 --> 48:15.075
If convicted, 
it was more than 10


48:15.075 --> 48:17.677
—maybe 12 or 15—
years in prison.


48:17.677 --> 48:20.014
We had one brother,
Aimé Boucher, 


48:20.013 --> 48:23.950
who was arrested 
and charged with sedition.


48:23.950 --> 48:27.620
Aimé Boucher 
was a very poor brother, 


48:27.620 --> 48:29.890
who lived 
in a rural part of Quebec. 


48:29.890 --> 48:31.558
And he actually 


48:31.558 --> 48:35.928
went to court 
with his ox and buggy.


48:35.928 --> 48:37.931
And on the way to court, 


48:37.932 --> 48:40.934
he was preaching, 
so he was arrested again. 


48:40.933 --> 48:44.136
They had the court hearing, 
and he was condemned. 


48:44.137 --> 48:47.040
He was found guilty of sedition. 


48:47.040 --> 48:49.910
And his case went up 
to the Court of Appeal


48:49.910 --> 48:53.780
—and at that time, the Court of Appeal 
of Quebec was very hostile—


48:53.780 --> 48:56.182
and he lost on appeal, 


48:56.182 --> 48:59.887
so it went up 
to the Supreme Court of Canada. 


48:59.887 --> 49:01.422
And by this time,


49:01.422 --> 49:04.290
there were several 
other brothers and sisters 


49:04.290 --> 49:06.760
also charged on sedition, 


49:06.760 --> 49:09.295
which meant that if he lost his case, 


49:09.295 --> 49:11.298
we had several going to prison 


49:11.298 --> 49:14.566
for very lengthy prison terms.


49:14.567 --> 49:16.904
When Brother Boucher’s case 


49:16.903 --> 49:19.438
came before the Supreme Court, 


49:19.438 --> 49:22.775
he lost by a majority of one. 


49:22.775 --> 49:26.447
The Catholic judges 
all ruled against him, 


49:26.447 --> 49:28.782
and they found that the tract 


49:28.782 --> 49:31.852
the Burning Hate of Quebec 
was seditious.


49:31.852 --> 49:34.722
Our lawyers looked at the situation, 


49:34.722 --> 49:37.190
prayed about it, and thought: 


49:37.190 --> 49:39.760
‘What can we do? 
We can’t lose this battle.’ 


49:39.760 --> 49:41.962
And they realized that in Canada 


49:41.962 --> 49:44.630
there was a very rarely used provision 


49:44.630 --> 49:47.567
of asking the Supreme Court 
for a rehearing.


49:47.567 --> 49:50.570
At the rehearing, 
one of the Catholic judges 


49:50.570 --> 49:52.572
was willing to discuss further 


49:52.572 --> 49:55.609
the issue of sedition. 


49:55.608 --> 49:58.211
And to be guilty of sedition, 


49:58.212 --> 50:01.615
you have to incite to violence. 


50:01.615 --> 50:04.685
So our attorney asked them: 


50:04.685 --> 50:06.753
“Please, look at the record. 


50:06.753 --> 50:09.923
“Show the court 
where Jehovah’s Witnesses 


50:09.923 --> 50:11.925
incited to violence.” 


50:11.925 --> 50:15.362
And finally, they were able 
to convince a court they were wrong. 


50:15.362 --> 50:17.964
And so they overturned 
their initial decision, 


50:17.963 --> 50:21.300
and Brother Boucher’s case 


50:21.300 --> 50:23.303
was victorious.


50:23.303 --> 50:27.506
This dealt with all 
the accusations of sedition 


50:27.507 --> 50:31.979
and really brought to an end 
the vicious opposition, 


50:31.978 --> 50:34.580
because that case 
was the one the government 


50:34.580 --> 50:37.000
was hoping would work out for them.


50:38.052 --> 50:41.722
There is one case 
that’s quite noteworthy in Quebec. 


50:41.722 --> 50:44.624
And it’s a case of the priest 


50:44.623 --> 50:47.560
calling up the federal police 


50:47.560 --> 50:50.597
to come and interrupt 


50:50.597 --> 50:53.167
a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


50:53.167 --> 50:58.272
and expel the speaker 
from the province of Quebec. 


50:58.272 --> 51:00.607
The police obeyed the priest. 


51:00.607 --> 51:03.410
They went to the meeting, 
they took the brother, 


51:03.410 --> 51:07.613
and they escorted him 
out of the province into Ontario.


51:07.613 --> 51:11.485
And to disrupt a religious meeting 
was a criminal act. 


51:11.485 --> 51:15.322
For the first time
—and it’s at the level of the Supreme Court—


51:15.322 --> 51:17.657
they found that the three policemen 


51:17.657 --> 51:21.160
had to pay moral damages 
to the brothers 


51:21.160 --> 51:24.297
for intercepting, 
or interrupting, the meeting. 


51:24.297 --> 51:26.232
This has never happened before.


51:26.232 --> 51:28.502
And when it came up 
to the Supreme Court, 


51:28.502 --> 51:31.037
they unanimously ruled 


51:31.037 --> 51:33.174
against the province of Quebec. 


51:33.173 --> 51:35.975
The section on religious freedom 


51:35.975 --> 51:39.445
is the result of these court cases. 


51:39.445 --> 51:44.050
Every lawyer in Canada 
(whether in Quebec or in English Canada), 


51:44.050 --> 51:46.920
when he studies law, 
must review these cases. 


51:46.920 --> 51:51.323
They are the fundamentals 
of religious freedom. 


51:51.323 --> 51:53.726
And they represent 
the different areas


51:53.727 --> 51:58.732
—police action, government action, 
criminal action—


51:58.732 --> 52:02.469
and they lay a very nice basis 


52:02.468 --> 52:05.938
for our freedoms today.


52:05.938 --> 52:09.208
Our purpose is to be able 
to preach the good news 


52:09.208 --> 52:12.945
and to direct people’s attention 
toward the Bible. 


52:12.945 --> 52:16.483
But our court cases 
have helped governments, 


52:16.483 --> 52:19.485
courts, judges, 


52:19.485 --> 52:23.423
and officials 
to have the right point of view 


52:23.423 --> 52:26.000
on the issue of religious freedom.


52:28.395 --> 52:31.463
The endurance and hard work 
of our brothers in Quebec 


52:31.463 --> 52:34.400
truly resulted in a witness 
to the nations. 


52:34.400 --> 52:37.137
While the hope 
for a positive outcome 


52:37.137 --> 52:40.140
can at times provide us 
with needed motivation, 


52:40.140 --> 52:42.208
we can’t always expect support 


52:42.208 --> 52:45.045
from the authorities 
in this system of things. 


52:45.045 --> 52:47.780
The same applies 
in many areas of life, 


52:47.780 --> 52:50.117
whatever trials we may face. 


52:50.117 --> 52:52.652
Perhaps you have lost 
a loved one in death. 


52:52.652 --> 52:55.655
Looking forward to a time 
just around the corner 


52:55.655 --> 52:57.657
can help us endure. 


52:57.657 --> 53:00.727
That’s also the title 
of this month’s music video, 


53:00.727 --> 53:03.000
Just Around the Corner.


53:14.140 --> 53:22.215
You can hear the songbirds singing,
And you watch the clouds roll by.


53:22.215 --> 53:30.323
Then you’re walking in the valley
As the sun shines in a clear blue sky.


53:30.323 --> 53:37.896
You’re welcoming your loved ones,
And you can’t believe your eyes.


53:37.897 --> 53:46.000
Yes, this earthly Paradise
Was just around the corner.


53:50.377 --> 53:57.717
There’s a house down in the valley
And a house high on the hill.


53:57.717 --> 54:06.559
There is singing by the river
As the water flows and turns the mill.


54:06.558 --> 54:14.466
The golden fields are waiting.
Let the harvesting begin.


54:14.467 --> 54:22.142
Once the world we’re living in
Was just around the corner.


54:22.142 --> 54:30.317
It’s great to share with friends who care
The things that we looked forward to.


54:30.317 --> 54:38.325
Now every tear has disappeared.
The world is young, and life is new.


54:38.325 --> 54:45.932
There’s the sound of happy voices
And the scent of new mown hay.


54:45.932 --> 54:54.340
Now you’re calling to your loved ones
As you start another perfect day.


54:54.340 --> 55:01.682
Then we thank our God, Jehovah,
For his tender loving care.


55:01.682 --> 55:10.290
Yes, the blessings we all share
Were just around the corner.


55:10.290 --> 55:18.365
And evʹry day I smile and say,
“How good to see your happy face!”


55:18.365 --> 55:26.538
ʹCause once, it seemed, I only dreamed
That you’d be in my warm embrace.


55:26.538 --> 55:34.113
Waiting ʹround the corner
Is a world I long to see.


55:34.113 --> 55:42.288
It’s a promise from Jehovah.
It’s a guaranteed reality.


55:42.288 --> 55:50.296
And it’s hard to get downhearted
When I think of what’s in store.


55:50.297 --> 55:58.000
It’s the day I’m waiting for,
And it’s just around the corner.


56:09.982 --> 56:12.385
What a beautiful song! 


56:12.385 --> 56:14.987
Personally, I lost my father 


56:14.987 --> 56:16.990
when I was two years old. 


56:16.990 --> 56:20.660
He was a soldier in World War II 
and was killed in battle. 


56:20.660 --> 56:24.063
I never had an opportunity 
to get to know him. 


56:24.063 --> 56:27.000
Growing up, 
I missed having a father 


56:27.000 --> 56:29.602
because I saw 
everyone else had one. 


56:29.602 --> 56:33.607
So I look forward to observing 
the earthly resurrection 


56:33.607 --> 56:35.842
and seeing my physical father, 


56:35.842 --> 56:38.512
and I hope that both he 
and my mother 


56:38.512 --> 56:41.915
will want to worship 
Jehovah in Paradise.


56:41.915 --> 56:44.517
Thank you for sharing that, 
Brother Lösch. 


56:44.517 --> 56:47.454
When my father comes back 
in the resurrection, 


56:47.453 --> 56:51.056
I look forward to welcoming him 
with open arms. 


56:51.057 --> 56:54.394
He was a keen student 
of history and the Bible, 


56:54.393 --> 56:57.096
and so he will want to know 
all about what took place 


56:57.097 --> 56:59.099
during this time of the end. 


56:59.098 --> 57:01.500
So my family and I 
will have a good time 


57:01.500 --> 57:03.703
filling him in on what took place. 


57:03.703 --> 57:06.773
This music video 
and some of the videos we’ve seen 


57:06.773 --> 57:09.475
the past few years 
at regional conventions 


57:09.475 --> 57:11.477
have painted such a clear picture 


57:11.477 --> 57:13.680
of the hope we have for the future. 


57:13.680 --> 57:16.548
And if we work hard 
as champions of the truth, 


57:16.548 --> 57:20.353
that hope will become 
a reality very soon.


57:20.353 --> 57:22.355
Well said. 


57:22.355 --> 57:24.690
And speaking of champions 
of the truth, 


57:24.690 --> 57:26.692
we would like 
to conclude this program 


57:26.692 --> 57:30.000
with greetings from our brothers 
and sisters in Romania, 


57:31.130 --> 57:33.767
a country situated 
in the southeast of Europe.


57:33.767 --> 57:36.269
Some of you may know Romania 


57:36.268 --> 57:38.036
for its traditional instrument 


57:38.037 --> 57:40.540
called the nai, or pan flute. 


57:40.540 --> 57:43.810
It’s made of wood 
and has around 20 pipes, 


57:43.810 --> 57:46.212
arranged in a curved array. 


57:46.212 --> 57:49.015
The pitch is adjusted 
with beeswax, 


57:49.015 --> 57:51.417
which is introduced 
in the pipes.


57:51.417 --> 57:53.452
The brothers and sisters 


57:53.452 --> 57:55.455
in the Certeze North Congregation, 


57:55.455 --> 57:58.825
in the north of Romania, 
send us their love. 


57:58.825 --> 58:02.528
The congregation is located 
near the Ukrainian border, 


58:02.528 --> 58:07.300
an area known 
for its brightly colored folk costumes. 


58:07.300 --> 58:09.568
The congregation 
is made up of families 


58:09.568 --> 58:12.305
with many generations 
of Witnesses, 


58:12.305 --> 58:14.407
so they have been 
champions of truth 


58:14.407 --> 58:16.409
for a long time.


58:16.408 --> 58:18.410
The truth reached this area 


58:18.410 --> 58:20.880
about 80 years ago, 
and now the congregation 


58:20.880 --> 58:24.517
is made up of 126 publishers. 


58:24.517 --> 58:27.254
They conduct 
about 90 Bible studies, 


58:27.253 --> 58:29.921
of which many 
attend the meetings. 


58:29.922 --> 58:32.459
Because there is 
a large concentration 


58:32.458 --> 58:35.661
of Witnesses in the area, 
the congregation territory 


58:35.662 --> 58:37.730
is only five kilometers, 


58:37.730 --> 58:41.000
or a little over three miles, 
from the one end to the other. 


58:42.102 --> 58:45.239
Each territory card 
has only about five houses. 


58:45.238 --> 58:47.540
Because of that, 
the congregation 


58:47.540 --> 58:49.875
regularly assists 
with working territory 


58:49.875 --> 58:52.578
up to 200 kilometers, 


58:52.578 --> 58:54.713
or about 124 miles away.


58:54.713 --> 58:56.715
The brothers and sisters 


58:56.715 --> 58:59.252
of the Certeze North Congregation 


58:59.252 --> 59:02.055
send all of you 
champions of the truth 


59:02.055 --> 59:04.657
their love and greetings 


59:04.657 --> 59:07.194
and so do all of us 
at world headquarters. 


59:07.193 --> 59:22.993
This is JW Broadcasting 
in Brooklyn, New York.
