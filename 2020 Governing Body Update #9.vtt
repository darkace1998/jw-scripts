It’s my great pleasure

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:05.822 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to speak for a few minutes

00:00:05.822 --> 00:00:10.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to you dear, beloved servants of Jehovah.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.763 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
As you well know, we’ve been dealing

00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:18.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the effects of this pandemic
for a long time.

00:00:19.502 --> 00:00:22.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you tired of wearing a mask?

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:25.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tired of physical distancing?

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you miss getting together in person.

00:00:29.879 --> 00:00:33.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because this is lasting so long,

00:00:33.383 --> 00:00:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may be tempting to lower your guard

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ease up
on the precautions we’ve been taking.

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:44.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as you’re probably aware,

00:00:44.961 --> 00:00:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
case numbers have risen sharply

00:00:48.698 --> 00:00:51.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one country after another.

00:00:51.735 --> 00:00:55.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, case numbers and deaths worldwide

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:59.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are higher than they have ever been

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:03.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at any point during the pandemic.

00:01:04.147 --> 00:01:08.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is not a time to let down our guard.

00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:13.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 28:14 says:

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy is the man

00:01:18.895 --> 00:01:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who is always on guard,

00:01:22.198 --> 00:01:25.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whoever hardens his heart

00:01:25.401 --> 00:01:28.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will fall into calamity.”

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:33.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re “always on guard”
like a watchman at his post,

00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:37.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help us avoid the calamity.

00:01:37.247 --> 00:01:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this update, we’d like to discuss

00:01:41.284 --> 00:01:43.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why we need to stay safe

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how we can do so.

00:01:46.623 --> 00:01:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll hear some experiences

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:54.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that highlight the benefits
of keeping on guard.

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:58.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s talk about why we need

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:02.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect ourselves and others.

00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:05.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the months have gone by

00:02:05.708 --> 00:02:10.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if we or our family
have not contracted COVID-19,

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:14.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be easy to think,

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘My family and I won’t get the virus.’

00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:20.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible warns us, though,

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about being overconfident.

00:02:23.593 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 10:12 says:

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So let the one who thinks he is standing

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beware that he does not fall.”

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:44.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In line with that principle,
rather than being overconfident

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:49.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to our safety and thinking,
‘It can’t happen to me,’

00:02:49.853 --> 00:02:53.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have good reason to “beware”

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:56.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain cautious.

00:02:56.426 --> 00:03:00.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, as of December 20,

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:04.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more than 7,500

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:07.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers and sisters worldwide

00:03:07.604 --> 00:03:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have died from COVID-19.

00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:15.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearts go out to those

00:03:15.078 --> 00:03:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have lost
dear family members and friends.

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, unfortunately,

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:26.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the tragic effects of this pandemic

00:03:26.055 --> 00:03:28.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not over.

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:34.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some branches have reported
two to three times more cases

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
among the brothers in just the last month

00:03:38.434 --> 00:03:42.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than they’ve had this entire year!

00:03:42.071 --> 00:03:45.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to stay safe.

00:03:45.842 --> 00:03:48.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,

00:03:48.778 --> 00:03:51.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Brother Peter Canning

00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:53.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the Croatia branch

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explains how vigilance

00:03:56.252 --> 00:04:01.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is helping our brothers
stay as safe as possible.

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the beginning of June, life in Croatia

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:09.499 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
seemed to be getting back to normal.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.068 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Some days, there were no new reported cases

00:04:12.068 --> 00:04:14.337 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the virus in the entire country.

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:17.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So businesses and restaurants reopened,

00:04:17.173 --> 00:04:20.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tourists flooded back into Croatia.

00:04:20.076 --> 00:04:22.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some brothers wondered,

00:04:22.078 --> 00:04:25.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Can we restart certain activities
such as public witnessing?’

00:04:25.782 --> 00:04:29.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, shortly after that,
as a safety precaution,

00:04:29.018 --> 00:04:31.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body directed all branches

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to resume public witnessing
until further notice.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At first, this level of caution
was not easy to understand,

00:04:38.261 --> 00:04:41.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as conditions seemed relatively safe
for public witnessing.

00:04:41.798 --> 00:04:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what a wise decision it proved to be!

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within weeks,
the number of cases in Croatia began to rise.

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:52.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now there are thousands
being infected every day.

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:55.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our experience
has made us even more determined

00:04:55.244 --> 00:04:58.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay close attention to the direction
coming from the organization

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to be ready to follow it.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot let our guard down.

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:08.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Canning said,

00:05:08.925 --> 00:05:12.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should not let down our guard.

00:05:13.196 --> 00:05:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what will help us stay safe?

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, back in June,
in <i>Governing Body Update #4,</i>

00:05:20.703 --> 00:05:23.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Morris stated

00:05:23.006 --> 00:05:26.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three key principles

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as a guide.

00:05:28.711 --> 00:05:31.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was good advice then

00:05:31.814 --> 00:05:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, with the infection rates rising,

00:05:34.984 --> 00:05:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s really good advice now.

00:05:37.887 --> 00:05:41.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s review those principles.

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one:

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:47.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Place a high value on life.

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:50.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the precautions you are taking

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:53.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be inconvenient, remember,

00:05:53.603 --> 00:05:58.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they protect you and your family’s lives.

00:05:59.275 --> 00:06:03.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two: Listen to the authorities.

00:06:03.746 --> 00:06:07.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we follow their safety guidelines,

00:06:07.183 --> 00:06:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we show respect for Jehovah’s arrangement

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and demonstrate that we really care
about our neighbors.

00:06:17.126 --> 00:06:22.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three:
Do not develop a casual attitude.

00:06:23.132 --> 00:06:26.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As this situation stretches on,

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please don’t lower your guard.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:35.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are three excellent principles.

00:06:35.845 --> 00:06:40.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s a question to ask yourself:

00:06:40.783 --> 00:06:44.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do my decisions show

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:46.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that I place a high value on life,

00:06:46.956 --> 00:06:49.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘listen to the authorities,

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have not developed a casual attitude?’

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:58.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever decisions you make, consider this:

00:06:58.134 --> 00:07:01.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your decisions affect
not just yourself

00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but your household,

00:07:03.773 --> 00:07:08.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your brothers and sisters,
and your community.

00:07:08.411 --> 00:07:11.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a sobering thought, isn’t it?

00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:16.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you consider how you and your family

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:20.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will handle activities in the coming months,

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:22.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we urge you

00:07:22.458 --> 00:07:24.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep following

00:07:24.494 --> 00:07:28.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the basic safety guidelines.

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:31.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember how COVID-19 is spread

00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:35.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what you can do to protect yourself.

00:07:35.671 --> 00:07:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s a brief overview.

00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:41.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Health experts agree

00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:44.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the main way the virus spreads

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is through the air.

00:07:46.983 --> 00:07:51.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when someone infected coughs, sneezes,

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speaks, or even breathes,

00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:58.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they can spread the virus.

00:07:59.295 --> 00:08:02.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if someone infected with the virus

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:04.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t have symptoms,

00:08:04.534 --> 00:08:09.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he or she can still spread
the virus to others.

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:12.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s an even higher risk

00:08:12.642 --> 00:08:15.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we’re in close contact with others,

00:08:15.945 --> 00:08:18.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in crowded places,

00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or indoors.

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the best ways
to prevent the spread of COVID-19

00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:27.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to wear a mask

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maintain physical distancing.

To review other precautions you can take
to protect yourself,

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:40.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve created a new whiteboard animation

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entitled <i>Virus Outbreaks</i>

00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:47.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>—What You Can Do.</i>

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:52.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This video is now available in English

00:08:52.148 --> 00:08:54.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on jw.org

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:58.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and will be available
in other languages soon.

00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:02.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please take the time to watch it.

00:09:02.358 --> 00:09:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you’d agree

00:09:04.727 --> 00:09:07.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it takes effort to remain vigilant,

00:09:07.863 --> 00:09:11.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but how can that benefit us?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall
what we read earlier

00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:16.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Proverbs 28:14?

00:09:17.773 --> 00:09:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy is the man who is always on guard.”

00:09:24.046 --> 00:09:26.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this video interview,

00:09:26.048 --> 00:09:28.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how Sister Louise Slender,

00:09:28.884 --> 00:09:31.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is a remote volunteer

00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a remote translation office
in the United States,

00:09:35.124 --> 00:09:40.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has benefited by remaining on guard.

00:09:40.129 --> 00:09:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll also see

00:09:42.498 --> 00:09:45.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the tragic impact

00:09:45.501 --> 00:09:48.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that COVID-19 has had

00:09:48.404 --> 00:09:51.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on her non-Witness relatives.

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:57.446 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I live on the Navajo land,

00:09:57.446 --> 00:10:02.084 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a place called Tuba City, Arizona.

00:10:02.084 --> 00:10:04.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it came (the pandemic),

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:08.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought we were so isolated

00:10:08.124 --> 00:10:12.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was not going to happen
here in Tuba City.

00:10:12.461 --> 00:10:16.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It affected my family a lot.

00:10:16.399 --> 00:10:20.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first wave, we lost 15,

00:10:20.403 --> 00:10:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then after that, some were hospitalized.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then up to today,

00:10:28.544 --> 00:10:32.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have lost 35,

00:10:32.615 --> 00:10:37.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some are still sick and hospitalized.

00:10:37.653 --> 00:10:40.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That makes me really sad,

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:44.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s really a serious thing.

00:10:44.093 --> 00:10:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So right now, my household

00:10:47.997 --> 00:10:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just three.

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And anybody outside of the household

00:10:53.469 --> 00:10:55.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be a risk.

00:10:55.705 --> 00:11:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very difficult
because you’re used to being around them

00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:03.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for years and years
and all of a sudden, this happens.

00:11:03.813 --> 00:11:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I have to look at it

00:11:07.249 --> 00:11:09.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as anybody can be positive

00:11:09.352 --> 00:11:11.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or anybody can have it.

00:11:11.354 --> 00:11:13.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I just keep my distance.

00:11:13.989 --> 00:11:15.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t want to get sick.

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just use caution, you know.

00:11:19.328 --> 00:11:23.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we’re— Out of Jehovah’s Word,

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:27.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I read is we’re a clean people;
we’re Jehovah’s people.

00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:29.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have to be clean.

00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wear masks,

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wash our hands
and wipe everything

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that comes into the house, even mail.

00:11:37.847 --> 00:11:42.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
COVID-19 is very serious

00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:46.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a pandemic that takes your loved ones

00:11:46.822 --> 00:11:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(people you love), and it’s so sad.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it has taken

00:11:52.495 --> 00:11:56.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many beautiful people,
like my relatives.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were very knowledgeable;
they did crafts;

00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:03.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they did work; they had houses.

00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:06.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we see

00:12:06.175 --> 00:12:09.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their tools are left behind;

00:12:09.545 --> 00:12:14.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nobody to pick up their fields.

00:12:14.183 --> 00:12:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They didn’t even put a seed in.

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:19.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just prepared it
but never put a seed in.

00:12:19.855 --> 00:12:24.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their homes and their transportation

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are just sitting there now.

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:31.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all the warnings that they put out

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are really true warnings,

00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:39.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s very important that we follow them.

00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:46.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearts go out
to Sister Slender and her family.

00:12:46.415 --> 00:12:49.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t her experience illustrate

00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the benefits of staying on guard?

00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:56.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a protection
following direction has been

00:12:56.759 --> 00:13:01.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Sister Slender, her husband, and her son!

00:13:02.798 --> 00:13:07.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review, what have we discussed?

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:12.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now is not the time to slacken our hand

00:13:12.475 --> 00:13:15.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to safety.

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:18.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let your guard down.

00:13:18.481 --> 00:13:23.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t think the virus
can’t affect you or your family.

00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:26.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even with the best of efforts,

00:13:26.622 --> 00:13:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of you may still get sick.

00:13:29.758 --> 00:13:34.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our prayers are with you and your families.

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:37.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We long for the day

00:13:37.132 --> 00:13:40.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah fulfills his promise

00:13:40.936 --> 00:13:45.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “no [one] will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:49.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please stay safe,

00:13:49.445 --> 00:13:52.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay connected to your congregation

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:54.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, above all,

00:13:54.517 --> 00:13:57.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stay close to Jehovah.

00:13:57.653 --> 00:13:59.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

00:13:59.788 --> 00:14:02.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re sure that you can cope

00:14:02.691 --> 00:14:05.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with any challenge you face.

00:14:07.563 --> 00:14:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s my privilege to share with you

00:14:11.467 --> 00:14:15.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
