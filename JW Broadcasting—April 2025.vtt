Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:04.733 --> 00:00:06.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:11.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
we consider the Bible
a marvelous gift from our heavenly Father.

00:00:11.615 --> 00:00:16.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the next hour,
we’ll deepen our appreciation for this gift.

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:19.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how Jehovah
expresses his love through it

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how countless individuals
preserved its message.

00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:27.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how the Bible was written down

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
long before modern printing techniques
were invented.

00:00:31.218 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing God’s name is a privilege.

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:36.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble man felt similarly,

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:39.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
which moved him
to produce the first English Bible

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:42.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
to consistently use Jehovah’s name.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in our latest installment
of <i>Truth Transforms Lives,</i>

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll learn how Bible promises
led a deaf man who was an orphan

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:53.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find his heavenly Father

00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:56.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual family.

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting®!

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:20.851 line:10% position:50% align:center
Imagine you just learned

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.063 line:10% position:50% align:center
that you had received an amazing inheritance

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:25.814 line:10% position:50% align:center
—something very special

00:01:25.814 --> 00:01:28.609 line:10% position:50% align:center
that had been in your family for many years.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:31.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the gift is very valuable.

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel?

00:01:33.238 --> 00:01:37.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, all of us
—everyone listening to this program—

00:01:37.284 --> 00:01:40.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
have received such an inheritance.

00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:42.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s something that’s been passed down

00:01:42.247 --> 00:01:46.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
from generation to generation
for thousands of years.

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:48.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s God’s Word, the Bible.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through this precious gift,
we feel Jehovah’s love.

00:01:56.553 --> 00:01:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what ways?

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider three:

00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel it when we learn how Jehovah

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:06.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
has preserved his Word
for thousands of years

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:09.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’d have it today,

00:02:09.483 --> 00:02:12.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
we feel it in the message it conveys

00:02:12.027 --> 00:02:15.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our loving heavenly Father,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we feel it when we see
how our lives are improved

00:02:19.034 --> 00:02:21.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we apply its teachings.

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about the first:

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:29.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love is felt
in the way that he preserved his Word.

00:02:30.462 --> 00:02:33.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible was written so long ago

00:02:33.257 --> 00:02:37.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
on perishable materials,
and yet we have it today.

00:02:38.887 --> 00:02:42.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have it on our phones and tablets,
and we have printed copies.

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:46.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider what a miracle it is

00:02:46.061 --> 00:02:49.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah had the Bible written down,

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:51.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
hand copied for centuries,

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:55.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet it was
accurately preserved until our day.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
How was the Bible written?

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:01.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a miraculous way.

00:03:01.035 --> 00:03:05.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 3:16 clearly states:

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:11.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All Scripture
is inspired of God and beneficial.”

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:16.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah used his holy spirit
to convey his thoughts

00:03:16.175 --> 00:03:20.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the minds and hearts of faithful men.

00:03:20.262 --> 00:03:23.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some 40 writers were used.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sixteen hundred years passed

00:03:26.143 --> 00:03:28.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the Bible was completed

00:03:28.562 --> 00:03:31.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
in about the year 98 C.E.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s more than 1,900 years ago.

00:03:36.028 --> 00:03:40.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how is it that we have the Bible today?

00:03:40.115 --> 00:03:42.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had to be hand copied.

00:03:42.993 --> 00:03:47.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the centuries,
scribes made copies of the text.

00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:50.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the Masoretes

00:03:50.042 --> 00:03:54.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a group of meticulous
Jewish scholars and copyists—

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally counted the number of words

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even the number of letters.

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:01.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:06.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
To make sure that they
copied the text accurately.

00:04:06.183 --> 00:04:09.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted no errors to be introduced.

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:14.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, many ancient Bible manuscripts

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
have survived until today

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:20.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
—perhaps some 6,000 manuscripts
of the Hebrew Scriptures

00:04:20.697 --> 00:04:24.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some 5,000
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:27.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the 15th century,

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:31.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible had been hand copied
for hundreds of years.

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:35.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now that was about to change.

00:04:35.462 --> 00:04:37.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me show you what happened,

00:04:37.464 --> 00:04:40.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
using a few examples
from our Bible collection

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:42.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Warwick, New York.

00:04:43.637 --> 00:04:47.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what’s often called a Paris Bible.

00:04:47.141 --> 00:04:52.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was completed in France
during the latter part of the 13th century,

00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:57.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, somewhere between
the years 1250 and 1300.

00:04:57.067 --> 00:05:01.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a complete Bible copied by hand.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at how beautiful it is!

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:06.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the work involved

00:05:06.577 --> 00:05:08.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a scribe sitting at a table

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:11.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
day after day carefully copying

00:05:11.832 --> 00:05:14.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that someone could have a Bible like this.

00:05:15.627 --> 00:05:19.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, few people
would ever have been able to own

00:05:19.464 --> 00:05:23.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
a precious hand-copied Bible like this one.

00:05:23.343 --> 00:05:26.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah had something better in mind.

00:05:26.847 --> 00:05:29.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in the 15th century,

00:05:29.433 --> 00:05:33.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
a man named Johannes Gutenberg
came up with an amazing idea.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
In about the year 1455,

00:05:37.858 --> 00:05:41.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gutenberg produced the first printed Bible.

00:05:41.904 --> 00:05:45.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
He printed only about 180 copies.

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:48.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
That doesn’t sound like a lot today, does it?

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember:

00:05:50.162 --> 00:05:55.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up until that time,
every Bible had been hand copied.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:57.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this was something truly amazing!

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an original page

00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:05.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
from one of those 180 Bibles
printed by Gutenberg.

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:11.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this was just the beginning.

00:06:11.558 --> 00:06:13.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time,

00:06:13.185 --> 00:06:17.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gutenberg’s invention would allow
for thousands of copies of the Bible

00:06:17.314 --> 00:06:20.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be printed
in a relatively short period of time.

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:23.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the years that followed,

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:28.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
printing presses gradually
were set up in various cities in Europe.

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:30.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were they able to produce?

00:06:31.453 --> 00:06:33.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1475,

00:06:33.914 --> 00:06:38.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bernhard Richel produced
this Bible in Basel, Switzerland.

00:06:39.253 --> 00:06:41.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at the size of it.

00:06:41.255 --> 00:06:43.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at the beautiful printing.

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:48.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing what those early printers
were able to produce!

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:52.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the Bible was now being printed,

00:06:52.266 --> 00:06:54.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was still a problem.

00:06:54.268 --> 00:06:56.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it?

00:06:56.144 --> 00:07:01.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Few people would ever
have been able to afford a Bible like this.

00:07:01.149 --> 00:07:06.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though it was printed,
it was still very expensive.

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible was probably produced for a church

00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:12.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
or for someone who was very wealthy.

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:15.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
But less than 20 years later,

00:07:15.706 --> 00:07:19.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was another exciting development.

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:22.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the <i>Biblia Integra,</i>

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:25.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
often called the Poor Man’s Bible.

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:30.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was printed
in Switzerland in the year 1491.

00:07:30.095 --> 00:07:32.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you notice about it?

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:34.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very small.

00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:39.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s thought to be the first
small-size printed Bible.

00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:42.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man who produced this Bible
had a new idea.

00:07:42.858 --> 00:07:47.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
He produced this Bible
to appeal to common churchgoers.

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t a Bible for a library or a church.

00:07:51.074 --> 00:07:55.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was for personal use,
something that a person could own

00:07:55.162 --> 00:07:58.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and carry with him and read at anytime.

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:03.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was this development so important?

00:08:03.045 --> 00:08:05.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because in the next few decades,

00:08:05.297 --> 00:08:07.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible would be translated

00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:09.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the original languages

00:08:09.384 --> 00:08:13.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
and printed in the vernacular,
or common languages,

00:08:13.013 --> 00:08:15.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
of people across Europe.

00:08:15.307 --> 00:08:16.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the first time,

00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:21.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would be possible for people
to have a personal copy of the Bible

00:08:21.938 --> 00:08:23.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their own language.

00:08:24.775 --> 00:08:28.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
These significant developments
in Bible production

00:08:28.779 --> 00:08:30.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
give us reason to believe

00:08:30.614 --> 00:08:34.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our loving Father,
Jehovah, was involved.

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
He not only had preserved the Bible

00:08:37.329 --> 00:08:41.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now he was ensuring that his gift

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:44.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be made available to all people.

00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:47.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s return to the studio.

00:08:49.674 --> 00:08:53.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
God’s enemies did not want people

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:55.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have Jehovah’s precious gift.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:09:00.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, it’s not surprising
that many people have actively worked

00:09:00.644 --> 00:09:03.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prevent others from having the Bible.

00:09:03.772 --> 00:09:07.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
One scholar, Albert Barnes,
described it this way:

00:09:08.068 --> 00:09:12.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No book has excited
so much opposition as this;

00:09:12.906 --> 00:09:15.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but it has survived every attack

00:09:15.534 --> 00:09:20.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which power, talent,
and eloquence have ever made on it.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:22.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No army ever survived

00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:25.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
so many battles as the Bible.”

00:09:26.753 --> 00:09:30.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans alone could never
have preserved the Bible

00:09:30.257 --> 00:09:33.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the face of such strong opposition.

00:09:33.218 --> 00:09:37.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a miracle that we have it today.

00:09:37.097 --> 00:09:40.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, we feel the love of Jehovah

00:09:40.976 --> 00:09:43.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we see how he’s preserved the Bible

00:09:43.687 --> 00:09:47.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made this precious gift available to all.

00:09:48.483 --> 00:09:53.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible’s message is a second way
that we feel Jehovah’s love.

00:09:53.864 --> 00:09:58.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible teaches us things
that we cannot learn anywhere else.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, without the Bible,

00:10:00.162 --> 00:10:03.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could understand that there is a Creator

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:07.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we could learn about his qualities
from the things he’s made.

00:10:07.836 --> 00:10:11.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Bible teaches us so much more.

00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:12.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
In it,

00:10:12.674 --> 00:10:15.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah tells us his own personal name,

00:10:15.594 --> 00:10:19.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
the purpose of life,
and what the future holds.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are things
that we’d expect a loving Father

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:26.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share with his beloved children.

00:10:26.646 --> 00:10:29.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s more, Jehovah invites us

00:10:29.983 --> 00:10:33.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a close relationship with him.

00:10:33.528 --> 00:10:36.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a tender and loving Father!

00:10:37.699 --> 00:10:41.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
The practical guidance for life
that the Bible contains

00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:45.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a third way that we feel Jehovah’s love.

00:10:45.582 --> 00:10:48.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a book
from the Creator that instructs us

00:10:48.585 --> 00:10:51.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to live a happy and satisfying life.

00:10:51.963 --> 00:10:56.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like our owner’s manual
from the Creator himself.

00:10:56.259 --> 00:10:59.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how much we need it!

00:10:59.763 --> 00:11:03.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus saw how much people
needed that guidance.

00:11:03.433 --> 00:11:06.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 9:36 says:

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them,

00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:13.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they were skinned and thrown about

00:11:13.777 --> 00:11:15.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
like sheep without a shepherd.”

00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:18.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true today also.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are so confused and lost.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t know what to do.

00:11:24.412 --> 00:11:28.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re often guided simply
by their own thinking and desires.

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:33.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
people end up in awful situations.

00:11:33.713 --> 00:11:36.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need reliable guidance

00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:39.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show us what’s right and what’s wrong

00:11:39.094 --> 00:11:42.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to help us find the way to happiness.

00:11:42.264 --> 00:11:45.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah has provided all of that

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his precious gift, the Bible.

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:51.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 15:4 says:

00:11:51.773 --> 00:11:55.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all the things
that were written beforehand

00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:57.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were written for our instruction,

00:11:57.612 --> 00:11:59.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that through our endurance

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:02.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and through the comfort from the Scriptures

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might have hope.”

00:12:05.036 --> 00:12:07.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even as our circumstances change,

00:12:07.789 --> 00:12:11.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible continues
to be our manual for life.

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:14.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether young or old, single or married,

00:12:14.588 --> 00:12:17.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
the guidance in God’s Word always applies.

00:12:17.882 --> 00:12:20.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
It always works.

00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:23.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we reflect on all the ways

00:12:23.388 --> 00:12:26.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible is a unique gift,

00:12:26.057 --> 00:12:29.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do we see or feel?

00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:31.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel the tremendous love

00:12:31.938 --> 00:12:36.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has for us
in giving us this gift.

00:12:36.359 --> 00:12:41.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s made sure that all
the information we need is inside it.

00:12:41.072 --> 00:12:44.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he helps us to apply it in our life.

00:12:44.993 --> 00:12:46.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
With what result?

00:12:46.911 --> 00:12:50.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 3:16, 17 says:

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:55.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All Scripture is inspired of God

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:58.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,

00:12:58.882 --> 00:13:00.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for setting things straight,

00:13:00.967 --> 00:13:03.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for disciplining in righteousness,

00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:07.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the man of God
may be fully competent,

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:13:13.021 --> 00:13:16.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have we learned
in this brief discussion?

00:13:17.025 --> 00:13:21.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything about the Bible
reflects Jehovah’s love

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:24.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the miraculous way he preserved it,

00:13:24.324 --> 00:13:27.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
its message from a loving Father,

00:13:27.535 --> 00:13:31.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its practical guidance on how to live.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:34.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inheriting a precious gift

00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:37.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not guarantee
that we will appreciate it.

00:13:37.504 --> 00:13:40.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, simply having a Bible

00:13:40.465 --> 00:13:43.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not mean that we’ll benefit from it.

00:13:43.176 --> 00:13:44.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
To benefit,

00:13:44.678 --> 00:13:49.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to read his Word,
the manual for life, every day.

00:13:50.642 --> 00:13:53.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read and study the Bible,

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:56.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
we feel the great love of its Author,

00:13:56.356 --> 00:13:59.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:13:59.567 --> 00:14:02.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the more we feel his love,

00:14:02.070 --> 00:14:06.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more we’re moved to do
what he wants us to do.

00:14:06.074 --> 00:14:10.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes helping others
to receive and benefit

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:12.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
from this precious gift.

00:14:12.163 --> 00:14:13.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way,

00:14:13.665 --> 00:14:17.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can help as many
as possible to experience

00:14:17.877 --> 00:14:20.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, to really feel—

00:14:20.255 --> 00:14:23.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
the love of God through the Bible.

00:14:25.385 --> 00:14:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
In ancient times,
Bible writers worked hard

00:14:28.805 --> 00:14:31.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
to write down God’s Word.

00:14:31.141 --> 00:14:35.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what techniques and materials
did they use?

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s explore some of those methods.

00:14:39.858 --> 00:14:43.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
God inspired some 40 men to write the Bible.

00:14:43.278 --> 00:14:45.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you ever wondered,

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.240 line:10% position:50% align:center
‘What did they write it on?’

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.242 line:10% position:50% align:center
After all, the oldest portions of the Bible

00:14:49.242 --> 00:14:51.077 line:10% position:50% align:center
were written more than 1,000 years

00:14:51.077 --> 00:14:53.079 line:10% position:50% align:center
before the invention of what we know today

00:14:53.079 --> 00:14:54.164 line:10% position:50% align:center
as paper.

00:14:54.164 --> 00:14:56.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
The earliest Bible manuscripts

00:14:56.374 --> 00:14:58.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
were written on a material called papyrus.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:03.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Papyrus is a plant
that grows in shallow water

00:15:03.214 --> 00:15:07.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
with stalks that can reach almost 4.6 meters,
or about 15 feet, high.

00:15:08.344 --> 00:15:10.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 4,000 years ago,

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:13.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Egyptians invented ways to turn papyrus

00:15:13.099 --> 00:15:16.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a smooth, strong writing material
similar to paper.

00:15:18.188 --> 00:15:22.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even with modern tools,
you can see it was a lot of work.

00:15:22.567 --> 00:15:24.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thin slices of the plant’s core

00:15:24.611 --> 00:15:26.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to be soaked and flattened,

00:15:28.615 --> 00:15:30.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
arranged in layers,

00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:33.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then beaten and pressed

00:15:34.370 --> 00:15:36.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bind the layers together.

00:15:37.415 --> 00:15:41.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the sheets were dry,
they were polished with a piece of ivory,

00:15:41.252 --> 00:15:43.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
a smooth shell, or even a stone.

00:15:44.297 --> 00:15:47.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result
was a relatively smooth surface for writing.

00:15:48.676 --> 00:15:50.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
To make a scroll,

00:15:50.178 --> 00:15:53.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
individual sheets of papyrus
were pasted together along the edges

00:15:53.973 --> 00:15:58.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a roll that might be more
than 6 meters, or about 20 feet, in length.

00:16:00.897 --> 00:16:03.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
But around the second century C.E.,

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:05.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
copyists began favoring a new technology

00:16:05.735 --> 00:16:08.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
that made papyrus documents
much easier to use:

00:16:08.738 --> 00:16:11.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
the codex.

00:16:11.032 --> 00:16:14.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the codex,
the papyrus pages were folded,

00:16:14.452 --> 00:16:17.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
sewn, and bound together

00:16:17.914 --> 00:16:20.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
to form something similar to a modern book.

00:16:20.375 --> 00:16:25.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of all the hours required
to produce these materials to write on.

00:16:25.213 --> 00:16:27.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
But without modern pens and pencils,

00:16:27.632 --> 00:16:30.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did ancient people use to write with?

00:16:31.594 --> 00:16:35.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
The pens they used were often made
from pieces of hard reed like this

00:16:35.807 --> 00:16:39.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was carefully cut
to produce a pointed slit.

00:16:41.855 --> 00:16:46.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Bible times, one common type of ink
that would be used with these reed pens

00:16:46.484 --> 00:16:49.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
was made by combining black soot

00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:52.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a rubbery gum
that helped it stick to the page.

00:16:53.575 --> 00:16:56.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, water was added to the mixture.

00:17:00.456 --> 00:17:04.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether in the form of a scroll or a codex,

00:17:04.377 --> 00:17:08.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
the problem with papyrus
was that it decomposed easily.

00:17:08.214 --> 00:17:13.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazingly, there are many fragments
of Bible manuscripts on papyrus

00:17:13.011 --> 00:17:15.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have survived down to our day.

00:17:15.179 --> 00:17:17.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
What you see here
are reproductions of fragments

00:17:17.849 --> 00:17:20.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are more than 2,000 years old.

00:17:21.185 --> 00:17:26.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, Bible manuscripts began to be copied
onto more durable materials.

00:17:26.190 --> 00:17:28.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
By about the fourth century,

00:17:28.234 --> 00:17:30.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
the most common of those was parchment.

00:17:30.361 --> 00:17:34.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was normally made from the hides of sheep,
calves, or goats.

00:17:35.742 --> 00:17:39.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
The process begins by soaking
the hide in water and lime,

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:42.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
then removing the hair and excess flesh.

00:17:48.296 --> 00:17:52.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, the skin is stretched on a frame
and scraped with a knife

00:17:52.258 --> 00:17:55.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remove any residues like fat.

00:17:55.553 --> 00:17:58.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next step is to dry the skin
under increased tension,

00:17:58.723 --> 00:18:01.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
which causes it to become stiff and flat.

00:18:02.727 --> 00:18:05.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, it’s dusted with chalk

00:18:05.146 --> 00:18:09.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sanded smooth with pumice
to create an even writing surface.

00:18:11.486 --> 00:18:14.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can see,
making even one sheet of parchment

00:18:14.489 --> 00:18:16.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires a tremendous amount of work.

00:18:16.574 --> 00:18:20.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
But today there are many Bible manuscripts
that were written on parchment,

00:18:20.828 --> 00:18:23.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as these two original manuscripts here.

00:18:24.582 --> 00:18:27.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another famous manuscript
is the Codex Amiatinus,

00:18:27.335 --> 00:18:31.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
located in Italy,
which is over 1,300 years old.

00:18:31.965 --> 00:18:36.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it’s the oldest complete Latin Bible
bound in a single volume ever found.

00:18:36.678 --> 00:18:41.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some historians feel that it required
the hides of over 400 animals to produce.

00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:47.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
This replica is big,
but the original is even larger.

00:18:47.855 --> 00:18:52.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
It weighs 34 kilograms,
or about 75 pounds.

00:18:53.945 --> 00:18:58.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of all of the work
that went into producing just that one Bible.

00:18:58.366 --> 00:19:02.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, all of these materials
are perishable and deteriorate with time.

00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:06.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to preserve his Word,
Jehovah God saw to it that the Bible

00:19:06.374 --> 00:19:09.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
was meticulously copied and recopied
over the centuries,

00:19:09.669 --> 00:19:12.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that today we have not just a few

00:19:12.672 --> 00:19:15.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
but thousands of manuscripts
of various parts of the Bible.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:20.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the next time you look up a Bible verse
by tapping on a link,

00:19:21.097 --> 00:19:23.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about what it took
to put those words in writing

00:19:23.474 --> 00:19:25.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how amazing it is that Jehovah’s Word,

00:19:25.893 --> 00:19:29.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded using these ancient,
fragile materials,

00:19:29.272 --> 00:19:31.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
is still with us today.

00:19:34.819 --> 00:19:38.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re grateful
to the countless God-fearing men

00:19:38.322 --> 00:19:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
who carefully wrote down
and copied the Bible.

00:19:42.118 --> 00:19:46.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their hard work made it possible
for us to have it today,

00:19:46.289 --> 00:19:49.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
thus fulfilling the words
of the prophet Isaiah:

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The word of our God endures forever.”

00:19:53.963 --> 00:19:58.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our great God, Jehovah,
has used people from all walks of life

00:19:58.342 --> 00:20:02.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preserve his message and holy name.

00:20:02.013 --> 00:20:05.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
One such person was Benjamin Boothroyd,

00:20:05.391 --> 00:20:07.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
the son of a humble shoemaker

00:20:07.602 --> 00:20:11.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
who became a minister and a printer.

00:20:11.147 --> 00:20:13.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
What caused this ordinary man

00:20:13.566 --> 00:20:17.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become a self-taught scholar
and Bible translator?

00:20:17.904 --> 00:20:19.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out.

00:20:23.201 --> 00:20:28.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We sincerely congratulate Dr. B.
on having completed a task

00:20:28.206 --> 00:20:31.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that was perhaps
never before accomplished

00:20:31.459 --> 00:20:33.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by a single individual;

00:20:33.211 --> 00:20:37.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“namely, a corrected Hebrew text
of the Old Testament,

00:20:37.423 --> 00:20:41.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a revised English version
of the whole Bible.”

00:20:43.221 --> 00:20:48.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Benjamin Boothroyd
was born in 1768 to a humble shoemaker.

00:20:48.684 --> 00:20:51.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lived his whole life
in Yorkshire, England.

00:20:52.980 --> 00:20:55.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd wasn’t wealthy or prominent;

00:20:55.817 --> 00:20:58.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet, he accomplished something remarkable

00:20:58.528 --> 00:21:01.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the field of Bible translation.

00:21:02.657 --> 00:21:07.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a young man, Boothroyd and his friends
would attend church

00:21:07.453 --> 00:21:11.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then go to a local alehouse
not dissimilar to this one.

00:21:13.084 --> 00:21:15.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was on one of these occasions

00:21:15.419 --> 00:21:19.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Boothroyd experienced something
that changed his life.

00:21:19.632 --> 00:21:24.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conversation was unusually profane
and sinful in which I joined

00:21:24.637 --> 00:21:28.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was perhaps worse
than any of my companions.

00:21:28.349 --> 00:21:31.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the suddenness
of almost a flash of lightening,

00:21:31.978 --> 00:21:36.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
my mind was struck with horror
under a sense of my sin and guilt

00:21:36.816 --> 00:21:38.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I was a suitable victim

00:21:38.901 --> 00:21:40.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the miseries of hell.

00:21:42.446 --> 00:21:44.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without saying a word,

00:21:44.448 --> 00:21:48.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd left the alehouse
and his companions behind.

00:21:52.707 --> 00:21:54.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he walked home,

00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:56.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
he got down on his knees

00:21:56.586 --> 00:21:59.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and begged God to have mercy on him.

00:21:59.881 --> 00:22:02.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a pivotal moment.

00:22:02.049 --> 00:22:05.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
He resolved to dedicate
the rest of his life

00:22:05.887 --> 00:22:07.305 line:10% position:50% align:center
to God.

00:22:08.598 --> 00:22:11.017 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re here at the National Library of Wales

00:22:11.017 --> 00:22:14.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reveal the next chapter
of Boothroyd’s story.

00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1801, Boothroyd married Sarah Hurst,

00:22:25.781 --> 00:22:28.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
who shared his devotion and faith.

00:22:29.577 --> 00:22:34.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
To supplement their income,
the couple ran a small bookshop and printery.

00:22:34.749 --> 00:22:38.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was there that Boothroyd
acquired these books:

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:43.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews.</i>

00:22:44.008 --> 00:22:48.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lowth’s lectures on Hebrew poetry
fell into my hands.

00:22:48.137 --> 00:22:50.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
I read it with peculiar pleasure.

00:22:52.475 --> 00:22:55.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd fell in love
with the Hebrew language.

00:22:55.478 --> 00:22:58.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
He decided to learn it.
But how?

00:22:58.898 --> 00:23:01.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd noticed
that some of the psalms

00:23:01.651 --> 00:23:06.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
were split into stanzas
using different Hebrew letters.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:09.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
The names of the letters
I learned from the 119th Psalm,

00:23:09.909 --> 00:23:13.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I began to read
the early part of the Pentateuch.

00:23:14.914 --> 00:23:18.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
He painstakingly
taught himself Hebrew letters,

00:23:18.542 --> 00:23:23.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
then words, then grammar
until he could read the Bible in Hebrew.

00:23:25.466 --> 00:23:29.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
On comparing
the latest Hebrew printed texts,

00:23:29.845 --> 00:23:33.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as these by Benjamin Kennicott,
with older available manuscripts,

00:23:33.808 --> 00:23:36.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd discovered
something troubling:

00:23:37.979 --> 00:23:39.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had many errors.

00:23:40.773 --> 00:23:43.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
This led him to a monumental decision.

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:48.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd began a project
to compile and publish

00:23:48.406 --> 00:23:52.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
a more accurate Hebrew text
of the Old Testament.

00:23:54.829 --> 00:23:58.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
While he did the majority of the work,
he wasn’t alone.

00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:03.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife learned the names
of the Hebrew letters;

00:24:03.129 --> 00:24:04.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we examined the sheets,

00:24:04.588 --> 00:24:07.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
not by uttering words,
but by pronouncing

00:24:07.258 --> 00:24:09.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
letter by letter.

00:24:11.095 --> 00:24:15.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah helped her husband
proofread the work to confirm the accuracy.

00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:18.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
After years of meticulous work,

00:24:18.561 --> 00:24:22.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
they completed Boothroyd’s <i>Biblia Hebraica</i>

00:24:22.315 --> 00:24:25.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
in two volumes in 1816.

00:24:25.901 --> 00:24:28.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many would consider
such an accomplishment

00:24:28.487 --> 00:24:31.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be the achievement of a lifetime.

00:24:31.615 --> 00:24:34.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Boothroyd was about to begin

00:24:34.368 --> 00:24:37.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
another major undertaking.

00:24:37.788 --> 00:24:39.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd felt it was his duty

00:24:39.999 --> 00:24:43.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
to produce a revised Bible in plain English,

00:24:43.961 --> 00:24:47.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Bible that anyone could understand.

00:24:47.798 --> 00:24:51.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with the knowledge, materials,
and means available to him,

00:24:51.844 --> 00:24:53.846 line:10% position:50% align:center
he went back to work.

00:24:55.598 --> 00:24:58.351 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re now at the university in Lampeter

00:24:58.351 --> 00:25:00.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find out what Boothroyd accomplished.

00:25:04.148 --> 00:25:07.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just two years later, in 1818,

00:25:07.735 --> 00:25:12.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
he published the first volume
of <i>A New Family Bible.</i>

00:25:12.198 --> 00:25:15.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second volume was completed in 1821.

00:25:15.618 --> 00:25:20.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by 1824, the entire English translation
was released.

00:25:21.707 --> 00:25:25.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once again,
he hadn’t accomplished this on his own.

00:25:25.503 --> 00:25:30.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the whole
of this important and laborious work,

00:25:30.508 --> 00:25:33.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mrs. Boothroyd
was my chief support and assistant,

00:25:33.969 --> 00:25:38.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to her, the public
are as much indebted as myself.

00:25:38.766 --> 00:25:41.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>A New Family Bible </i> was appreciated

00:25:41.143 --> 00:25:44.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
by scholars and faithful Bible readers alike.

00:25:45.064 --> 00:25:49.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
One thing in particular made
Boothroyd’s Bible especially significant.

00:25:50.319 --> 00:25:53.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd followed
this rule while translating:

00:25:53.739 --> 00:25:56.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have adopted <i>Jehovah </i> instead of <i>Lord;</i>

00:25:56.575 --> 00:26:00.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and . . .  <i>Jehovah</i>  God . . .  is certainly
more proper, and just to the original

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:02.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
than <i>Lord God.</i>”

00:26:03.749 --> 00:26:07.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the first English Bible
ever published

00:26:07.795 --> 00:26:11.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
to consistently use “Jehovah”
in the Old Testament.

00:26:11.674 --> 00:26:16.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd also included it several times
in the New Testament.

00:26:18.556 --> 00:26:21.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
The University of Glasgow
awarded Boothroyd a degree

00:26:21.809 --> 00:26:25.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
in recognition
of this outstanding piece of scholarship.

00:26:26.522 --> 00:26:28.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
His <i>New Family Bible</i>  was later used

00:26:28.983 --> 00:26:31.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the basis for translating the Bible

00:26:31.694 --> 00:26:35.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
into languages of the South Pacific,
such as Tahitian.

00:26:36.907 --> 00:26:41.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, these too
use Jehovah’s name extensively.

00:26:45.916 --> 00:26:48.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using what was available to him,

00:26:48.252 --> 00:26:51.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boothroyd peered into the Scriptures,

00:26:51.088 --> 00:26:53.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeking to know their meaning,

00:26:53.632 --> 00:26:57.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then worked to share
that knowledge with others.

00:26:58.304 --> 00:27:02.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his dedication to his <i>New Family Bible,</i>
he wrote:

00:27:05.394 --> 00:27:08.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have no interest to serve

00:27:08.355 --> 00:27:10.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that of truth.”

00:27:10.774 --> 00:27:15.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
This man of lowly origins
achieved something truly rare.

00:27:15.779 --> 00:27:20.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
His works gave people
knowledge of God’s Word,

00:27:20.075 --> 00:27:23.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s will, and God’s name.

00:27:27.958 --> 00:27:31.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
How encouraging it was
to see Boothroyd’s efforts

00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:34.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help others understand God’s Word

00:27:34.173 --> 00:27:38.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to restore God’s name
to the English Bible!

00:27:40.262 --> 00:27:43.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the Bible,
Jehovah also expresses his love

00:27:43.474 --> 00:27:46.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
for another group: orphans.

00:27:46.268 --> 00:27:50.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants these dear ones
to feel especially cared for.

00:27:50.731 --> 00:27:53.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how Nazar Komar,

00:27:53.484 --> 00:27:56.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
a deaf man who was also an orphan,

00:27:56.403 --> 00:27:59.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
came to feel Jehovah’s love.

00:28:02.076 --> 00:28:05.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was a child,
I attended a boarding school.

00:28:06.997 --> 00:28:09.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of my basic needs were taken care of.

00:28:11.669 --> 00:28:13.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on the weekends,

00:28:13.671 --> 00:28:17.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that the other kids had parents
who would take them home.

00:28:18.926 --> 00:28:21.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one ever came to take me home.

00:28:23.138 --> 00:28:25.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
They seemed so happy.

00:28:26.642 --> 00:28:28.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was alone.

00:28:31.105 --> 00:28:34.191 line:10% position:50% align:center
My name is Nazar Komar.

00:28:34.191 --> 00:28:37.278 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was born in Kyiv, Ukraine.

00:28:37.278 --> 00:28:40.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
And seven days after I was born,

00:28:40.030 --> 00:28:42.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was still just a baby,

00:28:42.658 --> 00:28:45.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
my parents abandoned me.

00:28:47.955 --> 00:28:52.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
The school principal and teachers
took turns caring for me.

00:28:52.585 --> 00:28:57.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I saw the other parents
and how much they loved their children.

00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:00.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really wanted to have my own parents.

00:29:00.843 --> 00:29:04.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
I waited for them to come,
but they never did.

00:29:05.556 --> 00:29:07.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very painful.

00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:11.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided I needed a goal to focus on.

00:29:14.356 --> 00:29:16.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hoped my parents were looking for me,

00:29:16.567 --> 00:29:20.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I thought playing sports
might help them find me.

00:29:20.237 --> 00:29:24.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
They might see me
and recognize that I am their son.

00:29:24.158 --> 00:29:28.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
I concentrated on getting good enough
to play professionally.

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned to play very well,

00:29:34.043 --> 00:29:37.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my hope always was that when
I traveled to different places,

00:29:37.963 --> 00:29:41.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
my parents might be sitting in the stands

00:29:41.091 --> 00:29:43.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they would see me and say:

00:29:43.886 --> 00:29:46.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is our son.
We found you.”

00:29:49.975 --> 00:29:53.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began playing in a national league,

00:29:53.228 --> 00:29:56.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the team provided me
a small room to live in

00:29:56.857 --> 00:30:00.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began to pay me a salary.

00:30:00.194 --> 00:30:03.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not much

00:30:03.113 --> 00:30:05.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not enough to live on.

00:30:06.492 --> 00:30:09.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I also got a job working at a factory.

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
While working there, I met Sergei.

00:30:14.750 --> 00:30:16.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:30:18.504 --> 00:30:20.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would show me scriptures from the Bible,

00:30:20.714 --> 00:30:23.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Revelation 21:3, 4,

00:30:23.884 --> 00:30:27.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a future paradise
with wonderful conditions

00:30:27.304 --> 00:30:30.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there would be
no more suffering or pain.

00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted a life like that,

00:30:34.895 --> 00:30:37.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I didn’t see those conditions around me.

00:30:37.815 --> 00:30:40.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life was very hard.

00:30:40.526 --> 00:30:44.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
So these promises were difficult to believe. 

00:30:46.031 --> 00:30:48.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sergei also showed me
God’s name in the Bible

00:30:48.659 --> 00:30:51.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Exodus 15:3.

00:30:51.203 --> 00:30:55.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he explained to me
the meaning of God’s name, Jehovah,

00:30:55.207 --> 00:30:57.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, He can become
whatever He chooses to become.

00:30:58.669 --> 00:31:00.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I connected that name

00:31:00.671 --> 00:31:03.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his promise at Revelation 21:3, 4,

00:31:03.799 --> 00:31:06.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was then that I started to believe it.

00:31:09.263 --> 00:31:12.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
At my first meeting,
I was amazed by what I saw.

00:31:12.850 --> 00:31:16.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hearing and the deaf
were communicating together.

00:31:16.687 --> 00:31:20.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had unity,
and they cared for each other.

00:31:20.649 --> 00:31:22.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt comfortable there.

00:31:24.027 --> 00:31:28.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one of the meetings,
I saw the verse at Psalm 68:5,

00:31:28.073 --> 00:31:32.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
which refers to Jehovah God
as the “father of the fatherless.”

00:31:32.494 --> 00:31:34.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was touched.

00:31:34.329 --> 00:31:37.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows exactly
how hard it is to be an orphan.

00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:39.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
He fully understands me.

00:31:39.918 --> 00:31:44.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gave me goose bumps,
and I felt an inner peace and comfort.

00:31:45.507 --> 00:31:48.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
When my basketball team
and the deaf community

00:31:48.552 --> 00:31:52.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
learned that I was studying the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:31:52.598 --> 00:31:55.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were very upset with me.

00:31:56.226 --> 00:31:58.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told me that I would lose their support

00:31:58.353 --> 00:32:01.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I would lose my salary and housing.

00:32:04.109 --> 00:32:06.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was at a crossroads.

00:32:06.945 --> 00:32:10.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I am an orphan,
where would I live?

00:32:10.657 --> 00:32:13.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a very difficult time.

00:32:15.537 --> 00:32:18.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that I didn’t feel the same unity

00:32:18.832 --> 00:32:22.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
or connection with my team

00:32:22.169 --> 00:32:24.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I did with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:32:24.755 --> 00:32:28.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided to continue to study the Bible.

00:32:30.803 --> 00:32:35.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
I gave up their support and got baptized.

00:32:37.684 --> 00:32:40.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has blessed me.

00:32:40.145 --> 00:32:42.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am no longer alone.

00:32:42.147 --> 00:32:43.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have my own family now

00:32:43.982 --> 00:32:46.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my wife, Evdokiia.

00:32:46.235 --> 00:32:49.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love and cherish each other so much.

00:32:52.157 --> 00:32:55.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has also given me
brothers and sisters who care about me.

00:32:57.079 --> 00:32:59.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are my spiritual family.

00:33:00.207 --> 00:33:03.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
My life is no longer full of pain.

00:33:03.961 --> 00:33:07.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, I still search for my parents

00:33:07.172 --> 00:33:11.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wait for them because when I find them,

00:33:11.426 --> 00:33:15.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to help them
by telling them about God’s name.

00:33:16.306 --> 00:33:19.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I no longer consider myself an orphan

00:33:19.935 --> 00:33:22.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I have a father

00:33:22.312 --> 00:33:26.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my Father in heaven whose name is Jehovah!

00:33:29.403 --> 00:33:33.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we search for love and acceptance
in the congregation,

00:33:33.657 --> 00:33:36.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll find that we belong to a caring family.

00:33:38.078 --> 00:33:42.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lovers of truth have sacrificed
more than time and energy.

00:33:42.457 --> 00:33:45.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many have sacrificed their very lives

00:33:45.335 --> 00:33:47.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can have God’s Word

00:33:47.546 --> 00:33:50.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a language we understand.

00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:54.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s visit the Belgium Bethel Bible museum

00:33:54.303 --> 00:33:57.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn who took such a risk and why.

00:34:03.395 --> 00:34:06.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave us the Bible

00:34:06.273 --> 00:34:10.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could know him and love him.

00:34:11.194 --> 00:34:13.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants us to become his friends.

00:34:15.699 --> 00:34:18.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made sure
that the Bible would be available

00:34:18.619 --> 00:34:22.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter where people live
or what language they speak.

00:34:24.958 --> 00:34:26.960 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Bible museum located

00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.462 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the branch office

00:34:28.462 --> 00:34:29.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:34:29.671 --> 00:34:31.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Brussels, Belgium,

00:34:31.214 --> 00:34:34.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the theme “The Bible
and the Low Countries,”

00:34:34.301 --> 00:34:39.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells the fascinating story
of Bible translation and production

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:42.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the coastal region
of northwestern Europe.

00:34:42.976 --> 00:34:46.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this museum, you will learn
of honesthearted people

00:34:46.605 --> 00:34:50.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
who came to love the Bible
and wanted to make it available to others.

00:34:56.281 --> 00:34:59.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout the Middle Ages,
the Roman Catholic Church

00:34:59.993 --> 00:35:03.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
feared the spread of Bibles
in vernacular languages.

00:35:04.373 --> 00:35:09.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding the Bible would have exposed
the unchristian behavior of the church.

00:35:10.837 --> 00:35:14.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
This led to cruel persecution
of Bible translators.

00:35:15.759 --> 00:35:18.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
What role did the region
of the Low Countries play

00:35:18.887 --> 00:35:21.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this overheated religious atmosphere?

00:35:23.684 --> 00:35:25.686 line:10% position:50% align:center
By the 16th century,

00:35:25.686 --> 00:35:28.355 line:10% position:50% align:center
the city of Antwerp, Belgium,

00:35:28.355 --> 00:35:31.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
had become the leading commercial center
of western Europe.

00:35:31.483 --> 00:35:35.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Antwerp’s relatively tolerant
religious and political climate

00:35:35.362 --> 00:35:37.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
made it an ideal hub

00:35:37.364 --> 00:35:42.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
for translating and printing Bibles
in common, everyday languages.

00:35:42.244 --> 00:35:45.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
About 270 printers,
publishers, and booksellers

00:35:45.831 --> 00:35:48.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
were located in this cosmopolitan city.

00:35:48.834 --> 00:35:51.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, the significant seaport

00:35:51.044 --> 00:35:54.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
was perfect for smuggling Bibles
to neighboring countries.

00:35:54.923 --> 00:35:56.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the many printers

00:35:56.466 --> 00:35:57.801 line:10% position:50% align:center
working in Antwerp

00:35:57.801 --> 00:36:00.345 line:10% position:50% align:center
was Jacob van Liesvelt.

00:36:00.345 --> 00:36:02.347 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 1526,

00:36:02.347 --> 00:36:06.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
he courageously published
the first complete Bible in Dutch.

00:36:06.393 --> 00:36:10.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was one of the first Bibles
printed in a single volume.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:15.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Van Liesvelt eventually printed
a total of 19 Bible editions.

00:36:16.695 --> 00:36:20.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the comparatively safe
working conditions in Antwerp,

00:36:20.407 --> 00:36:24.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible publishers
were not fully protected from the church.

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:27.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Van Liesvelt was condemned to death

00:36:27.789 --> 00:36:31.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
for including marginal notes
in his final edition of the Dutch Bible,

00:36:31.543 --> 00:36:35.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
notes which the Catholic Church
found offensive to their dogma.

00:36:36.131 --> 00:36:38.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was one of several
Antwerp Bible printers

00:36:38.925 --> 00:36:41.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were executed for their work.

00:36:42.471 --> 00:36:44.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
A translator

00:36:44.473 --> 00:36:46.725 line:10% position:50% align:center
who also published his work in Antwerp

00:36:46.725 --> 00:36:48.268 line:10% position:50% align:center
was the French scholar

00:36:48.268 --> 00:36:49.936 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jacques Lefèvre d’Étaples.

00:36:49.936 --> 00:36:51.605 line:10% position:50% align:center
He dedicated himself

00:36:51.605 --> 00:36:55.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
to restoring the original meaning
of ancient writings

00:36:55.609 --> 00:36:58.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
and studied closely the Latin <i>Vulgate </i> Bible.

00:36:59.738 --> 00:37:04.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
He strongly believed
in the right of every Christian

00:37:04.743 --> 00:37:08.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read and learn the Bible personally.

00:37:09.456 --> 00:37:14.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, Lefèvre devoted all his energy
to translating the Bible into French.

00:37:15.295 --> 00:37:19.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the first complete Bible
to be printed in this language.

00:37:20.509 --> 00:37:24.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was sure the Gospels would be, as he said,

00:37:24.221 --> 00:37:27.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“purely proclaimed throughout the world,

00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:29.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that people may no longer be led astray

00:37:29.935 --> 00:37:32.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
by alien doctrines of men.”

00:37:32.229 --> 00:37:35.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although his Bible translation

00:37:35.023 --> 00:37:38.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
initially was approved
by the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V,

00:37:38.568 --> 00:37:42.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1546 Lefèvre’s second edition

00:37:42.572 --> 00:37:47.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
was placed on the Roman Catholic Church’s 
<i>Index of Forbidden Books.</i>

00:37:48.745 --> 00:37:50.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another courageous man,

00:37:50.622 --> 00:37:53.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
one who translated
the Scriptures into English,

00:37:53.166 --> 00:37:56.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a clergyman and a scholar
of Greek and Latin.

00:37:57.087 --> 00:38:00.507 line:10% position:50% align:center
The name of this man was William Tyndale.

00:38:01.216 --> 00:38:03.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
He was passionate about God’s Word.

00:38:04.636 --> 00:38:08.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tyndale wrote: “We must also desire . . . God

00:38:08.598 --> 00:38:13.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make us understand
and feel wherefore the scripture was given,

00:38:13.478 --> 00:38:16.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we may apply
the medicine of the scripture.”

00:38:18.358 --> 00:38:20.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
For translating
the “New Testament” into English,

00:38:20.819 --> 00:38:23.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was chased and hunted
by Church and State.

00:38:23.738 --> 00:38:28.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sought refuge in various cities,
including the city of Antwerp.

00:38:28.952 --> 00:38:32.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here he published a revised version
of the New Testament

00:38:32.622 --> 00:38:34.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his translation of the Pentateuch,

00:38:34.749 --> 00:38:39.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he used Jehovah’s name
for the first time

00:38:39.004 --> 00:38:41.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an English translation.

00:38:41.548 --> 00:38:45.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tyndale also was executed
for his translation work.

00:38:46.928 --> 00:38:51.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Publishing Bibles in Spain
was a very dangerous undertaking.

00:38:52.517 --> 00:38:55.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this reason, in 1543,

00:38:55.145 --> 00:38:57.731 line:10% position:50% align:center
the translator Francisco de Enzinas

00:38:57.731 --> 00:39:00.108 line:10% position:50% align:center
had his New Testament in Spanish

00:39:00.108 --> 00:39:02.652 line:10% position:50% align:center
also printed in Antwerp.

00:39:02.652 --> 00:39:04.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the first Spanish version

00:39:04.696 --> 00:39:08.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be translated directly
from the original Greek text.

00:39:08.825 --> 00:39:11.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote: “It seemed to me

00:39:11.119 --> 00:39:13.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I had but one task:

00:39:13.205 --> 00:39:17.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to commit to the press the work
I had taken pains to produce,

00:39:17.918 --> 00:39:22.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and then commend it
to God the Father of the whole business,

00:39:22.547 --> 00:39:24.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
for whose cause it had been made.”

00:39:27.052 --> 00:39:30.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Francisco de Enzinas
was also arrested for his work.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:36.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, some copies of his New Testament
made it to Spain.

00:39:36.144 --> 00:39:40.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had a strong influence
on other Spanish translations,

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:43.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the widely known
Reina-Valera Bible,

00:39:43.276 --> 00:39:47.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first edition of which
was also printed in the Low Countries.

00:39:49.866 --> 00:39:53.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many more intriguing gems
for you to discover

00:39:53.578 --> 00:39:57.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this museum,
like the Antwerp Polyglot,

00:39:57.540 --> 00:40:00.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
which contains Bible text in five languages,

00:40:00.669 --> 00:40:04.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the secretly produced
Dutch <i>Jehovah Bible</i>

00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:08.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all printed in the Low Countries.

00:40:10.887 --> 00:40:14.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
All these men displayed love for God’s Word,

00:40:14.307 --> 00:40:17.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah blessed their efforts,

00:40:17.102 --> 00:40:22.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the work that they did
set in motion a series of events

00:40:22.107 --> 00:40:25.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have resulted
in God’s Word being available today

00:40:25.944 --> 00:40:28.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
in thousands of languages.

00:40:30.949 --> 00:40:33.326 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Bible museum in Belgium

00:40:33.326 --> 00:40:35.745 line:10% position:50% align:center
is one of our many museums

00:40:35.745 --> 00:40:37.372 line:10% position:50% align:center
around the world

00:40:37.372 --> 00:40:39.666 line:10% position:50% align:center
—each highlighting unique aspects

00:40:39.666 --> 00:40:43.003 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the fascinating history of God’s Word.

00:40:43.003 --> 00:40:44.838 line:10% position:50% align:center
These exhibitions

00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:47.173 line:10% position:50% align:center
deepen our appreciation for the Bible

00:40:47.173 --> 00:40:50.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the truthfulness of 1 Peter 1:25,

00:40:50.927 --> 00:40:55.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says:
“The saying of Jehovah endures forever.”

00:40:59.894 --> 00:41:02.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Belgium branch Bible museum

00:41:02.105 --> 00:41:05.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just one of the many Bible museums

00:41:05.108 --> 00:41:08.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
at our branch offices around the world.

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re able, we hope you too
will visit one of the Bible museums

00:41:12.991 --> 00:41:15.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a branch office close to you.

00:41:15.785 --> 00:41:19.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
There you’ll learn more
about the many honesthearted people

00:41:19.414 --> 00:41:24.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’ve endured persecution
to publish God’s Word, the Bible.

00:41:25.295 --> 00:41:30.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcoming new ones
into the congregations brings us great joy.

00:41:30.175 --> 00:41:35.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can we help them
be firmly grounded in the truth?

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s listen to Brother David Schafer

00:41:37.599 --> 00:41:40.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
explain how in the following morning worship.

00:41:42.645 --> 00:41:46.608 line:10% position:50% align:center
So, what does it take to help someone

00:41:46.608 --> 00:41:50.653 line:10% position:50% align:center
become firmly grounded in the truth?

00:41:51.529 --> 00:41:54.491 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s focus on three things:

00:41:54.491 --> 00:41:58.703 line:10% position:50% align:center
cooperating with divine direction,

00:41:58.703 --> 00:42:00.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
loving the truth,

00:42:00.872 --> 00:42:03.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
and loving people who love the truth.

00:42:03.958 --> 00:42:06.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to the year 50 C.E.

00:42:06.586 --> 00:42:11.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see what we can learn
from Paul’s ministry in Macedonia.

00:42:11.091 --> 00:42:13.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Paul began his second missionary tour

00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:16.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
around 49 C.E. in Lystra.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:19.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
He and Silas found Timothy,

00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:22.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom Paul met on his first visit.

00:42:22.352 --> 00:42:26.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now Timothy is ready
to accompany them on their journey.

00:42:27.565 --> 00:42:30.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
From Map B13 in your <i>Study Bible</i>,

00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:33.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can see that they visited Iconium

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Pisidia and Antioch.

00:42:35.615 --> 00:42:40.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then you see the big purple swoop

00:42:40.578 --> 00:42:43.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
—purple representing Paul’s second journey.

00:42:43.331 --> 00:42:48.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
The map indicates no stops
between Antioch and Troas,

00:42:48.253 --> 00:42:50.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
just a swoop.

00:42:50.380 --> 00:42:52.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it represent?

00:42:52.382 --> 00:42:55.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obedience to divine direction.

00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:58.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 16:8-10 tells us

00:42:58.388 --> 00:43:01.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they tried to preach in Asia

00:43:01.015 --> 00:43:03.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
but were forbidden by holy spirit.

00:43:04.352 --> 00:43:06.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they tried to preach in Bithynia,

00:43:06.938 --> 00:43:11.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
but again Jesus used the holy spirit
to block them.

00:43:11.025 --> 00:43:15.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they turned west
and went all the way to Troas on the coast.

00:43:15.405 --> 00:43:17.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is where they met up with Luke,

00:43:17.449 --> 00:43:20.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s in Troas
that they received divine direction

00:43:20.869 --> 00:43:24.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
to step over into Macedonia.

00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:25.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wasted no time.

00:43:25.665 --> 00:43:27.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stepped onto a ship,

00:43:27.709 --> 00:43:30.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they sailed over to Macedonia.

00:43:30.879 --> 00:43:34.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s now spring or early summer of 50 C.E.

00:43:34.883 --> 00:43:37.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within a year, Paul formed congregations

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:41.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea

00:43:41.556 --> 00:43:43.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
—cities of Macedonia.

00:43:44.934 --> 00:43:46.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did he do it?

00:43:48.563 --> 00:43:50.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn to Acts chapter 17,

00:43:50.815 --> 00:43:55.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here we see Paul’s love for the truth
shine through.

00:43:55.528 --> 00:43:59.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts chapter 17
and we begin in verse 1:

00:44:02.452 --> 00:44:06.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They now traveled
through Amphipolis and Apollonia

00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:08.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and came to Thessalonica,

00:44:08.082 --> 00:44:10.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where there was a synagogue of the Jews.

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:14.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So according to Paul’s custom
he went inside to them,

00:44:14.172 --> 00:44:18.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and for three sabbaths
he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,

00:44:18.676 --> 00:44:22.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“explaining and proving by references

00:44:22.055 --> 00:44:24.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that it was necessary
for the Christ to suffer

00:44:24.557 --> 00:44:26.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to rise from the dead”

00:44:26.559 --> 00:44:28.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
—today’s text.

00:44:28.645 --> 00:44:33.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here we see Paul
in the synagogue in Thessalonica.

00:44:33.274 --> 00:44:34.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has their attention.

00:44:34.734 --> 00:44:35.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:44:35.777 --> 00:44:38.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s using God’s inspired Word.

00:44:38.154 --> 00:44:41.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul loves these truths.

00:44:41.032 --> 00:44:43.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can see it in his eyes.

00:44:43.076 --> 00:44:46.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he’s forming an attachment
for these new disciples.

00:44:46.955 --> 00:44:49.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is Jason in this picture?

00:44:49.624 --> 00:44:51.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aristarchus?

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Demas?

00:44:52.043 --> 00:44:53.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Secundus?

00:44:53.211 --> 00:44:57.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
All those believers came from Thessalonica.

00:44:57.423 --> 00:44:59.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s a problem.

00:44:59.634 --> 00:45:01.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was not Paul’s synagogue,

00:45:01.678 --> 00:45:04.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Jews were getting jealous.

00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:06.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Acts 17:5,

00:45:06.432 --> 00:45:11.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
they begin persecuting the new believers
—persecution.

00:45:11.271 --> 00:45:14.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul had been opposed in Philippi

00:45:14.607 --> 00:45:16.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now here in Thessalonica,

00:45:16.859 --> 00:45:20.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he would be in Beroea as well.

00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:24.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
In short order, he would be whisked away
from Macedonia altogether.

00:45:25.785 --> 00:45:28.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to stabilize those new congregations,

00:45:28.663 --> 00:45:31.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul left Luke in Philippi,

00:45:31.499 --> 00:45:33.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Silas in Beroea,

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Timothy in Thessalonica.

00:45:37.005 --> 00:45:40.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
With trained representatives
in each new congregation,

00:45:40.633 --> 00:45:45.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
could Paul now forget about Macedonia?

00:45:46.055 --> 00:45:51.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, turn with me, please,
to 1 Thessalonians 2:17.

00:45:51.102 --> 00:45:55.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is where we see
Paul’s love for the brothers.

00:45:55.857 --> 00:45:58.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Timothy came to Paul in Corinth

00:45:58.067 --> 00:46:00.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reported on the brothers in Thessalonica,

00:46:00.111 --> 00:46:02.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
it moved Paul to write

00:46:02.113 --> 00:46:07.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was very likely
his first inspired letter.

00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this letter,
he reveals where his heart was

00:46:09.954 --> 00:46:12.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Thessalonians 2:17:

00:46:13.916 --> 00:46:17.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When we were separated.”

00:46:17.420 --> 00:46:19.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a powerful word

00:46:19.464 --> 00:46:22.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
—associated with parents
bereaved of their children,

00:46:22.967 --> 00:46:27.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicating the strong bond Paul felt
for his spiritual family.

00:46:27.221 --> 00:46:30.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When we were separated from you, brothers,

00:46:30.683 --> 00:46:32.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for just a short time

00:46:32.727 --> 00:46:36.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
(in person, not in our hearts).”

00:46:36.397 --> 00:46:40.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Paul’s heart was still
with the congregation in Thessalonica.

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:42.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he reveals:

00:46:42.236 --> 00:46:46.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because of our strong desire,
we made every effort to see you in person.

00:46:46.741 --> 00:46:48.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this reason we wanted to come to you,

00:46:48.951 --> 00:46:53.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yes I, Paul,
tried not just once but twice;

00:46:54.874 --> 00:46:59.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet Satan cut across our path.”

00:47:00.546 --> 00:47:03.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, by this point,
Paul had tried to go back twice,

00:47:03.883 --> 00:47:06.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
but his efforts were hindered.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:10.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he mistake that as divine indication

00:47:10.848 --> 00:47:14.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his work in Macedonia was finished?

00:47:14.519 --> 00:47:15.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:47:15.728 --> 00:47:17.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul knew the difference

00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:20.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
between divine direction

00:47:20.316 --> 00:47:22.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
and satanic opposition,

00:47:22.860 --> 00:47:25.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he did not give up.

00:47:25.113 --> 00:47:28.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Impelled by Jehovah’s spirit,
Paul wrote this letter.

00:47:28.991 --> 00:47:32.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in his love for the congregation
and with his love for the truth,

00:47:32.537 --> 00:47:35.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
he reminds the Thessalonians of their hope.

00:47:35.748 --> 00:47:39.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 19,
he mentions Christ’s “presence.”

00:47:39.127 --> 00:47:42.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this one brief letter,
he talks about Christ’s presence

00:47:42.672 --> 00:47:45.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than he would in all 13

00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:49.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his other inspired letters combined.

00:47:49.595 --> 00:47:50.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:54.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because these persecuted Christians
in Thessalonica

00:47:54.809 --> 00:47:56.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
needed to be reminded of their hope.

00:47:56.853 --> 00:47:58.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
They needed to wear it like a helmet

00:47:58.938 --> 00:48:01.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let it guard their thinking.

00:48:01.899 --> 00:48:04.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the encouragement worked.

00:48:04.193 --> 00:48:08.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Satan used a different tactic.

00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speculators tried to twist Paul’s word.

00:48:12.326 --> 00:48:14.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did he mention Christ’s presence so much?

00:48:14.662 --> 00:48:18.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Might this prove
that the presence has already begun?

00:48:18.207 --> 00:48:21.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Possibly there was even a letter
wrongly attributed to Paul

00:48:21.043 --> 00:48:25.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was being interpreted to mean
that the day of Jehovah had arrived.

00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:29.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what could Paul do about this?

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:32.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote his second inspired letter.

00:48:32.221 --> 00:48:36.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
In it he admonished the brothers
not to be quickly shaken from their reason

00:48:36.601 --> 00:48:39.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah’s day would “not come

00:48:39.812 --> 00:48:44.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
unless the apostasy comes first.”

00:48:45.276 --> 00:48:48.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The apostasy”

00:48:48.279 --> 00:48:52.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those words completely harmonized

00:48:52.408 --> 00:48:56.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jesus’ illustration
about the wheat and the weeds,

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:59.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
a prophecy recorded in Matthew’s Gospel,

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:02.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
which had been in circulation
for nearly ten years

00:49:02.543 --> 00:49:06.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Paul wrote 2 Thessalonians.

00:49:07.173 --> 00:49:09.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also in 2 Thessalonians that we learn

00:49:09.926 --> 00:49:13.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this apostasy would eventually set in

00:49:13.346 --> 00:49:17.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
because people “did not accept

00:49:17.725 --> 00:49:21.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
the love of the truth.”

00:49:21.771 --> 00:49:23.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meanwhile, though,
Paul and the other apostles

00:49:23.773 --> 00:49:26.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
would ‘act as a restraint’ against apostasy

00:49:26.192 --> 00:49:28.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
by fostering love for the truth.

00:49:28.486 --> 00:49:30.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, by Paul’s example

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:35.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
and constantly meditating on the Scriptures,

00:49:35.451 --> 00:49:39.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
reasoning from them, explaining them,

00:49:39.872 --> 00:49:42.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
and proving with references,

00:49:42.667 --> 00:49:44.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
he equipped the brothers to withstand

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:48.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
the opposition they would face.

00:49:49.006 --> 00:49:53.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
As it turns out,
Paul did return to Macedonia two more times.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what did he find?

00:49:56.013 --> 00:50:00.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strong congregations exemplary in their love,

00:50:00.935 --> 00:50:03.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
unselfish in their generosity,

00:50:03.312 --> 00:50:06.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving even beyond their actual ability.

00:50:06.107 --> 00:50:10.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their example inspires Christians
to this very day.

00:50:11.153 --> 00:50:13.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
So,

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does it take to help others

00:50:15.616 --> 00:50:19.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
become well-grounded in the truth?

00:50:19.829 --> 00:50:24.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Persistence in obeying divine direction,

00:50:24.083 --> 00:50:28.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping others to love the truth as we do,

00:50:28.629 --> 00:50:32.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
and loving those who love the truth

00:50:32.675 --> 00:50:35.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
(even when we’re separated
by circumstances),

00:50:35.219 --> 00:50:37.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
remaining attached at heart.

00:50:37.722 --> 00:50:42.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we continue to follow
this example of genuine love

00:50:42.727 --> 00:50:46.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we carry out our sacred service today.

00:50:48.566 --> 00:50:51.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Given the world’s self-centered attitude,

00:50:51.402 --> 00:50:54.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
we consider belonging to a spiritual family

00:50:54.405 --> 00:50:57.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
that looks after each other
as a precious gift.

00:50:58.784 --> 00:51:02.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of gifts,
we have a surprise for you:

00:51:02.496 --> 00:51:04.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
a preview of what we’ll experience

00:51:04.832 --> 00:51:09.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
at our 2025 “Pure Worship”
Regional Convention.

00:51:09.337 --> 00:51:10.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy!

00:51:15.092 --> 00:51:17.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
People have a need to worship something:

00:51:17.845 --> 00:51:21.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
a higher power,

00:51:21.057 --> 00:51:23.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
themselves,

00:51:23.976 --> 00:51:27.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
other people,

00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:30.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
money.

00:51:31.692 --> 00:51:34.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how should we fill this need?

00:51:35.071 --> 00:51:37.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jesus say?

00:51:37.448 --> 00:51:39.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“True worshippers . . .

00:51:39.617 --> 00:51:42.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
must worship with spirit and truth.”

00:51:43.245 --> 00:51:47.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 2025 convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:49.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
continues the new video series

00:51:49.043 --> 00:51:51.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

00:51:53.130 --> 00:51:56.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus alone is qualified
to teach us how to worship God.

00:51:57.510 --> 00:52:02.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
The benefits are personal,
immediate, and everlasting.

00:52:07.269 --> 00:52:12.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re certain you’ll thoroughly enjoy
three days of learning what it means

00:52:12.024 --> 00:52:14.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give pure worship to Jehovah.

00:52:15.486 --> 00:52:19.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,
we’ve seen how Jehovah’s love

00:52:19.448 --> 00:52:23.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
is expressed through his gift of the Bible.

00:52:23.202 --> 00:52:26.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel his love when we consider
how he preserved his Word

00:52:26.914 --> 00:52:30.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
from ancient times until our modern day,

00:52:30.626 --> 00:52:35.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he used humble people
to restore his name,

00:52:35.214 --> 00:52:38.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how its message can transform lives.

00:52:39.510 --> 00:52:41.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video highlights

00:52:41.846 --> 00:52:45.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his Word is filled with love.

00:52:58.529 --> 00:53:05.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a letter from a loved one
that I’m reading ev’ry day,

00:53:05.119 --> 00:53:11.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I turn the precious pages,
so many thoughts that come my way—

00:53:11.375 --> 00:53:17.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ev’ry day that passes
gives me reason to be sure

00:53:17.465 --> 00:53:23.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
That the things that I am reading
will comfort me some more.

00:53:23.679 --> 00:53:30.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the dew there in the morning,
Like the warmth that’s from the sun,

00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:36.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the moonlight on the water—
It’s there for ev’ryone.

00:53:36.901 --> 00:53:43.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a pillow is for comfort,
So your words can comfort me.

00:53:43.491 --> 00:53:49.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as I meditate on this,
It’s easy just to see

00:53:49.121 --> 00:53:59.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s filled with love—
Jehovah’s love.

00:54:08.390 --> 00:54:14.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminds me not to worry
—that a trial will never last—

00:54:14.939 --> 00:54:21.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gives me hope for the future,
helps me learn from the past.

00:54:21.403 --> 00:54:27.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your promise draws me close to you
as you draw close to me.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:34.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
And once again I’m thankful
for the gifts that I can see.

00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:40.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the dew there in the morning,
Like the warmth that’s from the sun,

00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:47.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the moonlight on the water—
It’s there for ev’ryone.

00:54:47.221 --> 00:54:53.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a pillow is for comfort,
So your words can comfort me.

00:54:53.769 --> 00:54:59.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as I meditate on this,
It’s easy just to see

00:54:59.525 --> 00:55:09.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s filled with love—
Jehovah’s love.

00:55:18.502 --> 00:55:25.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a tree growing by a stream,
I’m stronger ev’ry day,

00:55:25.718 --> 00:55:31.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Building up the faith that I need.

00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:38.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes me want to share the love
that’s found right there

00:55:38.814 --> 00:55:44.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just how much your Word means to me.

00:55:44.904 --> 00:55:51.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a letter from a loved one
that I’m reading ev’ry day,

00:55:51.118 --> 00:55:57.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I turn the precious pages,
so many thoughts that come my way—

00:55:57.583 --> 00:56:04.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
And ev’ry day that passes
gives me reason to be sure

00:56:04.006 --> 00:56:10.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
That the things that I am reading
will comfort me some more.

00:56:10.179 --> 00:56:16.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the dew there in the morning,
Like the warmth that’s from the sun,

00:56:16.602 --> 00:56:23.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the moonlight on the water—
It’s there for ev’ryone.

00:56:23.234 --> 00:56:29.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a pillow is for comfort,
So your words can comfort me.

00:56:29.990 --> 00:56:35.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as I meditate on this,
It’s easy just to see

00:56:35.537 --> 00:56:45.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s filled with love—
Jehovah’s love.

00:57:00.104 --> 00:57:02.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our postcard this month takes us

00:57:02.231 --> 00:57:04.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the beautiful country of Paraguay.

00:57:04.942 --> 00:57:09.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paraguay is a landlocked country
in the heart of South America,

00:57:09.697 --> 00:57:12.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a population of about seven million.

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:17.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Paraguay River runs
from north to south, dividing the country.

00:57:18.580 --> 00:57:23.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
The east is characterized
by rolling hills and fertile fields

00:57:23.043 --> 00:57:25.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some of which have red soil

00:57:25.504 --> 00:57:27.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thick forests.

00:57:27.715 --> 00:57:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,
the western region has a sparse population,

00:57:32.261 --> 00:57:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
coarse grass, scrub forests,

00:57:35.306 --> 00:57:37.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
vast swamps,

00:57:37.141 --> 00:57:40.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
and diverse colorful tropical birds.

00:57:41.228 --> 00:57:43.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paraguay has two official languages:

00:57:43.689 --> 00:57:46.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spanish and Guaraní.

00:57:46.358 --> 00:57:48.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when the two languages mix,

00:57:48.694 --> 00:57:50.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
you get Jopara,

00:57:50.863 --> 00:57:53.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is frequently used today.

00:57:53.949 --> 00:57:56.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paraguay’s theocratic history began

00:57:56.285 --> 00:57:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Eberhard Hoeckle,
a German immigrant,

00:57:59.747 --> 00:58:04.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
found a tract randomly sent
to his home from world headquarters.

00:58:04.752 --> 00:58:08.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
This moved him to order
<i>Studies in the Scriptures.</i>

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1906,

00:58:10.382 --> 00:58:13.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
he and his brother-in-law
baptized each other,

00:58:13.469 --> 00:58:17.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
becoming the first in Paraguay
to accept Bible truth.

00:58:18.307 --> 00:58:20.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1924,

00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:24.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Juan Muñiz,
a faithful missionary from Spain,

00:58:24.188 --> 00:58:26.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
arrived to spread the Kingdom message

00:58:26.815 --> 00:58:29.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout several South American countries,

00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:31.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Paraguay.

00:58:32.529 --> 00:58:34.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then in 1934,

00:58:34.615 --> 00:58:39.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Martonfi, Koros, and Rebacz

00:58:39.119 --> 00:58:43.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
entered the country
despite the ongoing Chaco War.

00:58:43.791 --> 00:58:45.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their efforts paid off

00:58:45.793 --> 00:58:49.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the first congregation
was formed five years later.

00:58:50.714 --> 00:58:54.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Decades of political instability
resulted in a decree

00:58:54.968 --> 00:58:59.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
revoking the organization’s
legal status in 1979.

00:59:00.849 --> 00:59:04.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
the brothers had to conduct meetings

00:59:04.061 --> 00:59:07.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
in small groups at private homes

00:59:07.106 --> 00:59:09.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in isolated areas.

00:59:09.691 --> 00:59:13.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fortunately, 12 years later, in 1991,

00:59:13.904 --> 00:59:17.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
the organization was legally recognized

00:59:17.116 --> 00:59:20.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the fall of the military regime.

00:59:20.536 --> 00:59:23.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the publishers
dwindle during those years?

00:59:23.497 --> 00:59:25.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hardly!

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:28.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
The number of publishers doubled in size.

00:59:28.168 --> 00:59:32.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, there are over 11,000 publishers

00:59:32.131 --> 00:59:35.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
who conduct about 10,000 Bible studies

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and attend 183 congregations.

00:59:40.097 --> 00:59:42.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the western part of the country,

00:59:42.099 --> 00:59:44.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find the Filadelfia Español

00:59:44.476 --> 00:59:48.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Loma Plata Guaraní Congregations.

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:52.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 95 publishers of these two congregations

00:59:52.276 --> 00:59:56.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
conduct an average of 155 Bible studies

00:59:56.488 --> 00:59:58.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
and preach in Spanish,

00:59:58.323 --> 01:00:01.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guaraní, Low German,

01:00:01.368 --> 01:00:03.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Nivaclé.

01:00:03.996 --> 01:00:06.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Filadelfia Español

01:00:06.081 --> 01:00:10.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Loma Plata Guaraní Congregations
send their love.

01:00:11.003 --> 01:00:14.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you all very much.

01:00:14.256 --> 01:00:17.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:00:17.676 --> 01:00:20.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
