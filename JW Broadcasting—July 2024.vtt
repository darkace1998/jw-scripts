Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:06.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll learn how to develop
and protect our God-given thinking ability.

00:00:12.491 --> 00:00:14.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are some highlights of what’s to come.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next episode of <i>Imitate Their Faith</i>,
we’ll learn from Rebekah.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:24.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did her love for God
influence her choices?

00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:30.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
A priest spent years lost in a maze
of confusing teachings.

00:00:30.217 --> 00:00:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did she escape the maze and find truth?

00:00:34.805 --> 00:00:38.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve been feeling like life is nonstop,

00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:41.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll enjoy our latest music video.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a reminder to take a breath,

00:00:44.106 --> 00:00:47.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
pause, and reset.

00:00:47.568 --> 00:00:52.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is JW Broadcasting for July 2024.

00:01:13.052 --> 00:01:14.470 line:10% position:50% align:center
Young or old,

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.263 line:10% position:50% align:center
we need to consider the topic

00:01:16.263 --> 00:01:17.973 line:10% position:50% align:center
of thinking ability

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:21.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
and how to develop it effectively.

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:23.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us can think.

00:01:23.437 --> 00:01:26.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can think about a lot of things

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some good and some bad.

00:01:29.193 --> 00:01:31.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not uncommon, even for an adult,

00:01:31.946 --> 00:01:35.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let his mind wander aimlessly.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or a person may spend time thinking

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
of frivolous matters of little substance.

00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:44.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what can happen to our thinking,

00:01:44.458 --> 00:01:47.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it doesn’t always have a positive effect

00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our life or our future.

00:01:51.173 --> 00:01:54.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though specifically addressed to a young man,

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:59.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible book of Proverbs
gives sound advice for all of us.

00:02:00.224 --> 00:02:03.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 1:4 says:

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:07.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To give a young man
[for that matter any of us]

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowledge and thinking ability.”

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:14.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is thinking ability in this verse?

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:17.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Hebrew word translated “thinking ability”

00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:22.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be used in a bad sense
or in a favorable one.

00:02:22.287 --> 00:02:25.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our mind and thoughts can be directed

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:29.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a worthy, upright end
or just the opposite.

00:02:30.504 --> 00:02:32.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we incline our thinking to aspects

00:02:32.923 --> 00:02:35.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s will and purposes,

00:02:35.592 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll safeguard our own thinking ability,

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:42.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
directing it into the right channels.

00:02:43.767 --> 00:02:47.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
How valuable
is that type of thinking process?

00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn to Proverbs 3:21, 22,

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:55.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
which states: “Safeguard practical wisdom

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:57.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and thinking ability;

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will give you life.”

00:03:00.492 --> 00:03:03.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thinking ability
is not in the exclusive realm

00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:05.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the studious type.

00:03:05.706 --> 00:03:07.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout our entire life,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
we take in information by reading,

00:03:11.003 --> 00:03:13.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing, hearing,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experiencing things.

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:17.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s the way we take in information

00:03:17.468 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
and react to it
that shapes our individual behavior

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and personality.

00:03:24.391 --> 00:03:27.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many persons
have not used their minds for much more

00:03:27.853 --> 00:03:31.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
than the essentials of daily living.

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:35.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to succeed in life and in Jehovah’s eyes,

00:03:35.235 --> 00:03:38.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s necessary that we learn to train,

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:42.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
develop, and guard thinking ability.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider how trained thinking ability

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:47.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
might protect us

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to using the Internet wisely.

00:03:51.085 --> 00:03:55.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the Internet can be an excellent tool
for gathering knowledge,

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:58.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking ability when properly exercised

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:02.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
will safeguard us from its harmful effects.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:07.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, some popular social media sites

00:04:07.476 --> 00:04:09.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
contain short videos

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
designed to deliver instant gratification.

00:04:14.608 --> 00:04:18.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the viewer
gets no immediate emotional reward,

00:04:18.821 --> 00:04:21.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is tempted to keep scrolling

00:04:21.615 --> 00:04:25.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find material
that will give the desired effect.

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:29.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over time,
this can lower one’s attention span,

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:33.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
which may impede a person’s ability to learn,

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
retain, and recall information.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:41.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of us would want that to happen to us,
would we?

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, studies have shown

00:04:45.472 --> 00:04:48.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
that those who spend too much
of their time

00:04:48.392 --> 00:04:53.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their electronic devices
are more prone to stress, anxiety,

00:04:53.272 --> 00:04:57.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
depression, or other mental health problems.

00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:00.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand, thinking ability

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:02.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to work out ways

00:05:02.573 --> 00:05:06.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
to control our use of such technology.

00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:10.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, God-oriented thinking ability

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to distinguish truth

00:05:14.418 --> 00:05:18.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
from misleading and false information.

00:05:18.797 --> 00:05:21.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, there is wisdom in what is stated

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:24.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 2:11, 12:

00:05:25.637 --> 00:05:27.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thinking ability

00:05:27.556 --> 00:05:30.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will keep watch over you,

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and discernment will safeguard you,

00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:36.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
to save you from the bad course.”

00:05:38.275 --> 00:05:41.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is this so important?

00:05:41.695 --> 00:05:44.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thinking ability and discernment

00:05:44.698 --> 00:05:47.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us perception.

00:05:47.451 --> 00:05:50.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
And perception is closely related

00:05:50.662 --> 00:05:52.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our conscience.

00:05:53.373 --> 00:05:57.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we have meditated on
from God’s Word and stored in our mind

00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:59.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
can mold our conscience,

00:05:59.713 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is an inner mechanism

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warn us of wrong actions or tendencies.

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:10.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, our thinking watches over us.

00:06:11.516 --> 00:06:13.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how this is alluded to

00:06:13.268 --> 00:06:16.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 5:14:

00:06:17.314 --> 00:06:20.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But solid food belongs to mature people,

00:06:20.859 --> 00:06:24.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who through use
have their powers of discernment

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:28.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[that is, their thinking]
trained to distinguish

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:30.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
both right and wrong.”

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:34.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us, both young and old,

00:06:34.498 --> 00:06:39.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
should think carefully
about the following suggestions:

00:06:39.211 --> 00:06:43.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, grow in knowledge of Jehovah.

00:06:43.924 --> 00:06:46.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 9:10 says in part:

00:06:46.885 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Knowledge of the Most Holy One

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
is understanding.”

00:06:52.516 --> 00:06:54.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Coming to know Jehovah

00:06:54.518 --> 00:06:58.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a blessing and a protection.

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:02.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to pray to Jehovah
for insight when we study,

00:07:02.276 --> 00:07:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
apply ourselves to Bible reading
on a regular basis,

00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:09.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
and immerse ourselves in the truth.

00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:13.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should talk to Jehovah
in prayer as our closest confidant.

00:07:14.955 --> 00:07:17.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means using our thinking ability

00:07:17.791 --> 00:07:20.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
to convince ourselves that Jehovah’s advice

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:22.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the best advice,

00:07:22.879 --> 00:07:25.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
because doing so will 

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:28.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
safeguard us when we’re tempted,

00:07:28.218 --> 00:07:30.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
tested, or put into a situation

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:32.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we know we must say

00:07:32.806 --> 00:07:34.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
no.

00:07:35.142 --> 00:07:38.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember who we are, what we stand for, 

00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:41.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to whom we have dedicated our life.

00:07:43.608 --> 00:07:45.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next suggestion:

00:07:45.193 --> 00:07:49.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to continue to enhance
our Christian personality.

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:53.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is important, but why?

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:56.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because people who love Jehovah

00:07:56.455 --> 00:08:00.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
will like and respect us for who we are.

00:08:00.834 --> 00:08:04.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what kind of personality
are we suggesting?

00:08:04.713 --> 00:08:06.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note the expression

00:08:06.715 --> 00:08:09.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Christian personality”?

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:12.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means “Christlike.”

00:08:12.304 --> 00:08:16.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cannot go wrong
by imitating Jesus in any way possible.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall that 1 Peter 2:21 says:

00:08:22.939 --> 00:08:25.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this course you were called,

00:08:25.108 --> 00:08:28.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because even Christ suffered for you,

00:08:28.153 --> 00:08:32.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving a model
for you to follow his steps closely.”

00:08:33.742 --> 00:08:35.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ whole way of life

00:08:35.994 --> 00:08:40.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his attitudes, his values,
his interactions with others—

00:08:40.749 --> 00:08:43.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
culminated into a personality

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:48.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we should strive to follow closely.

00:08:48.048 --> 00:08:50.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know well how we want to look

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
when dressed for a special occasion.

00:08:53.387 --> 00:08:57.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
We clothe ourselves
with careful attention to details.

00:08:58.558 --> 00:09:03.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 3:10
picks up on the illustration of clothing.

00:09:03.355 --> 00:09:05.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it states:

00:09:06.358 --> 00:09:10.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And clothe yourselves
with the new personality.”

00:09:10.904 --> 00:09:14.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, Romans 13:14

00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:18.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells us: “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:23.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not be planning ahead
for the desires of the flesh.”

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:27.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to think
about Jesus’ personality constantly.

00:09:28.338 --> 00:09:30.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly does not come naturally to us

00:09:30.966 --> 00:09:33.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
imperfect descendants of Adam.

00:09:33.593 --> 00:09:36.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes real thinking ability.

00:09:36.513 --> 00:09:38.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, in this case,

00:09:38.974 --> 00:09:43.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are not clothing ourselves
just for one special occasion.

00:09:43.562 --> 00:09:47.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is to be our daily wardrobe.

00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:51.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the extent possible,
with our imperfection,

00:09:51.027 --> 00:09:53.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
we continuously work to reflect

00:09:53.738 --> 00:09:55.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ personality.

00:09:57.325 --> 00:09:58.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next suggestion:

00:09:58.827 --> 00:10:02.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Give priority to our priorities.

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:04.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this mean?

00:10:05.625 --> 00:10:07.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
To accomplish things in life,

00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:11.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must have schedules,
routines, and priorities.

00:10:11.923 --> 00:10:14.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, at Bethel,

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:17.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
much work is accomplished
because of the daily routine

00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:22.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of giving priority
to spiritual matters.

00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:25.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 1:10, Paul said

00:10:25.854 --> 00:10:29.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “make sure of the more important things.”

00:10:30.734 --> 00:10:34.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wholesome thinking ability
will help us to see the value

00:10:34.779 --> 00:10:37.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
of organizing our life each day

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:41.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give priority
to the most important things.

00:10:42.746 --> 00:10:44.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next suggestion:

00:10:44.247 --> 00:10:46.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep a modest view

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:49.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our own knowledge and experience.

00:10:49.878 --> 00:10:52.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thinking ability will help us to filter

00:10:52.964 --> 00:10:55.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
the information we let into our mind.

00:10:55.884 --> 00:11:00.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
The real test of whether our thinking ability
has been properly trained

00:11:00.305 --> 00:11:03.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
is how we apply knowledge.

00:11:03.433 --> 00:11:04.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we need to be

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:05.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
cautious in life,

00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:08.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask questions,

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:09.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
fact-check,

00:11:09.731 --> 00:11:12.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
get advice, read, study,

00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:15.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learn from Bible principles.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
And once we’ve accumulated knowledge,

00:11:17.781 --> 00:11:20.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
insight, and thinking ability,

00:11:20.492 --> 00:11:24.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
modesty is involved in how we share it.

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:28.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul said at Romans 12:3:

00:11:30.293 --> 00:11:32.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I tell everyone there among you

00:11:32.879 --> 00:11:37.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not to think more of himself
than it is necessary to think,

00:11:37.717 --> 00:11:41.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to think so as to have a sound mind.”

00:11:41.221 --> 00:11:44.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we need to display a modest outlook

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:47.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our acquired thinking ability.

00:11:47.852 --> 00:11:52.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice it said
to think with “a sound mind,”

00:11:52.148 --> 00:11:54.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
not an inflated mind,

00:11:54.526 --> 00:11:58.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
not thinking more of ourselves
than is necessary to think?

00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:03.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way to use thinking ability
in this old world

00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:05.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to avoid debt.

00:12:05.662 --> 00:12:07.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why is this our last point?

00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:12.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because material things
are not the most important things in life.

00:12:14.045 --> 00:12:16.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many work themselves to death

00:12:16.131 --> 00:12:18.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gain material prosperity.

00:12:18.675 --> 00:12:23.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as Christians,
there’s other work that’s related to worship.

00:12:23.638 --> 00:12:26.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to work ourselves to life,

00:12:26.266 --> 00:12:30.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, focused on everlasting life yet ahead.

00:12:31.938 --> 00:12:34.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true, though, that some money is needed

00:12:34.566 --> 00:12:37.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
to buy the necessities of life.

00:12:37.527 --> 00:12:41.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we’re young
and just starting to earn a living

00:12:41.072 --> 00:12:45.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we’re older
and have been working secularly for years,

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:50.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to learn to manage and budget money.

00:12:50.665 --> 00:12:53.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
This involves using our thinking ability

00:12:53.918 --> 00:12:57.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
to separate needs from wants

00:12:57.505 --> 00:13:02.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being cautious
about accumulating much debt.

00:13:02.469 --> 00:13:06.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, according to Proverbs 22:7,

00:13:06.598 --> 00:13:10.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the borrower is a slave to the lender.”

00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:15.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
These few suggestions 
are but a sample of areas in life

00:13:15.982 --> 00:13:20.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we need
thinking ability and discernment

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to analyze our situation,

00:13:23.114 --> 00:13:27.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
make decisions, and determine future plans.

00:13:27.827 --> 00:13:32.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always remember the advice
at Proverbs 3:21, 22:

00:13:32.248 --> 00:13:35.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Safeguard practical wisdom

00:13:35.168 --> 00:13:37.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and thinking ability;

00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:39.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will give you life.”

00:13:39.756 --> 00:13:43.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes and—we may add—
even everlasting life

00:13:43.259 --> 00:13:45.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s righteous new world!

00:13:48.014 --> 00:13:52.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young people in the Bible used their
thinking ability to make wise decisions.

00:13:52.894 --> 00:13:55.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah was one of them.

00:13:55.772 --> 00:14:00.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how she was
able to make a life-changing choice.

00:14:04.948 --> 00:14:06.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Long ago,

00:14:06.783 --> 00:14:09.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham sent his servant Eliezer

00:14:09.244 --> 00:14:12.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find a wife for his son Isaac.

00:14:12.163 --> 00:14:13.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew God’s purpose

00:14:13.748 --> 00:14:16.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
required a woman of deep faith.

00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:18.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who would be willing

00:14:18.545 --> 00:14:20.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
to leave their home

00:14:20.171 --> 00:14:21.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and travel into the unknown?

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:27.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah!

00:14:28.263 --> 00:14:30.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah!

00:14:35.687 --> 00:14:37.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mother, I’m back.

00:14:42.026 --> 00:14:43.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, my dear.

00:14:43.611 --> 00:14:45.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Mother. 

00:14:45.155 --> 00:14:46.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah!

00:14:46.197 --> 00:14:48.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your cousin has been looking for you.

00:14:48.992 --> 00:14:50.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ana, I’m over here!

00:14:52.579 --> 00:14:55.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah, can you bring this to Father?

00:14:55.165 --> 00:14:56.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah. Is he still working?

00:14:56.875 --> 00:14:58.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still working.

00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah, I’ve been looking for you.

00:15:01.796 --> 00:15:02.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I come with you?

00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:03.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:15:10.388 --> 00:15:11.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, Father.

00:15:11.931 --> 00:15:13.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Laban said you needed this.

00:15:13.308 --> 00:15:14.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, thank you.

00:15:23.777 --> 00:15:25.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I help with anything?

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can come with me to the well.

00:15:26.738 --> 00:15:27.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:15:33.953 --> 00:15:36.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ana, not today.

00:15:36.164 --> 00:15:38.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need your help making dinner.

00:15:38.166 --> 00:15:39.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:15:46.758 --> 00:15:47.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good day.

00:15:47.383 --> 00:15:48.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello, Rebekah.

00:15:48.092 --> 00:15:49.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice to see you. Have a good day.

00:15:59.312 --> 00:16:01.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please,

00:16:01.314 --> 00:16:04.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
give me a little sip of water from your jar.

00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:06.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Drink, my lord.

00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:17.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will also draw water for your camels

00:16:17.163 --> 00:16:19.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
until they are done drinking.

00:16:48.778 --> 00:16:50.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve had a long trip.

00:16:53.157 --> 00:16:54.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excuse me, my lord.

00:16:54.576 --> 00:16:56.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please tell me,

00:16:56.202 --> 00:16:58.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose daughter are you?

00:16:59.539 --> 00:17:01.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there any room at your father’s house

00:17:01.416 --> 00:17:02.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to spend the night?

00:17:15.263 --> 00:17:17.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will not eat

00:17:17.265 --> 00:17:19.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
until I have told you what I have to say.

00:17:20.643 --> 00:17:22.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please speak!

00:17:23.521 --> 00:17:26.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am Abraham’s servant.

00:17:26.232 --> 00:17:30.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah has blessed my master very much.

00:17:30.403 --> 00:17:34.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sarah the wife of my master

00:17:34.324 --> 00:17:37.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
bore a son to my master after she grew old.

00:17:39.203 --> 00:17:41.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my master made me swear, saying:

00:17:41.998 --> 00:17:44.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will go to the house of my father

00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:46.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to my family,

00:17:47.128 --> 00:17:49.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you must take a wife

00:17:49.213 --> 00:17:51.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
for my son.”

00:17:51.215 --> 00:17:52.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I said to my master:

00:17:52.884 --> 00:17:55.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What if the woman is unwilling to come?”

00:17:57.347 --> 00:17:59.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to me:

00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:02.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will send his angel with you

00:18:02.393 --> 00:18:05.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will certainly give success to your journey.”

00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:08.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I got to the spring today,

00:18:08.983 --> 00:18:13.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Jehovah the God of my master Abraham,

00:18:14.530 --> 00:18:17.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if you will make my journey successful,

00:18:18.451 --> 00:18:21.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“here I am standing at a spring.

00:18:22.914 --> 00:18:25.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When a young woman comes out to draw water,

00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:27.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will say: ‘Please,

00:18:27.919 --> 00:18:31.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let me drink a little water from your jar.’

00:18:31.047 --> 00:18:34.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And she will say to me: ‘You take a drink,

00:18:34.968 --> 00:18:38.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will also draw water for your camels.’

00:18:38.972 --> 00:18:40.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let that woman be the one

00:18:40.598 --> 00:18:42.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whom Jehovah has chosen

00:18:42.141 --> 00:18:43.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the son of my master.”

00:18:45.228 --> 00:18:48.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I was finished speaking in my heart,

00:18:49.774 --> 00:18:52.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was Rebekah

00:18:52.443 --> 00:18:55.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
coming out with her jar on her shoulder.

00:18:55.738 --> 00:18:58.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that I asked her,

00:18:58.241 --> 00:18:59.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whose daughter are you?”

00:18:59.742 --> 00:19:00.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
to which she replied,

00:19:00.994 --> 00:19:03.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The daughter of Bethuel.”

00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:06.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I put the ring on her nose

00:19:06.207 --> 00:19:08.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the bracelets on her hands.

00:19:09.335 --> 00:19:11.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now tell me

00:19:11.462 --> 00:19:14.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you wish to show loyal love

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:17.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and faithfulness to my master;

00:19:19.345 --> 00:19:22.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if not, tell me,

00:19:23.391 --> 00:19:26.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I may proceed one way or the other.

00:19:32.817 --> 00:19:35.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is from Jehovah.

00:19:36.112 --> 00:19:38.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let her become a wife

00:19:38.239 --> 00:19:39.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the son of your master,

00:19:39.699 --> 00:19:41.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as Jehovah has spoken.

00:20:12.648 --> 00:20:14.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Negeb is far.

00:20:15.902 --> 00:20:17.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will you come back?

00:20:23.993 --> 00:20:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can’t you just stay here?

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
You heard what my father said:

00:20:28.498 --> 00:20:30.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is from Jehovah.”

00:20:30.458 --> 00:20:32.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can serve Jehovah here!

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:38.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is true.

00:20:43.679 --> 00:20:45.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you know

00:20:45.473 --> 00:20:47.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will bless you

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
in ways you can’t even imagine.

00:20:53.815 --> 00:20:57.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still have time together.

00:21:04.242 --> 00:21:06.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s make the most of it.

00:21:36.023 --> 00:21:38.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, why me?

00:21:53.791 --> 00:21:56.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gather all the men and prepare the camels.

00:21:56.252 --> 00:21:57.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must leave soon.

00:21:57.295 --> 00:21:58.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right away.

00:21:58.045 --> 00:22:00.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are you packing?

00:22:01.632 --> 00:22:04.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please send me off to my master.

00:22:04.343 --> 00:22:05.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let the young woman stay with us

00:22:05.928 --> 00:22:07.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ten more days.

00:22:07.638 --> 00:22:09.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
At least ten more days.

00:22:09.557 --> 00:22:11.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then she can go.

00:22:11.559 --> 00:22:13.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not detain me,

00:22:13.561 --> 00:22:15.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing that Jehovah has made

00:22:15.188 --> 00:22:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
my journey successful.

00:22:17.273 --> 00:22:19.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Send me off,

00:22:19.192 --> 00:22:21.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order that I may go to my master.

00:22:22.403 --> 00:22:24.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us call the young woman

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:26.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and inquire of her.

00:22:30.161 --> 00:22:31.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah,

00:22:32.413 --> 00:22:34.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eliezer wants to leave right now!

00:22:56.145 --> 00:22:57.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excuse me.

00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:15.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you go with this man?

00:23:27.635 --> 00:23:29.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am willing to go.

00:23:47.071 --> 00:23:48.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:24:29.530 --> 00:24:31.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah!

00:24:34.618 --> 00:24:36.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister,

00:24:38.289 --> 00:24:41.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
may you become thousands times ten thousand,

00:24:41.876 --> 00:24:43.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let your offspring

00:24:43.169 --> 00:24:44.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
take possession of the gate

00:24:44.337 --> 00:24:46.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who hate them.

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Praise Jehovah!

00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:54.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Praise Jehovah!

00:24:55.556 --> 00:24:57.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll miss you!

00:24:58.434 --> 00:25:00.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love you.

00:25:20.498 --> 00:25:23.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebekah did not know what lay before her,

00:25:23.584 --> 00:25:25.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there is no record

00:25:25.336 --> 00:25:27.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she saw her family again.

00:25:30.925 --> 00:25:34.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
She showed faith when she left the comfort of home.

00:25:37.098 --> 00:25:38.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah blessed her

00:25:38.766 --> 00:25:41.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an ancestress of the Messiah.

00:25:43.354 --> 00:25:46.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her faith is worthy of our imitation.

00:25:55.741 --> 00:25:59.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Overall, Rebekah had a life of few regrets.

00:25:59.703 --> 00:26:03.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
The opportunity for the same blessing
is there for you too

00:26:03.916 --> 00:26:06.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you imitate the faith of Rebekah.

00:26:08.087 --> 00:26:12.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some people feel
that faith and science are at odds.

00:26:12.925 --> 00:26:16.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
They say that a thinking person
cannot believe in God.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that true?

00:26:18.722 --> 00:26:22.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
See how these young people used science

00:26:22.059 --> 00:26:24.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build their faith.

00:26:31.819 --> 00:26:33.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you believe in creation,

00:26:33.696 --> 00:26:35.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
what challenges might you face?

00:26:37.199 --> 00:26:39.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
My favorite subject was science

00:26:39.452 --> 00:26:42.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I learned facts
about how things are connected.

00:26:42.121 --> 00:26:44.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought that was really exciting,

00:26:44.248 --> 00:26:46.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing how the physical world works.

00:26:46.625 --> 00:26:49.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then you come to a topic like evolution,

00:26:49.086 --> 00:26:51.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you immediately know

00:26:51.422 --> 00:26:54.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is something here
that is not quite right.

00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:58.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fifth grade when I was around 12,
we had science

00:26:58.679 --> 00:27:00.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my worst subject.

00:27:00.723 --> 00:27:03.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
The teacher was fully convinced

00:27:03.017 --> 00:27:06.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we descended from apes
and that the evolution theory is the truth.

00:27:09.064 --> 00:27:10.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
You realize that you’re probably

00:27:10.649 --> 00:27:14.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
the only one in that room thinking,
‘This is not true.’

00:27:15.946 --> 00:27:18.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you might start questioning yourself,

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:21.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is the teacher wrong,

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:24.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
or have I maybe believed something wrong
my whole life?’

00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:30.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s— It’s a little challenging
being alone in such a situation.

00:27:31.462 --> 00:27:34.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped you
to build your faith in a Creator?

00:27:36.717 --> 00:27:40.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
I spent a lot of time on the bus
to and from school

00:27:40.513 --> 00:27:44.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
reading jw.org
and the <i>Five Questions </i> brochure,

00:27:44.350 --> 00:27:48.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually, to make up my mind
as to what I believe in.

00:27:48.646 --> 00:27:51.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did a lot of research
when I got home that evening,

00:27:51.815 --> 00:27:54.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my parents helped me search our website.

00:27:54.527 --> 00:27:56.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what helped me the most was the video 

00:27:56.820 --> 00:27:59.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>What Your Peers Say—Belief in God.</i>

00:27:59.323 --> 00:28:02.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember one small scene
that stuck with me.

00:28:02.243 --> 00:28:04.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the glass bottle
that was pulled up from the sand.

00:28:04.954 --> 00:28:09.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it’s made of the same material,
but it definitely didn’t form by itself.

00:28:09.833 --> 00:28:13.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
There has to be someone
that turns it into a glass bottle.

00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:16.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I found that very logical;

00:28:16.382 --> 00:28:20.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really convinced me
that there is a Creator.

00:28:20.052 --> 00:28:23.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember there are
three things necessary for life.

00:28:23.305 --> 00:28:27.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
I learned it was RNA, DNA, and proteins.

00:28:27.601 --> 00:28:31.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they were to exist at the same place
and at the same time,

00:28:31.772 --> 00:28:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would be very rare.

00:28:33.816 --> 00:28:35.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on top of that, 

00:28:35.568 --> 00:28:38.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would be as if those three things
then should team up

00:28:38.654 --> 00:28:42.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say, “We would like to create life,
a cell that, in turn,

00:28:42.783 --> 00:28:45.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
would become an animal,
a person, or many other things.”

00:28:46.954 --> 00:28:49.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
This made me realize that believing this

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
would require even more faith

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
than believing that there is a God
who has created everything.

00:28:55.296 --> 00:28:58.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I sent a text message to my teacher

00:28:58.716 --> 00:29:01.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my viewpoints
about me believing in a Creator

00:29:01.719 --> 00:29:04.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and added a link to the video.

00:29:04.597 --> 00:29:08.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
He then asked if it was OK
if I showed the video to the class.

00:29:10.227 --> 00:29:12.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I said, “Of course.”

00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:16.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
I watched the video so many times
that I knew all the lines by heart.

00:29:16.859 --> 00:29:20.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew exactly
which scene came when and where

00:29:20.362 --> 00:29:24.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that if someone in the class
had any questions, I would know the answer.

00:29:24.408 --> 00:29:28.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the last five minutes,
I got to appear in front of the class,

00:29:28.162 --> 00:29:30.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
explained a little about Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:29:30.706 --> 00:29:32.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we believe in a Creator,

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
and said I had a video
that convinced <i>me</i>  of that.

00:29:35.628 --> 00:29:39.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I was about to press start,
the bell rang for a break.

00:29:39.882 --> 00:29:43.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
But everyone stayed in the classroom
to watch the video.

00:29:43.302 --> 00:29:45.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought that was really fun.

00:29:46.138 --> 00:29:48.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does having faith in a loving Creator
help you?

00:29:50.142 --> 00:29:53.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes everything more meaningful.

00:29:53.937 --> 00:29:57.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not thinking: ‘Here I am.

00:29:57.316 --> 00:30:00.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’ll just live the way I do until I die,

00:30:00.444 --> 00:30:02.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s it.’

00:30:02.529 --> 00:30:05.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
You believe that there is a purpose to life,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it also opens the possibility
of a hope for the future.

00:30:08.911 --> 00:30:11.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around us there are so many people

00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:14.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have different views and theories,

00:30:14.792 --> 00:30:17.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that can have a big impact on us.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you don’t have a strong faith,

00:30:21.006 --> 00:30:25.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
then someone can pick away at your faith
and try to break it down.

00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:31.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I am very grateful
that my parents taught me about creation.

00:30:31.183 --> 00:30:34.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I always knew
that there is a loving Father out there

00:30:34.603 --> 00:30:36.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has created
all the beautiful things for us.

00:30:37.272 --> 00:30:39.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can just go out into nature.

00:30:39.441 --> 00:30:43.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sun is shining; 
look at all the beautiful colors in autumn.

00:30:43.612 --> 00:30:47.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so nice, and all you can do is, really,
just be grateful.

00:30:47.908 --> 00:30:50.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I am 100 percent convinced

00:30:50.911 --> 00:30:54.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
that creation is a fact.

00:30:54.206 --> 00:30:56.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how it must have begun.

00:31:07.553 --> 00:31:10.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
These young people had doubts,

00:31:10.347 --> 00:31:13.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they faced them head on.

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can too.

00:31:15.144 --> 00:31:18.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be afraid to talk to mature Christians.

00:31:18.647 --> 00:31:22.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do your research
and reason on what you learn.

00:31:22.109 --> 00:31:26.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you take in accurate knowledge,
you’ll find satisfying answers.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what Katri wanted

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
—answers to life’s big questions.

00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:36.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was a Lutheran priest in Finland.

00:31:36.999 --> 00:31:39.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would she find real truth?

00:31:39.251 --> 00:31:40.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out.

00:31:45.507 --> 00:31:48.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother taught me
from a very young age to pray.

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:52.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
For us, it meant chatting openly
with our heavenly Father

00:31:53.182 --> 00:31:55.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
—everyday conversation.

00:31:57.603 --> 00:31:59.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a valuable life lesson

00:31:59.813 --> 00:32:02.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has empowered me throughout my life.

00:32:04.443 --> 00:32:07.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up, I always wanted
to become a teacher.

00:32:09.156 --> 00:32:10.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after reflecting on it a bit more,

00:32:12.201 --> 00:32:14.203 line:10% position:50% align:center
I realized that

00:32:14.203 --> 00:32:16.497 line:10% position:50% align:center
what I really wanted to do with my life

00:32:16.497 --> 00:32:19.249 line:10% position:50% align:center
was to work for the Kingdom of heaven.

00:32:19.249 --> 00:32:22.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how could I do both?

00:32:22.503 --> 00:32:25.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided to pursue a career in theology.

00:32:25.964 --> 00:32:28.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
My goal was to become
an instructor in the church.

00:32:30.844 --> 00:32:33.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I started working for the church,

00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:37.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
I quickly discovered
that the teachings of the church

00:32:37.142 --> 00:32:39.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
contradict what the Bible says.

00:32:42.773 --> 00:32:45.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
One question left unanswered by the church

00:32:45.317 --> 00:32:47.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
was why suffering exists.

00:32:48.987 --> 00:32:51.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
A pastor could only stammer and say,

00:32:51.448 --> 00:32:55.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, it can’t be explained
because it’s a mystery.”

00:32:56.537 --> 00:32:59.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I didn’t think the existence of suffering

00:32:59.331 --> 00:33:01.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
could be a mystery at all.

00:33:03.085 --> 00:33:06.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I had to find a way

00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:11.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
to satisfy my conscience

00:33:11.343 --> 00:33:14.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still uphold the position of the church.

00:33:14.972 --> 00:33:18.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while I was teaching, I would explain,

00:33:18.475 --> 00:33:23.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what the church teaches,
but this is what the Bible says.”

00:33:35.117 --> 00:33:36.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then

00:33:36.618 --> 00:33:39.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
the most tragic moment
of my life happened.

00:33:40.998 --> 00:33:45.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was 22 years old
and in the middle of planning for my wedding

00:33:49.464 --> 00:33:53.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
when my fiancé died in a car accident.

00:33:56.305 --> 00:33:59.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, this changed my life

00:34:01.476 --> 00:34:02.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely.

00:34:06.857 --> 00:34:08.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the most painful feeling.

00:34:08.942 --> 00:34:10.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just knew deep down

00:34:10.944 --> 00:34:15.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
that now I would never marry
or have a family of my own.

00:34:17.492 --> 00:34:20.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I had to find a way to survive

00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
—day after day, year after year—

00:34:24.625 --> 00:34:28.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look for another way
to leave something meaningful behind.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I buried myself in my work.

00:34:34.468 --> 00:34:36.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
The position at the church

00:34:36.261 --> 00:34:39.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I had been working toward
was discontinued

00:34:39.139 --> 00:34:41.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and changed to the role of a priest.

00:34:42.684 --> 00:34:45.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Altogether, I did congregational work

00:34:45.187 --> 00:34:46.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 33 years.

00:34:47.648 --> 00:34:49.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then

00:34:49.107 --> 00:34:51.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
when my health
couldn’t take it anymore,

00:34:51.902 --> 00:34:54.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did other tasks for the church.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was giving everything I had to give.

00:34:59.368 --> 00:35:02.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whenever I looked to the church
to give something to me,

00:35:04.873 --> 00:35:07.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always left empty.

00:35:09.753 --> 00:35:11.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed for many years,

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:16.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Lord, help me find my real spiritual home.”

00:35:17.302 --> 00:35:21.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was my prayer for about ten years.

00:35:21.014 --> 00:35:22.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then one day,

00:35:24.893 --> 00:35:27.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
I came across Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:35:30.232 --> 00:35:32.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Immediately, I said to my heavenly Father,

00:35:32.859 --> 00:35:35.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what I have been searching for!”

00:35:47.666 --> 00:35:50.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What do you have for me?”

00:35:50.627 --> 00:35:53.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the first thing I asked them.

00:35:54.423 --> 00:35:58.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first meeting I attended
made a big impression on me.

00:35:59.177 --> 00:36:00.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember in particular

00:36:00.762 --> 00:36:03.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
the verse in the Gospel of John:

00:36:03.473 --> 00:36:06.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By this all will know
that you are my disciples

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:08.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if you have love [in your midst].”

00:36:09.938 --> 00:36:11.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought:

00:36:11.732 --> 00:36:13.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I’ve been searching for this

00:36:13.859 --> 00:36:16.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘all my life, and this is it!

00:36:16.737 --> 00:36:18.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s right here.’

00:36:23.869 --> 00:36:26.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
My closest friend was deeply shocked

00:36:26.621 --> 00:36:29.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I told her
that I was going to leave the church

00:36:29.541 --> 00:36:32.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:36:33.086 --> 00:36:36.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
When she calmed down, she said:

00:36:36.173 --> 00:36:40.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will support you, as I always have.

00:36:40.093 --> 00:36:43.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
But promise me you won’t change.”

00:36:44.097 --> 00:36:47.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Four years later, she came to visit me again.

00:36:48.393 --> 00:36:52.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
She kept watching me closely and said,

00:36:54.566 --> 00:36:56.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have changed.”

00:36:56.943 --> 00:37:01.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was startled and asked, “In what way?”

00:37:02.741 --> 00:37:04.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said,

00:37:04.826 --> 00:37:08.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It looks to me like you’re happy.”

00:37:12.334 --> 00:37:14.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
My prayer

00:37:14.169 --> 00:37:17.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find a spiritual home

00:37:17.130 --> 00:37:19.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
was answered,

00:37:21.301 --> 00:37:25.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I experienced the great miracle

00:37:25.222 --> 00:37:27.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
of finally finding

00:37:27.099 --> 00:37:32.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
what I had been looking for my entire life.

00:37:38.944 --> 00:37:42.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re glad Katri found
the spiritual home she prayed for.

00:37:43.532 --> 00:37:46.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
A painful loss was a turning point for her.

00:37:47.953 --> 00:37:52.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suffering can cause any of us to wonder: 
‘Why me?

00:37:52.833 --> 00:37:54.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why now?

00:37:54.835 --> 00:37:57.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does God care?’

00:37:57.129 --> 00:38:00.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother David Splane
of the Governing Body examines

00:38:00.006 --> 00:38:03.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we can quell disquieting thoughts

00:38:03.218 --> 00:38:05.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the following morning worship.

00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:08.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever gotten into trouble

00:38:08.473 --> 00:38:11.184 line:10% position:50% align:center
trying to do the right thing?

00:38:11.184 --> 00:38:14.521 line:10% position:50% align:center
If you have, think about Jacob.

00:38:14.521 --> 00:38:17.858 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, Jacob did the right thing.

00:38:17.858 --> 00:38:19.860 line:10% position:50% align:center
Rather than marry out of the truth

00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
like his brother Esau,

00:38:21.862 --> 00:38:25.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
he traveled to the home
of a believing relative, Laban,

00:38:25.782 --> 00:38:29.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked for the hand
of his daughter Rachel.

00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:32.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
It didn’t work out so well.

00:38:32.622 --> 00:38:35.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob was tricked by Laban

00:38:35.125 --> 00:38:39.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
into marrying both Rachel
and her older sister, Leah.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the women didn’t get along very well.

00:38:42.382 --> 00:38:47.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
they acted more like rivals than like family.

00:38:47.095 --> 00:38:49.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jehovah saw what Laban was up to,

00:38:49.890 --> 00:38:52.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he didn’t intervene.

00:38:52.475 --> 00:38:55.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jacob didn’t blame Jehovah, as if to say:

00:38:55.478 --> 00:38:57.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, why is this happening to me?

00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I followed instructions.

00:38:59.149 --> 00:39:02.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
I did the right thing,
and look where I am today.’

00:39:02.277 --> 00:39:04.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, that wasn’t Jacob.

00:39:04.821 --> 00:39:08.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, later on,
Jehovah fixed the matter

00:39:08.283 --> 00:39:10.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving the law to Israel:

00:39:10.744 --> 00:39:15.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not take a woman
in addition to her sister

00:39:15.498 --> 00:39:17.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a rival wife.”

00:39:17.918 --> 00:39:19.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that law seems to have

00:39:19.544 --> 00:39:22.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leah and Rachel
written all over it, doesn’t it?

00:39:22.422 --> 00:39:24.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah fixed the matter,

00:39:24.174 --> 00:39:27.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in the meantime,
he did sustain Jacob.

00:39:27.761 --> 00:39:32.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did help Jacob through his trial.

00:39:32.432 --> 00:39:35.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a bright spot in all of this was Joseph,

00:39:35.185 --> 00:39:38.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s the subject of our comment today.

00:39:38.146 --> 00:39:42.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah began dealing with Joseph
when he was just a teenager,

00:39:42.192 --> 00:39:44.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and He gave him two dreams.

00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:49.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the first dream was about food,
sheaves of wheat.

00:39:49.574 --> 00:39:53.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
His brothers’ sheaves bowed down
to his sheaf.

00:39:53.453 --> 00:39:55.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was appropriate, wasn’t it?

00:39:55.080 --> 00:39:58.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because later on,
not only Joseph’s brothers

00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:01.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
but almost everyone in the known world

00:40:01.378 --> 00:40:04.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
was going to look to Joseph for food.

00:40:04.756 --> 00:40:07.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second dream included his father

00:40:07.926 --> 00:40:10.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, strangely, his mother,

00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:13.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had died giving birth to Benjamin.

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in that dream, the sun, moon,

00:40:16.851 --> 00:40:19.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 11 stars (that would include Benjamin)

00:40:19.729 --> 00:40:22.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
bowed down to Joseph.

00:40:22.232 --> 00:40:24.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s no record
that Joseph ever attempted

00:40:24.776 --> 00:40:26.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
to interpret that dream.

00:40:26.778 --> 00:40:30.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jacob and his sons got the point,

00:40:30.198 --> 00:40:32.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were offended.

00:40:32.534 --> 00:40:36.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jacob kind of accused Joseph
of being presumptuous.

00:40:36.037 --> 00:40:41.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Am I . . .
your mother and your brothers

00:40:41.001 --> 00:40:44.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
really going to come
and bow down to the earth to you?”

00:40:45.046 --> 00:40:47.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we won’t comment on the fact

00:40:47.048 --> 00:40:50.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jacob automatically assumed

00:40:50.010 --> 00:40:52.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was the sun in that dream.

00:40:53.388 --> 00:40:57.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by means of the dreams,
what was Jehovah telling Joseph?

00:40:57.392 --> 00:41:01.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was telling Joseph that he had
something special in mind for him.

00:41:01.646 --> 00:41:04.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a purpose for Joseph.

00:41:04.774 --> 00:41:07.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you suppose
the Devil wanted to do?

00:41:07.944 --> 00:41:10.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Devil wanted
to frustrate that purpose.

00:41:10.864 --> 00:41:14.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to keep that purpose
from being fulfilled.

00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:17.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Satan must have been overjoyed

00:41:17.162 --> 00:41:20.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he heard Joseph’s brothers
plotting to put him to death.

00:41:21.833 --> 00:41:24.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would they have followed through with it?

00:41:24.627 --> 00:41:27.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about Simeon and Levi.

00:41:27.672 --> 00:41:30.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
They didn’t hesitate
to mow down all the men of Shechem

00:41:30.884 --> 00:41:34.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
when one man raped their sister.

00:41:34.846 --> 00:41:38.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the oldest of the brothers,
24-year-old Reuben,

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:41.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
talks the others into sparing Joseph’s life.

00:41:41.811 --> 00:41:44.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did Jehovah move him to do that?

00:41:44.105 --> 00:41:45.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be.

00:41:45.774 --> 00:41:47.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was certainly in line with His purpose.

00:41:47.817 --> 00:41:49.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
So instead of killing Joseph,

00:41:49.819 --> 00:41:53.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
his brothers sell him
to a band of Ishmaelites.

00:41:53.239 --> 00:41:56.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I want you to tuck that
in the back of your mind, Ishmaelites,

00:41:56.701 --> 00:41:59.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we’re going
to come back to that a little later.

00:41:59.829 --> 00:42:03.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the Ishmaelites
bring Joseph down to Egypt,

00:42:03.333 --> 00:42:05.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he becomes a slave to Potiphar,

00:42:05.877 --> 00:42:09.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
the chief of Pharaoh’s bodyguard.

00:42:09.631 --> 00:42:12.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Joseph is a slave.

00:42:12.008 --> 00:42:14.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happens three years later?

00:42:15.595 --> 00:42:18.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
His grandfather Isaac dies.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:23.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Joseph the slave
can’t be there to say goodbye.

00:42:23.269 --> 00:42:28.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
It kind of reminds us of many of us
during this pandemic, doesn’t it?

00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:32.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as with us, Jehovah was with Joseph.

00:42:32.529 --> 00:42:36.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a great success
in Potiphar’s household

00:42:36.032 --> 00:42:39.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
until Potiphar’s wife accused him of rape

00:42:39.577 --> 00:42:42.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Potiphar threw Joseph into prison.

00:42:44.457 --> 00:42:49.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can say that Jehovah was with Joseph
because he went to prison.

00:42:50.797 --> 00:42:53.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we say that?

00:42:53.341 --> 00:42:56.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prison was probably
the mildest form of punishment

00:42:56.719 --> 00:42:58.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Joseph could have suffered.

00:42:58.388 --> 00:42:59.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a Hebrew slave.

00:42:59.848 --> 00:43:01.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And under Egyptian law,

00:43:01.850 --> 00:43:06.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Potiphar could have killed him on the spot
because of the accusations,

00:43:06.229 --> 00:43:09.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
or he could have had Joseph arrested

00:43:09.107 --> 00:43:13.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the court could have ordered
a thousand lashes.

00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:18.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph would probably have died
under the lash.

00:43:18.158 --> 00:43:21.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that gives us perspective
when we read in the Mosaic Law

00:43:21.703 --> 00:43:26.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
that an Israelite could receive
up to 40 strokes of the rod

00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:28.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not a thousand lashes.

00:43:28.418 --> 00:43:30.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was love on Jehovah’s part.

00:43:30.503 --> 00:43:33.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to prevent the Israelites

00:43:33.631 --> 00:43:37.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
from being cruel like the Egyptians.

00:43:37.343 --> 00:43:40.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s use our imagination a little bit.

00:43:40.013 --> 00:43:43.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later on,
Joseph interprets a dream for Pharaoh,

00:43:43.433 --> 00:43:45.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Pharaoh makes him his chief adviser.

00:43:45.894 --> 00:43:46.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, imagine.

00:43:46.936 --> 00:43:51.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph kneels
and receives the signet ring from Pharaoh.

00:43:51.816 --> 00:43:55.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
He rises and takes a step back.

00:43:55.403 --> 00:43:57.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out of the corner of his eye,

00:43:57.405 --> 00:44:00.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
he sees someone standing near the throne,

00:44:00.241 --> 00:44:05.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
someone who’s trying
to make himself very small:

00:44:05.163 --> 00:44:10.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Potiphar, the chief of the bodyguard.

00:44:10.084 --> 00:44:11.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know about you,

00:44:11.461 --> 00:44:15.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that possibility makes me smile
when I think about it.

00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what happened
when Potiphar went home to lunch that day

00:44:19.802 --> 00:44:24.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and told his wife
who his new boss was now?

00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:27.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder how much sleep she lost over that.

00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:33.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Potiphar’s wife did a terrible thing,
but so did Joseph’s brothers.

00:44:33.566 --> 00:44:36.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
if the Law had been in force,

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:39.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph’s brothers
would have been put to death for kidnapping.

00:44:39.447 --> 00:44:44.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later,
Jehovah made kidnapping a capital offense.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:48.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
He may have had Joseph’s brothers in mind
when he did that.

00:44:48.498 --> 00:44:52.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, some think that Simeon
masterminded the kidnapping plot,

00:44:52.544 --> 00:44:56.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that might explain
why Joseph chose him to stay behind

00:44:56.005 --> 00:44:58.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he sent the rest of his brothers home.

00:44:58.925 --> 00:45:00.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s get back to Jehovah’s purpose.

00:45:00.927 --> 00:45:03.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has a purpose for Joseph.

00:45:03.388 --> 00:45:06.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joseph brings the family down to Egypt.

00:45:06.224 --> 00:45:09.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s part of the prophecy,
but there’s more.

00:45:09.519 --> 00:45:11.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
God told Abraham

00:45:11.312 --> 00:45:15.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his descendants
would be afflicted by foreigners

00:45:15.066 --> 00:45:17.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 400 years.

00:45:17.777 --> 00:45:20.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Israel left Egypt in 1513 B.C.E.

00:45:20.947 --> 00:45:23.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when did the 400 years start?

00:45:23.533 --> 00:45:25.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
1913 B.C.E.

00:45:25.827 --> 00:45:28.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened that year?

00:45:28.121 --> 00:45:32.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac’s half brother
—what was his name again?

00:45:32.292 --> 00:45:33.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ishmael.

00:45:33.751 --> 00:45:37.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ishmael persecuted Isaac.

00:45:37.630 --> 00:45:40.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was Ishmael a foreigner?

00:45:40.341 --> 00:45:44.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
His mother was an Egyptian slave,

00:45:44.137 --> 00:45:46.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his descendants
—the Ishmaelites—

00:45:46.180 --> 00:45:48.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
had Egyptian blood.

00:45:48.558 --> 00:45:52.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting that the Ishmaelites
followed in the family tradition

00:45:52.729 --> 00:45:56.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
by persecuting Isaac’s grandson Joseph.

00:45:57.358 --> 00:45:59.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah didn’t incite Joseph’s brothers

00:45:59.736 --> 00:46:02.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
to kidnap him and send him down to Egypt,

00:46:02.947 --> 00:46:06.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
but He did use the event
to carry out his purpose.

00:46:06.743 --> 00:46:09.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t always prevent bad things

00:46:09.037 --> 00:46:13.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
from happening to Jacob
(like marrying sisters who didn’t get along)

00:46:13.041 --> 00:46:15.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to Joseph
(like being falsely accused).

00:46:15.793 --> 00:46:17.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t put a hedge around them.

00:46:17.795 --> 00:46:22.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he did help both of them
to face their trials every step of the way.

00:46:23.468 --> 00:46:25.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did that for them.

00:46:25.511 --> 00:46:27.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll do it for you too.

00:46:27.555 --> 00:46:31.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you ever get in trouble
trying to do the right thing,

00:46:31.726 --> 00:46:34.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
think of Jacob; think of Jehovah.

00:46:34.771 --> 00:46:36.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will help you.

00:46:36.773 --> 00:46:38.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will never abandon you.

00:46:40.234 --> 00:46:42.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
To see Jehovah’s support,

00:46:42.236 --> 00:46:46.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may have to set aside time to meditate.

00:46:46.115 --> 00:46:48.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s music video,

00:46:48.618 --> 00:46:52.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see just how powerful
it is to take a break,

00:46:52.789 --> 00:46:56.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
take a breath, and take in God’s creation.

00:47:01.923 --> 00:47:08.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sitting around the fire
beneath a million stars,

00:47:08.096 --> 00:47:15.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Letting go of the cares of the day,
we share the reflections of our heart.

00:47:15.269 --> 00:47:22.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so nice to make the time
to think of all the good.

00:47:22.402 --> 00:47:26.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daily gifts from above
—how God shows us his love—

00:47:26.531 --> 00:47:29.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
fill us with gratitude.

00:47:31.494 --> 00:47:40.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re just taking a moment
to change our focus,

00:47:40.002 --> 00:47:45.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slowing down
to look up and reflect

00:47:45.717 --> 00:47:54.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the simple things,
the joy it brings to slow down,

00:47:54.225 --> 00:48:00.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
To take a deep breath,
Pause, and reset.

00:48:09.365 --> 00:48:16.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the moon shines through the forest
in the stillness of the night,

00:48:16.664 --> 00:48:23.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our spirits are lifted by ev’ry good gift
that comes from our Father up high.

00:48:23.421 --> 00:48:30.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we see the bigger picture
beyond the trials we face,

00:48:30.845 --> 00:48:34.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
You and I can endure
as our hearts are assured

00:48:34.557 --> 00:48:37.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s warm embrace.

00:48:37.977 --> 00:48:45.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re just taking a moment
to change our focus,

00:48:46.861 --> 00:48:52.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slowing down
to look up and reflect

00:48:52.366 --> 00:49:00.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the simple things,
the joy it brings to slow down,

00:49:00.833 --> 00:49:06.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
To take a deep breath,
Pause, and reset.

00:49:08.299 --> 00:49:14.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pause and reset;
Pause and reset.

00:49:15.473 --> 00:49:23.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re just taking a moment
to change our focus,

00:49:24.732 --> 00:49:30.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slowing down
to look up and reflect

00:49:30.279 --> 00:49:38.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the simple things,
the joy it brings to slow down,

00:49:38.621 --> 00:49:45.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
To take a deep breath,
Pause, and reset.

00:49:45.169 --> 00:49:52.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Savor the moment;
change our focus.

00:49:52.510 --> 00:49:56.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take a deep breath.

00:49:56.013 --> 00:50:02.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Savor the moment;
change our focus.

00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:12.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slow down, take a deep breath,
Pause, and reset.

00:50:21.163 --> 00:50:24.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our thinking ability will enrich our life now

00:50:24.834 --> 00:50:26.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
in so many ways.

00:50:26.544 --> 00:50:31.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll make wise decisions
that draw us closer to Jehovah,

00:50:33.217 --> 00:50:36.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll address any doubts to our faith,

00:50:38.264 --> 00:50:42.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll “safeguard [the] practical wisdom”
we’ve found in the Bible,

00:50:42.476 --> 00:50:47.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll secure
a perfect life in the future.

00:50:48.774 --> 00:50:52.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our postcard for the month, 
we’ll visit Burundi.

00:50:52.737 --> 00:50:56.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s located
in the often-called “heart of Africa,”

00:50:56.365 --> 00:50:59.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
bordered on the southwest by Lake Tanganyika.

00:51:00.912 --> 00:51:04.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Burundi is full of green rolling hills,

00:51:04.123 --> 00:51:08.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
cascading waterfalls,
and rich agricultural land.

00:51:09.629 --> 00:51:13.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lake Tanganyika
is the longest freshwater lake in the world

00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:16.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the second deepest.

00:51:16.302 --> 00:51:20.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s absolutely bursting with life!

00:51:20.139 --> 00:51:23.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 2,000 species are found here,

00:51:23.017 --> 00:51:26.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 500 of them found nowhere else
in the world.

00:51:27.605 --> 00:51:30.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
The local fishermen
tap into this natural bounty,

00:51:30.942 --> 00:51:34.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
hauling in tons of fish every year.

00:51:34.904 --> 00:51:38.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Burundi is also a preaching paradise
for “fishers of men.”

00:51:39.867 --> 00:51:43.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are now over 17,000 publishers
in the country.

00:51:44.288 --> 00:51:49.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they had
an incredible Memorial attendance in 2023

00:51:49.085 --> 00:51:52.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
of over 65,000 people.

00:51:53.881 --> 00:51:56.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was not always like this.

00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:01.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
From 1977 to 1993,
the preaching work was banned.

00:52:01.931 --> 00:52:04.308 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our brothers were persecuted

00:52:04.308 --> 00:52:07.478 line:10% position:50% align:center
and even imprisoned for their faith.

00:52:07.478 --> 00:52:10.189 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now when the opportunity comes to preach,

00:52:10.189 --> 00:52:11.857 line:10% position:50% align:center
they seize it.

00:52:12.483 --> 00:52:15.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Sarah Niyungeko walked

00:52:15.653 --> 00:52:18.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
45 minutes to school each day.

00:52:18.487 --> 00:52:23.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way she could save money 
for preaching in seldom-worked territory.

00:52:25.029 --> 00:52:28.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Burundi Bethel family
and the 83 publishers

00:52:28.749 --> 00:52:32.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Bujumbura Gihosha Centre Congregation

00:52:32.837 --> 00:52:36.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
send warm greetings
to all their brothers and sisters.

00:52:37.837 --> 00:52:40.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:44.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
