The theme for this program is

00:00:04.521 --> 00:00:09.526 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Be Childlike—But Not Childish!”

00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:14.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 14:20

00:00:14.597 --> 00:00:17.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our theme scripture:

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:23.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brothers, do not become
young children in your understanding,

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:27.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but be young children as to badness;

00:00:27.243 --> 00:00:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become full-grown in your understanding.”

00:00:32.148 --> 00:00:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this single verse,

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:38.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told not to be
like a young child in one way

00:00:38.822 --> 00:00:43.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re told to be
like a young child in another way.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:48.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should not be like a child
when it comes to understanding,

00:00:48.064 --> 00:00:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we should be like a child
when it comes to badness.

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:55.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this discussion,

00:00:55.405 --> 00:00:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s focus on three ways

00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should not be like a child

00:01:00.844 --> 00:01:05.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then let’s talk about three ways
we should be like a child.

00:01:06.316 --> 00:01:11.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Hebrews 5:13, 14,

00:01:11.888 --> 00:01:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s identify negative trait number one

00:01:16.893 --> 00:01:19.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not want to imitate:

00:01:20.964 --> 00:01:24.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For everyone who continues to feed on milk

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:28.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is unacquainted
with the word of righteousness,

00:01:28.138 --> 00:01:31.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he is a young child.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But solid food belongs to mature people,

00:01:35.678 --> 00:01:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those who through use
have their powers of discernment trained

00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distinguish both right and wrong.”

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:47.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the negative trait that children have

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is immature feeding habits.

00:01:52.195 --> 00:01:55.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it: Young children

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:58.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a tendency to eat what they like

00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:02.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of its nutritional value.

00:02:02.238 --> 00:02:05.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most young ones would be perfectly happy

00:02:05.575 --> 00:02:08.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eating ice cream, candy, cookies,

00:02:08.311 --> 00:02:12.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other sweets for all of their meals.

00:02:12.315 --> 00:02:14.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask,

00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:17.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do our spiritual appetites

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:21.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feeding habits reveal about us?

00:02:21.257 --> 00:02:25.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider: How do we spend our free time?

00:02:25.962 --> 00:02:30.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we squander
voluminous hours watching television

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or reading material that provides
little or no spiritual nutrition?

00:02:35.371 --> 00:02:39.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do we make wise use of our free time

00:02:39.776 --> 00:02:43.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take in solid spiritual food?

00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:47.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we receive
a new issue of <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we merely scan through it,
looking at a few highlights,

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then do something else?

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we take time
to research deeper spiritual truths

00:02:58.728 --> 00:03:01.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to fully understand them?

00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:04.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we take time to really meditate?

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:07.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is not daydreaming.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is bridled, focused thought.

00:03:11.241 --> 00:03:15.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pause your reading to ask questions such as:

00:03:15.345 --> 00:03:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What does this teach me about Jehovah?

00:03:19.315 --> 00:03:22.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘With whom could I share this information?

00:03:22.785 --> 00:03:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What’s Jehovah telling me?

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:30.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How does this fit in with other things
I know about this subject?

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I make application?’

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:25 encourages us

00:03:38.234 --> 00:03:40.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to peer into God’s Word.

00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:43.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to the <i>Reference Bible,</i>

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘peer’ literally means to ‘stoop beside.’

00:03:47.944 --> 00:03:52.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate:
Simply reading through the Bible

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:56.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be likened to walking quickly
through the world’s greatest museum

00:03:56.753 --> 00:04:01.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and periodically glancing
at the various displays.

00:04:01.524 --> 00:04:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will learn something.

00:04:04.527 --> 00:04:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But meditatively peering into God’s Word

00:04:08.197 --> 00:04:12.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be likened to stopping
all along the museum route

00:04:12.468 --> 00:04:14.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even stooping down

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and closely examining from different angles

00:04:18.274 --> 00:04:23.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the artifacts, exhibitions, and displays.

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now our knowledge and appreciation

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to be enhanced much more.

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:36.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our spiritual appetite
and feeding habits

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveal much about whether
we have done away

00:04:40.029 --> 00:04:42.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the trait of a young child, namely,

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
immature feeding habits.

00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:51.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now please turn to Ephesians 4:14.

00:04:51.908 --> 00:04:56.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discern from this scripture
negative trait number two

00:04:56.779 --> 00:04:59.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t want to imitate:

00:05:00.783 --> 00:05:04.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So we should no longer be children,

00:05:04.454 --> 00:05:09.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“tossed about as by waves
and carried here and there

00:05:09.325 --> 00:05:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by every wind of teaching
by means of the trickery of men,

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:18.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of cunning in deceptive schemes.”

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the negative trait?

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:26.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children are easily tricked, or fooled.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture likens being easily tricked
about what’s right or wrong

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:36.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to being tossed about
by the waves of the ocean

00:05:36.786 --> 00:05:39.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and blown around by the wind.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:44.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think of a piece of wood
floating in a turbulent ocean

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:47.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a piece of paper in a windstorm,

00:05:47.497 --> 00:05:50.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no stability or direction.

00:05:50.867 --> 00:05:54.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both can be easily maneuvered

00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go anywhere—take any position.

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:02.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s true of very young children

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:05.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who often can be easily deceived.

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:08.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if given a choice

00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:11.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between a shiny coin of little value

00:06:11.754 --> 00:06:15.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and paper money of great value,

00:06:15.892 --> 00:06:20.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the shiny coin will likely be chosen.

00:06:20.063 --> 00:06:22.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s the point:

00:06:22.231 --> 00:06:25.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do our spiritual choices
reveal about us?

00:06:26.903 --> 00:06:31.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do our choices in regard to music
and other entertainment,

00:06:31.507 --> 00:06:35.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clothing, and grooming indicate
that we’re being fooled

00:06:35.978 --> 00:06:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even slightly by Satan and his world?

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:43.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Satan is bent on tricking us,

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:45.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah tells us

00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:49.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 14:20
(the scripture we read earlier):

00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:55.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not become young children
in your understanding.”

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, please turn to Matthew 11:16, 17.

00:07:03.673 --> 00:07:07.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we’ll find
the third negative trait of a child

00:07:07.743 --> 00:07:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not want to imitate:

00:07:11.714 --> 00:07:15.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With whom will I compare this generation?

00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:20.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is like young children
sitting in the marketplaces

00:07:20.056 --> 00:07:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who call out to their playmates, saying:

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:27.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘We played the flute for you,
but you did not dance;

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wailed, but you
did not beat yourselves in grief.’”

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was saying that adult people

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:40.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were acting like children.

00:07:40.276 --> 00:07:43.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children love to play.

00:07:43.579 --> 00:07:46.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the negative trait of young children

00:07:46.382 --> 00:07:51.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that they prefer play over responsibility.

00:07:51.387 --> 00:07:55.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it: The vast majority

00:07:55.224 --> 00:07:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the waking hours of a small child

00:07:57.827 --> 00:07:59.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are spent playing

00:07:59.862 --> 00:08:03.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—play, play, and more play.

00:08:03.799 --> 00:08:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of their life is fun and games.

00:08:07.136 --> 00:08:10.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later, when the child goes to school,

00:08:10.406 --> 00:08:13.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where does he get the time to do so?

00:08:13.976 --> 00:08:17.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has to take it from his playtime.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:22.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, spiritually speaking,
we can ask ourselves,

00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:25.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How far have we progressed

00:08:25.054 --> 00:08:29.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in buying out time from our playtime?’

00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:32.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:16 encourages us

00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:36.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ‘make the best use of our time.’

00:08:36.399 --> 00:08:38.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Literally, according to the footnote,

00:08:38.968 --> 00:08:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this scripture is telling us

00:08:41.537 --> 00:08:45.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ‘buy out the appointed time’

00:08:45.675 --> 00:08:49.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, buy it from less important things.

00:08:49.712 --> 00:08:52.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question for all of us is,

00:08:52.481 --> 00:08:55.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have we bought out
the majority of our playtime

00:08:55.818 --> 00:08:58.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more important
spiritual responsibilities?

00:09:00.723 --> 00:09:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’ve discussed three negative traits

00:09:03.826 --> 00:09:07.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a young child that we want to avoid.

00:09:07.663 --> 00:09:10.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had time, we could have discussed

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:12.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
other negative traits to be avoided,

00:09:12.969 --> 00:09:17.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as how children tend
to have a short attention span

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they’re easily distracted),

00:09:20.743 --> 00:09:25.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their curiosity often gets them into trouble,

00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:29.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they generally
need a lot of time and attention

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:32.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they’re high-maintenance).

00:09:32.455 --> 00:09:36.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s briefly discuss
three positive traits

00:09:36.892 --> 00:09:40.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a young child that we do well to imitate.

00:09:40.896 --> 00:09:44.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Positive characteristic number one

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:49.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is at 1 Corinthians 14:20,
which we read at the outset.

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:53.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That scripture tells us

00:09:53.442 --> 00:09:58.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “be young children as to badness.”

00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:02.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the characteristic
that we want to imitate?

00:10:02.885 --> 00:10:06.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children are innocent,

00:10:06.255 --> 00:10:10.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inexperienced, when it comes to badness.

00:10:10.726 --> 00:10:13.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or put another way,

00:10:13.162 --> 00:10:16.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they haven’t done many truly bad things.

00:10:16.832 --> 00:10:20.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like children, we don’t want

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:24.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gain knowledge
or experience in what is bad.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when it comes to pornography,

00:10:28.344 --> 00:10:32.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want no experience whatsoever

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:36.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in regard to this filthy thing
of Satan’s world.

00:10:36.519 --> 00:10:39.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to television programs

00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:43.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are designated for a “mature audience,”

00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:46.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember to tell yourself,

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:50.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m not old enough; I’m a young child.’

00:10:52.168 --> 00:10:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For positive characteristic number two,

00:10:55.604 --> 00:11:01.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider Matthew 18:2-4:

00:11:02.778 --> 00:11:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So calling a young child to him,

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he [Jesus] stood him
in their midst and said:

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Truly I say to you, unless you turn around

00:11:15.925 --> 00:11:18.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and become as young children,

00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:23.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will by no means enter
into the Kingdom of the heavens.

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:27.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Therefore, whoever
 will humble himself like this young child

00:11:27.837 --> 00:11:32.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the one who is the greatest
in the Kingdom of the heavens.’”

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the desirable trait?

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:39.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children are humble and teachable.

00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:44.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children ask many questions
because they want to learn,

00:11:44.286 --> 00:11:48.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but grown-ups
are often hesitant to ask questions.

00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:50.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:11:50.793 --> 00:11:54.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t want to look uninformed.

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:56.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But acting like we know something

00:11:56.732 --> 00:12:00.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we don’t is actually dishonest

00:12:00.336 --> 00:12:03.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably motivated by pride.

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:06.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is,

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:10.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be afraid to reveal
what you don’t know.

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:14.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain humble and teachable like a child.

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:20.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s identify
desirable trait number three

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by going to Matthew 21:15, 16:

00:12:26.595 --> 00:12:29.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the chief priests and the scribes

00:12:29.131 --> 00:12:32.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saw the marvelous things he did

00:12:32.401 --> 00:12:35.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the boys who
were shouting in the temple,

00:12:35.538 --> 00:12:38.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Save, we pray, the Son of David!’

00:12:38.407 --> 00:12:42.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they became indignant and said to him:

00:12:42.244 --> 00:12:44.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do you hear what these are saying?’

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus said to them

00:12:46.682 --> 00:12:49.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yes. Did you never read this,

00:12:49.618 --> 00:12:52.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Out of the mouth of children and infants

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have brought forth praise”?’”

00:12:56.091 --> 00:13:00.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what desirable characteristic
can we identify?

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:05.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children
are exuberant and enthusiastic.

00:13:05.434 --> 00:13:08.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in like manner,

00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:12.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to remain exuberant and expressive

00:13:12.274 --> 00:13:15.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah, Jesus,

00:13:15.511 --> 00:13:19.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom, and other spiritual things.

00:13:19.315 --> 00:13:23.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 145:7 encourages us to “bubble over”

00:13:23.853 --> 00:13:28.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “shout joyfully”
because of these wonderful things.

00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:33.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we never want to lose
that childlike enthusiasm.

00:13:34.964 --> 00:13:39.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there we have
three desirable traits of a young child

00:13:39.602 --> 00:13:43.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we want to do our utmost to imitate.

00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had time, we could discuss

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:49.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several other positive characteristics,

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:54.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as how children tend to be trusting,

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:59.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not prejudiced, and not hypocritical.

00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:04.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now in review, may each of us

00:14:04.326 --> 00:14:08.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayerfully strive not to be childish

00:14:08.197 --> 00:14:13.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to (1) immature feeding habits,

00:14:13.202 --> 00:14:17.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) being easily tricked, or fooled,

00:14:18.908 --> 00:14:24.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) preferring play over responsibility.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,

00:14:26.916 --> 00:14:30.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may each of us
prayerfully strive to be childlike

00:14:30.953 --> 00:14:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to being 

00:14:33.489 --> 00:14:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) innocent and inexperienced
concerning badness,

00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) humble and teachable,

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:48.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) exuberant and enthusiastic

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about spiritual things!
