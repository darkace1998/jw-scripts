Welcome to the June 2019 program
of JW Broadcasting.

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:26.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier this year,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
56 students from all over the world

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:30.613 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
gathered to attend

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:36.453 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They enjoyed a 20-week course that gifted them

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:39.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with an in-depth study of the Bible.

00:00:39.622 --> 00:00:41.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The aim of Gilead schooling

00:00:41.825 --> 00:00:45.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to help strengthen
the faith of each of the students

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:49.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they in turn can strengthen
the brothers in their respective assignments.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On March 9 of this year,

00:00:52.702 --> 00:00:56.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the graduation program for the 146th class

00:00:56.773 --> 00:00:59.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was held at the Watchtower Educational Center

00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Patterson, New York.

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll now enjoy faith-strengthening talks

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:07.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were delivered during the first part

00:01:07.484 --> 00:01:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Gilead graduation program.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re happy to be here today

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:17.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for this graduation of the 146th class of Gilead,

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:20.497 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we welcome all who are tied in with us

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:23.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at our Bethel complexes in the United States,

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Canada, in Puerto Rico,

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:29.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in a number of remote translation offices.

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:32.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We especially welcome our Gilead students

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:36.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are about to graduate
from this marvelous school.

00:01:36.646 --> 00:01:39.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we welcome your dear family members

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:44.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and friends who are joining you
on this very, very special day.

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:47.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You seem excited, and you should be.

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:50.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy.
We’re very, very happy for you.

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, throughout your schooling,
you’ve been asked to draw out principles

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:58.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from many different Bible accounts, haven’t you?

00:01:58.835 --> 00:02:03.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With that in mind,
here’s the theme of our introductory comments:

00:02:03.773 --> 00:02:08.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do You See the Point
and Remember the Purpose?”

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:11.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to illustrate what we mean

00:02:11.014 --> 00:02:15.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by looking at Luke 5:1-11.

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:19.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the account
where some of Jesus’ disciples

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:23.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chose to leave everything behind
and follow him.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s the setting:

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of Jesus’ disciples were fishermen

00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:31.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had followed Jesus for a time,

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:34.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then they went back to their fishing business.

00:02:34.337 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus sought to reach their hearts

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and move them to follow him fully.

00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:41.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did he do?

00:02:41.678 --> 00:02:45.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used a powerful object lesson

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:48.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that provided a point and a purpose.

00:02:48.484 --> 00:02:55.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it at Luke 5:1-11,

00:02:55.124 --> 00:02:59.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look for the point, first of all,
behind what Jesus did here.

00:03:00.964 --> 00:03:05.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “On one occasion
when the crowd was pressing in on him

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:07.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and listening to the word of God,

00:03:07.704 --> 00:03:10.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:13.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he saw two boats docked at the lakeside,

00:03:13.776 --> 00:03:17.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the fishermen had got out of them
and were washing off their nets.

00:03:17.881 --> 00:03:21.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Going aboard one of the boats,
which was Simon’s,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he asked him to pull away a bit from land.

00:03:23.853 --> 00:03:28.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he sat down,
and he began teaching the crowds from the boat.

00:03:28.858 --> 00:03:31.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he stopped speaking,
he said to Simon:

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:36.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Pull out to where it is deep,
and let down your nets for a catch.’

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But in reply Simon said:

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Instructor, we toiled all night and caught nothing,

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:45.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but at your word I will lower the nets.’

00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:49.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, when they did this,
they caught a great number of fish.

00:03:49.212 --> 00:03:52.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In fact, their nets began ripping apart.

00:03:52.548 --> 00:03:56.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So they motioned to their partners
in the other boat to come and assist them,

00:03:56.686 --> 00:04:01.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they came and filled both boats,
so that these began to sink.

00:04:01.157 --> 00:04:05.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seeing this, Simon Peter
fell down at the knees of Jesus,

00:04:05.194 --> 00:04:09.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saying: ‘Depart from me, Lord,
because I am a sinful man.’

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For both he and those with him
were overwhelmed with astonishment

00:04:14.103 --> 00:04:16.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the catch of fish they had taken,

00:04:16.706 --> 00:04:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the same was true
of both James and John, Zebedee’s sons,

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:23.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who were partners with Simon.

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:25.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Jesus said to Simon:

00:04:25.315 --> 00:04:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Stop being afraid.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“From now on you will be catching men alive.’

00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:33.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So they brought the boats back to land

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and abandoned everything and followed him.”

00:04:38.695 --> 00:04:41.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what was the point

00:04:41.597 --> 00:04:44.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind this miracle here?

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was this?

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:48.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their needs would be cared for

00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:52.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they trusted in Jesus and followed him.

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:56.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, to do this,
they had to believe Jesus, didn’t they?

00:04:56.446 --> 00:04:57.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had to listen to him.

00:04:57.647 --> 00:04:59.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was not a trick.

00:04:59.482 --> 00:05:02.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With their own eyes,
they could see that catch of fish

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:07.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then deduce that their needs would,
in fact, be cared for by Jesus.

00:05:07.824 --> 00:05:09.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the point.

00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did they get it?

00:05:10.893 --> 00:05:12.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they did.

00:05:12.328 --> 00:05:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With what result?

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:16.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it says that they
were moved to abandon everything

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:19.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and follow Jesus

00:05:19.168 --> 00:05:21.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is,
everything related to the fishing business.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They gave it all up and followed him.

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:29.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Almost instantly,
their faith and trust in Jesus grew, didn’t it?

00:05:30.646 --> 00:05:33.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s bring the point up to our day.

00:05:33.516 --> 00:05:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon you will go to your assignments.

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:40.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you remember the point of your Gilead training?

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:42.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is the point?

00:05:42.258 --> 00:05:45.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point has been to build up your faith

00:05:45.495 --> 00:05:47.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your trust in Jehovah

00:05:47.897 --> 00:05:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thereby strengthen
your relationship with him.

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:54.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In turn,
as you draw steadily closer to Jehovah,

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will be ready for whatever work

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:01.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whatever responsibility
he chooses to place on you.

00:06:01.144 --> 00:06:04.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, by means of his Son, will care for you.

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:07.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will help you
to faithfully fulfill your assignments,

00:06:07.817 --> 00:06:10.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will add to his glory.

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:12.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in all that you do,

00:06:12.188 --> 00:06:16.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember those disciples
who were humble enough to get the point

00:06:16.359 --> 00:06:20.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—abandon everything and follow Jesus.

00:06:21.397 --> 00:06:25.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for the second part of the question
we mentioned at the beginning,

00:06:25.635 --> 00:06:28.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the purpose behind what Jesus did?

00:06:28.771 --> 00:06:32.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words,
Jesus’ miracle on that day

00:06:32.442 --> 00:06:35.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
carried what deeper meaning for them?

00:06:35.912 --> 00:06:38.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, looking back at Luke chapter 5,

00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:42.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what happened
when the disciples listened to Jesus,

00:06:42.385 --> 00:06:44.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went out to where the water was deep,

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lowered their nets?

00:06:46.556 --> 00:06:49.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The catch was so great that it says

00:06:49.258 --> 00:06:52.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they filled two boats to the point of sinking.

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account doesn’t say
what the disciples did with the fish,

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:58.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they made it to shore.

00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:02.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A man who could walk on water
was not going to let them sink.

00:07:02.638 --> 00:07:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we get, though,
to the greater purpose behind Jesus’ miracle.

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:11.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall what Jesus said to the disciples

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after that catch of fish

00:07:13.382 --> 00:07:17.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and after the disciples became filled with astonishment?

00:07:17.954 --> 00:07:21.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told them: “Stop being afraid.

00:07:21.657 --> 00:07:25.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From now on you will be catching men alive.”

00:07:25.895 --> 00:07:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, by means of that miracle,

00:07:28.397 --> 00:07:33.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus illustrated something
greater for them, didn’t he?

00:07:33.136 --> 00:07:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would not only be cared for materially

00:07:35.771 --> 00:07:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they got that point)

00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:40.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, more importantly,
they would also become

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:44.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very successful fishers of men.

00:07:44.747 --> 00:07:46.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, the first miracle

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pointed to an even greater one yet to come.

00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:54.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If their large catch was meant to illustrate

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:58.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how successful they would be as fishers of men,

00:07:58.694 --> 00:08:02.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then they could look back
on that catch years later

00:08:02.098 --> 00:08:05.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and visualize those boats filled with fish

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:08.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be reminded
that they had much work yet to do

00:08:08.771 --> 00:08:11.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in being fishers of men

00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:16.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“catching men alive,” so to speak,
and helping them to become disciples of Christ.

00:08:17.246 --> 00:08:22.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your Gilead training
will help you to continue supporting

00:08:22.018 --> 00:08:24.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this vital and never-to-be-repeated work,

00:08:24.554 --> 00:08:28.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is the greater purpose behind your training.

00:08:28.457 --> 00:08:33.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, whatever you’re given to do
and wherever your training may take you,

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:37.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forget the point
and the purpose behind the blessing

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you just experienced
in being part of this class.

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:46.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah and in his Son
to help you at all times,

00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:50.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and use your Gilead training 
to support this important work

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:54.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the branches and the territories
where you will serve.

00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:57.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’ll say a little bit more about this

00:08:57.853 --> 00:09:01.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the conclusion of our program today.

00:09:01.357 --> 00:09:05.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re going to enjoy
a series of very encouraging talks

00:09:05.528 --> 00:09:08.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will strengthen your faith,
build up your trust,

00:09:08.831 --> 00:09:11.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(in fact, for all of us listening in)

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:13.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and highlight God’s wonderful purpose

00:09:13.703 --> 00:09:15.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we support.

00:09:15.738 --> 00:09:19.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, we’re very happy to have with us

00:09:19.108 --> 00:09:21.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Governing Body,
Brother David Splane,

00:09:21.844 --> 00:09:24.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is going to present the talk

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If You Look for It, You Will Find It.”

00:09:43.266 --> 00:09:46.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you look for it,

00:09:46.669 --> 00:09:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will find it.

00:09:49.138 --> 00:09:51.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for what?

00:09:51.707 --> 00:09:56.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look for the good in your brothers.

00:09:56.445 --> 00:09:58.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you find it,

00:09:58.814 --> 00:10:02.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t be afraid to acknowledge it.

00:10:02.752 --> 00:10:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we all know that we should do that,

00:10:05.888 --> 00:10:08.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we do have to fight the tendency

00:10:08.224 --> 00:10:11.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to view others a bit critically at times.

00:10:11.661 --> 00:10:14.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes we question their motives,

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:19.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe because we’re just a little bit jealous.

00:10:20.469 --> 00:10:23.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, think
about that brother in your congregation

00:10:23.372 --> 00:10:27.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is just an excellent public speaker.

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:30.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he is scheduled to give a talk,
the hall is full.

00:10:30.613 --> 00:10:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everybody raves about his talks,

00:10:33.349 --> 00:10:35.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even your wife

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—yours, not so much.

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:46.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘The show-off; he doesn’t impress me.’

00:10:46.762 --> 00:10:48.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or what about this:

00:10:48.764 --> 00:10:52.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re working in a department
with one of those annoying people

00:10:52.568 --> 00:10:55.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is very efficient.

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:58.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s never late,

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he never misses a day’s work,

00:11:00.743 --> 00:11:04.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gets a tremendous amount done in a day,

00:11:04.146 --> 00:11:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he almost never makes a mistake.

00:11:08.017 --> 00:11:10.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘That doesn’t impress me either.

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:14.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mr. Perfect, he’s trying to make
the rest of us look bad.’

00:11:14.757 --> 00:11:19.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there we go questioning 
someone’s motives.

00:11:19.595 --> 00:11:22.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, can we look for the good in Mr. Perfect?

00:11:24.133 --> 00:11:28.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can we, see, give him the benefit of the doubt?

00:11:28.671 --> 00:11:32.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe his parents trained him

00:11:32.408 --> 00:11:36.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to offer the very best gift he could to Jehovah.

00:11:36.145 --> 00:11:38.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, if he could do more,

00:11:38.981 --> 00:11:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was expected to do more,

00:11:41.350 --> 00:11:43.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he wanted his gift

00:11:43.586 --> 00:11:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the very best gift
that he could possibly give.

00:11:46.222 --> 00:11:50.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, come to think of it,
he never criticizes your gift to Jehovah.

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:55.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just wants to give
his very best gift to Jehovah.

00:11:55.264 --> 00:11:58.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the way
he approached the pioneer ministry,

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s the way
he approaches his Bethel service.

00:12:01.704 --> 00:12:04.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, now, what do you do with Mr. Perfect?

00:12:04.273 --> 00:12:06.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you tell him to slow down?

00:12:06.909 --> 00:12:09.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re making the rest of us look bad.”

00:12:09.745 --> 00:12:14.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if he did that,
he’d be giving a substandard gift to Jehovah,

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:19.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah expects
and deserves the very best.

00:12:19.688 --> 00:12:21.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what do you do?

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:24.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You acknowledge his gift.

00:12:24.293 --> 00:12:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You really get a lot done in a day;

00:12:26.929 --> 00:12:29.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish I had your stamina.”

00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about Mr. Show-off,
the outstanding speaker?

00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:36.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah has given you a wonderful gift.

00:12:36.906 --> 00:12:39.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You use it well.”

00:12:39.074 --> 00:12:41.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, was that hard?

00:12:41.577 --> 00:12:46.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders occasionally have to evaluate
brothers for privileges of service.

00:12:46.415 --> 00:12:49.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while we’re not blind
to the shortcomings of our brothers,

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:53.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we try to keep the discussion mainly positive.

00:12:53.055 --> 00:12:57.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, sometimes we have to discuss
a shortcoming—a negative.

00:12:57.793 --> 00:13:01.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But are we talking about one isolated incident,

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:03.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is it a pattern?

00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:07.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that if we make it
a habit to look on the positive side,

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:09.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be disappointed sometimes.

00:13:09.438 --> 00:13:12.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s better to be disappointed occasionally

00:13:12.708 --> 00:13:17.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than to develop a cynical or resentful attitude

00:13:17.379 --> 00:13:19.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward our brothers.

00:13:19.482 --> 00:13:21.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a Scriptural example

00:13:21.917 --> 00:13:24.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where questioning the motives of a brother

00:13:24.253 --> 00:13:27.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have led to disaster.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:31.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in 1 Samuel chapter 17

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and a little bit of background,
a little bit of the setting—

00:13:35.931 --> 00:13:40.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesse has sent his youngest son, David,

00:13:40.336 --> 00:13:43.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit his three oldest brothers in the army,

00:13:43.305 --> 00:13:47.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Israel is having a face-off with the Philistines.

00:13:47.810 --> 00:13:51.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when he arrives, David hears Goliath

00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:53.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
challenge any man of the house of Israel

00:13:53.782 --> 00:13:55.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a battle to the death.

00:13:55.885 --> 00:13:58.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are no volunteers.

00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David is a man of faith, and he can’t believe it.

00:14:02.191 --> 00:14:05.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says:
“Who is this uncircumcised Philistine

00:14:05.694 --> 00:14:09.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he should taunt
the battle line[s] of the living [true] God?”

00:14:09.465 --> 00:14:12.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, his oldest brother, Eliab, is listening,

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:15.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we pick up the account in verse 28.

00:14:15.571 --> 00:14:18.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s 1 Samuel chapter 17,

00:14:18.073 --> 00:14:20.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll read verse 28:

00:14:20.943 --> 00:14:25.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When his oldest brother Eliab
heard him speak to the men,

00:14:25.014 --> 00:14:27.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he became [very] angry with David and said:

00:14:27.917 --> 00:14:29.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Why have you come down?

00:14:29.785 --> 00:14:32.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And with whom did you leave
those few sheep in the wilderness?

00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:35.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I well know your presumptuousness

00:14:35.858 --> 00:14:38.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and the bad intentions of your heart;

00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:43.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you came down just to see the battle.’”

00:14:43.399 --> 00:14:48.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what did we learn
about Eliab’s personality from this verse?

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not much.

00:14:54.043 --> 00:14:56.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You recognize that as a trick question.

00:14:57.546 --> 00:15:01.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just met the man,
we don’t know very much about him,

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we certainly aren’t going to pass
judgment on somebody

00:15:05.654 --> 00:15:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over one isolated incident, are we?

00:15:08.891 --> 00:15:10.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now the question is this:

00:15:10.893 --> 00:15:15.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was this a one-off for Eliab,
or was he always like that?

00:15:15.264 --> 00:15:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was this an isolated incident, or was it a pattern?

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When analyzing the situation, ask yourself this,

00:15:24.006 --> 00:15:26.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Was there ever an occasion

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:30.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘when I got so frustrated with my fleshly brother

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that I said something awful,

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:36.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
something that I had to apologize for later?’

00:15:36.485 --> 00:15:39.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did that make you a terrible person?

00:15:39.388 --> 00:15:41.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question is:
Is this a one-off?

00:15:41.824 --> 00:15:43.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it isolated, or is it a pattern?

00:15:43.859 --> 00:15:45.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are things that we really need to apply

00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:48.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to our relations
with our brothers and sisters.

00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t write somebody off
on the basis of one incident.

00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:57.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can say that on this occasion,
Eliab was wrong.

00:15:57.873 --> 00:16:02.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He questioned David’s motives,
and he wasn’t nice about it.

00:16:02.077 --> 00:16:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not the worst of it.

00:16:04.079 --> 00:16:07.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suppose that David had listened to Eliab saying,

00:16:07.983 --> 00:16:11.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Slow down,
you’re making the rest of us look bad.’

00:16:11.787 --> 00:16:13.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What might have happened?

00:16:13.789 --> 00:16:16.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suppose David had said: ‘You’re right, Eliab.

00:16:16.291 --> 00:16:18.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I am a bit arrogant.

00:16:18.293 --> 00:16:22.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who do I think I am
that I could fight this mighty man of war?’

00:16:22.097 --> 00:16:26.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that could have had
disastrous consequences for Israel,

00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:28.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least temporarily.

00:16:28.337 --> 00:16:30.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:16:30.339 --> 00:16:35.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t discourage anyone
from giving their best to Jehovah,

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:39.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if their best is better than your best.

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:43.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s take another isolated incident
from the life of Eliab

00:16:43.819 --> 00:16:46.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and say something positive about the man.

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:49.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look for the good in Eliab.

00:16:49.291 --> 00:16:51.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Samuel 22

00:16:54.263 --> 00:16:57.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—1 Samuel 22:1,

00:17:02.604 --> 00:17:05.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says:
“So David went from there,

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“escaping to the cave of Adullam.

00:17:07.676 --> 00:17:10.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[So David is running away from Saul.]

00:17:10.546 --> 00:17:13.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When his brothers

00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:17.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his father’s entire house heard of it,

00:17:17.753 --> 00:17:20.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they went down there to him

00:17:20.622 --> 00:17:24.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[his brothers, including Eliab].”

00:17:24.026 --> 00:17:26.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the point?

00:17:26.028 --> 00:17:29.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when he was needed,
Eliab was there for him.

00:17:29.765 --> 00:17:31.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could be counted on.

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:36.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later, one of David’s sons
married one of Eliab’s daughters.

00:17:37.506 --> 00:17:40.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, wait a minute, say that again.

00:17:40.676 --> 00:17:43.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David ran away from Saul?

00:17:44.947 --> 00:17:48.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t run away from Goliath, did he?

00:17:48.016 --> 00:17:50.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he ran away from Saul.

00:17:50.819 --> 00:17:53.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s spirit must have indicated

00:17:53.689 --> 00:17:56.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when David should stand and fight

00:17:56.525 --> 00:18:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when he should run and hide.

00:18:00.195 --> 00:18:02.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sounds like material for another talk.

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’ll help our blood pressure

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we can learn to give a positive spin

00:18:09.805 --> 00:18:12.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to potentially negative situations.

00:18:12.808 --> 00:18:14.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve run into this.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:19.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re walking down the hallway
following closely behind someone.

00:18:19.548 --> 00:18:24.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He goes through the door
and lets the door slam right in your face.

00:18:25.954 --> 00:18:30.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is he self-centered or just lost in thought?

00:18:30.626 --> 00:18:34.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you choose to characterize that incident?

00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:37.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is the public speaker a show-off,

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:41.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or on this occasion is he simply trying
a bit too hard to be enthusiastic?

00:18:43.405 --> 00:18:48.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is the brother being picky,
or is he trying to be thorough?

00:18:48.143 --> 00:18:52.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standoffish and proud
or just shy?

00:18:53.816 --> 00:18:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one day, some of you brothers
are going to have positions of responsibility,

00:18:57.786 --> 00:19:00.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’re going to be dealing with people.

00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:04.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when that happens, remember this:

00:19:04.893 --> 00:19:09.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many joys are denied those
who keep looking for mistakes,

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:13.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the one who sees the good in others

00:19:13.502 --> 00:19:16.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have “a feast constantly.”

00:19:16.872 --> 00:19:18.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that!

00:19:18.507 --> 00:19:20.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may Jehovah bless you richly.

00:19:20.509 --> 00:19:22.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you.

00:19:31.887 --> 00:19:36.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we thank you very, very much
for that encouraging talk, Brother Splane.

00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:39.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we have a member 
of the U.S. Branch Committee

00:19:39.561 --> 00:19:41.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with us to deliver the talk

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:43.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Causes to Become.”

00:19:43.966 --> 00:19:46.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Troy Snyder will do this for us.

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:52.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as Gilead graduates,
you’re being sent out

00:19:52.975 --> 00:19:57.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen and stabilize
Jehovah’s precious sheep.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re being sent out

00:20:00.082 --> 00:20:03.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the threshold of the great tribulation.

00:20:04.486 --> 00:20:09.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what one scripture will strengthen

00:20:09.057 --> 00:20:13.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stabilize you so you can help others?

00:20:13.495 --> 00:20:15.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here’s a clue:

00:20:15.497 --> 00:20:19.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What truth did Jehovah
reveal to fortify the Israelites

00:20:19.468 --> 00:20:23.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right before they
were to be delivered from Egypt?

00:20:23.405 --> 00:20:27.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn our Bibles to Exodus chapter 3,

00:20:27.109 --> 00:20:29.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s notice what truth Jehovah revealed.

00:20:29.845 --> 00:20:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You remember the account?

00:20:31.847 --> 00:20:34.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses was asking Jehovah,

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:37.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What can I tell the Israelites

00:20:37.753 --> 00:20:40.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they will have
confidence in your deliverance?’

00:20:40.088 --> 00:20:42.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In essence,
that’s what he was asking Jehovah.

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:46.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Jehovah said
to fortify them in verse 14:

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So God said to Moses:

00:20:48.764 --> 00:20:52.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I Will Become What I Choose to Become.’

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:56.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he added: 
‘This is what you are to say to the Israelites,

00:20:56.571 --> 00:21:00.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I Will Become has sent me to you.”’”

00:21:01.743 --> 00:21:05.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That fortified the Israelites.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They understood that Jehovah was saying,

00:21:07.382 --> 00:21:11.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll be whatever is necessary to carry out my will.’

00:21:12.955 --> 00:21:17.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And according to Appendix A
in our New World Translation,

00:21:17.659 --> 00:21:20.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it appears that the name also means

00:21:20.896 --> 00:21:23.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He Causes to Become”

00:21:23.432 --> 00:21:26.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “He Causes
His Creation (you and me) to Become”

00:21:26.635 --> 00:21:29.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever is needed to carry out his will.

00:21:29.938 --> 00:21:32.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And doesn’t that harmonize with who Jehovah is?

00:21:32.774 --> 00:21:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know him as the Creator, don’t we?

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:36.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s created us.

00:21:36.545 --> 00:21:38.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He brought about this universe.

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:41.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the God who causes to become.

00:21:42.951 --> 00:21:46.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, this truth
—this extraordinary truth—

00:21:46.521 --> 00:21:49.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can strengthen and stabilize you

00:21:50.692 --> 00:21:53.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it links you

00:21:53.161 --> 00:21:56.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to something that Jehovah is willing to give you.

00:21:57.766 --> 00:21:58.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at what that is.

00:21:58.967 --> 00:22:01.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to Jeremiah chapter 10.

00:22:05.107 --> 00:22:09.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, this aspect of Jehovah’s name

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:12.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveals something about his personality

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:14.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and something that he’s willing to share with you.

00:22:14.282 --> 00:22:17.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what it is in verse 6, Jeremiah 10:6.

00:22:17.819 --> 00:22:21.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“No one is like you, O Jehovah.

00:22:21.223 --> 00:22:23.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You are great,

00:22:23.225 --> 00:22:25.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your name

00:22:25.293 --> 00:22:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is great and mighty.”

00:22:29.164 --> 00:22:33.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah’s name is linked to his power.

00:22:33.035 --> 00:22:35.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what it reveals about Jehovah.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:40.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is willing to use
his power to strengthen us.

00:22:40.142 --> 00:22:43.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, it was Jehovah’s power
that caused the Red Sea to part.

00:22:43.845 --> 00:22:48.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah’s power that made
the sun stand still when Joshua was in battle.

00:22:48.517 --> 00:22:53.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah’s power
that caused a bird to feed Elijah.

00:22:53.522 --> 00:22:56.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was Jehovah’s power

00:22:56.691 --> 00:22:59.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that took a tired prophet who was exhausted

00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:02.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made him run faster than a racing chariot.

00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:05.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that reassuring
—to know that Jehovah is saying,

00:23:05.934 --> 00:23:08.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m going to give you my power’?

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because oftentimes we’re exhausted

00:23:11.173 --> 00:23:14.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we may feel like we’re unraveling.

00:23:14.076 --> 00:23:17.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah is saying,
‘I love you so much

00:23:17.345 --> 00:23:21.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m going to give you 
the power you need to accomplish my will.’

00:23:23.585 --> 00:23:26.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can see why Satan and Jehovah’s enemies

00:23:26.388 --> 00:23:28.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have tried to hide Jehovah’s name

00:23:28.423 --> 00:23:30.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not just because it identified Him,

00:23:30.425 --> 00:23:33.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but because they wanted to obscure
the power that that name has

00:23:33.562 --> 00:23:36.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what it means to us
and how it strengthens us.

00:23:37.766 --> 00:23:40.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know what else it also does?

00:23:40.469 --> 00:23:42.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It comforts us.

00:23:42.804 --> 00:23:46.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can reassure our hearts.

00:23:46.108 --> 00:23:49.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can allay our fears.

00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:52.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how it did this
with one of Jehovah’s servants.

00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:55.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go back over to Jeremiah chapter 1.

00:23:57.018 --> 00:23:59.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember Jeremiah?

00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was commissioned
with a very difficult assignment,

00:24:02.424 --> 00:24:04.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
representing Jehovah.

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what did Jeremiah express to Jehovah?

00:24:07.062 --> 00:24:08.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “I am but a boy.”

00:24:08.463 --> 00:24:11.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like he was saying:
‘Jehovah, I’m inexperienced.

00:24:11.766 --> 00:24:14.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I know I have a spiritual foundation
you’ve given me; you’ve trained me.

00:24:14.903 --> 00:24:18.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I don’t know if I can handle this; I’m afraid.’

00:24:18.106 --> 00:24:20.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jehovah say to him to fortify him?

00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:22.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jehovah cause him to become?

00:24:22.878 --> 00:24:27.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice verse 18, Jeremiah 1:18.

00:24:28.683 --> 00:24:33.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:
“For today I have made you a fortified city,

00:24:33.655 --> 00:24:35.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“an iron pillar,

00:24:35.924 --> 00:24:39.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and copper walls against all the land,

00:24:39.995 --> 00:24:42.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“toward the kings of Judah and her princes,

00:24:42.464 --> 00:24:45.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward her priests and the people of the land.”

00:24:45.567 --> 00:24:47.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A fortified city”

00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:49.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—see, Jehovah says:
‘I will strengthen you.

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’ll make you like that iron pillar.

00:24:51.473 --> 00:24:54.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll give you that inner strength
you need to carry out your assignment.’

00:24:56.178 --> 00:24:58.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But “copper walls”

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:02.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what was significant about copper walls?

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:06.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it might be how Jehovah created copper.

00:25:06.188 --> 00:25:08.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can copper do?

00:25:08.723 --> 00:25:13.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Copper at very high temperature will not buckle,

00:25:13.728 --> 00:25:16.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not warp, will not lose its strength.

00:25:17.699 --> 00:25:20.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, it’s as if Jehovah is saying,

00:25:20.035 --> 00:25:23.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jeremiah, I will make it
so you can take the heat.’

00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:27.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what Jehovah is doing for you.

00:25:27.509 --> 00:25:29.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He will make it

00:25:29.511 --> 00:25:32.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—make you—
possible to handle any situation.

00:25:32.347 --> 00:25:35.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you notice those were copper walls
—they fortified him.

00:25:35.917 --> 00:25:37.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They surrounded the city.

00:25:37.919 --> 00:25:40.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if mentally, emotionally, spiritually,

00:25:40.922 --> 00:25:42.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and physically Jehovah would give him

00:25:42.958 --> 00:25:45.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whatever was needed
to carry out his assignment.

00:25:47.362 --> 00:25:50.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that fortified Jeremiah!

00:25:50.465 --> 00:25:53.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you imagine
how Jeremiah may have drawn upon this

00:25:53.602 --> 00:25:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he dealt with challenges?

00:25:56.204 --> 00:25:58.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when he was persecuted,

00:25:58.907 --> 00:26:00.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was put in stocks.

00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:04.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s torture; that’s a form of torture.

00:26:04.079 --> 00:26:07.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you imagine Jeremiah’s prayer,

00:26:07.182 --> 00:26:10.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah, cause me
to become what I need to become

00:26:10.852 --> 00:26:13.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay faithful to you’?

00:26:13.054 --> 00:26:15.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, did Jehovah block the pain?

00:26:15.657 --> 00:26:16.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know.

00:26:16.925 --> 00:26:18.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what we do know is

00:26:18.927 --> 00:26:20.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jeremiah stayed faithful.

00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:23.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This experience did not break his will,

00:26:23.098 --> 00:26:26.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not break his spirit,
nor did it break his integrity.

00:26:27.802 --> 00:26:30.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or how about the time when Jeremiah

00:26:30.205 --> 00:26:32.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had to go in front of the temple

00:26:32.207 --> 00:26:34.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in front of the priests and the leaders

00:26:34.209 --> 00:26:36.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had to tell them that their precious temple

00:26:36.211 --> 00:26:37.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was going to be destroyed?

00:26:37.712 --> 00:26:38.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he had to illustrate it

00:26:38.913 --> 00:26:41.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by slamming that clay vessel on the ground

00:26:41.383 --> 00:26:43.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watching it shatter.

00:26:43.718 --> 00:26:45.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could you imagine Jeremiah’s prayer?

00:26:45.854 --> 00:26:47.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah, help me become

00:26:47.355 --> 00:26:49.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘what I need to to deliver this message.

00:26:49.157 --> 00:26:50.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Give me the poise.

00:26:50.525 --> 00:26:51.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Give me the courage.

00:26:51.893 --> 00:26:54.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help me have that inner strength to do so.’

00:26:55.997 --> 00:26:57.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah did.

00:26:57.999 --> 00:27:02.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with Jeremiah time and time again.

00:27:03.972 --> 00:27:07.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the very name of Jehovah

00:27:07.375 --> 00:27:10.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes it clear that you will succeed.

00:27:10.845 --> 00:27:14.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be able to carry out his will.

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:16.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ve been doing that.

00:27:17.752 --> 00:27:20.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In your introductions to the family,

00:27:20.755 --> 00:27:24.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we heard how Jehovah
was causing you to become.

00:27:24.092 --> 00:27:28.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
one of you talked about how as a young girl

00:27:28.363 --> 00:27:32.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you and your sister
were asked to leave the family home

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of your relationship with Jehovah.

00:27:34.936 --> 00:27:36.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:27:36.938 --> 00:27:40.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah caused you and others around you

00:27:40.008 --> 00:27:41.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—your brothers and sisters—

00:27:41.543 --> 00:27:45.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become what was necessary
to keep you close to Jehovah.

00:27:46.514 --> 00:27:50.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of you related how you were
on a theocratic construction expansion project

00:27:50.652 --> 00:27:55.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you were assigned
to cut brick in the heat with all your gear on.

00:27:57.525 --> 00:27:59.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You said you maintained your joy.

00:27:59.527 --> 00:28:00.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:28:00.695 --> 00:28:03.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jehovah caused you to become.

00:28:04.566 --> 00:28:06.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of you dear ones related to us

00:28:06.701 --> 00:28:11.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you had thought
your service to Jehovah had no value to him.

00:28:12.407 --> 00:28:14.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You had lost your joy.

00:28:14.576 --> 00:28:16.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happened?

00:28:16.578 --> 00:28:20.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah caused someone to encourage you,

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:22.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strengthen you.

00:28:22.550 --> 00:28:24.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of you related how Jehovah

00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:28.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped you serve
beyond the capacity of your heart.

00:28:30.225 --> 00:28:33.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah has caused all of you

00:28:33.328 --> 00:28:38.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to become what is necessary to carry out his will.

00:28:38.333 --> 00:28:41.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So whenever you feel discouraged,
whenever you feel afraid,

00:28:41.903 --> 00:28:44.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever you feel unqualified,

00:28:44.539 --> 00:28:46.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pray to Jehovah.

00:28:46.541 --> 00:28:50.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask him to help you become
what is necessary to carry out his will.

00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:54.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask him to help you do whatever you need

00:28:54.883 --> 00:28:57.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so you can glorify his name.

00:29:00.221 --> 00:29:04.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider: When did Jehovah reveal

00:29:04.459 --> 00:29:07.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this truth to the Israelites?

00:29:07.629 --> 00:29:11.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was right before they were
about to face challenges.

00:29:12.634 --> 00:29:17.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When did Jehovah reveal this truth to us?

00:29:17.639 --> 00:29:22.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really with the revision
of the New World Translation.

00:29:22.377 --> 00:29:25.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really helped bring it into focus
—the power of his name—

00:29:25.747 --> 00:29:27.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really, right before we are to be ushered

00:29:27.982 --> 00:29:29.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Jehovah’s new world.

00:29:31.186 --> 00:29:33.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what trials will you face?

00:29:33.922 --> 00:29:37.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What challenges will you experience?

00:29:37.058 --> 00:29:40.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will the great tribulation bring?

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:42.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It doesn’t matter

00:29:42.564 --> 00:29:44.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you worship Jehovah.

00:29:44.866 --> 00:29:49.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s his name
—the God who causes to become.

00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:05.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we deeply appreciate
that very fine talk, Brother Snyder.

00:30:05.553 --> 00:30:07.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we have Brother Donald Gordon,

00:30:07.755 --> 00:30:10.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves as a helper
to the Publishing Committee,

00:30:10.492 --> 00:30:12.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with us to deliver the talk

00:30:12.494 --> 00:30:15.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Live in Sync With Jehovah.”

00:30:17.165 --> 00:30:19.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for the last five months you dear students

00:30:19.968 --> 00:30:24.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been downloading a lot
of wonderful information about Jehovah.

00:30:24.472 --> 00:30:28.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that the class has finished,
the download is complete

00:30:28.142 --> 00:30:30.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all synced up.

00:30:30.378 --> 00:30:33.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it may seem that way for the moment.

00:30:33.114 --> 00:30:37.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course,  Jehovah did not create us
like simple computers

00:30:37.118 --> 00:30:40.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we just store away
information in our memories.

00:30:40.989 --> 00:30:43.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were created “in his image.”

00:30:43.391 --> 00:30:46.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as we take in knowledge from Jehovah,

00:30:46.728 --> 00:30:51.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the ability to absorb it
and then to reflect his image

00:30:51.432 --> 00:30:54.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to think like him, to feel like him.

00:30:54.702 --> 00:30:58.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin to act like him.

00:30:58.006 --> 00:31:02.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he has given us
what we have here in his Word,

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:04.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he as well created us

00:31:04.512 --> 00:31:08.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our human capacity to assimilate his Word

00:31:08.983 --> 00:31:11.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the beautiful facets of his image,

00:31:11.719 --> 00:31:16.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we can truly be in sync with Jehovah.

00:31:16.724 --> 00:31:19.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does our being in sync with Jehovah

00:31:19.861 --> 00:31:23.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bring honor to him and joy to him?

00:31:23.831 --> 00:31:27.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we think of the various ones
who are in sync with Jehovah,

00:31:27.569 --> 00:31:31.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no doubt the foremost example is Jesus Christ.

00:31:31.339 --> 00:31:35.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything he did, everything he said,

00:31:35.043 --> 00:31:40.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every thought he had
was in full harmony with his Father.

00:31:40.048 --> 00:31:44.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said:
“I cannot do a single thing of my own initiative.”

00:31:44.786 --> 00:31:48.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it’s like a husband and wife

00:31:48.523 --> 00:31:50.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been married a number of years.

00:31:50.592 --> 00:31:54.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With just a glance, without a word,
they know what the other one is thinking.

00:31:54.228 --> 00:31:56.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re in sync.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps you’re thinking of two ice skaters

00:31:58.766 --> 00:32:02.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
flowing across the ice as one, in unison.

00:32:03.438 --> 00:32:06.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one example of Jehovah and Jesus

00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:08.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
working in unison, in sync,

00:32:08.142 --> 00:32:11.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when the woman
with the flow of blood was cured

00:32:11.346 --> 00:32:14.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by just touching the fringe of Jesus’ garment

00:32:14.215 --> 00:32:16.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one of our favorite miracles.

00:32:16.651 --> 00:32:19.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recall that scene again, recorded here

00:32:19.087 --> 00:32:23.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Mark 5:29, 30

00:32:24.892 --> 00:32:27.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Mark 5:29.

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:29.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The woman
has made her way through the crowd;

00:32:29.764 --> 00:32:32.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she touches the garment, and then in verse 29:

00:32:32.233 --> 00:32:35.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Immediately her flow of blood dried up,

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:39.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and she sensed
in her body that she had been healed

00:32:39.007 --> 00:32:41.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the grievous sickness.

00:32:41.309 --> 00:32:45.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Immediately Jesus realized in himself

00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that power had gone out of him,

00:32:47.749 --> 00:32:50.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he turned around in the crowd and asked:

00:32:50.151 --> 00:32:52.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Who touched my outer garments?’”

00:32:53.287 --> 00:32:57.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that moment
when that woman sensed that she was cured,

00:32:57.325 --> 00:33:01.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus
were working in complete harmony.

00:33:01.262 --> 00:33:04.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, until that moment,
Jesus may have been unaware

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:09.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was watching
this woman with a desire to heal her.

00:33:10.471 --> 00:33:14.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suppose that Jehovah
could have just cured the woman on his own,

00:33:14.642 --> 00:33:17.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it were, without Jesus even knowing.

00:33:17.845 --> 00:33:22.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no, he chose to work through his Son,

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:26.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who he knew was working in harmony with him.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when Jesus felt the power go out from him,

00:33:30.558 --> 00:33:33.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he naturally wanted to know who was cured

00:33:33.127 --> 00:33:36.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘Who did my Father see that I did not see?’—

00:33:36.030 --> 00:33:38.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they were working together in harmony.

00:33:38.866 --> 00:33:42.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then seeing this woman,
realizing that actually she was unclean

00:33:42.804 --> 00:33:44.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where she did not belong,

00:33:44.839 --> 00:33:47.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was still
in complete agreement with his Father.

00:33:47.809 --> 00:33:50.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was in sync
with Jehovah’s view of this woman

00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:54.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and very happy
to have been involved in the cure of her

00:33:54.916 --> 00:33:58.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—leaving us, of course, 
with one of our favorite accounts of Jesus’ life.

00:34:00.054 --> 00:34:03.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what’s a lesson for us?

00:34:03.524 --> 00:34:05.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether we are at our work assignments,

00:34:05.727 --> 00:34:08.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our congregations, or out in the ministry,

00:34:08.096 --> 00:34:13.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to be in sync
with how Jehovah views other people.

00:34:13.101 --> 00:34:17.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We often tend
to view others through our own eyes.

00:34:17.105 --> 00:34:20.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can be clouded
by our own human concerns and viewpoints,

00:34:20.808 --> 00:34:23.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps tainted by some misunderstandings

00:34:23.745 --> 00:34:27.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or misconceptions or wrong information

00:34:27.014 --> 00:34:31.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps
our need to be a little more forgiving.

00:34:31.185 --> 00:34:35.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, if any of those feelings
are tainting our judgment

00:34:35.022 --> 00:34:38.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or relationships even in a small way,

00:34:38.459 --> 00:34:42.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to that degree we are out of sync with Jehovah.

00:34:42.897 --> 00:34:46.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus and Jehovah
were focused on this woman’s faith:

00:34:46.968 --> 00:34:48.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your faith has made you well.

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:50.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go in peace.”

00:34:50.972 --> 00:34:53.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let us in every situation

00:34:53.541 --> 00:34:57.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strive to see others as Jehovah sees them.

00:34:57.011 --> 00:34:59.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brings honor to Jehovah

00:34:59.113 --> 00:35:03.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and allows him
to use us in harmony with his will.

00:35:04.886 --> 00:35:08.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there was another situation
where being in sync with his Father

00:35:08.389 --> 00:35:11.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took more time and effort.

00:35:11.392 --> 00:35:14.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus
chose his 12 apostles, he, of course,

00:35:14.495 --> 00:35:17.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wanted to be in harmony with his Father,

00:35:17.732 --> 00:35:20.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this did not happen with just a glance.

00:35:20.902 --> 00:35:25.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jesus had a very deep, 
intimate knowledge of Jehovah.

00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:29.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these men that he was considering
—he knew them well.

00:35:29.010 --> 00:35:33.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, this decision took hours of prayer

00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:37.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to arrive at the 12 apostles selected.

00:35:37.318 --> 00:35:39.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it will be in performing your work

00:35:39.754 --> 00:35:42.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and making decisions in your assignments

00:35:42.356 --> 00:35:46.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—you cannot simply rely
on your knowledge of the Scriptures,

00:35:46.427 --> 00:35:48.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as deep as it may be.

00:35:48.863 --> 00:35:53.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make decisions,
we must implore Jehovah in our prayers

00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:55.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—maybe many prayers—

00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:57.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our meditations.

00:35:57.271 --> 00:35:59.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t hold back from beseeching Jehovah

00:35:59.941 --> 00:36:02.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you struggle for a decision.

00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:05.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But certainly, always relying,
of course, on his Word, the Bible

00:36:05.580 --> 00:36:07.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—knowledge from his Word—

00:36:07.582 --> 00:36:11.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayers to our Father,
and then meditation on his will.

00:36:14.856 --> 00:36:17.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, you’ve learned in your class

00:36:17.058 --> 00:36:21.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the knowledge of Jehovah
is such a multifaceted gem.

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:26.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is an intriguing scripture 
that sheds further light on this thought

00:36:26.534 --> 00:36:29.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here at Ephesians 3:19,

00:36:32.373 --> 00:36:36.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 3:19.

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says “and to know the love of the Christ,

00:36:39.547 --> 00:36:41.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which surpasses knowledge.”

00:36:41.983 --> 00:36:46.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, how can knowing something

00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:49.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be more than the knowledge?

00:36:49.023 --> 00:36:53.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you’ve learned here
that the Greek term rendered “to know” means

00:36:53.661 --> 00:36:58.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to know “practically, through experience.”

00:36:58.266 --> 00:37:02.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course, the Gospel accounts
teach us much about Christ’s love.

00:37:02.603 --> 00:37:07.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We come to know his patience,
his humility, his willingness to forgive, etc.

00:37:07.441 --> 00:37:10.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read and we study that with delight.

00:37:10.678 --> 00:37:13.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But to really know it,

00:37:13.481 --> 00:37:17.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like, well, a skill that we might learn

00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:19.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only after we actually do it.

00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:21.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:37:21.422 --> 00:37:25.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a doctor goes to school to learn to be a doctor.

00:37:25.559 --> 00:37:29.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s lots of learning
and years of study involved,

00:37:29.363 --> 00:37:33.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then when the studies are complete,
they begin their internship.

00:37:33.734 --> 00:37:36.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They begin making the rounds at the hospital.

00:37:36.904 --> 00:37:40.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They now begin taking part in this education

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:42.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what they learned from the books—

00:37:42.443 --> 00:37:45.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and applying it to real-life situations.

00:37:45.546 --> 00:37:48.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The knowledge learned from this experience

00:37:48.482 --> 00:37:52.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surpasses the knowledge learned in the books.

00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:56.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we have studied the Christ;
we do the bookwork; we have learned.

00:37:56.924 --> 00:38:00.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you Gilead students have had
the amazing opportunity these last five months

00:38:00.828 --> 00:38:04.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read and study about his patience, his love,

00:38:04.632 --> 00:38:08.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his forgiveness, humility, compassion.

00:38:08.936 --> 00:38:12.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You cherish that knowledge; you’re in sync

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:14.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not quite yet.

00:38:14.709 --> 00:38:17.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, now we must do the internship;

00:38:17.778 --> 00:38:22.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now we must take that knowledge
and make the rounds, as it were.

00:38:22.049 --> 00:38:25.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We go around the congregation;
we interact with our workmates;

00:38:25.486 --> 00:38:27.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we go out in the field ministry.

00:38:27.488 --> 00:38:30.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You deal with a sticky, difficult situation

00:38:30.992 --> 00:38:35.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put into practice
what you’ve learned from the Christ.

00:38:35.997 --> 00:38:40.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the way to get the full impact.

00:38:40.001 --> 00:38:42.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve read and studied what he was thinking,

00:38:42.536 --> 00:38:46.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now you know how he was feeling

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:51.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how it feels to unselfishly give
of oneself in behalf of others.

00:38:51.212 --> 00:38:55.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does it really feel
to act with humility as Jesus did?

00:38:55.282 --> 00:38:58.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you come to know how it really feels

00:38:58.219 --> 00:39:01.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to forgive from the heart as Jesus did.

00:39:01.756 --> 00:39:04.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, by experience

00:39:04.458 --> 00:39:07.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you come “to know the love of the Christ,”

00:39:07.161 --> 00:39:10.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that ‘surpasses the knowledge.’

00:39:10.197 --> 00:39:15.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now not only is what you know about God
and is treasured in your heart in sync

00:39:15.202 --> 00:39:18.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now your actions, your life,

00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:22.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who you are is in sync with Jehovah.

00:39:24.045 --> 00:39:28.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Indeed, like King David,
who expressed in the 139th Psalm,

00:39:28.516 --> 00:39:31.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you dear students have found in God’s Word

00:39:31.552 --> 00:39:34.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the precious thoughts of Jehovah.

00:39:34.288 --> 00:39:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to search them out,

00:39:36.724 --> 00:39:40.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bring them to mind,
cherish them, and do them.

00:39:40.628 --> 00:39:45.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then you
will be living your life in sync with Jehovah.

00:39:51.038 --> 00:39:55.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we are very grateful
for that heartfelt talk, Brother Gordon.

00:39:55.276 --> 00:39:59.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we go to one
of our Gilead instructors for the next talk;

00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:01.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s Brother Mark Noumair.

00:40:01.982 --> 00:40:04.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he will speak on the subject

00:40:04.018 --> 00:40:06.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Offer Your Bow.”

00:40:08.289 --> 00:40:12.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the age of 20, he was a natural leader,

00:40:12.359 --> 00:40:15.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
commanding a thousand men.

00:40:15.029 --> 00:40:17.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His tribe was legendary

00:40:17.331 --> 00:40:19.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their military prowess.

00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was known as a skilled archer.

00:40:22.269 --> 00:40:25.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His bow never turned back from its target.

00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:28.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the firstborn, favored prince

00:40:28.309 --> 00:40:31.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—courageous, loyal, loved by the people.

00:40:31.946 --> 00:40:35.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything was lining up perfectly

00:40:35.316 --> 00:40:39.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jonathan to become Israel’s next king

00:40:39.253 --> 00:40:41.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—everything except

00:40:41.288 --> 00:40:44.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was not Jehovah’s choice.

00:40:44.992 --> 00:40:49.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how would he react when he saw David

00:40:49.663 --> 00:40:52.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
receive Jehovah’s special favor?

00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:55.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would he react when David

00:40:55.703 --> 00:40:58.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was now transferred permanently

00:40:58.305 --> 00:41:00.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the king’s house?

00:41:00.641 --> 00:41:03.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he be filled with envy, jealousy?

00:41:03.310 --> 00:41:05.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he feel threatened?

00:41:05.312 --> 00:41:09.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he work to assassinate David’s character?

00:41:09.316 --> 00:41:11.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all,

00:41:11.318 --> 00:41:14.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was 30 years younger than Jonathan

00:41:14.255 --> 00:41:17.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and came from a rather insignificant family.

00:41:17.424 --> 00:41:19.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what would Jonathan do?

00:41:19.827 --> 00:41:21.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what he did.

00:41:21.829 --> 00:41:24.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did something remarkable.

00:41:24.331 --> 00:41:28.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s found at 1 Samuel 18:3, 4.

00:41:30.538 --> 00:41:34.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is what we want you to think about:
what he did do and the application,

00:41:34.175 --> 00:41:37.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because this is so valuable for you.

00:41:37.711 --> 00:41:42.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Samuel 18:3, 4:

00:41:43.417 --> 00:41:47.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jonathan and David made a covenant,

00:41:47.121 --> 00:41:49.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he loved him as himself.”

00:41:49.690 --> 00:41:51.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, note verse 4:

00:41:51.692 --> 00:41:54.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jonathan took off the sleeveless coat

00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:57.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that he wore and gave it to David,

00:41:57.531 --> 00:42:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“along with his gear, his sword,

00:42:00.534 --> 00:42:04.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his bow, and his belt.”

00:42:04.104 --> 00:42:07.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this dramatic act of deep symbolism

00:42:07.775 --> 00:42:10.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicated that Jonathan would submit

00:42:10.344 --> 00:42:12.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his will to Jehovah’s will.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:15.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was going to humbly support David.

00:42:15.549 --> 00:42:17.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But think about it.

00:42:17.551 --> 00:42:21.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By offering his bow to David,

00:42:21.322 --> 00:42:25.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan was giving up
a major part of his identity.

00:42:25.159 --> 00:42:28.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible describes Jonathan as a manly warrior

00:42:28.996 --> 00:42:31.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—‘swifter than an eagle,’ ‘mightier than a lion.’

00:42:31.865 --> 00:42:34.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was winning battles against the Philistines

00:42:34.068 --> 00:42:36.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before David was even born.

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:40.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was he worried
about losing the respect of others?

00:42:40.274 --> 00:42:42.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he say: ‘What will people think of me?

00:42:42.543 --> 00:42:47.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will I lose my credibility
if I support this younger David?’

00:42:47.514 --> 00:42:49.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:42:49.516 --> 00:42:52.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nor did he feel that Jehovah rejected him

00:42:52.519 --> 00:42:55.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the special favor upon David.

00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:59.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan’s bow and his other war equipment

00:42:59.793 --> 00:43:01.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were his trademark,

00:43:01.795 --> 00:43:04.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that symbolized his military power.

00:43:04.632 --> 00:43:09.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the bow did not make the man.

00:43:09.503 --> 00:43:11.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love made the man

00:43:11.505 --> 00:43:15.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—love for Jehovah, love for Jehovah’s choices.

00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:17.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what we’re highlighting.

00:43:17.811 --> 00:43:21.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And once Jonathan offered his bow,

00:43:21.248 --> 00:43:23.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he never retracted it,

00:43:23.284 --> 00:43:25.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when he knew

00:43:25.286 --> 00:43:28.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that David would be the next king.

00:43:28.455 --> 00:43:31.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He respected the divine arrangement,

00:43:31.258 --> 00:43:35.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and repeatedly Jonathan would support David.

00:43:35.162 --> 00:43:38.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He would reassure David,
‘You are Jehovah’s choice.’

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan was not insecure.

00:43:42.603 --> 00:43:46.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not afraid to appear insignificant.

00:43:46.006 --> 00:43:48.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was not threatened to see David rise;

00:43:48.075 --> 00:43:53.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor did he view David as a rival to be eliminated.

00:43:53.013 --> 00:43:57.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in human terms, this cost Jonathan.

00:43:57.618 --> 00:44:00.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He lost the prospect of being king;

00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:04.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he lost his close relationship with his father;

00:44:04.625 --> 00:44:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he might have lost
some stature in the eyes of men.

00:44:09.196 --> 00:44:12.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in spiritual terms, he gained.

00:44:12.766 --> 00:44:16.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His unselfish devotion to David

00:44:16.036 --> 00:44:18.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received honorable mention in God’s Word,

00:44:18.772 --> 00:44:22.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which never would have happened
had he resisted Jehovah’s choice.

00:44:22.676 --> 00:44:25.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wouldn’t even be talking about this right now

00:44:25.245 --> 00:44:27.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if he took a fleshly view

00:44:27.348 --> 00:44:30.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s divine arrangement.

00:44:30.351 --> 00:44:32.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is your first big lesson:

00:44:32.853 --> 00:44:36.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t measure your worth by your job title.

00:44:38.325 --> 00:44:40.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s your love of Jehovah

00:44:40.361 --> 00:44:43.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s what makes you so valuable.

00:44:43.163 --> 00:44:46.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A spiritual person is a most powerful tool

00:44:46.567 --> 00:44:49.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the hands of God, and this is what you are.

00:44:49.970 --> 00:44:52.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can you imitate Jonathan?

00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:55.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Offer your bow

00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:59.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by showing your support
of Jehovah’s organizational decisions,

00:44:59.747 --> 00:45:03.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if it means giving up something you love

00:45:03.283 --> 00:45:05.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or want to cling to.

00:45:05.519 --> 00:45:07.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:45:07.654 --> 00:45:11.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of you have been given
new country assignments,

00:45:11.058 --> 00:45:13.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet you might not have planned

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on moving to another country.

00:45:15.562 --> 00:45:20.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were content where you were;
you were happy doing what you were doing.

00:45:20.234 --> 00:45:22.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:45:22.236 --> 00:45:26.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for your unselfish support
of the decisions made

00:45:26.473 --> 00:45:28.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to advance Kingdom interests globally.

00:45:28.842 --> 00:45:31.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:45:31.011 --> 00:45:34.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or perhaps you’ve been trained in some capacity

00:45:34.281 --> 00:45:36.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something you really enjoy.

00:45:36.350 --> 00:45:40.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet now someone else
is assigned to do that job.

00:45:40.387 --> 00:45:42.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you, like Jonathan,

00:45:42.389 --> 00:45:45.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put your heart into supporting and reassuring

00:45:45.959 --> 00:45:49.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the new person that took your job?

00:45:49.496 --> 00:45:52.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how about you as a sister?

00:45:52.199 --> 00:45:55.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about if a new sister comes and gets

00:45:55.302 --> 00:45:57.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the job assignment you love, you cherish?

00:45:57.805 --> 00:46:00.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wake up every day ‘I love my job!’

00:46:00.574 --> 00:46:02.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now you’re asked to train her.

00:46:02.743 --> 00:46:04.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you do?

00:46:04.745 --> 00:46:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you offer your bow?

00:46:07.681 --> 00:46:12.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or the sister gets the office that you dreamed of

00:46:12.052 --> 00:46:13.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the one with the window.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it is.
You had your eyes set on it.

00:46:16.824 --> 00:46:18.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might have seniority.

00:46:18.525 --> 00:46:21.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She could be younger than you,
but perhaps oversight

00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:23.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took other factors into consideration

00:46:23.797 --> 00:46:25.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you were not aware of.

00:46:25.799 --> 00:46:27.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you do?

00:46:27.801 --> 00:46:30.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will all of you do in these situations?

00:46:30.304 --> 00:46:33.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you accept the fact that supporting decisions

00:46:33.707 --> 00:46:35.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the organization at times

00:46:35.709 --> 00:46:38.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves sacrifices on your part?

00:46:39.913 --> 00:46:42.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let your love for Jehovah

00:46:42.349 --> 00:46:46.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mean more than your cherished work assignment.

00:46:46.019 --> 00:46:49.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is a very, very big lesson
—lesson number one—

00:46:49.790 --> 00:46:52.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and very important for you to think about,

00:46:52.326 --> 00:46:56.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offering your bow in this way.

00:46:56.129 --> 00:46:58.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve already shown this spirit.

00:46:58.165 --> 00:47:00.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just reinforcing something

00:47:00.501 --> 00:47:03.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you need to hear prior to your departure.

00:47:05.138 --> 00:47:07.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, I want you to think about this for a moment.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Compare Jonathan’s good example

00:47:12.913 --> 00:47:16.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with that of his brother Ish-bosheth.

00:47:17.918 --> 00:47:20.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Saul died,

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Samuel 2:8 says

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:25.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his general, Abner,

00:47:25.492 --> 00:47:28.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made Ish-bosheth king

00:47:28.862 --> 00:47:31.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no loyalty to Jehovah’s choice.

00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:34.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Ish-bosheth agreed, ‘I want that.’

00:47:34.434 --> 00:47:37.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ish-bosheth craved position,

00:47:37.804 --> 00:47:42.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which led to a civil war, which led to problems.

00:47:42.409 --> 00:47:45.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, instead of Ish-bosheth offering his bow

00:47:45.612 --> 00:47:48.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his war equipment to David,

00:47:48.615 --> 00:47:50.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Samuel chapter 2

00:47:50.851 --> 00:47:54.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes how he provoked war with David,

00:47:54.621 --> 00:47:56.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which resulted in bloodshed

00:47:56.723 --> 00:48:00.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the death of 380 men in Israel.

00:48:00.594 --> 00:48:04.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ish-bosheth’s heart wasn’t with David.

00:48:04.031 --> 00:48:06.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was Jehovah’s choice.

00:48:06.133 --> 00:48:08.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was unlike his brother Jonathan.

00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:14.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now imagine if Jonathan was still alive

00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:17.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Saul died and Abner
now comes to Jonathan and says:

00:48:17.411 --> 00:48:19.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jonathan, I want you to be king.

00:48:19.613 --> 00:48:21.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’d make a great king.’

00:48:21.882 --> 00:48:23.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would Jonathan have agreed?

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:26.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would he have then said,
‘Give me my bow back’ and retract it

00:48:26.787 --> 00:48:30.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take it back and tell David:
‘No, I feigned loyalty to you.

00:48:30.257 --> 00:48:32.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what I really wanted.
I want to be king’?

00:48:32.793 --> 00:48:34.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No. No.

00:48:34.795 --> 00:48:36.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan wouldn’t have done that.

00:48:36.563 --> 00:48:38.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:48:38.332 --> 00:48:41.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he gave not just his bow to David,

00:48:41.435 --> 00:48:44.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave not just his war equipment to David (no),

00:48:44.438 --> 00:48:47.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave his very heart to Jehovah’s choice.

00:48:47.874 --> 00:48:50.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s the beautiful thing about him.

00:48:50.143 --> 00:48:52.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The difference between Jonathan,

00:48:52.713 --> 00:48:56.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who sees an opportunity
to support Jehovah’s cause,

00:48:56.883 --> 00:49:01.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Ish-bosheth,
who never thought for a moment

00:49:01.154 --> 00:49:05.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how Jehovah God
was directing David, is striking.

00:49:06.927 --> 00:49:09.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the results speak for themselves.

00:49:09.630 --> 00:49:12.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan was loved and honored.

00:49:12.766 --> 00:49:16.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ish-bosheth was hated and murdered.

00:49:19.339 --> 00:49:21.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jonathan died,

00:49:21.975 --> 00:49:24.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
David was so deeply grieved

00:49:24.778 --> 00:49:27.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the loss of his dear friend

00:49:27.114 --> 00:49:29.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he was moved to do something.

00:49:29.916 --> 00:49:32.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what he did is recorded

00:49:32.919 --> 00:49:37.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Samuel 1:17, 18.

00:49:37.958 --> 00:49:40.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to read this to you.

00:49:40.627 --> 00:49:44.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Samuel 1:17, 18:

00:49:47.534 --> 00:49:51.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then David chanted this dirge [or this song]

00:49:51.038 --> 00:49:55.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“over Saul and his son Jonathan and said

00:49:55.876 --> 00:49:58.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the people of Judah should be taught

00:49:58.178 --> 00:50:02.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dirge [the song] called ‘The Bow.’”

00:50:02.616 --> 00:50:04.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Bow.”

00:50:04.651 --> 00:50:07.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could David have had in mind the bow

00:50:07.988 --> 00:50:12.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jonathan gave him
at the beginning of their friendship?

00:50:12.159 --> 00:50:15.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan supported
the nation without demanding

00:50:15.362 --> 00:50:18.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he receive high rank, or position.

00:50:18.298 --> 00:50:20.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonathan was so loyal.

00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:23.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a powerful lesson that David never forgot,

00:50:23.637 --> 00:50:26.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and neither did he want
the sons of Judah to forget,

00:50:26.473 --> 00:50:30.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he instructed
that they all learn this song by heart.

00:50:31.845 --> 00:50:34.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Offering your bow

00:50:34.948 --> 00:50:38.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a powerful word picture.

00:50:38.618 --> 00:50:41.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you continue to work in the background

00:50:41.822 --> 00:50:43.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(work quietly in the background),

00:50:43.824 --> 00:50:46.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in loyal support of Jehovah’s choices

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:50.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the cost,
despite the human imperfections,

00:50:50.497 --> 00:50:53.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the disappointments,
despite the perceived injustices,

00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:55.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you don’t worry about all of that.

00:50:55.902 --> 00:50:59.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s simply the ebb and flow of life.

00:50:59.172 --> 00:51:02.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pick yourself up; keep on moving; grow mighty;

00:51:02.375 --> 00:51:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become a living example
to the brotherhood in loyalty.

00:51:06.146 --> 00:51:08.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what you’ve been trained to do.

00:51:08.615 --> 00:51:10.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you will receive

00:51:10.617 --> 00:51:12.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s attention and favor

00:51:12.619 --> 00:51:14.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Jonathan did.

00:51:15.622 --> 00:51:19.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah did not merely dismiss
Jonathan as a would-have-been king.

00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:21.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:51:21.628 --> 00:51:25.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, he took note of Jonathan’s loyal support

00:51:25.065 --> 00:51:28.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had his wonderful example embedded,

00:51:28.168 --> 00:51:31.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
etched, into his inspired Word.

00:51:33.473 --> 00:51:36.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you go to your assignment,

00:51:36.409 --> 00:51:38.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is your bow?

00:51:39.913 --> 00:51:42.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone has one.

00:51:42.048 --> 00:51:45.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it your cherished work assignment?

00:51:45.285 --> 00:51:50.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it that privilege that you have been given
that few others enjoy?

00:51:50.123 --> 00:51:52.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it the responsibility

00:51:52.225 --> 00:51:55.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that requires many to consult you for direction?

00:51:55.796 --> 00:51:57.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about this:

00:51:57.964 --> 00:51:59.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The time will come

00:51:59.966 --> 00:52:03.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when someone is put in a leading role,

00:52:03.203 --> 00:52:06.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you will be asked to support that person,

00:52:06.439 --> 00:52:09.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work under that person, help that person.

00:52:09.176 --> 00:52:12.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when that time comes, ask yourself,

00:52:12.245 --> 00:52:14.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What will I do?’

00:52:14.848 --> 00:52:18.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And not just you brothers, you sisters too,

00:52:18.985 --> 00:52:21.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, you wives, will you support?

00:52:21.188 --> 00:52:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will the wife support as well?

00:52:23.223 --> 00:52:25.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Single sisters, will you support the arrangement?

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:26.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the point.

00:52:26.827 --> 00:52:30.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself: ‘Will I offer my bow like Jonathan?

00:52:30.263 --> 00:52:32.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Will I offer it freely?

00:52:32.265 --> 00:52:36.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Will I offer it generously to anyone chosen

00:52:36.336 --> 00:52:40.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a role of responsibility
within God’s organization?’

00:52:40.207 --> 00:52:44.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And be assured
that Jehovah in turn will offer you

00:52:44.311 --> 00:52:47.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—offer you an unimaginable treasure.

00:52:47.347 --> 00:52:50.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that treasure is his favor and approval.

00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:52.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s favor and approval

00:52:52.853 --> 00:52:54.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—what is better than that?—

00:52:54.855 --> 00:52:58.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now and life in the new world.

00:52:58.225 --> 00:53:00.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you get to the new world,

00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be sure to look for the one

00:53:02.662 --> 00:53:05.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who inspired you to offer your bow.

00:53:20.113 --> 00:53:24.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we thank you, Brother Noumair,
very much for that encouraging talk.

00:53:24.284 --> 00:53:29.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we’ve enjoyed a series
of wonderful talks this morning, haven’t we?

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:33.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouraging program thus far!

00:53:33.426 --> 00:53:35.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the upcoming weeks,

00:53:35.428 --> 00:53:39.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for Parts 2 and 3 of the graduation program.

00:53:39.633 --> 00:53:42.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ll be found under Latest Videos

00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:47.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or under the Video on Demand segment

fishing, or agricultural industries.

00:54:11.298 --> 00:54:13.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the official language
of Kosrae is English,

00:54:13.867 --> 00:54:17.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s a remote translation office here.

assist with translating literature

to the over 6,000 inhabitants of the island.

00:54:39.259 --> 00:54:42.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And their hard work is bearing fruit.
