Ephesians 4:30 has been selected

00:00:03.987 --> 00:00:06.489 line:10% position:50% align:center
as the theme text for my comments this month.

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:10.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:30 says:

00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:14.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, do not be grieving God’s holy spirit,

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:15.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with which you have been sealed

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:18.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a day of releasing by ransom.”

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:22.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does it mean
to “be grieving God’s holy spirit”?

00:00:23.373 --> 00:00:25.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we discuss that,

00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:28.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s make clear
what grieving the spirit is not.

00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:32.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grieving the holy spirit is not the same

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:34.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “blasphemy against the spirit.”

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
For that matter, grieving the spirit
is not necessarily the same

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a serious or gross sin.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the difference
between these three expressions?

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark 3:29 mentions
blasphemy against God’s holy spirit.

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says about this action:

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:52.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But whoever blasphemes

00:00:52.335 --> 00:00:54.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“against the holy spirit

00:00:54.437 --> 00:00:56.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has no forgiveness forever

00:00:56.606 --> 00:01:00.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
but is guilty of everlasting sin.”

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:05.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Blasphemy against the spirit
is said to be an “everlasting sin.”

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it is that our publications
often use the terms

00:01:08.451 --> 00:01:11.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
“blasphemy against the spirit”
and “sinning against the spirit”

00:01:11.788 --> 00:01:13.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
interchangeably.

00:01:14.958 --> 00:01:17.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 12:31, 32 further expands

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our understanding of blasphemy

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:21.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
or sinning against the holy spirit.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:27.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
This kind of sin is termed in these verses
as “unforgivable sin.”

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:30.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very serious indeed!

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:32.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 12:31, 32 says:

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:36.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this reason I say to you,

00:01:36.713 --> 00:01:39.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
“every sort of sin and blasphemy

00:01:39.182 --> 00:01:41.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will be forgiven men,

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the blasphemy against the spirit

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:44.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will not be forgiven.

00:01:44.888 --> 00:01:48.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For example, whoever speaks a word

00:01:48.892 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“against the Son of man [that’s Jesus],

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:54.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it will be forgiven him;

00:01:54.097 --> 00:01:56.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but whoever speaks against the holy spirit,

00:01:56.866 --> 00:01:59.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it will not be forgiven him,

00:01:59.269 --> 00:02:01.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
“no, not in this system of things

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:03.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor in that to come.”

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
A most tragic prospect
for any who sin against the holy spirit.

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:11.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what kind of sin might that be?

00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:14.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all,
you notice in verse 31 Jesus said:

00:02:14.717 --> 00:02:18.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Every sort of sin . . . will be forgiven.” 

00:02:18.087 --> 00:02:21.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even very serious, gross sin,
can be forgiven.

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:26.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you have sinned in the past,
in a very serious way,

00:02:26.362 --> 00:02:29.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re not at all a lost cause.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Jehovah is merciful.

00:02:32.101 --> 00:02:34.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we sin and we’re truly repentant,

00:02:34.604 --> 00:02:36.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we’ve been severely disciplined,

00:02:36.673 --> 00:02:38.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be forgiven.

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the verse said:
“Every sort of sin . . . will be forgiven.”

00:02:44.013 --> 00:02:46.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
did you notice Jesus’ further statement?

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said that a person
who speaks against Jesus

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:53.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
has the possibility of being forgiven,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas one who blasphemes
against the holy spirit

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be forgiven—forever.

00:03:00.697 --> 00:03:02.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:06.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reason is that holy spirit
has God as its very Source.

00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
The holy spirit is expressive
of God’s own personality.

00:03:11.574 --> 00:03:15.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
So saying things against
or denying the holy spirit

00:03:15.211 --> 00:03:18.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the same as speaking
against Jehovah himself.

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:23.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jesus was here referring
to those who willfully, deliberately opposed

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
an operation of God’s holy spirit.

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:31.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, do we have an example
of some who did just that,

00:03:31.361 --> 00:03:34.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
they blasphemed or sinned
against the holy spirit?

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:41.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look back in the context of Jesus’ statement
in Matthew chapter 12.

00:03:42.472 --> 00:03:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus had used the power of the holy spirit
to cure a man.

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how the Jewish religious leaders spoke

00:03:48.745 --> 00:03:53.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
against that obvious, miraculous use
of holy spirit.

00:03:54.317 --> 00:03:57.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 12:22 first,

00:03:57.086 --> 00:03:59.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: “Then they brought him

00:03:59.222 --> 00:04:00.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a demon-possessed man

00:04:00.823 --> 00:04:02.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who was blind and speechless,

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:04.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he cured him,

00:04:04.594 --> 00:04:06.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the speechless man

00:04:06.396 --> 00:04:08.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
could speak and see.”

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:11.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was indisputable evidence

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:14.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the operation of Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:04:14.237 --> 00:04:16.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
The crowds recognized that.

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:18.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pharisees did not.

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:21.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s read verses 23 and 24:

00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:26.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, all the crowds were astounded

00:04:26.049 --> 00:04:28.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and began to say:

00:04:28.051 --> 00:04:31.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘May this not perhaps be the Son of David?’

00:04:31.154 --> 00:04:33.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At hearing this, the Pharisees said:

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:35.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This fellow does not expel the demons

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:37.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘except by means of Beelzebub,

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ruler of the demons.’”

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of acknowledging
the power of Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
many Pharisees spoke against it,

00:04:47.236 --> 00:04:50.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
attributing the healing of the man
to Satan the Devil himself.

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:55.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider also the case of Judas Iscariot.

00:04:55.078 --> 00:04:58.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
He betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver.

00:04:59.282 --> 00:05:03.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider, when Jesus
came down to earth as a human,

00:05:03.453 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was a manifestation of the power
of Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:05:08.524 --> 00:05:11.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judas arranged for His death.

00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:14.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why at John 17:12,
Jesus called him

00:05:14.697 --> 00:05:17.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the son of destruction.”

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judas sinned against the spirit.

00:05:20.703 --> 00:05:24.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
He poisoned his relationship with Jehovah,

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:26.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sin that could never be canceled out.

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Irreversible!

00:05:29.946 --> 00:05:34.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
So blaspheming the holy spirit
is related more to the motive,

00:05:34.584 --> 00:05:38.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the heart condition,
the degree of willfulness,

00:05:38.388 --> 00:05:40.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
more so than to a specific type of sin.

00:05:42.058 --> 00:05:45.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that is not for us to judge.

00:05:45.194 --> 00:05:48.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows who is worthy of a resurrection
and who is not.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, clearly,
we do not even want to come close

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
to sinning against Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:05:55.772 --> 00:05:57.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
as did Judas

00:05:57.407 --> 00:06:00.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some of the false religious leaders
in the first century.

00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:04.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s change now to another expression,

00:06:04.213 --> 00:06:07.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“serious” or “gross” sin.

00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that,

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:12.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how does it differ
from sinning against the spirit?

00:06:12.955 --> 00:06:15.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we will see how it also differs

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:17.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
from “grieving God’s holy spirit.”

00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:21.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, serious or gross sin most often refers

00:06:21.464 --> 00:06:24.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
to violating one of Jehovah’s moral standards

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:28.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
—sins such as sexual immorality, idolatry,

00:06:28.971 --> 00:06:33.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
thievery, extortion, murder, spiritism.

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:37.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a person is not repentant,

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:39.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
these sins are serious enough

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:42.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a person could be expelled
from the congregation.

00:06:44.087 --> 00:06:48.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hence, we refer to these
as “serious” or “gross” sins.

00:06:49.025 --> 00:06:53.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, unlike sinning against the spirit
—unforgivable sin—

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:56.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
a person who commits a serious sin

00:06:56.399 --> 00:07:00.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be retained in the congregation
or restored to it

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
if the person ceases the wrong
and is repentant.

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:09.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s mercy
can cover over even a very serious sin

00:07:09.912 --> 00:07:12.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has been properly addressed.

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:15.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Forgiveness is possible.

00:07:15.585 --> 00:07:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Jesus said:
‘Every sort of sin can be forgiven.’

00:07:21.124 --> 00:07:24.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve talked
about sinning against the spirit

00:07:24.494 --> 00:07:28.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
—willfully denying
a manifestation of Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:07:28.264 --> 00:07:30.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
No forgiveness is possible.

00:07:31.434 --> 00:07:34.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just mentioned “serious” or “gross” sin.

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:36.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
As imperfect humans,

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:40.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can succumb
to a violation of one of God’s moral laws.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though very serious, we can recover.

00:07:45.047 --> 00:07:47.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back to our theme text again,

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:49.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:30.

00:07:49.919 --> 00:07:54.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reads: “Also, do not be grieving 

00:07:54.023 --> 00:07:55.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God’s holy spirit,

00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with which you have been sealed

00:07:57.126 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a day of releasing by ransom.”

00:08:01.097 --> 00:08:05.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grieving the spirit is different
than sinning against the spirit.

00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:07.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also different from serious sin.

00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:09.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our motto is:

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:14.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow the lead of the spirit,
do not grieve the spirit.

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:18.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate:
Suppose you are following another vehicle

00:08:18.347 --> 00:08:21.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a trip to a paradisaical resort.

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:25.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
You do not know the precise directions,
but no problem.

00:08:25.521 --> 00:08:28.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
The vehicle in front of you
is from the resort

00:08:28.257 --> 00:08:30.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will lead the way.

00:08:30.259 --> 00:08:32.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you started off very well,

00:08:32.361 --> 00:08:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
carefully following the car mile after mile.

00:08:35.097 --> 00:08:37.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it changes lanes, you change lanes.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
When it speeds up, you speed up.

00:08:40.336 --> 00:08:43.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what would happen
if you failed to stay alert?

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:46.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you could lag behind considerably.

00:08:46.275 --> 00:08:48.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or possibly you notice that the lead car

00:08:48.277 --> 00:08:51.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
has moved over into the far left lane,

00:08:51.881 --> 00:08:54.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you stay in the far right lane.

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:59.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without even realizing it,
your lane turns into an exit-only lane

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:03.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suddenly you’re no longer following
the lead car.

00:09:03.392 --> 00:09:05.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re off on some other roadway.

00:09:06.429 --> 00:09:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, all of us are, in effect,

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:11.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a highway of holiness.

00:09:11.167 --> 00:09:14.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re en route to our paradisaical promises.

00:09:14.203 --> 00:09:17.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
We follow the lead of the holy spirit.

00:09:18.474 --> 00:09:20.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Initially, grieving the holy spirit

00:09:20.509 --> 00:09:25.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not necessarily involve
a serious or gross sin.

00:09:25.014 --> 00:09:27.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
A gross sin could be likened to driving

00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:29.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the same road as the holy spirit,

00:09:29.485 --> 00:09:31.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in the opposite direction.

00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:34.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, oh, in the same lane.

00:09:34.757 --> 00:09:36.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
So gross sin is, in effect,

00:09:36.926 --> 00:09:40.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a collision course with God’s spirit,

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:45.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas grieving the spirit
initially may not be so obvious.

00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:47.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re still heading
in the same general direction

00:09:47.903 --> 00:09:49.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the spirit’s leading,

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:52.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it is as if we took an exit ramp.

00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:55.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, an exit ramp
initially is just a slight veer

00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:57.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
off the highway.

00:09:57.413 --> 00:10:01.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, it appears you’re still going
in the same direction as the lead car,

00:10:01.617 --> 00:10:03.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
but eventually, what happens?

00:10:03.653 --> 00:10:05.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
The veer widens.

00:10:05.721 --> 00:10:07.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ramp may come to a stop sign.

00:10:07.923 --> 00:10:09.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now what?

00:10:09.091 --> 00:10:11.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we turn right or left, you see,

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re no longer being led by the spirit.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re on a different road.

00:10:17.833 --> 00:10:21.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote in verse 30
on the word “grieving,”

00:10:21.504 --> 00:10:23.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicates that this could be translated

00:10:23.906 --> 00:10:27.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not “cause sorrow to” God’s spirit.

00:10:27.777 --> 00:10:30.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not as if Jehovah
is bitterly angry at us

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:33.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this initial deviation,

00:10:33.082 --> 00:10:36.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he is saddened by our course of conduct.

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:41.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what might be some examples
of grieving the spirit?

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:44.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s review the verses
prior to that expression,

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
which surface in verse 30.

00:10:46.796 --> 00:10:51.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a look at verses 25-29.

00:10:51.233 --> 00:10:53.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore,

00:10:53.235 --> 00:10:55.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“now that you have put away deceit,

00:10:55.771 --> 00:10:57.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each one of you speak truth

00:10:57.206 --> 00:10:58.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with his neighbor,

00:10:58.541 --> 00:10:59.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because we are members

00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:00.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
belonging to one another.”

00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:05.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that it said:
“We are members belonging to one another”?

00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:07.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re fellow worshippers.

00:11:07.783 --> 00:11:12.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deceitful words and actions
can disrupt the unity of the congregation.

00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:17.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deceit is not following
the lead of the holy spirit.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:20.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would be disappointing Jehovah,

00:11:20.529 --> 00:11:23.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this could lead
to even more serious sin.

00:11:24.533 --> 00:11:26.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:26

00:11:26.635 --> 00:11:29.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what’s another way
to grieve the holy spirit?

00:11:30.339 --> 00:11:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:26 says:

00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:34.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Be wrathful [that happens],

00:11:34.643 --> 00:11:36.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but do not sin;

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:39.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not let the sun set
while you are still angry.”

00:11:41.083 --> 00:11:45.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the verse makes clear
that getting angry is not the sin,

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:47.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
even Jehovah can get angry.

00:11:47.456 --> 00:11:51.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
For us humans, it’s staying angry
that could grieve the spirit.

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:56.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother said that he and his wife
have taken to heart the counsel:

00:11:56.565 --> 00:12:00.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not let the sun set
while you are still angry.”

00:12:00.202 --> 00:12:04.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, he admits
there have been some very long sunsets.

00:12:05.307 --> 00:12:08.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when angered, what should we do?

00:12:08.444 --> 00:12:12.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Say a silent prayer
asking that you display self-control.

00:12:12.748 --> 00:12:17.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Change lanes,
closely following the spirit’s lead.

00:12:18.621 --> 00:12:21.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
What might be yet another way
we could grieve the spirit?

00:12:21.524 --> 00:12:24.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
A slight veer if not corrected,

00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:27.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
could put us on another roadway altogether.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:29.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:28:

00:12:29.999 --> 00:12:34.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let the one who steals steal no more;

00:12:34.203 --> 00:12:36.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“rather, let him do hard work,

00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:38.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“doing good work with his hands,

00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that he may have something to share

00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:42.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
with someone in need.”

00:12:43.579 --> 00:12:46.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actual outright stealing
—robbing a bank—

00:12:46.816 --> 00:12:49.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more than grieving the spirit.

00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:54.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is a serious sin
—on a collision course with the spirit.

00:12:55.391 --> 00:12:58.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
But are we closely following the spirit,
in principle?

00:12:58.694 --> 00:13:01.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Hebrews 13:18 says:

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We wish to conduct ourselves honestly
in all things.”

00:13:06.535 --> 00:13:09.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the job, do we take liberties?

00:13:09.538 --> 00:13:12.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we “borrow” disposable items
from the company?

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:17.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we put in a full day of work,
not stealing time from our employer?

00:13:18.781 --> 00:13:20.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honesty is the best policy;

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s following the spirit closely,
in the correct lane,

00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:28.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the right speed,
on the highway of holiness.

00:13:29.625 --> 00:13:32.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, is there another exit
from the highway of holiness

00:13:32.161 --> 00:13:34.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will want to avoid?

00:13:34.396 --> 00:13:36.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:29:

00:13:36.632 --> 00:13:38.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let a rotten word

00:13:38.367 --> 00:13:42.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[so we can grieve the spirit
simply by words uttered—let a rotten word]

00:13:42.872 --> 00:13:44.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not come out of your mouth,

00:13:44.707 --> 00:13:46.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but only what is good for building up

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:48.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as the need may be,

00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:51.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
to impart what is beneficial to the hearers.”

00:13:52.615 --> 00:13:56.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s spirit enables us to guard our speech.

00:13:56.986 --> 00:13:58.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
When frustrated or under duress,

00:13:58.988 --> 00:14:01.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
do we resort to inappropriate expressions?

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Euphemisms, perhaps.

00:14:04.193 --> 00:14:08.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
A euphemism is defined
as ‘the substitution of a less offensive word

00:14:08.564 --> 00:14:10.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
for one that is harsh, crude, offensive.’

00:14:12.134 --> 00:14:16.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
We grieve the spirit
by resorting to unwholesome speech.

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about Matthew 5:28?

00:14:20.509 --> 00:14:21.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said:

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I say to you that everyone who

00:14:24.346 --> 00:14:26.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
“keeps on looking at a woman

00:14:26.415 --> 00:14:28.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so as to have a passion for her

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:30.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has already committed adultery with her

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:31.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his heart.”

00:14:32.655 --> 00:14:35.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said,
‘has committed adultery in his heart,’

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:40.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
not the literal act at this point,
not yet a serious sin,

00:14:41.697 --> 00:14:45.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
but ‘looking at the woman
and developing passion for her.’

00:14:45.868 --> 00:14:50.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, viewing pornography
can be a grieving of the holy spirit.

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:53.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are saddening Jehovah,

00:14:53.442 --> 00:14:56.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at some point
we become distasteful to him.

00:14:57.813 --> 00:15:01.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jesus said, this can lead to serious sin.

00:15:01.183 --> 00:15:03.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, even the type of pornography

00:15:03.385 --> 00:15:05.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the frequency of viewing it

00:15:05.921 --> 00:15:08.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
can become a serious sin in itself.

00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:12.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how else do we avoid
grieving God’s spirit?

00:15:13.596 --> 00:15:16.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Avoiding hurtful gossip,

00:15:16.198 --> 00:15:21.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
cooperating with the elders,
not forming cliques in the congregation,

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:23.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
these are all ways that we demonstrate

00:15:23.505 --> 00:15:26.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we follow the spirit’s lead.

00:15:27.576 --> 00:15:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 4:30 again, it says:

00:15:30.379 --> 00:15:34.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, do not be grieving God’s holy spirit,

00:15:34.583 --> 00:15:36.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with which you have been sealed

00:15:36.318 --> 00:15:39.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a day of releasing by ransom.”

00:15:39.154 --> 00:15:40.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s review.

00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We invite our waiters to join us.

00:15:43.993 --> 00:15:46.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have some props
they’re going to set up for us.

00:15:47.363 --> 00:15:48.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is

00:15:48.631 --> 00:15:51.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brett Cox and Michael Banks.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
In case you’re wondering,
they are not real Bethel waiters.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:59.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, they both work as secretaries
in the office of the Teaching Committee,

00:15:59.508 --> 00:16:02.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we’ve impressed them into service today.

00:16:03.012 --> 00:16:04.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brett and Michael.

00:16:07.016 --> 00:16:11.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
In case you were thinking it,
this is not a Watchtower cooking show.

00:16:11.854 --> 00:16:14.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we’ve prepared
a visual review of the material

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:17.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
we just discussed
about “grieving God’s holy spirit.”

00:16:19.595 --> 00:16:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have three beautiful loaves of bread here.

00:16:23.298 --> 00:16:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is garlic powder.

00:16:29.805 --> 00:16:33.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is basic old mud.

00:16:36.578 --> 00:16:38.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
This represents poison,

00:16:40.315 --> 00:16:42.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have a trash can.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the bread represents

00:16:46.755 --> 00:16:50.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
the relationship
that three people have with Jehovah.

00:16:51.093 --> 00:16:53.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Samuel 16:7 says

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:55.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “mere man sees

00:16:55.264 --> 00:16:57.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what appears to the eyes,

00:16:57.499 --> 00:17:00.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah sees into the heart.”

00:17:00.536 --> 00:17:02.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah sees

00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:06.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we are on the inside,

00:17:06.141 --> 00:17:08.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knows exactly

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:13.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
the status of our relationship with him.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:17.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as you can see,
all three loaves are pure, clean,

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
and undefiled in any way.

00:17:19.321 --> 00:17:21.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
This represents the clean relationship

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adam originally had with Jehovah

00:17:24.059 --> 00:17:26.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that all humans were intended to enjoy.

00:17:27.196 --> 00:17:28.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sin of Adam

00:17:31.033 --> 00:17:35.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
tainted our pure relationship with Jehovah.

00:17:36.538 --> 00:17:39.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
The garlic powder represents

00:17:39.942 --> 00:17:42.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
inherited sin and imperfection

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:45.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was passed on to all humans.

00:17:47.716 --> 00:17:51.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the garlic powder is not poison.

00:17:52.454 --> 00:17:56.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
The bread is still edible,
but it’s no longer pure.

00:17:56.992 --> 00:18:01.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a similar way,
though we’re tainted with sin,

00:18:01.163 --> 00:18:05.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not discard imperfect humans.

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:07.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
He still allows us
to have a relationship with him

00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:09.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on Jesus’ sacrifice.

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:12.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s review our material.

00:18:12.608 --> 00:18:15.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, sinning against the spirit.

00:18:17.079 --> 00:18:20.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I’m holding represents poison,

00:18:20.916 --> 00:18:24.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when the Pharisees denied
an outright manifestation of the holy spirit,

00:18:24.953 --> 00:18:27.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was as if they rejected Jehovah himself.

00:18:27.656 --> 00:18:29.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their actions

00:18:29.658 --> 00:18:34.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
were like pouring poison on the bread.

00:18:35.531 --> 00:18:38.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
It totally saturates the bread.

00:18:40.636 --> 00:18:42.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
This bread is ruined.

00:18:44.006 --> 00:18:47.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah determines
that someone has sinned against the spirit,

00:18:47.409 --> 00:18:49.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s no forgiveness possible.

00:18:49.878 --> 00:18:53.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
That one’s relationship with Jehovah
has been forever ruined.

00:18:56.685 --> 00:18:58.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah discards the person

00:18:58.987 --> 00:19:00.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
like a piece of garbage,

00:19:00.989 --> 00:19:04.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like Judas, “the son of destruction.”

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, second, let’s review
what serious or gross sin

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:09.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
generally refers to.

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:14.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we drop the bread into the mud,

00:19:14.336 --> 00:19:16.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
it becomes soiled.

00:19:16.672 --> 00:19:19.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serious sin is
when we break one of Jehovah’s moral laws,

00:19:19.775 --> 00:19:22.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the sins listed at 1 Corinthians 6:10.

00:19:23.512 --> 00:19:28.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serious sin muddies or soils
our relationship with Jehovah.

00:19:28.250 --> 00:19:32.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our first reaction might be,
this bread is ruined too,

00:19:32.354 --> 00:19:34.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we reach for the trash can again.

00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:39.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s true that serious sin
has sullied our relationship with Jehovah,

00:19:39.528 --> 00:19:43.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
but is serious sin the same
as sinning against the spirit,

00:19:43.031 --> 00:19:44.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
fit only for the trash can?

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you see, a person
can be repentant over a serious sin.

00:19:49.538 --> 00:19:51.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
He ceases the wrong conduct,

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:54.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
prays for forgiveness,
talks to the elders,

00:19:54.543 --> 00:19:57.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and follows Jehovah’s procedure
to become clean again.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, the mud is cut away,

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:08.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to Jehovah

00:20:11.426 --> 00:20:16.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
that serious sin of the past is forever gone.

00:20:16.999 --> 00:20:19.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t think about it again.

00:20:19.902 --> 00:20:21.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s left?

00:20:22.638 --> 00:20:25.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unsoiled garlic bread.

00:20:25.607 --> 00:20:30.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
We still have imperfection,
we’re tainted with that,

00:20:30.078 --> 00:20:32.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we again have a good relationship
with Jehovah.

00:20:33.782 --> 00:20:36.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, third,
how can we illustrate grieving the spirit?

00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:42.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember grieving the spirit is
drifting away from the lead of the spirit.

00:20:42.658 --> 00:20:46.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
You recall,
Ephesians 4:25-29 listed such things

00:20:46.128 --> 00:20:51.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
as deceitfulness, continued anger,
inappropriate speech.

00:20:52.567 --> 00:20:55.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
So grieving the spirit is not like

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:58.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
the poison of sinning against the spirit,

00:20:58.206 --> 00:21:01.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s not necessarily like
the mud of serious sin.

00:21:02.878 --> 00:21:06.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grieving the spirit might be likened to

00:21:08.684 --> 00:21:12.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting on more layers of garlic powder.

00:21:14.323 --> 00:21:17.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
This does not immediately damage
our relationship with Jehovah,

00:21:17.726 --> 00:21:19.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
but if we continue to veer away

00:21:19.761 --> 00:21:23.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the leading of God’s spirit,
we sadden him.

00:21:23.665 --> 00:21:26.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
We grieve the spirit.

00:21:28.303 --> 00:21:29.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what should we do?

00:21:30.973 --> 00:21:33.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stop our inappropriate behavior

00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:35.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pray for forgiveness.

00:21:36.445 --> 00:21:40.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we must shake off

00:21:40.649 --> 00:21:43.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
any remnants of such traits from our person.

00:21:44.619 --> 00:21:47.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though we’re still imperfect,

00:21:47.856 --> 00:21:51.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can again have
a wholesome relationship with Jehovah.
