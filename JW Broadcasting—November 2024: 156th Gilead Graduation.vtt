Welcome to JW Broadcasting®

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:07.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
for November 2024.

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
On September 14, 2024,

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:33.930 line:10% position:50% align:center
the 156th class of Gilead graduated.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.681 line:10% position:50% align:center
This is the culmination

00:00:35.681 --> 00:00:38.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
of five months of intensive study

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:41.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual refinement.

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:44.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind words of encouragement

00:00:44.565 --> 00:00:47.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
lie in store in this graduation?

00:00:48.444 --> 00:00:51.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we watch this portion of the program,

00:00:51.614 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for something
that you can apply in your life.

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:58.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
For our introductory chairman comments,

00:00:58.246 --> 00:01:00.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
we thought we’d talk
for just a couple of moments

00:01:00.415 --> 00:01:04.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what a privilege it is
to be used by Jehovah.

00:01:05.503 --> 00:01:06.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we were kids,

00:01:06.838 --> 00:01:09.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes we played games
in the schoolyard, didn’t we?

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:11.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe if it was a team sport,

00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:13.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes there would be
two captains selected,

00:01:13.928 --> 00:01:17.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the captains would choose
from among the kids playing the game

00:01:17.599 --> 00:01:19.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you know?—
who was going to be on their team.

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:21.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what would happen?

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would pick the best players first
—the most skilled, the most talented.

00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:27.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our goal was just not to be picked last.

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:31.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s OK.

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:34.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the point of the illustration is

00:01:34.157 --> 00:01:37.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
that each captain had in his mind
what he valued

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:40.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
among those potential players,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then that guided his choices.

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah has a work to do,

00:01:46.127 --> 00:01:49.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he uses us humans to do
an important part of it.

00:01:49.798 --> 00:01:52.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whom will Jehovah choose
to use in his service?

00:01:52.968 --> 00:01:54.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does he value?

00:01:54.886 --> 00:01:59.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of people is Jehovah
pleased to use to do his work?

00:02:00.934 --> 00:02:02.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, on that point,

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:05.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
let me make one clarification
—a little context.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we talk about (in these comments)
being used by Jehovah,

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not specifically
talking about privileges,

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
because privileges come and go
and very often it’s timing

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
and availability and need
that play a big part.

00:02:17.993 --> 00:02:21.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, rather,
we’re talking about being the kind of people

00:02:21.246 --> 00:02:24.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cultivate the spiritual qualities

00:02:24.791 --> 00:02:27.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah values and then, therefore,

00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:30.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
are useful to him in whatever assignment

00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:33.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
or work he has to do at a given time.

00:02:34.593 --> 00:02:38.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, on that point,
this summer most of us enjoyed watching 

00:02:38.055 --> 00:02:40.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus: Episode 1.</i>

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:43.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the events captured in that episode

00:02:43.268 --> 00:02:45.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
highlight for us in a special way

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:48.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah values in humans

00:02:48.774 --> 00:02:51.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
and therefore whom he is pleased to use.

00:02:51.568 --> 00:02:55.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, whom would Jehovah use

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be the earthly mother
of his only-begotten Son?

00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would it be someone,
maybe, from a prominent family?

00:03:03.414 --> 00:03:06.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe someone respected in the community?

00:03:06.542 --> 00:03:10.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe someone wealthy so that his Son
would be sure to be cared for?

00:03:10.546 --> 00:03:14.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe someone
from the capital city of Jerusalem?

00:03:14.592 --> 00:03:16.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that might be OK.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does the Bible say?

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:20.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to the book of Luke chapter 1,

00:03:24.185 --> 00:03:28.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read together Luke 1:26, 27:

00:03:31.234 --> 00:03:33.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In her sixth month, the angel Gabriel

00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:38.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was sent from God
to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,

00:03:38.407 --> 00:03:40.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to a virgin promised in marriage

00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:43.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to a man named Joseph of David’s house,

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the name of the virgin was Mary.”

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we remember from this summer’s video

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:54.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this is whom Jehovah chose
—Mary, a humble young woman

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:59.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
of little means materially
from an insignificant city called Nazareth.

00:04:01.222 --> 00:04:02.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why?

00:04:02.307 --> 00:04:04.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did Jehovah choose Mary?

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:05.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
What mattered most to him?

00:04:05.393 --> 00:04:09.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he see in Mary
that assured him she was the right choice?

00:04:10.773 --> 00:04:14.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in Mary,
Jehovah saw a deeply spiritual,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
humble, obedient young woman.

00:04:17.822 --> 00:04:20.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we get to know Mary
in the Bible account,

00:04:20.658 --> 00:04:25.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
it becomes very clear why Jehovah chose
her for this important assignment.

00:04:25.413 --> 00:04:29.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, as soon as she understood
from the angel Gabriel

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
what the assignment was
that Jehovah had in mind for her

00:04:33.338 --> 00:04:36.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this assignment
that would require a miracle,

00:04:36.257 --> 00:04:39.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
this assignment
that would change her life forever—

00:04:39.427 --> 00:04:41.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was her reaction?

00:04:41.846 --> 00:04:42.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 38:

00:04:44.516 --> 00:04:47.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Mary said: ‘Look!

00:04:47.227 --> 00:04:49.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Jehovah’s slave girl!

00:04:49.437 --> 00:04:52.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
May it happen to me
according to your declaration.’”

00:04:54.192 --> 00:04:55.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there she is.

00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:57.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember that moment in the video

00:04:57.654 --> 00:05:01.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
—humble obedience and submission
to Jehovah’s will.

00:05:01.032 --> 00:05:02.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Mary have questions?

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:03.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Undoubtedly.

00:05:03.535 --> 00:05:06.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she didn’t need to know
all the answers to those questions.

00:05:06.246 --> 00:05:09.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
All she needed to know was that the request
was coming from Jehovah.

00:05:09.833 --> 00:05:11.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so the answer was yes

00:05:11.835 --> 00:05:15.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
—humble obedience and submission
to Jehovah’s will.

00:05:16.673 --> 00:05:19.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we further see what Jehovah saw in Mary

00:05:19.843 --> 00:05:24.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we hear her words
that she spoke at Luke 1:46-55.

00:05:24.097 --> 00:05:26.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t read that, but we remember this

00:05:26.934 --> 00:05:28.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
little speech that she gave there.

00:05:28.477 --> 00:05:30.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s the moment from the video

00:05:30.562 --> 00:05:33.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
with these two women
with very unique circumstances

00:05:33.607 --> 00:05:37.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they were reflecting
on what Jehovah was doing in their case.

00:05:37.444 --> 00:05:41.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Mary, as we know, in these few verses,

00:05:41.031 --> 00:05:44.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes copious references
to passages in the Hebrew Scriptures.

00:05:44.827 --> 00:05:47.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she shows herself
to be one who loved God’s Word,

00:05:47.955 --> 00:05:51.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
who treasured it, who read it, studied it,
and meditated on it.

00:05:51.625 --> 00:05:54.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in her situation, in reading God’s Word,

00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:56.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
she felt a connection to Hannah

00:05:56.338 --> 00:05:58.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she felt a connection to the psalmist.

00:05:58.382 --> 00:06:02.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these are the things
that motivated and formed her words.

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:07.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah used humble,
spiritual, obedient Mary

00:06:07.558 --> 00:06:09.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be the earthly mother of his Son.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, another example: When the time came

00:06:13.606 --> 00:06:16.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
to announce the birth of his Son,

00:06:16.525 --> 00:06:18.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom did Jehovah choose to tell?

00:06:18.527 --> 00:06:21.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would it be
the prominent officials in Bethlehem?

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would it be the leaders of the Sanhedrin?
maybe the high priest? maybe Herod?

00:06:25.576 --> 00:06:27.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does the Bible say?

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn to Luke 2:8, 9

00:06:33.459 --> 00:06:37.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke 2:8: 
“There were also in the same region

00:06:37.004 --> 00:06:39.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“shepherds living out of doors

00:06:39.423 --> 00:06:42.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and keeping watch in the night
over their flocks.

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:44.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Suddenly Jehovah’s angel stood before them,

00:06:44.637 --> 00:06:49.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s glory gleamed around them
 and they became very fearful.”

00:06:49.183 --> 00:06:50.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what was the announcement?

00:06:50.268 --> 00:06:54.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 11: “For today there was born to you
in David’s city a savior,

00:06:54.939 --> 00:06:57.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is Christ the Lord.”

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah appeared
to these humble shepherds

00:07:01.571 --> 00:07:06.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
—men who would treasure
this privilege to see the infant, God’s Son,

00:07:06.367 --> 00:07:09.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
men whose reaction
would reassure Joseph and Mary

00:07:09.704 --> 00:07:12.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how special this child was

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:15.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course, would bring
praise and glory to Jehovah’s name.

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:19.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, soon the time came for Mary and Joseph

00:07:19.172 --> 00:07:22.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go to the temple
for the purification offering.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:25.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so whom would Jehovah use
to welcome his Son

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:29.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even to acknowledge Jesus’ future role
as the Messiah?

00:07:29.974 --> 00:07:32.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, perhaps Mary thought
that the officiating priests

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:36.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
might make some comment
about what Jesus’ future role would be.

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:40.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whom did Jehovah choose to do this?

00:07:40.235 --> 00:07:42.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
The faithful man Simeon.

00:07:43.947 --> 00:07:47.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simeon had been faithful to Jehovah
his whole life.

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:49.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah appreciated and loved him

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:51.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his faithful course
and had promised Simeon

00:07:51.955 --> 00:07:55.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would have this privilege
to see the Christ before he died.

00:07:57.419 --> 00:07:59.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, whom would Jehovah

00:07:59.671 --> 00:08:03.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
use to further emphasize the importance
of this infant child

00:08:03.008 --> 00:08:06.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to proclaim it
to all those in the temple area?

00:08:07.846 --> 00:08:12.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithful Anna, who was always present
and “never missing from the temple.”

00:08:12.559 --> 00:08:15.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was steadfast in her theocratic routine

00:08:15.062 --> 00:08:18.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in her appreciation for pure worship.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:21.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could count on her
to be present that day

00:08:21.568 --> 00:08:26.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Joseph and Mary
would arrive with Jesus Christ.

00:08:27.908 --> 00:08:30.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thinking about those whom Jehovah used

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:34.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry out his will in these various ways
in connection with his Son

00:08:34.915 --> 00:08:39.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thinking about what a privilege it is
to be used for anything in Jehovah’s service

00:08:39.128 --> 00:08:42.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
leads us to ask the question,
“Well, how can I be the kind of person

00:08:42.923 --> 00:08:46.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom Jehovah would be pleased to use?”

00:08:47.052 --> 00:08:49.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as these examples teach us,

00:08:49.013 --> 00:08:53.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s by focusing
on what matters most to Jehovah.

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is it?
Is it prominence?

00:08:54.518 --> 00:08:55.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it fame?
Is it wealth?

00:08:55.686 --> 00:08:57.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it personality?
No.

00:08:57.605 --> 00:08:59.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s spirituality, isn’t it?

00:08:59.899 --> 00:09:02.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we become useful to Jehovah
when we cultivate 

00:09:02.943 --> 00:09:06.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
these beautiful spiritual qualities
that Jehovah appreciates.

00:09:06.572 --> 00:09:09.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many of them are the same ones that Mary

00:09:09.158 --> 00:09:12.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the shepherds
and Simeon and Anna showed,

00:09:12.995 --> 00:09:17.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as deep spirituality, humility,
and obedience (like Mary);

00:09:17.333 --> 00:09:21.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
appreciation for spiritual things
(like those humble shepherds);

00:09:21.337 --> 00:09:24.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
a faithful, waiting attitude (like Simeon);

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:28.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and constancy in your theocratic routine
(like Anna).

00:09:29.428 --> 00:09:32.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sees such sincere efforts

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:35.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beautiful spiritual qualities,
and he values them.

00:09:35.601 --> 00:09:38.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the qualities that matter to Jehovah.

00:09:38.062 --> 00:09:40.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is substance that matters to Jehovah,

00:09:40.439 --> 00:09:43.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘not what appears to the eyes
but what is in the heart.’

00:09:44.861 --> 00:09:47.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as you go to your assignments now,

00:09:47.447 --> 00:09:51.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember these fine examples
of men and women who pleased Jehovah,

00:09:51.284 --> 00:09:54.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because they were impressive
by the world’s standards,

00:09:54.203 --> 00:09:58.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because they developed qualities
that Jehovah appreciated

00:09:58.124 --> 00:10:01.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a life course
of humble, loyal service to him.

00:10:01.169 --> 00:10:03.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are ones whom Jehovah appreciated,

00:10:03.254 --> 00:10:06.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
ones whom Jehovah could use to do his will.

00:10:06.591 --> 00:10:10.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
And always treasure the privilege
of being used by Jehovah.

00:10:12.013 --> 00:10:14.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that the rest of the program

00:10:14.349 --> 00:10:16.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to be the kind of people

00:10:16.267 --> 00:10:20.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom Jehovah loves, approves of,
and is pleased to use in his service.

00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next part of the program
is <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:10:32.033 --> 00:10:34.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the operative word is “story,” isn’t it?

00:10:34.744 --> 00:10:36.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because each one of Jehovah’s servants

00:10:36.788 --> 00:10:40.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a story and has a journey with Jehovah,

00:10:40.417 --> 00:10:43.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we always enjoy hearing
about some of the stories

00:10:43.587 --> 00:10:45.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our Gilead students.

00:10:45.589 --> 00:10:48.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in this episode of <i>The Inside Story,</i>

00:10:48.174 --> 00:10:50.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will have interviews
spanning four different countries

00:10:50.719 --> 00:10:54.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also a brief tour
of a notable Bible land.

00:10:54.431 --> 00:10:56.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please enjoy <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:11:25.671 --> 00:11:29.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to this edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:11:29.842 --> 00:11:32.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today we will get to know 6

00:11:32.302 --> 00:11:34.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 48 students

00:11:34.346 --> 00:11:37.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
representing the 156th class of Gilead.

00:11:39.059 --> 00:11:40.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
To my left, I have

00:11:40.602 --> 00:11:45.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sister Hanta Razafimandimby
from Madagascar.

00:11:45.149 --> 00:11:50.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next to Hanta is Adalia and Mannie Luna
from the United States.

00:11:50.112 --> 00:11:51.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
To my far right

00:11:51.238 --> 00:11:55.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Shimon and Yoshi Hori from Japan.

00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:57.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
And last but not least,

00:11:57.077 --> 00:12:00.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have brother Marco Caproni from Italy.

00:12:00.956 --> 00:12:03.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, to all six of you,

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we look forward to hearing
what you have to share with us today.

00:12:07.922 --> 00:12:11.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we start by first hearing

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
how long you’ve been
in your respective Bethels

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what your current assignments are.

00:12:17.014 --> 00:12:18.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why don’t we start with you, Hanta?

00:12:19.558 --> 00:12:22.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been serving at the Madagascar Bethel

00:12:22.436 --> 00:12:24.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 24 years,

00:12:24.522 --> 00:12:28.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
and currently I’m serving
on one of the translation teams there.

00:12:29.527 --> 00:12:31.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.
Adalia?

00:12:31.529 --> 00:12:33.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are currently serving
in the United States branch,

00:12:33.531 --> 00:12:37.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the Wallkill complex for about 13 years.

00:12:37.368 --> 00:12:39.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
And my assignment
is actually a split assignment

00:12:39.745 --> 00:12:42.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
between Food Service
and the Health Care Department.

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Very good.
Mannie?

00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:46.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I, along with Adalia, have been serving

00:12:46.627 --> 00:12:49.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the United States branch
for about 13 years,

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:51.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I currently work
with the Service Department.

00:12:51.382 --> 00:12:52.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very good.

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:54.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s switch over to you, Shimon, please.

00:12:55.511 --> 00:12:56.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have been

00:12:56.888 --> 00:12:59.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Japan branch for 16 years,

00:12:59.682 --> 00:13:03.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my assignment
is the Computer Department.

00:13:03.102 --> 00:13:05.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Very good.
And Yoshi?

00:13:05.813 --> 00:13:07.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ve been in the Japan branch

00:13:07.398 --> 00:13:10.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
for six years,
and now I serve in the Legal Department.

00:13:10.735 --> 00:13:13.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK. Very good.
And, please, Marco.

00:13:13.404 --> 00:13:15.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been serving in the Italy branch in Rome

00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:20.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 18 years and, actually, I’m serving
in the Public Information Department.

00:13:20.787 --> 00:13:21.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.

00:13:21.955 --> 00:13:24.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now that we’ve had a chance

00:13:24.124 --> 00:13:27.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
to learn a little bit about you,
let’s start off with Shimon.

00:13:28.128 --> 00:13:28.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shimon, . . .

00:13:28.962 --> 00:13:29.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:13:29.754 --> 00:13:33.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . I understand that you were baptized
at ten years of age.

00:13:33.842 --> 00:13:34.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:13:34.801 --> 00:13:37.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us about what your father did

00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:40.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help you make spiritual progress
at such a young age?

00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:45.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, my father was very creative.

00:13:45.228 --> 00:13:46.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.
Explain.

00:13:47.814 --> 00:13:50.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, as a family,

00:13:50.942 --> 00:13:53.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoyed playing a game

00:13:53.153 --> 00:13:55.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
named Bible golf.

00:13:55.989 --> 00:13:57.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:02.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a simple game.

00:14:02.829 --> 00:14:04.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the winner is

00:14:04.081 --> 00:14:07.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
whoever can open to a specific Bible verse

00:14:07.292 --> 00:14:09.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the fewest attempts.

00:14:09.336 --> 00:14:14.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if I can open the verse
in the first attempt, it’s a hole in one.

00:14:14.216 --> 00:14:15.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right.

00:14:15.425 --> 00:14:19.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
And three attempts, it’s a birdie

00:14:20.472 --> 00:14:22.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
—something like this.

00:14:22.307 --> 00:14:25.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
And another game I can still remember is

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:28.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jehovah’s Witnesses game of life,

00:14:28.605 --> 00:14:33.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is a board game with two circles on it.

00:14:33.026 --> 00:14:35.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can start from the outside circle,

00:14:35.612 --> 00:14:38.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
which represents non-Witness life.

00:14:38.449 --> 00:14:40.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Non-Witness life—OK.

00:14:40.576 --> 00:14:42.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you progress properly

00:14:42.828 --> 00:14:47.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Bible study and dedication,
assembly or convention—

00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:50.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you can enter into the inner circle,

00:14:50.419 --> 00:14:52.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
which represents the Witness life.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:53.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aha.

00:14:53.797 --> 00:14:57.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is a time limit called Armageddon.

00:14:59.803 --> 00:15:03.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the alarm goes off,

00:15:03.641 --> 00:15:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can enter into Paradise 
if you are in the inner circle.

00:15:07.770 --> 00:15:09.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s so much fun

00:15:09.772 --> 00:15:12.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there are
also stumbling blocks along the way.

00:15:12.942 --> 00:15:14.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:15:14.193 --> 00:15:16.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
And your father came up with this game?

00:15:16.445 --> 00:15:17.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:15:17.196 --> 00:15:17.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:15:17.905 --> 00:15:20.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, he was very creative.

00:15:20.074 --> 00:15:21.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he do anything else to help you?

00:15:21.784 --> 00:15:23.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well,

00:15:23.035 --> 00:15:25.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the <i>Knowledge </i> book came out,

00:15:25.204 --> 00:15:27.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
he asked me and my sister

00:15:27.915 --> 00:15:31.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we wanted
to get baptized within six months.

00:15:31.002 --> 00:15:32.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we said yes.

00:15:32.378 --> 00:15:33.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
From then on,

00:15:33.838 --> 00:15:37.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
each morning he would leave the house,

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:41.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
knock on the door,
introduce himself as Brother Hori,

00:15:41.470 --> 00:15:44.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conduct a Bible study with us.

00:15:44.474 --> 00:15:47.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we had to serve tea for him.

00:15:51.522 --> 00:15:54.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I understand he wanted to teach us

00:15:54.317 --> 00:15:57.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a Bible study
is a serious thing in our life.

00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:03.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s unique, but I was able
to get baptized within a year.

00:16:03.117 --> 00:16:07.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously it worked
because here you are with us today.

00:16:07.997 --> 00:16:10.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, once you were baptized,

00:16:10.625 --> 00:16:14.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
was it always smooth sailing for you, Shimon?

00:16:14.003 --> 00:16:17.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly, no, not always.

00:16:17.173 --> 00:16:20.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I grew older, I started struggling

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:24.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I wanted to be exemplary
in the congregation

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:28.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I liked computers very much,
so I wanted to be

00:16:28.226 --> 00:16:31.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
an engineer in an IT company.

00:16:31.604 --> 00:16:33.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mhm.
Big dreams, huh?

00:16:33.148 --> 00:16:33.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:16:33.606 --> 00:16:34.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:16:36.026 --> 00:16:40.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
But eventually, the Timothy drama came out.

00:16:40.322 --> 00:16:43.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in that drama, the apostle Paul

00:16:43.617 --> 00:16:47.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
encouraged Timothy not to use his skill

00:16:47.203 --> 00:16:49.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Satan’s world but for Jehovah.

00:16:50.916 --> 00:16:54.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the turning point for me.

00:16:54.252 --> 00:16:56.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of pursuing secular work,

00:16:56.796 --> 00:17:00.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started pioneering,
and then I came to love it.

00:17:00.509 --> 00:17:02.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, wise choice.

00:17:02.052 --> 00:17:04.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk to your wife, Yoshi,
for just a moment.

00:17:04.805 --> 00:17:08.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Yoshi, you were born in Japan.

00:17:08.308 --> 00:17:11.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I understand that you and your family
moved around a bit.

00:17:11.853 --> 00:17:13.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us a little bit about that?

00:17:13.939 --> 00:17:14.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:17:14.564 --> 00:17:17.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my father
(he wasn’t a Witness at the time),

00:17:17.484 --> 00:17:21.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
his work necessitated
that we move around quite a bit.

00:17:21.113 --> 00:17:25.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I remember I was five
when we were living in Osaka, in Japan.

00:17:26.702 --> 00:17:30.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we moved to London, in Britain.

00:17:31.415 --> 00:17:33.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were there for four years,

00:17:33.292 --> 00:17:36.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then after that,
we all moved to Scotland.

00:17:36.378 --> 00:17:39.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I lived in Glasgow for five years.

00:17:39.673 --> 00:17:42.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, we all moved back to Tokyo.

00:17:44.136 --> 00:17:48.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later, when I was an adult,
I moved on my own

00:17:48.599 --> 00:17:51.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve where the need was great
in Tanzania.

00:17:51.894 --> 00:17:54.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stayed there for six years,
and after that, I moved back.

00:17:54.563 --> 00:17:55.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we’re here.

00:17:55.814 --> 00:17:58.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re happy to have you.

00:17:58.525 --> 00:18:00.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, you’ve gotten to live in some

00:18:00.486 --> 00:18:03.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
pretty fascinating places over those years.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you learn about yourself

00:18:07.409 --> 00:18:10.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
and culture from living in those places?

00:18:11.539 --> 00:18:14.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know, when I was young,

00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:17.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
I honestly didn’t really appreciate it.

00:18:17.336 --> 00:18:19.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now that I’ve grown older,

00:18:19.171 --> 00:18:22.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel that it’s taught me to understand

00:18:22.341 --> 00:18:24.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there are so many different ways

00:18:24.927 --> 00:18:27.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
of looking at something

00:18:27.138 --> 00:18:29.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so many different ways
of doing something.

00:18:29.682 --> 00:18:32.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, actually,
all of them are really, really good.

00:18:33.436 --> 00:18:35.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a blessing to have so many

00:18:35.688 --> 00:18:37.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
different personalities with us.

00:18:37.899 --> 00:18:41.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just love working with this
variety of brothers and sisters now.

00:18:41.777 --> 00:18:44.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously, looking back on it,
you learned quite a bit.

00:18:44.614 --> 00:18:46.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing that.

00:18:46.532 --> 00:18:49.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s switch over to you now, Hanta.

00:18:49.744 --> 00:18:52.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I understand that you were not raised

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:54.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:18:54.999 --> 00:18:58.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you tell us a little bit
about your background, please?

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was raised in a religious family.

00:19:02.382 --> 00:19:06.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
We used to go to a Protestant church
every week,

00:19:06.010 --> 00:19:09.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my siblings and I
even attended Sunday school for a while.

00:19:10.598 --> 00:19:11.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:19:11.641 --> 00:19:13.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, although your father

00:19:13.893 --> 00:19:16.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
never became
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:19:16.688 --> 00:19:20.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
how was he instrumental
in leading you to the truth?

00:19:20.733 --> 00:19:23.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father welcomed

00:19:23.778 --> 00:19:27.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
anyone who knocked at our door
in the name of religion.

00:19:28.533 --> 00:19:31.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah’s Witnesses
were among these people.

00:19:32.787 --> 00:19:34.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time they stopped by,

00:19:34.664 --> 00:19:39.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would leave magazines, books, brochures.

00:19:39.210 --> 00:19:43.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what I really appreciated
in those publications

00:19:43.798 --> 00:19:46.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
is God’s promise of a paradise earth.

00:19:47.719 --> 00:19:51.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really liked the pictures of Paradise
in those publications,

00:19:51.556 --> 00:19:55.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
so much so that my siblings and I

00:19:55.018 --> 00:19:57.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
would trace those pictures,

00:19:57.771 --> 00:20:00.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
paint them, and hang them on the wall.

00:20:00.315 --> 00:20:03.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your parents were OK
with you redecorating like this?

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:12.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, our father bought
the <i>Live Forever</i>  book from the Witnesses.

00:20:12.661 --> 00:20:15.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was then
that a Bible study was started.

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:19.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the first meeting I attended,

00:20:19.459 --> 00:20:23.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so impressed
by the warm welcome I received

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:27.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I said to myself,
‘I want to belong to these people.’

00:20:27.467 --> 00:20:28.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah.

00:20:29.094 --> 00:20:32.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, all my siblings and I,

00:20:32.598 --> 00:20:35.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with our mother, embraced the truth.

00:20:35.684 --> 00:20:37.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, one of my brothers

00:20:37.895 --> 00:20:40.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I got baptized together on the same day.

00:20:40.731 --> 00:20:42.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, that must have been
really special for you.

00:20:42.858 --> 00:20:44.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing that with us, Hanta.

00:20:44.651 --> 00:20:46.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll come back to you.

00:20:46.487 --> 00:20:48.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go over to Adalia now.

00:20:48.614 --> 00:20:51.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Adalia, you were born,

00:20:51.241 --> 00:20:54.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
raised, and spent your early teenage years

00:20:54.244 --> 00:20:56.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Brooklyn, New York.

00:20:56.330 --> 00:21:00.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
How was that for you,
growing up around world headquarters?

00:21:00.417 --> 00:21:03.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a beautiful, positive experience.

00:21:03.003 --> 00:21:05.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Getting to see self-sacrificing
brothers and sisters

00:21:05.839 --> 00:21:08.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
give all they could to Jehovah

00:21:08.425 --> 00:21:11.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to see
how happy and excited they were

00:21:11.428 --> 00:21:14.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their service was a beautiful example.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
This helped instill in me goals

00:21:16.392 --> 00:21:18.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really plant seeds

00:21:18.477 --> 00:21:21.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put in me the desire
to want to live that same kind of life.

00:21:21.522 --> 00:21:23.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, we could understand that.

00:21:23.524 --> 00:21:28.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, eventually,
you and your family moved to Florida.

00:21:29.113 --> 00:21:30.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where you met Mannie.

00:21:30.990 --> 00:21:33.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
You two were eventually married.

00:21:33.034 --> 00:21:35.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should have stayed in Brooklyn, see?

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you met Mannie, and you two were married.

00:21:40.416 --> 00:21:41.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
What next?

00:21:41.542 --> 00:21:43.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
So shortly after we got married,

00:21:43.753 --> 00:21:46.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
before our first year anniversary,
we started regular pioneering.

00:21:47.465 --> 00:21:50.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then after that, we were invited
to serve where the need is great

00:21:50.510 --> 00:21:53.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very rural part of Florida

00:21:53.054 --> 00:21:55.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
—kind of the orange grove region.

00:21:55.264 --> 00:21:57.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very different to where we both grew up.

00:21:57.475 --> 00:21:59.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were both used to the city life.

00:21:59.811 --> 00:22:04.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we went to that area
and immersed ourselves in the congregation

00:22:04.399 --> 00:22:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
—beautiful, young congregation—
which worked hard in the ministry.

00:22:08.778 --> 00:22:11.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we grew to really love those brothers.

00:22:11.698 --> 00:22:15.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah blessed the hard work
that was being done in that area.

00:22:15.618 --> 00:22:16.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long were you there?

00:22:16.911 --> 00:22:18.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were there for ten years.

00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:22.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
And during that time period,
that one congregation that we were in

00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:23.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually turned into five congregations.

00:22:23.793 --> 00:22:24.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:22:24.502 --> 00:22:27.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Five congregations over ten years, excellent!

00:22:27.255 --> 00:22:29.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Mannie, clearly 

00:22:29.841 --> 00:22:33.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
you and Adalia
—you were busy in Jehovah’s service.

00:22:33.553 --> 00:22:38.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was that the end of the extent
of your pursuing theocratic goals?

00:22:38.516 --> 00:22:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not at all.

00:22:39.768 --> 00:22:42.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adalia and I made an effort
to live a simple life

00:22:42.687 --> 00:22:46.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could give all we could
to Jehovah without any distractions,

00:22:46.608 --> 00:22:48.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that allowed us to pioneer.

00:22:48.652 --> 00:22:52.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also allowed us to move to that area
where there was a greater need.

00:22:53.114 --> 00:22:55.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to further make ourselves available,

00:22:55.450 --> 00:22:59.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
we applied to Bethel several times.

00:22:59.496 --> 00:23:01.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, that’s a little nebulous

00:23:01.623 --> 00:23:03.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
—several times.

00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
How many times did you apply to Bethel?

00:23:06.878 --> 00:23:09.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about only 12 times.

00:23:11.842 --> 00:23:13.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twelve times?

00:23:13.593 --> 00:23:15.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
What part of no did you not understand?

00:23:17.222 --> 00:23:18.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perseverance.

00:23:18.348 --> 00:23:20.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please tell us
what caused you to keep applying

00:23:20.934 --> 00:23:24.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you weren’t receiving
a response to come?

00:23:25.105 --> 00:23:29.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, as you can see,
certainly we were very persistent.

00:23:30.319 --> 00:23:32.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wanted to keep our options open
and allow Jehovah 

00:23:32.988 --> 00:23:35.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
to decide where we would serve.

00:23:35.032 --> 00:23:36.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know, when we look back at it,

00:23:36.575 --> 00:23:39.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
we realize that applying to Bethel
all those times

00:23:39.536 --> 00:23:43.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not getting accepted
was just simply because it wasn’t our time.

00:23:44.541 --> 00:23:46.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm, what do you mean by that,
wasn’t your time?

00:23:48.087 --> 00:23:50.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you see,
there we were in our assignment

00:23:50.547 --> 00:23:52.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
but wanting to be at Bethel.

00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:55.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knew we had a lot to learn,

00:23:55.219 --> 00:23:57.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he allowed that assignment

00:23:57.304 --> 00:24:00.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give us the training that we needed.

00:24:00.599 --> 00:24:03.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those 12 applications,

00:24:03.352 --> 00:24:05.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
or those 12 times that we applied,
taught us a lot.

00:24:05.729 --> 00:24:09.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
It taught us patience,
taught us to wait on Jehovah,

00:24:09.608 --> 00:24:11.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
taught us appreciation.

00:24:11.694 --> 00:24:14.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though we wanted
to make ourselves available

00:24:14.071 --> 00:24:17.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do more by means of Bethel service,

00:24:17.408 --> 00:24:20.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were a lot of lessons 
that we still needed to learn.

00:24:20.244 --> 00:24:22.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
We needed to learn to focus on, love,

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:25.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciate the privileges
we already had up to that point

00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:28.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to be able

00:24:28.419 --> 00:24:32.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
to fully appreciate
our future Bethel assignment.

00:24:32.423 --> 00:24:34.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a blessing it was being with those

00:24:34.675 --> 00:24:37.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers and sisters for those years

00:24:37.011 --> 00:24:38.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being able to witness that growth!

00:24:38.763 --> 00:24:40.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was amazing!

00:24:40.556 --> 00:24:42.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we fondly look back at it,

00:24:42.391 --> 00:24:46.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and these certainly are memories
that we truly treasure.

00:24:46.562 --> 00:24:49.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those are some valuable lessons
that you learned.

00:24:49.232 --> 00:24:51.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re glad that Jehovah
gave you that training.

00:24:51.484 --> 00:24:53.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re sure it will serve you well.

00:24:54.153 --> 00:24:56.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s shift over to you now, Marco.

00:24:57.490 --> 00:25:01.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you mind telling us a little bit
about your family background?

00:25:01.035 --> 00:25:02.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sure.

00:25:02.286 --> 00:25:05.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
So growing up, I was raised as a Catholic,

00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:07.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I used to go 

00:25:07.709 --> 00:25:09.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
every Sunday to the church.

00:25:10.837 --> 00:25:12.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:25:12.672 --> 00:25:15.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then when I was 17 years old,

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
my uncle began to study the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:25:19.387 --> 00:25:23.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And observing the big changes
that he made in his life for good

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how happy he became
made me really curious about the Bible.

00:25:28.104 --> 00:25:31.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a powerful book it is,

00:25:31.316 --> 00:25:33.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
to change life in such a way!

00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:36.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I accepted to study the Bible as well.

00:25:36.654 --> 00:25:40.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I was 19 years old, I got baptized.

00:25:40.992 --> 00:25:44.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later on,
I started to serve as a regular pioneer.

00:25:44.704 --> 00:25:48.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
I attended the Ministerial Training School,
or MTS.

00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:51.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yes, as I told you,
for the last 18 years,

00:25:51.586 --> 00:25:53.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve been serving at Bethel in Rome.

00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:55.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, excellent.

00:25:55.215 --> 00:25:58.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, during your time here at Gilead,

00:25:58.844 --> 00:26:01.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
it became clear that you have

00:26:01.096 --> 00:26:03.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
a real love for history, Marco.

00:26:08.937 --> 00:26:10.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all saw it.

00:26:10.605 --> 00:26:14.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was there anything
that was part of the Gilead curriculum

00:26:14.609 --> 00:26:17.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
that particularly caught your attention?

00:26:17.863 --> 00:26:21.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, here at Gilead
we have many artifacts on display.

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:25.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is something in particular
that caught my attention,

00:26:25.245 --> 00:26:28.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I brought it here to show you.

00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, really?

00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:31.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the Gilead Office
know that you have this?

00:26:32.294 --> 00:26:33.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will bring it back soon.

00:26:33.962 --> 00:26:35.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right.

00:26:35.422 --> 00:26:36.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we have?

00:26:36.465 --> 00:26:37.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a coin.

00:26:37.341 --> 00:26:39.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
Tell us about it.

00:26:39.134 --> 00:26:39.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:26:39.968 --> 00:26:41.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
This coin is an authentic coin

00:26:41.970 --> 00:26:46.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
minted by Emperor Nero in 66 C.E.

00:26:46.266 --> 00:26:49.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to celebrate a period of peace.

00:26:49.561 --> 00:26:53.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, if you look carefully on one side,

00:26:53.107 --> 00:26:54.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can see a door.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
Now, I can see that.

00:26:56.068 --> 00:26:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
But can you all see this?

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, OK.

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:02.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, wait a minute.
There it is; there it is.

00:27:02.658 --> 00:27:07.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this door is the door
of an ancient temple in Rome.

00:27:07.037 --> 00:27:11.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this door was kept closed
during a period of peace.

00:27:11.458 --> 00:27:14.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in fact,
Nero wanted to boast that he was capable

00:27:14.462 --> 00:27:17.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
of bringing peace to the empire.

00:27:17.214 --> 00:27:20.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this was 66 C.E.,

00:27:20.092 --> 00:27:22.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the prophecy of Jesus
about the destruction

00:27:22.511 --> 00:27:24.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jerusalem had to be fulfilled.

00:27:24.555 --> 00:27:25.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it is.

00:27:25.514 --> 00:27:29.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
a few months after minting this coin,

00:27:29.101 --> 00:27:31.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nero was forced

00:27:31.145 --> 00:27:34.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send a military army

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
down to Judea to settle

00:27:36.651 --> 00:27:39.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Jewish revolt with Cestius Gallus.

00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:42.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these facts, we know,
led to the destruction of Jerusalem

00:27:42.365 --> 00:27:45.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the temple in 70 C.E.

00:27:45.368 --> 00:27:47.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, you see, a coin like this

00:27:47.453 --> 00:27:49.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
can remind us of a precious lesson:

00:27:49.872 --> 00:27:53.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Bible prophecies are always fulfilled,

00:27:53.334 --> 00:27:56.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though the propaganda
of this world can say differently.

00:27:56.504 --> 00:27:59.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hmm.
Nice lesson.

00:27:59.298 --> 00:28:00.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see that you liked this story.

00:28:00.967 --> 00:28:03.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to know more
about Bible history and Rome?

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:04.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:28:04.721 --> 00:28:06.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:28:12.270 --> 00:28:14.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a short video to watch together.

00:28:14.814 --> 00:28:16.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see it.

00:28:18.526 --> 00:28:21.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Visiting some of the archaeological sites
of Italy

00:28:21.613 --> 00:28:25.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to imagine
what life was like for the early Christians.

00:28:25.825 --> 00:28:28.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to come with me
for a quick tour?

00:28:29.579 --> 00:28:31.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s begin here.

00:28:31.289 --> 00:28:35.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Located about ten kilometers,
or six miles, west of Naples

00:28:35.335 --> 00:28:39.172 line:10% position:50% align:center
was the ancient port city of Puteoli.

00:28:39.172 --> 00:28:42.050 line:10% position:50% align:center
Today, it is known as Pozzuoli.

00:28:42.050 --> 00:28:43.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
In about 59 C.E.,

00:28:43.468 --> 00:28:47.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul
arrived here by boat as a prisoner.

00:28:47.973 --> 00:28:52.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
From here, Paul would now begin
the long journey to Rome,

00:28:52.018 --> 00:28:54.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he would eventually stand

00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:56.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
before Caesar himself.

00:28:56.231 --> 00:28:59.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the most famous Roman highways

00:28:59.276 --> 00:29:01.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
is called the Appian Way.

00:29:01.319 --> 00:29:05.991 line:10% position:50% align:center
It averages 6 meters, or 20 feet, in width

00:29:05.991 --> 00:29:09.286 line:10% position:50% align:center
and was paved with large lava blocks.

00:29:09.286 --> 00:29:13.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was on this very road
that Paul traveled to the city of Rome.

00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:19.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along the way,
Paul eventually came to a busy trading center

00:29:19.129 --> 00:29:22.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
known as the Marketplace of Appius,

00:29:22.424 --> 00:29:24.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a little further north

00:29:24.343 --> 00:29:26.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a rest area (like an inn)

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:29.431 line:10% position:50% align:center
known as Three Taverns.

00:29:29.431 --> 00:29:31.850 line:10% position:50% align:center
Having heard about Paul’s coming,

00:29:31.850 --> 00:29:34.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians from Rome
organized a group of brothers

00:29:34.436 --> 00:29:36.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet the apostle at both of these stops.

00:29:36.897 --> 00:29:41.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 28:15
tells us that upon seeing them,

00:29:41.693 --> 00:29:44.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul “thanked God and took courage.”

00:29:45.489 --> 00:29:48.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, we come to the impressive ruins
of Ostia Antica.

00:29:48.951 --> 00:29:50.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was Rome’s most important port.

00:29:51.578 --> 00:29:53.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is about 25 kilometers,

00:29:53.622 --> 00:29:56.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 16 miles, southwest of Rome.

00:29:56.875 --> 00:29:58.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get a glimpse of Roman life

00:29:58.669 --> 00:29:59.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
back then with its

00:29:59.878 --> 00:30:02.089 line:10% position:50% align:center
multistory apartment buildings,

00:30:02.089 --> 00:30:05.050 line:10% position:50% align:center
known as insulae, along with temples,

00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:08.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
theaters, thermal baths, and shops.

00:30:08.178 --> 00:30:11.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Walking through the old streets,
it’s easy to imagine

00:30:11.515 --> 00:30:13.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers witnessing to the people.

00:30:13.893 --> 00:30:16.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps they stopped to eat at a food shop

00:30:16.604 --> 00:30:19.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
similar to this one called <i>thermopolium,</i>

00:30:19.315 --> 00:30:21.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you could buy

00:30:21.358 --> 00:30:25.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
bread, wine, roasted meat, 

00:30:25.071 --> 00:30:27.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
cheese, and have some refreshment.

00:30:29.408 --> 00:30:31.786 line:10% position:50% align:center
Next, we arrive in Rome,

00:30:31.786 --> 00:30:33.412 line:10% position:50% align:center
where perhaps the most well-known

00:30:33.412 --> 00:30:35.081 line:10% position:50% align:center
monument stands.

00:30:35.373 --> 00:30:39.335 line:10% position:50% align:center
Yes, you guessed it, the Colosseum.

00:30:39.335 --> 00:30:41.337 line:10% position:50% align:center
The mammoth structure

00:30:41.337 --> 00:30:43.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
was built in the first century C.E.

00:30:43.839 --> 00:30:47.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a seating capacity
estimated to be from 40,000

00:30:47.677 --> 00:30:50.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 87,000 persons.

00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was Rome’s entertainment center.

00:30:54.308 --> 00:30:57.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were mainly two types of games,
or exhibitions:

00:30:57.937 --> 00:31:00.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
combat between two gladiators

00:31:00.398 --> 00:31:02.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the hunting of wild animals.

00:31:02.859 --> 00:31:05.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Criminals were also put to death here.

00:31:05.611 --> 00:31:09.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly,
entry to the Colosseum was free.

00:31:09.866 --> 00:31:12.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was part of the policy of the emperors,

00:31:12.577 --> 00:31:14.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
who offered free entertainment

00:31:14.704 --> 00:31:16.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to keep the people under control.

00:31:16.956 --> 00:31:20.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
In reality,
these spectacles were like a drug 

00:31:20.501 --> 00:31:22.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
that corrupted people’s consciences.

00:31:22.795 --> 00:31:25.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
True Christians back then courageously

00:31:25.507 --> 00:31:29.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
refused to take any part as spectators.

00:31:29.219 --> 00:31:31.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the way, do you know where the Romans

00:31:31.429 --> 00:31:34.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
got the funds to build this huge stadium?

00:31:34.974 --> 00:31:37.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
They came from the conquest of Jerusalem

00:31:37.352 --> 00:31:39.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 70 C.E.

00:31:39.562 --> 00:31:44.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, there is even an inscription
at the Colosseum that reads:

00:31:44.150 --> 00:31:48.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Emperor Titus Caesar Vespasian Augustus

00:31:48.196 --> 00:31:52.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ordered the new amphitheater
to be made from the proceeds

00:31:52.242 --> 00:31:54.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the sale of the booty.”

00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:57.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
To remember this important event,

00:31:57.205 --> 00:31:59.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emperor Domitian had a triumphal arch

00:31:59.875 --> 00:32:01.835 line:10% position:50% align:center
built in honor of his brother Titus,

00:32:01.835 --> 00:32:03.295 line:10% position:50% align:center
who conquered Jerusalem

00:32:03.295 --> 00:32:05.380 line:10% position:50% align:center
and later became emperor.

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look carefully,
you can see a bas-relief

00:32:08.842 --> 00:32:13.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a scene of Roman soldiers carrying
the spoils from Jerusalem

00:32:13.305 --> 00:32:16.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the lampstand
taken from Jehovah’s temple.

00:32:16.558 --> 00:32:18.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
The arch stands today

00:32:18.935 --> 00:32:21.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a clear fulfillment of Jesus’ words

00:32:21.772 --> 00:32:25.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the destruction
of Jerusalem and the temple.

00:32:25.025 --> 00:32:28.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, you see, if we use the Bible as a map,

00:32:28.445 --> 00:32:31.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
even the stones can be silent witnesses

00:32:31.281 --> 00:32:34.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible is a book of true history,

00:32:34.284 --> 00:32:38.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
true life, and true prophecies.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:40.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope you enjoyed the tour.

00:32:47.256 --> 00:32:50.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for taking us
on that wonderful tour, Marco.

00:32:50.426 --> 00:32:53.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
After seeing that video,
we all want to go to Italy ourselves

00:32:53.887 --> 00:32:56.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
—don’t we?—
to see those sites in person.

00:32:56.515 --> 00:32:57.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be prepared.

00:33:00.394 --> 00:33:02.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, Mannie, let’s come back to you now.

00:33:02.855 --> 00:33:06.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has been the highlight
of your Gilead training?

00:33:07.568 --> 00:33:09.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, I wasn’t raised in the truth.

00:33:09.612 --> 00:33:11.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as a teenager,

00:33:11.697 --> 00:33:14.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was interested in making sure

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:16.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
I improved my situation

00:33:16.744 --> 00:33:19.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of secular education.

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:21.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought education was the answer.

00:33:21.832 --> 00:33:23.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it was my ticket out.

00:33:23.834 --> 00:33:26.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, boy, did Jehovah fool me.

00:33:26.003 --> 00:33:26.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:33:26.962 --> 00:33:28.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, secular education

00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:32.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
wasn’t the answer, but education was.

00:33:32.134 --> 00:33:37.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knew I needed
the very best education—divine education.

00:33:37.139 --> 00:33:37.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uh-huh.

00:33:37.974 --> 00:33:40.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the truth is that what I’ve learned

00:33:40.518 --> 00:33:43.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our Grand Instructor, Jehovah,

00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:45.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
surpasses by far

00:33:45.064 --> 00:33:49.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
anything that the secular education
could have provided me with.

00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:51.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s truly helped me see that, in fact,

00:33:51.487 --> 00:33:56.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
the education that Jehovah provides us with
makes us better people.

00:33:56.325 --> 00:33:58.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in Gilead School,

00:33:58.035 --> 00:34:00.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have been able to appreciate how Jehovah

00:34:00.955 --> 00:34:04.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
has continued to train us
and provide us with something that’s helpful,

00:34:04.625 --> 00:34:06.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to myself but to others.

00:34:06.919 --> 00:34:08.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
And honestly,

00:34:08.212 --> 00:34:10.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m really grateful
that I’ve had this opportunity

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:13.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get better acquainted
with my heavenly Father.

00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:15.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, well stated.

00:34:15.053 --> 00:34:17.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, tell us, a final question to you,

00:34:17.805 --> 00:34:21.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you plan on using in your assignment

00:34:21.059 --> 00:34:23.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you’ve learned at Gilead?

00:34:23.311 --> 00:34:26.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would tend to steer,

00:34:26.564 --> 00:34:29.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
or guide, myself toward guidelines.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Gilead has taught me
that while guidelines are important,

00:34:35.031 --> 00:34:39.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can’t lose sight of what’s
more important to Jehovah, and that’s people.

00:34:39.494 --> 00:34:40.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:34:40.453 --> 00:34:42.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus knew that, and he saw that.

00:34:42.664 --> 00:34:44.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, I want to imitate

00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:47.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus in my dealings with people.

00:34:47.085 --> 00:34:51.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was on earth,
who knew the rules better than Jesus?

00:34:51.339 --> 00:34:53.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, what was his focus?

00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:54.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
People.

00:34:54.926 --> 00:34:56.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
He put people first.

00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:57.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loved them.

00:34:57.554 --> 00:34:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t hold that against them.

00:34:59.723 --> 00:35:04.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my assignment,
I hope to imitate Jesus fully

00:35:04.728 --> 00:35:09.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that I can
balance guidelines with principles

00:35:09.065 --> 00:35:12.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
but never lose sight
of loving Jehovah’s people.

00:35:12.611 --> 00:35:15.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, that’s beautiful, a nice lesson learned.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:17.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing that.

00:35:17.199 --> 00:35:19.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, why don’t we get an expression

00:35:19.534 --> 00:35:23.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the rest of you
on those very same questions?

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:25.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about you, Adalia?

00:35:25.832 --> 00:35:28.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has been the highlight
of your Gilead training?

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:30.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be honest with you, Brother Chilton,

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:32.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
I came to Gilead very scared

00:35:32.881 --> 00:35:34.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
and apprehensive of the unknown.

00:35:34.967 --> 00:35:36.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understand.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:39.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not knowing
what our future assignment might be

00:35:39.221 --> 00:35:41.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
was very unsettling to me.

00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after several lessons, I feel positive

00:35:44.685 --> 00:35:47.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
and better equipped
for what the future holds for us.

00:35:47.688 --> 00:35:50.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
We did a deep dive
into the Sermon on the Mount,

00:35:50.274 --> 00:35:53.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one particular illustration touched me.

00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:56.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 7:9, 10, Jesus asks:

00:35:56.697 --> 00:36:01.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Which father, when his son asks for a fish,
would hand him a serpent?’

00:36:01.118 --> 00:36:05.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, his listeners understood
that a fish could resemble a serpent,

00:36:05.623 --> 00:36:08.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the illustration
took on a little bit more meaning.

00:36:08.834 --> 00:36:11.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though a son could have been

00:36:11.378 --> 00:36:14.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
initially deceived if he received

00:36:14.048 --> 00:36:16.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
a serpent,
a loving father would never do such a thing.

00:36:16.884 --> 00:36:17.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:20.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I realized that my heavenly Father,

00:36:20.096 --> 00:36:23.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, would never give me something bad

00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:25.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make it appear as something good.

00:36:26.185 --> 00:36:28.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after meditating on this,
I realized that Jehovah

00:36:28.437 --> 00:36:31.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
will only give me something
that will be beneficial for us.

00:36:31.482 --> 00:36:33.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whatever he asks,

00:36:33.359 --> 00:36:36.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
it will only be for my eternal happiness.

00:36:36.737 --> 00:36:38.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, that’s beautiful.

00:36:38.281 --> 00:36:41.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we pray that you have success in that.

00:36:41.158 --> 00:36:43.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the final question
for you, Adalia,

00:36:43.744 --> 00:36:47.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you
hope to use in your assignment

00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:50.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you’ve learned at Gilead?

00:36:50.376 --> 00:36:52.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know our brothers and sisters
are going through a lot.

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:57.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to be able to help strengthen
their faith the way mine has been upbuilt

00:36:57.425 --> 00:37:00.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
by sharing with them
things that I’ve learned in school

00:37:00.595 --> 00:37:04.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also just by being
a living example for them

00:37:04.348 --> 00:37:07.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also making sure that they understand

00:37:07.185 --> 00:37:09.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
that whatever challenge or trial
that they face,

00:37:09.646 --> 00:37:11.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will sustain them.

00:37:11.397 --> 00:37:13.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no doubt about it.

00:37:13.191 --> 00:37:15.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with all that being said,

00:37:15.234 --> 00:37:17.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that we’re ready
for whatever the future holds for us.

00:37:17.987 --> 00:37:20.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the way my faith has been strengthened

00:37:20.323 --> 00:37:23.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s my treasure, my possession,
that I’m never going to let go of.

00:37:23.701 --> 00:37:24.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, that’s beautiful.

00:37:24.827 --> 00:37:27.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing with us.

00:37:27.705 --> 00:37:30.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hanta, let’s ask you that question,

00:37:30.542 --> 00:37:33.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has been the highlight
of Gilead training for you?

00:37:34.712 --> 00:37:37.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve learned many times

00:37:37.966 --> 00:37:41.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I’ve read in our publications many times—

00:37:41.594 --> 00:37:45.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah never fails

00:37:45.306 --> 00:37:47.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reward his faithful ones.

00:37:48.518 --> 00:37:52.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Gilead helped me
to understand that more fully.

00:37:52.188 --> 00:37:53.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you mean?

00:37:53.607 --> 00:37:56.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:37:56.276 --> 00:38:00.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah used Nebuchadnezzar
to conquer Tyre.

00:38:01.323 --> 00:38:04.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Nebuchadnezzar and his men

00:38:04.534 --> 00:38:07.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not get many things,

00:38:07.788 --> 00:38:10.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
many riches from Tyre.

00:38:10.707 --> 00:38:14.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was as if Jehovah told him:

00:38:14.628 --> 00:38:19.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Nebuchadnezzar,
thank you very much for your labor to me.

00:38:20.258 --> 00:38:23.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here I give you treasures from Egypt.’

00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:27.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar was not His servant,

00:38:27.891 --> 00:38:30.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
but He rewarded him

00:38:30.811 --> 00:38:34.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the labor he did for Him.

00:38:34.398 --> 00:38:37.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Jehovah can do that

00:38:37.234 --> 00:38:41.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
to someone who is not worshipping Him,

00:38:41.572 --> 00:38:43.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much more so will He reward

00:38:43.991 --> 00:38:46.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who are loyal to Him?

00:38:46.577 --> 00:38:48.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that really strengthened me.

00:38:48.579 --> 00:38:50.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, what a beautiful lesson learned!

00:38:50.456 --> 00:38:53.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.
Thank you for sharing that.

00:38:53.167 --> 00:38:55.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a final question to you, Hanta,

00:38:55.544 --> 00:39:00.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you plan on using
what you’ve learned in your assignment

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:02.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
from what you’ve gathered here at Gilead?

00:39:02.927 --> 00:39:07.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, when a sister comes to me
with her problem,

00:39:07.264 --> 00:39:09.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I quickly think of a solution,

00:39:09.892 --> 00:39:12.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when the sister is still speaking.

00:39:12.186 --> 00:39:13.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh.

00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:16.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Gilead has taught me

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:19.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen and to show empathy.

00:39:20.361 --> 00:39:23.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
The person may not need the solution at all.

00:39:23.072 --> 00:39:26.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe what she needs is a listening ear.

00:39:26.367 --> 00:39:29.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when help is needed, I’m determined

00:39:29.161 --> 00:39:33.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use Bible principles
to reason with the person

00:39:33.207 --> 00:39:37.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allow the person
to draw the conclusion.

00:39:37.169 --> 00:39:40.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’ll allow the person
to draw the conclusion herself.

00:39:41.299 --> 00:39:43.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wish you success in that, Hanta.

00:39:43.593 --> 00:39:45.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much for sharing that with us.

00:39:46.596 --> 00:39:49.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shimon, let’s go over to you.

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:52.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has been the highlight
of your Gilead training?

00:39:53.186 --> 00:39:57.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me,
the Growing Spiritually course lessons

00:39:57.565 --> 00:40:00.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a huge impact.

00:40:00.443 --> 00:40:03.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
I even changed my prayer a little bit.

00:40:04.489 --> 00:40:08.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, I used to pray to Jehovah,

00:40:08.242 --> 00:40:10.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please help me to show love

00:40:10.370 --> 00:40:13.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to my wife

00:40:13.081 --> 00:40:15.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and friends and brothers and sisters.”

00:40:15.416 --> 00:40:17.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good prayer.
Good prayer.

00:40:17.961 --> 00:40:20.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s a little bit vague.

00:40:20.463 --> 00:40:25.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now I understand
what love is specifically.

00:40:26.511 --> 00:40:30.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is an unselfish quality,

00:40:30.014 --> 00:40:33.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
focusing on doing good to others

00:40:33.768 --> 00:40:37.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of the merit of the recipient

00:40:37.772 --> 00:40:41.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
or any benefit I could get back.

00:40:43.194 --> 00:40:45.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now I know

00:40:45.113 --> 00:40:49.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when I pray to Jehovah to show love,

00:40:49.951 --> 00:40:52.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am asking for help

00:40:52.704 --> 00:40:55.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be a more unselfish person.

00:40:56.917 --> 00:40:58.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, that’s beautiful.

00:40:58.543 --> 00:41:00.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a good lesson you’ve learned.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:05.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, tell us, how do you plan
on using in your assignment

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you’ve gathered here at Gilead?

00:41:07.803 --> 00:41:11.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, you know, Brother Chilton,

00:41:11.389 --> 00:41:13.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gilead training made me understand

00:41:13.975 --> 00:41:16.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
why I loved computers so much.

00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.
We have to know more on that one.

00:41:21.149 --> 00:41:22.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you mean?

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:26.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because I can program the computer
how to work,

00:41:26.947 --> 00:41:29.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they will just work.

00:41:30.993 --> 00:41:34.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
But people are not like that;

00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are unpredictable,

00:41:38.167 --> 00:41:42.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they don’t always do
what I want them to do.

00:41:43.755 --> 00:41:48.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
So because of this, when I am focusing
on something technical,

00:41:48.343 --> 00:41:53.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is not always easy for me
to switch my mind to love people.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:55.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my goal is to love people

00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:58.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way Jehovah loves them,

00:41:58.437 --> 00:42:02.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
remembering they are doing their best
—as I am.

00:42:02.775 --> 00:42:04.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, a good lesson learned.

00:42:04.526 --> 00:42:07.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for sharing that with us.

00:42:07.238 --> 00:42:09.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk to your wife now.

00:42:09.073 --> 00:42:10.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yoshi, what has been

00:42:10.991 --> 00:42:13.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
the highlight of your training?

00:42:13.410 --> 00:42:17.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, well, I’m seeing
the fruitage of the spirit in a way 

00:42:17.623 --> 00:42:19.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I never thought of before.

00:42:19.667 --> 00:42:21.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I give an example?

00:42:21.293 --> 00:42:22.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please.

00:42:22.503 --> 00:42:25.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our culture

00:42:25.047 --> 00:42:28.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
is generally viewed
as being humble and polite.

00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:33.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead has taught me
that that kind of humility, though,

00:42:33.431 --> 00:42:36.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not a result of the holy spirit,

00:42:36.851 --> 00:42:39.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a fruitage of the holy spirit.

00:42:39.353 --> 00:42:44.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead has taught me
that humility, love, kindness

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:46.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all those good qualities—

00:42:46.319 --> 00:42:49.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
they have to come
from much, much deeper down,

00:42:49.822 --> 00:42:54.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
not culture or your natural tendency
or personality.

00:42:54.076 --> 00:42:56.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has to be driven by Jehovah,

00:42:56.579 --> 00:42:59.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
by his holy spirit,

00:42:59.248 --> 00:43:01.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
for it to be a fruitage of the holy spirit.

00:43:01.876 --> 00:43:06.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that understanding
of Jehovah helping us in our good points

00:43:06.714 --> 00:43:09.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that just really blew my mind.

00:43:09.008 --> 00:43:11.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, nice.

00:43:12.762 --> 00:43:15.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do you plan on using
in your assignment

00:43:15.056 --> 00:43:16.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you’ve learned at Gilead, Yoshi?

00:43:16.891 --> 00:43:18.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:43:18.017 --> 00:43:21.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the holy spirit’s power is very strong.

00:43:21.104 --> 00:43:24.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
So my goal when I get to my new assignment

00:43:24.941 --> 00:43:29.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to be able to expand my comfort zone,

00:43:29.237 --> 00:43:31.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
widen out, with Jehovah’s help,

00:43:31.281 --> 00:43:34.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can be more people-oriented

00:43:34.659 --> 00:43:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I can be comfortable with people.

00:43:37.954 --> 00:43:40.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I hope
they’ll be comfortable with me too.

00:43:41.541 --> 00:43:43.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, we have every confidence
that they will be.

00:43:43.793 --> 00:43:45.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well done, Yoshi.

00:43:45.253 --> 00:43:46.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:43:46.546 --> 00:43:51.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, finally, Marco,
you’re our last one here.

00:43:51.885 --> 00:43:55.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what has been the highlight
of your Gilead training?

00:43:56.014 --> 00:44:00.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think that Gilead helped me
to love the Bible even more.

00:44:00.268 --> 00:44:02.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that when digging into it,

00:44:02.312 --> 00:44:04.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more I studied the Bible,

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:09.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more I found new things to learn
that I didn’t imagine.

00:44:09.277 --> 00:44:13.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I could compare
the Bible now to a suitcase

00:44:13.031 --> 00:44:17.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a double or triple bottom layer

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:21.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and full of things
because the more I look into it,

00:44:21.498 --> 00:44:24.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more I can take out more things

00:44:24.042 --> 00:44:26.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
that maybe I didn’t see at the beginning.

00:44:26.586 --> 00:44:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the lesson for me is

00:44:28.171 --> 00:44:30.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when I study the Bible,
I should slow down

00:44:30.882 --> 00:44:32.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
—take my time to meditate,

00:44:34.469 --> 00:44:37.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find the different angles,
to study all the the aspects

00:44:39.141 --> 00:44:43.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
—because nothing in the Bible
is random or written by chance.

00:44:44.188 --> 00:44:46.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice, nice lesson you’ve learned there.

00:44:46.231 --> 00:44:49.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how do you plan on using
in your assignment what you’ve learned?

00:44:49.943 --> 00:44:52.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I think to be aware of how rich

00:44:52.446 --> 00:44:54.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible is will help me in any assignment.

00:44:55.824 --> 00:44:59.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m more convinced that in any circumstance

00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:01.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will face in the future (new circumstances

00:45:01.789 --> 00:45:04.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
could be challenging or unexpected),

00:45:04.249 --> 00:45:07.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think that the only thing I have to do

00:45:07.086 --> 00:45:10.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to go back to the Bible
and look for a similar

00:45:10.631 --> 00:45:13.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
situation or a lesson

00:45:13.092 --> 00:45:16.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a Bible principle that can apply

00:45:16.011 --> 00:45:19.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I’m sure that Jehovah
as a loving Father

00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:22.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
has already written in the Bible
everything that I need.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:23.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent.
Well done.

00:45:23.394 --> 00:45:25.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll pray for your success
in that too, Marco.

00:45:27.523 --> 00:45:31.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have thoroughly enjoyed
getting to know the six of you better,

00:45:31.152 --> 00:45:33.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we appreciate so much
you sharing with us

00:45:33.446 --> 00:45:35.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
your personal expressions.

00:45:35.865 --> 00:45:38.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
We echo the words of the apostle Paul,

00:45:38.909 --> 00:45:42.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
written at 2 Timothy 4:22,

00:45:42.496 --> 00:45:45.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he said: “The Lord

00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:48.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“be with the spirit you show.

00:45:48.461 --> 00:45:51.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
His undeserved kindness be with you.”

00:45:51.672 --> 00:45:55.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is our prayer that Jehovah’s rich blessing
continue upon you six

00:45:55.802 --> 00:45:59.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the rest of your Gilead class—156.

00:46:00.473 --> 00:46:03.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to all of you in our viewing audience,

00:46:03.851 --> 00:46:06.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
thank you for joining us.

00:46:06.521 --> 00:46:08.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to being with you again

00:46:08.564 --> 00:46:12.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the next edition of <i>The Inside Story.</i>

00:46:36.843 --> 00:46:39.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
We look forward to hearing
from Brother Gerrit Lösch today

00:46:39.596 --> 00:46:41.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this principal talk.

00:46:41.723 --> 00:46:45.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lösch is our longest-serving member
of the Governing Body.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:49.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, he just recently made 30 years
serving on the Governing Body.

00:46:49.356 --> 00:46:51.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we look forward to his fine talk.

00:46:51.483 --> 00:46:55.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think you’ll appreciate
the simplicity and power of his theme.

00:46:55.987 --> 00:46:59.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is “Trust in Jehovah.”

00:47:02.285 --> 00:47:05.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In God we trust,”

00:47:05.205 --> 00:47:07.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says on U.S. dollar bills.

00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:12.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, according to
the actual attitude of the people,

00:47:12.921 --> 00:47:16.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
should it not rather say,
“In money we trust.”

00:47:18.176 --> 00:47:23.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, trusting in money or riches
will lead to disappointment.

00:47:23.557 --> 00:47:26.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 11:28 says:

00:47:26.476 --> 00:47:29.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one trusting in his riches will fall.”

00:47:30.397 --> 00:47:32.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses, we say:

00:47:32.941 --> 00:47:37.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In Jehovah we trust.
Therefore, we will not fail.”

00:47:39.489 --> 00:47:42.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many reasons to trust Jehovah.

00:47:42.659 --> 00:47:46.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are all impressed
by Jehovah’s works, aren’t we?

00:47:46.914 --> 00:47:49.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes nature,

00:47:49.166 --> 00:47:53.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are impressed
when we look at majestic mountains,

00:47:53.212 --> 00:47:56.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we admire the beauty of flowers.

00:47:57.091 --> 00:48:00.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are ever so many
different flowers in the world.

00:48:01.095 --> 00:48:03.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which one do you like best?

00:48:04.932 --> 00:48:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Men can make artificial flowers,

00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:10.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
but not real ones that reproduce.

00:48:11.647 --> 00:48:14.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Men can make beautiful jewelry

00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other works of art;

00:48:17.528 --> 00:48:20.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
however, men cannot produce, or make,

00:48:20.239 --> 00:48:23.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
a single stem of grass,

00:48:23.701 --> 00:48:26.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to speak of flowers or trees.

00:48:27.496 --> 00:48:30.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should reflection on this
not make us humble?

00:48:31.959 --> 00:48:35.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Man cannot create any living thing,

00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:38.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah can and did so.

00:48:39.175 --> 00:48:41.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus commanded,

00:48:41.177 --> 00:48:45.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
in connection with Matthew 6:28—

00:48:46.724 --> 00:48:50.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, also, in this verse:

00:48:50.436 --> 00:48:54.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take a lesson from the lilies of the field,
how they grow;

00:48:54.023 --> 00:48:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they do not toil, nor do they spin;

00:48:56.192 --> 00:48:58.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I tell you that not even Solomon

00:48:58.778 --> 00:49:01.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all his glory
was arrayed as one of these.”

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:06.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah is the Almighty,

00:49:06.994 --> 00:49:10.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he created nature and man.

00:49:10.206 --> 00:49:13.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not need to create nature and us

00:49:13.334 --> 00:49:15.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order for him to be happy.

00:49:16.504 --> 00:49:21.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
He existed before he started to create

00:49:21.217 --> 00:49:25.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an unknown length of time,
as we understand time.

00:49:26.848 --> 00:49:29.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since when does Jehovah exist?

00:49:30.602 --> 00:49:32.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always existed.

00:49:32.729 --> 00:49:35.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we understand this?

00:49:36.107 --> 00:49:38.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose there was a time

00:49:38.818 --> 00:49:41.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah did not exist yet.

00:49:42.822 --> 00:49:46.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then nothing would exist now.

00:49:46.326 --> 00:49:47.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:49:47.827 --> 00:49:52.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because nothing can come from nothing.

00:49:52.332 --> 00:49:55.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact that we exist is proof

00:49:55.001 --> 00:49:57.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah always existed.

00:49:57.587 --> 00:49:59.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s that simple.

00:50:00.590 --> 00:50:05.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before Jehovah started to create,
he existed all alone.

00:50:05.053 --> 00:50:07.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he did not feel lonely, did he?

00:50:08.306 --> 00:50:13.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does not depend on others
or on things to feel happy.

00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:18.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says at 1 Timothy 1:11
that he is “the happy God.”

00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:23.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah exists
“from time indefinite to time indefinite”

00:50:24.573 --> 00:50:29.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has complete knowledge
of the universe and history.

00:50:29.578 --> 00:50:31.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 90:1, 2 says:

00:50:31.663 --> 00:50:35.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, . . .
from everlasting to everlasting,

00:50:35.542 --> 00:50:37.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are God.”

00:50:39.046 --> 00:50:43.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created the universe,
the earth, and man.

00:50:43.008 --> 00:50:45.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
He desired to let others

00:50:45.135 --> 00:50:49.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
share intelligent life and self-awareness 

00:50:49.014 --> 00:50:51.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of love.

00:50:51.225 --> 00:50:54.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not that he needed other creatures

00:50:54.228 --> 00:50:56.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel happy,

00:50:56.772 --> 00:51:01.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he didn’t also need
material things to feel happy.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:04.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was happy since past eternity

00:51:04.655 --> 00:51:06.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
before creation.

00:51:08.075 --> 00:51:10.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
How loving that he created mankind

00:51:10.286 --> 00:51:13.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can enjoy life
and friendship with him!

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:18.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what an expression
of his almightiness,

00:51:18.043 --> 00:51:21.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
his wisdom, and his love!

00:51:21.130 --> 00:51:25.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
It impresses on our mind and heart
how great Jehovah is.

00:51:25.843 --> 00:51:29.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we encounter challenges
in our everyday lives,

00:51:29.513 --> 00:51:31.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditating on Jehovah will help us

00:51:31.682 --> 00:51:36.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to endure challenges
and difficulties of all sorts

00:51:36.729 --> 00:51:39.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to trust him.

00:51:39.106 --> 00:51:42.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
You soon-to-be Gilead graduates

00:51:42.276 --> 00:51:45.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
will seem to find this to be true

00:51:45.363 --> 00:51:49.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you are confronted
with problems in the future.

00:51:50.201 --> 00:51:53.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you experience problems, then what?

00:51:53.454 --> 00:51:55.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray to Jehovah.

00:51:55.456 --> 00:51:59.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
His ability to hear prayers
is mind-boggling.

00:52:01.796 --> 00:52:03.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it not so that when we pray,

00:52:03.923 --> 00:52:08.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the feeling
that Jehovah at that moment

00:52:08.219 --> 00:52:12.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
has nothing else in mind 
or to do than just listen to us?

00:52:13.641 --> 00:52:16.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he can listen

00:52:16.728 --> 00:52:21.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
to tens of thousands of prayers

00:52:21.024 --> 00:52:25.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
in hundreds of languages
all at the same time.

00:52:26.946 --> 00:52:30.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes prayers,
which are not presented audibly,

00:52:30.533 --> 00:52:34.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
but silent prayers also spoken

00:52:34.287 --> 00:52:37.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our heart and our mind.

00:52:37.749 --> 00:52:39.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
How awesome!

00:52:40.502 --> 00:52:45.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
This really strengthens
our trust and faith in him, doesn’t it?

00:52:46.758 --> 00:52:51.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
The universe that Jehovah created

00:52:51.179 --> 00:52:54.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthens our trust in him.

00:52:54.516 --> 00:52:57.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel really small and insignificant

00:52:57.519 --> 00:53:00.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we think about
how the universe got started about,

00:53:00.522 --> 00:53:05.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
as scientists say,
18 to 20 billion years ago.

00:53:07.112 --> 00:53:12.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us consider a few facts

00:53:13.368 --> 00:53:17.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
in connection with the universe that expands,

00:53:17.622 --> 00:53:20.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
comments that were made about galaxies

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
that move into empty space,

00:53:23.045 --> 00:53:27.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
empty space
where no galaxies or stars are yet.

00:53:28.050 --> 00:53:30.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even with the newest telescope,

00:53:30.052 --> 00:53:32.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
scientists have not reached the border

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:36.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the physical universe,

00:53:36.058 --> 00:53:39.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
behind which there is nothing,
just empty space.

00:53:41.271 --> 00:53:44.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is mind-boggling
to meditate on the universe.

00:53:44.525 --> 00:53:46.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking at the starry heaven at night,

00:53:46.777 --> 00:53:51.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
have you ever wondered how far out
into space you’re actually peering

00:53:52.991 --> 00:53:56.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
or how many stars you can see
with the naked eye?

00:53:57.079 --> 00:53:59.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 8:3, 4,

00:53:59.915 --> 00:54:03.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
David wrote about looking at the stars.

00:54:03.002 --> 00:54:05.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “When I see your heavens,

00:54:05.296 --> 00:54:07.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the works of your fingers,

00:54:07.131 --> 00:54:09.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the moon and the stars
that you have prepared,

00:54:09.383 --> 00:54:12.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what is mortal man
that you keep him in mind,

00:54:12.511 --> 00:54:15.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a son of man
that you take care of him?”

00:54:16.807 --> 00:54:21.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really can make us feel humble
to meditate on the universe.

00:54:23.230 --> 00:54:28.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
How far into the universe
could David and can we peer?

00:54:29.528 --> 00:54:34.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
At a distance of some
600,000 light years,

00:54:34.533 --> 00:54:37.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to <i>The Watchtower,</i>
January 1, 1983.

00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:41.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is estimated that our Milky Way alone

00:54:41.415 --> 00:54:46.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
contains 200 to 400 billion stars.

00:54:47.505 --> 00:54:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stars move with fantastic speed.

00:54:50.967 --> 00:54:53.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Wikipedia Encyclopedia says:

00:54:53.386 --> 00:54:57.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The speed of our solar system
circulating in our galaxy

00:54:57.098 --> 00:55:01.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is about 220 kilometers per second

00:55:02.645 --> 00:55:06.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and as scientists found out, at the speed

00:55:06.524 --> 00:55:11.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 568,000 miles per hour.”

00:55:12.113 --> 00:55:13.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
(End of quote)

00:55:14.449 --> 00:55:16.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is estimated that a light beam

00:55:16.993 --> 00:55:20.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
takes about 100,000 years

00:55:20.622 --> 00:55:24.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
from one end of our Milky Way
to the other end.

00:55:26.169 --> 00:55:28.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at our Milky Way

00:55:28.171 --> 00:55:31.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
from outside our Milky Way

00:55:31.341 --> 00:55:34.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from a different angle,

00:55:34.511 --> 00:55:38.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would see it like a disk,

00:55:38.181 --> 00:55:41.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we see it as a way

00:55:41.017 --> 00:55:43.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the location of our solar system

00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:45.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the outskirts of the Milky Way.

00:55:47.315 --> 00:55:50.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the book <i>Guide to the Galaxy,</i>

00:55:51.778 --> 00:55:54.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
published in 1994, it says:

00:55:54.531 --> 00:55:57.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It takes the solar system

00:55:57.742 --> 00:56:00.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“240 million years

00:56:00.662 --> 00:56:04.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to complete the grand circuit
around the galaxy.

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:08.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
This speed is an absolute speed.”

00:56:09.337 --> 00:56:11.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
(End of quote)

00:56:12.257 --> 00:56:17.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Astronomers estimated there
are approximately 100 billion

00:56:17.262 --> 00:56:21.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 1 trillion galaxies in the universe.

00:56:22.976 --> 00:56:24.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how many stars?

00:56:25.645 --> 00:56:29.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is estimated between 10 sextillion

00:56:29.441 --> 00:56:32.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 1 septillion,
if it means something to you.

00:56:34.947 --> 00:56:38.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may wonder, ‘What is 1 septillion?’

00:56:38.033 --> 00:56:40.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it is,

00:56:40.244 --> 00:56:44.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we can see illustrated,

00:56:44.081 --> 00:56:49.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 with 24 zeros,

00:56:49.294 --> 00:56:53.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, if you take 1 billion

00:56:53.132 --> 00:56:57.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you multiply that by 1 quadrillion

00:56:57.386 --> 00:57:01.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
(the next picture shows),
you get 1 septillion.

00:57:01.306 --> 00:57:03.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you follow?
It’s hard for me.

00:57:04.810 --> 00:57:07.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower </i> of March 1, 1991,

00:57:07.855 --> 00:57:10.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
raised the question:

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:14.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where . . . is the source
of all the energy represented

00:57:14.445 --> 00:57:18.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the 100,000 million stars

00:57:18.699 --> 00:57:21.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in our galaxy
[that’s just one galaxy],

00:57:21.785 --> 00:57:26.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as well as the more than
1,000 million galaxies

00:57:26.373 --> 00:57:29.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make up the visible universe?”

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:33.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
to quote from the 1991 <i>Watchtower,</i>  March 1.

00:57:34.924 --> 00:57:39.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible encourages us
to meditate on the universe.

00:57:39.095 --> 00:57:43.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
It strengthens our trust in Jehovah.

00:57:43.182 --> 00:57:45.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says:

00:57:45.184 --> 00:57:48.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Raise your eyes high up and see.

00:57:48.479 --> 00:57:50.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who has created these things?

00:57:50.898 --> 00:57:54.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is the One who is bringing forth
the army of them by number,

00:57:54.986 --> 00:57:57.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all of whom he calls even by name.

00:57:57.947 --> 00:58:00.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Due to the abundance
of dynamic energy,

00:58:00.992 --> 00:58:05.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
he also being vigorous in power,
not one [of them] is missing.”

00:58:06.038 --> 00:58:08.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, who is that One?

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah.

00:58:11.252 --> 00:58:13.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is it good to talk about the universe

00:58:13.796 --> 00:58:17.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
since it is so hard to fathom its size?

00:58:18.092 --> 00:58:23.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
The universe proves
that Jehovah is Almighty.

00:58:24.474 --> 00:58:29.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this inspires us
to trust in his prophecies

00:58:29.437 --> 00:58:31.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
about putting an end to wickedness,

00:58:31.648 --> 00:58:33.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
putting an end to the Devil,

00:58:33.650 --> 00:58:38.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and creating a paradise on earth
for all obedient mankind.

00:58:39.322 --> 00:58:44.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good to reflect
on what David wrote about Jehovah

00:58:44.035 --> 00:58:46.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Psalm 139.

00:58:47.622 --> 00:58:50.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verses 1 to 5,

00:58:50.625 --> 00:58:55.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
David is confident
of Jehovah’s interest in him.

00:58:58.258 --> 00:59:01.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants to hear from us.

00:59:02.512 --> 00:59:05.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can share our innermost thoughts.

00:59:05.932 --> 00:59:09.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can tell Jehovah anything
without being embarrassed.

00:59:11.980 --> 00:59:14.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s look at the scripture.

00:59:18.236 --> 00:59:23.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 139 from verse 1:

00:59:23.992 --> 00:59:28.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, you have searched through me,
and you know me.

00:59:28.413 --> 00:59:32.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You know when I sit down
and when I rise up.

00:59:32.042 --> 00:59:35.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You discern my thoughts from afar.

00:59:35.254 --> 00:59:39.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You observe me
when I travel and when I lie down;

00:59:39.925 --> 00:59:42.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you are familiar with all my ways.

00:59:42.594 --> 00:59:44.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is not a word
on my tongue, but look!

00:59:44.972 --> 00:59:47.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, you already know it well.

00:59:48.725 --> 00:59:51.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Behind and before me,
you surround me;

00:59:51.562 --> 00:59:54.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you lay your hand upon me.”

00:59:56.275 --> 01:00:00.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s a very impressive text, isn’t it?

01:00:01.113 --> 01:00:03.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verses 6 to 13,

01:00:03.115 --> 01:00:07.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
then David tried to comprehend
Jehovah’s greatness.

01:00:07.411 --> 01:00:09.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was too much for him.

01:00:10.873 --> 01:00:14.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so in verse 6, he goes on to say:

01:00:14.084 --> 01:00:17.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Such knowledge
is beyond my comprehension.

01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:20.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is too high for me to reach.

01:00:20.799 --> 01:00:22.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where can I escape from your spirit,

01:00:22.968 --> 01:00:26.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and where can I run away
from your face?

01:00:26.096 --> 01:00:29.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I were to ascend to heaven,
you would be there,

01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:32.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and if I were to make my bed
in the Grave,

01:00:32.103 --> 01:00:34.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“look! you would be there.

01:00:35.648 --> 01:00:39.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I would fly away
with the wings of the dawn

01:00:39.276 --> 01:00:42.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to reside by the most remote sea,

01:00:42.989 --> 01:00:45.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even there your hand would lead me

01:00:45.533 --> 01:00:47.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your right hand
would take hold of me.

01:00:48.869 --> 01:00:51.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I say: ‘Surely darkness
will conceal me!’

01:00:51.330 --> 01:00:54.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then the night around me
would become light.

01:00:54.292 --> 01:00:57.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even the darkness
would not be too dark for you,

01:00:57.795 --> 01:01:00.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but night would be as bright as the day;

01:01:00.631 --> 01:01:04.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“darkness is the same as light to you.

01:01:05.636 --> 01:01:07.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For you produced my kidneys;

01:01:07.638 --> 01:01:10.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
you kept me screened off
in my mother’s womb.”

01:01:12.727 --> 01:01:17.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
David is amazed at Jehovah’s wisdom
in creating the human body.

01:01:17.732 --> 01:01:20.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives all credit to Jehovah

01:01:20.276 --> 01:01:23.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his extraordinary gift.

01:01:23.988 --> 01:01:26.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 14 continues to say:

01:01:26.824 --> 01:01:31.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I praise you because
in an awe-inspiring way

01:01:31.454 --> 01:01:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am wonderfully made.

01:01:33.456 --> 01:01:37.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your works are wonderful,
I know this very well.

01:01:38.419 --> 01:01:43.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My bones were not hidden from you
when I was made in secret,

01:01:43.425 --> 01:01:47.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when I was woven
in the depths of the earth [figuratively].

01:01:47.637 --> 01:01:50.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your eyes even saw me as an embryo;

01:01:50.765 --> 01:01:53.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“all its parts were written in your book

01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“regarding the days
when they were formed,

01:01:55.562 --> 01:01:58.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
before any of them existed.”

01:01:59.733 --> 01:02:02.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s read two more verses

01:02:02.235 --> 01:02:05.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see the effect it had on David

01:02:05.071 --> 01:02:09.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his complete trust and confidence

01:02:09.492 --> 01:02:11.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his heavenly Father.

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:16.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 17: “So to me,
how precious your thoughts are!

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:20.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O God, how vast is the sum of them!

01:02:20.212 --> 01:02:23.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I try to count them,

01:02:23.715 --> 01:02:27.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they outnumber the grains of sand.

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:30.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I awake, I am still with you.”

01:02:32.099 --> 01:02:34.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we agree with David

01:02:34.643 --> 01:02:38.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are created in a wonderful way,

01:02:38.772 --> 01:02:40.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
very impressive.

01:02:40.899 --> 01:02:44.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think of, as an example,
of our ability

01:02:44.987 --> 01:02:49.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use language and thought.

01:02:50.492 --> 01:02:53.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also unique
in our profound curiosity

01:02:53.745 --> 01:02:55.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
about ourselves, aren’t we?

01:02:55.748 --> 01:02:57.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Different from all animals,

01:02:57.666 --> 01:03:01.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are unique in our ability
to contemplate God’s thoughts.

01:03:03.005 --> 01:03:06.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is one way
we are made in God’s image.

01:03:07.676 --> 01:03:11.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of our eyes—a marvel.

01:03:11.263 --> 01:03:13.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have binocular vision

01:03:13.933 --> 01:03:18.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
—able to distinguish the relationship
between different objects.

01:03:18.812 --> 01:03:22.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of our ears—a marvel.

01:03:22.316 --> 01:03:24.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hear in stereo.

01:03:24.985 --> 01:03:28.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s talk about the universe
in our brain.

01:03:30.991 --> 01:03:33.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book <i>The Physics Factbook,</i>

01:03:33.828 --> 01:03:36.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
edited by Glenn Elert, says (and I quote):

01:03:36.997 --> 01:03:39.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Weighing around 3 pounds,

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the brain contains

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:46.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
nearly 100 billion neurons.”

01:03:46.716 --> 01:03:48.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are those?

01:03:48.509 --> 01:03:53.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nerve cells—100 billion neurons.

01:03:53.514 --> 01:03:55.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t believe me, you can verify.

01:03:55.516 --> 01:03:57.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Count them yourself, yeah?

01:04:00.605 --> 01:04:05.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brain is the most complicated organ
in the universe.

01:04:06.194 --> 01:04:08.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
One reference works says
about these nerve cells

01:04:08.905 --> 01:04:10.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they are as many

01:04:10.907 --> 01:04:14.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

01:04:15.953 --> 01:04:18.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also has trillions

01:04:18.039 --> 01:04:22.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
of supportive cells called glia.

01:04:22.001 --> 01:04:26.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each neuron is connected to other neurons

01:04:26.381 --> 01:04:28.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
by as many as

01:04:28.174 --> 01:04:32.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
40,000 individual connections,

01:04:32.011 --> 01:04:35.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
called synapses, between the cells.

01:04:36.307 --> 01:04:39.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brain has more connections

01:04:39.686 --> 01:04:43.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
than there are stars in the universe.

01:04:43.857 --> 01:04:45.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
(End of quote)

01:04:45.775 --> 01:04:49.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
No question we are wonderfully made

01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:52.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the praise belongs to Jehovah.

01:04:53.366 --> 01:04:57.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being aware that Jehovah
created this fantastic universe,

01:04:57.537 --> 01:04:59.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
the earth, and man,
does this not help us

01:04:59.831 --> 01:05:04.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become more confident
in our trust in Jehovah

01:05:04.794 --> 01:05:07.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able and willing to help us

01:05:07.297 --> 01:05:09.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we face problems or challenges?

01:05:11.343 --> 01:05:14.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we face persecution

01:05:14.304 --> 01:05:17.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a ban on our work, then what?

01:05:18.433 --> 01:05:20.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust in Jehovah.

01:05:21.019 --> 01:05:25.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah is not only all-powerful,

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:28.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is also love personified.

01:05:28.026 --> 01:05:32.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is very interested
in you soon-to-be Gilead graduates.

01:05:32.739 --> 01:05:34.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he is interested in all of us.

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:36.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves us.

01:05:36.743 --> 01:05:40.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave his beloved Son, Jesus Christ,
as a sacrifice for our sins

01:05:40.956 --> 01:05:44.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the purpose of helping us
to become perfect

01:05:44.835 --> 01:05:47.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy everlasting friendship with him.

01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:53.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had full trust
and confidence in his Son’s faithfulness.

01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:57.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
His love moves us to love.

01:05:57.973 --> 01:06:00.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love . . . is a perfect bond of union,”

01:06:00.851 --> 01:06:03.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
says Colossians 3:14.

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:07.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is the most powerful bond
in the universe

01:06:07.524 --> 01:06:12.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
—perfect love
bonding the Son and the Father

01:06:12.112 --> 01:06:15.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
together unbreakably.

01:06:15.032 --> 01:06:19.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
For like reasons,
God trusts his organization of servants,

01:06:19.203 --> 01:06:21.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that love would hold most of them

01:06:21.830 --> 01:06:25.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
immovably under test.

01:06:25.918 --> 01:06:28.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 56:11 says:

01:06:28.295 --> 01:06:31.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘In God we have put our trust.’

01:06:31.966 --> 01:06:34.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 3:5 encourages us:

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust in Jehovah with all your heart.”

01:06:38.931 --> 01:06:41.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is our best example.

01:06:41.684 --> 01:06:43.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was nailed to the torture stake,

01:06:43.728 --> 01:06:45.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
his enemies mockingly said:

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has put his trust in God;

01:06:48.441 --> 01:06:51.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let Him now rescue him if He wants him,

01:06:51.319 --> 01:06:53.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”

01:06:55.156 --> 01:06:59.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
Jehovah trusts us as well.

01:07:00.786 --> 01:07:02.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
How encouraging!

01:07:02.830 --> 01:07:05.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
He trusts his organization of servants,

01:07:05.249 --> 01:07:08.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that love
would hold most of them,

01:07:08.002 --> 01:07:11.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
or most of us, immovable to him,

01:07:12.965 --> 01:07:14.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
immovable under test,

01:07:16.219 --> 01:07:20.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that his organization of creatures

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:23.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
would never stop doing so.

01:07:24.477 --> 01:07:26.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
He trusted Abraham.

01:07:26.854 --> 01:07:29.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
He trusted other patriarchs.

01:07:29.732 --> 01:07:33.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
He trusts the anointed ones today.

01:07:33.111 --> 01:07:37.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
He trusts the members of the great crowd
with an earthly hope.

01:07:37.907 --> 01:07:42.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah trusts you,

01:07:42.537 --> 01:07:44.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we trust that you all

01:07:44.748 --> 01:07:49.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue to trust Jehovah forever.

01:07:49.002 --> 01:07:51.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, in God we trust!

01:07:59.804 --> 01:08:03.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we come
to our presentation of the diplomas.

01:08:03.558 --> 01:08:07.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so for this
I will be assisted by Brother Malenfant,

a helper to the Teaching Committee.

01:08:10.023 --> 01:08:12.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we appreciate your help, young man.

01:08:12.567 --> 01:08:13.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, thank you.

will return to the United States branch.

01:12:29.285 --> 01:12:33.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Volkmann
will return to the Serbia branch.

01:12:40.755 --> 01:12:44.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Walker
have been assigned to the Brazil branch.

01:12:52.516 --> 01:12:56.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother and Sister Wicaksana
will return to the Indonesia branch.

01:13:10.785 --> 01:13:13.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think Brother Malenfant
did a fantastic job!

01:13:24.507 --> 01:13:27.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now it’s my pleasure to present to you

01:13:27.385 --> 01:13:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
the graduates of the 156th class of Gilead.

01:13:53.328 --> 01:13:56.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the class has written a letter
that they would like to read.

01:13:56.456 --> 01:13:59.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so Brother Louis Walker from
the United States will read that for us now.

01:14:10.345 --> 01:14:13.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To the Governing Body and Bethel family:

01:14:15.267 --> 01:14:18.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After five months of intense Bible study,

01:14:18.812 --> 01:14:21.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we are filled with so many emotions

01:14:21.940 --> 01:14:24.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that it is hard to find words to express

01:14:24.067 --> 01:14:27.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our appreciation and gratitude.

01:14:27.571 --> 01:14:29.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We feel like Isaiah

01:14:29.948 --> 01:14:34.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when he saw a vision of Jehovah
as described in Isaiah chapter 6.

01:14:35.078 --> 01:14:39.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He saw Jehovah in a way he never had before,

01:14:39.082 --> 01:14:42.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the same is true of us.

01:14:42.002 --> 01:14:45.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Gilead has helped us
to more deeply appreciate

01:14:45.756 --> 01:14:48.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s beautiful personality,

01:14:48.967 --> 01:14:51.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“his matchless wisdom,

01:14:51.428 --> 01:14:54.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and his unfailing love.

01:14:54.139 --> 01:14:56.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like Isaiah, at times

01:14:56.475 --> 01:15:00.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we felt overwhelmed
with our imperfections and limitations.

01:15:00.854 --> 01:15:05.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, just as Jehovah
reassured Isaiah through a seraph,

01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:09.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah lovingly encouraged us.

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:14.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During the past 20 weeks, we were cared for

01:15:14.952 --> 01:15:17.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as ‘a nursing mother tenderly cares

01:15:17.955 --> 01:15:19.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for her own children.’

01:15:19.999 --> 01:15:24.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our instructors became ‘beloved to us’

01:15:24.461 --> 01:15:28.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as they shared not only their knowledge
and understanding of God’s Word

01:15:28.757 --> 01:15:31.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but their ‘very selves.’

01:15:31.135 --> 01:15:35.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were encouraged 
to always give Jehovah our best,

01:15:35.181 --> 01:15:39.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to lower ourselves, and to lift others up.

01:15:40.436 --> 01:15:44.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We learned the value 
of not taking ourselves too seriously

01:15:44.190 --> 01:15:47.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to cherish our journey with Jehovah.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:53.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We also deeply appreciate
our dear Governing Body.

01:15:54.784 --> 01:15:58.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Despite your very busy schedules,

01:15:58.162 --> 01:16:00.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you made time for us.

01:16:00.957 --> 01:16:04.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your heartfelt lectures motivated us

01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:06.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be courageous

01:16:06.337 --> 01:16:09.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to not fear the challenges we will face.

01:16:10.425 --> 01:16:14.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will never forget
your example of kindness,

01:16:14.095 --> 01:16:16.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“humility, and love.

01:16:18.057 --> 01:16:20.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In ‘imitating your faith,’

01:16:20.685 --> 01:16:24.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we are determined to remain loyal

01:16:24.022 --> 01:16:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and submissive
to Jehovah and his organization

01:16:27.483 --> 01:16:29.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as we go out to our assignments.

01:16:31.237 --> 01:16:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Finally, our education
went beyond the Gilead classroom.

01:16:36.826 --> 01:16:39.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We saw hospitality defined

01:16:39.662 --> 01:16:43.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by you dear brothers and sisters
of the United States Bethel family.

01:16:44.918 --> 01:16:49.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your kindness and generosity
were outstanding!

01:16:50.131 --> 01:16:52.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were simply basking in your love.

01:16:53.885 --> 01:16:58.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And although we did not have enough time
to get to know each one of you,

01:16:58.056 --> 01:17:00.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it was enough time to fall in love with you.

01:17:02.769 --> 01:17:07.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We will never be able
to thank our heavenly Father enough

01:17:07.607 --> 01:17:10.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for this unique experience!

01:17:10.610 --> 01:17:14.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We now echo the words of Isaiah,
who declared

01:17:14.447 --> 01:17:18.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even before receiving details
of his new assignment:

01:17:22.831 --> 01:17:24.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Here I am!
Send me!

01:17:24.833 --> 01:17:26.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Send me!’

01:17:26.752 --> 01:17:29.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As we depart for our respective assignments,

01:17:29.921 --> 01:17:34.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we are confident,
thanks to this beautiful training,

01:17:34.718 --> 01:17:39.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah ‘will make us firm
and he will make us strong.’

01:17:40.641 --> 01:17:43.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With hearts full of gratitude and love,

01:17:43.769 --> 01:17:47.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
your brothers, the 156th class of Gilead.”

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we thank you for those sentiments.

01:18:25.227 --> 01:18:27.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
It truly does reflect the appreciation

01:18:27.688 --> 01:18:32.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spirituality of the entire class,
so we appreciate that very much.

01:18:32.401 --> 01:18:34.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a pleasure to be with you today!

01:18:35.237 --> 01:18:37.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in our opening comments,
we talked a bit

01:18:37.740 --> 01:18:42.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the privilege of being ones
whom Jehovah would use.

01:18:42.078 --> 01:18:45.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, we reviewed examples
from Luke chapters 1 and 2

01:18:45.539 --> 01:18:48.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
of humble, obedient ones
whom Jehovah appreciated,

01:18:48.751 --> 01:18:53.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Mary, the humble shepherds,
Simeon, and Anna.

01:18:53.589 --> 01:18:57.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the encouragement
was to imitate those fine examples,

01:18:57.343 --> 01:19:01.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be the kind of people
whom Jehovah is pleased to use

01:19:01.597 --> 01:19:05.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
by cultivating what matters most to Jehovah,

01:19:05.726 --> 01:19:08.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is,
spiritual qualities that he holds dear

01:19:08.813 --> 01:19:11.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that makes us useful to him.

01:19:13.276 --> 01:19:16.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact is, you are ones

01:19:16.529 --> 01:19:18.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom Jehovah is pleased to use.

01:19:19.615 --> 01:19:21.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, all of Jehovah’s people

01:19:21.743 --> 01:19:25.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all in the listening audience,
all of Jehovah’s people the world over—

01:19:25.204 --> 01:19:29.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is pleased to use
because he has drawn each one.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:29.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that, don’t we?

01:19:29.876 --> 01:19:32.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 6:44 tells us
(what does the verse say?):

01:19:32.503 --> 01:19:35.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No man can come to me unless the Father,
who sent me,

01:19:35.256 --> 01:19:38.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
draws him,
and I will resurrect him on the last day.”

01:19:38.426 --> 01:19:41.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah has drawn each one of us

01:19:41.846 --> 01:19:45.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he saw something
in our hearts of value.

01:19:45.850 --> 01:19:48.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw a humility and honesty

01:19:48.561 --> 01:19:53.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a desire to learn the truth
and to serve the true and living God.

01:19:53.775 --> 01:19:56.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we have the privilege, then,

01:19:56.403 --> 01:20:00.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
of being a part of Jehovah’s name people.

01:20:00.365 --> 01:20:03.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
As individuals,
we have the privilege of having a place

01:20:03.201 --> 01:20:05.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his great spiritual temple arrangement.

01:20:05.829 --> 01:20:09.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are all on Jehovah’s team,

01:20:09.249 --> 01:20:12.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the privilege that every one of us has,
of course,

01:20:12.127 --> 01:20:14.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to bear his name
in the Kingdom preaching work.

01:20:16.882 --> 01:20:19.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at times,
Jehovah also gives us other work to do

01:20:19.801 --> 01:20:23.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
in other assignments that are
related to the Kingdom preaching work.

01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:25.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for you, dear friends, that included

01:20:25.474 --> 01:20:28.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
providing to you this training in Gilead.

01:20:29.644 --> 01:20:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while this Gilead training
doesn’t place you above your brothers

01:20:32.147 --> 01:20:34.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and you certainly do not feel that way—

01:20:34.441 --> 01:20:37.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
it does indicate Jehovah’s approval of you

01:20:37.736 --> 01:20:41.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the fact that he saw something good
in your hearts

01:20:41.198 --> 01:20:44.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he could then continue to mold and train

01:20:44.368 --> 01:20:46.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could use you to further help

01:20:46.495 --> 01:20:49.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthen his people.

01:20:49.206 --> 01:20:52.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
And quite likely it’s some of the same things
that he saw in Mary

01:20:52.668 --> 01:20:56.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the shepherds and Simeon and Anna:

01:20:56.088 --> 01:20:59.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility, deep spirituality, obedience,

01:20:59.007 --> 01:21:02.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
loyalty, appreciation for spiritual things,

01:21:02.094 --> 01:21:06.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and constancy in your theocratic routine.

01:21:06.515 --> 01:21:09.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be assured that Jehovah loves you

01:21:09.810 --> 01:21:14.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he approves of you
for these valuable qualities

01:21:14.023 --> 01:21:16.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really make you useful to him.

01:21:18.110 --> 01:21:20.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so our concluding encouragement is

01:21:20.863 --> 01:21:23.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep being the kind of people

01:21:23.157 --> 01:21:25.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom Jehovah can use.

01:21:25.784 --> 01:21:28.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really,
that’s at the heart of the encouragement

01:21:28.204 --> 01:21:31.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 3:16: “At any rate,
to the extent we have made progress,

01:21:31.957 --> 01:21:35.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us go on walking orderly
in this same [routine].”

01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:39.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we think back
to our examples from Luke chapters 1 and 2.

01:21:39.381 --> 01:21:41.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t hear again
about Simeon and Anna,

01:21:41.842 --> 01:21:45.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
although we are sure that they remained
faithful for the rest of their lives.

01:21:45.930 --> 01:21:48.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we do follow Mary

01:21:48.224 --> 01:21:51.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
as she continued in her service to Jehovah

01:21:51.060 --> 01:21:53.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the years went by as she raised Jesus

01:21:53.187 --> 01:21:58.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
and her other children along with Joseph
to love and serve Jehovah.

01:21:58.568 --> 01:22:01.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
We watched as Mary appreciatively

01:22:01.487 --> 01:22:04.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘preserved these things in her heart’

01:22:04.198 --> 01:22:07.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah was doing
in connection with her son

01:22:07.702 --> 01:22:10.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his Son, of course, Jehovah’s.

01:22:10.163 --> 01:22:14.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we also follow Mary as she

01:22:14.041 --> 01:22:17.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
possibly dealt with the death of her husband
at some point along the way 

01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:20.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as she dealt
with the initial lack of faith

01:22:20.798 --> 01:22:24.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
of her other children in Jesus’ Messiahship

01:22:24.052 --> 01:22:27.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then finally as she watched her son die

01:22:27.263 --> 01:22:31.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a most shameful and painful way
on that torture stake,

01:22:31.184 --> 01:22:33.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Simeon’s words came true

01:22:33.770 --> 01:22:36.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘a long sword would be run through her.’

01:22:37.607 --> 01:22:40.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s confidence in Mary was well-placed.

01:22:40.652 --> 01:22:45.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
She continued to be the kind of person
whom he could use.

01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:47.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so follow her good example

01:22:47.742 --> 01:22:50.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being one whom Jehovah
can continue to use

01:22:50.412 --> 01:22:53.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by focusing
on what matters most to Jehovah.

01:22:53.456 --> 01:22:55.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep cultivating the qualities

01:22:55.792 --> 01:22:58.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will endear you to Jehovah.

01:22:58.545 --> 01:23:01.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then whatever work needs to be done,

01:23:01.923 --> 01:23:04.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
whatever assignment needs to be filled,

01:23:04.259 --> 01:23:07.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
whatever encouragement needs to be given,

01:23:07.178 --> 01:23:09.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, then, you will be spiritually qualified

01:23:09.681 --> 01:23:14.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will be ready to be used by Jehovah
if that is his desire.

01:23:14.477 --> 01:23:18.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, continue to be one whom Jehovah
would use in his service,

01:23:18.565 --> 01:23:20.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then you will always have his favor

01:23:20.692 --> 01:23:23.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will have joy and contentment
in whatever

01:23:23.987 --> 01:23:26.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has in mind for you to do.

01:23:27.032 --> 01:23:30.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you enjoyed
this portion of the graduation.

01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:34.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be on the lookout for the rest of the program

01:23:34.623 --> 01:23:38.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it’s released on jw.org during this month.

01:23:39.962 --> 01:23:42.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
To conclude, our postcard

01:23:42.464 --> 01:23:45.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
takes us to the southern tip of Africa.

01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:49.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to Eswatini.

01:23:49.137 --> 01:23:51.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
This tiny landlocked country,

01:23:51.431 --> 01:23:54.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
once known as Swaziland,

01:23:54.059 --> 01:23:57.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
sits between Mozambique and South Africa.

01:23:59.606 --> 01:24:01.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can find magnificent wildlife

01:24:01.483 --> 01:24:04.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Hlane National Park

01:24:04.111 --> 01:24:07.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
or stand in amazement

01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:12.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
beside Sibebe Rock,
one of the world’s largest granite domes.

01:24:13.537 --> 01:24:18.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tradition has an important place
in Eswatini culture.

01:24:18.917 --> 01:24:22.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
How men or women tie lihiya fabric

01:24:22.296 --> 01:24:24.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
over their shoulders

01:24:24.215 --> 01:24:26.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
communicates whether they are
married or single.

01:24:28.260 --> 01:24:30.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
The country also has kept 

01:24:30.596 --> 01:24:34.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tradition of an absolute monarchy.

01:24:34.683 --> 01:24:39.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Sobhuza II reigned for 82 years

01:24:39.522 --> 01:24:42.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
until his death in 1982

01:24:42.691 --> 01:24:46.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had quite the rapport
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:24:47.154 --> 01:24:49.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1933,

01:24:49.365 --> 01:24:53.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
the king was delighted
with the message carried by pioneers

01:24:53.869 --> 01:24:57.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and called his personal bodyguard
of 100 warriors

01:24:57.790 --> 01:24:59.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
to listen as well.

01:25:00.668 --> 01:25:02.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
On another occasion,

01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:06.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
he offered to buy
the loudspeaker and the records

01:25:06.507 --> 01:25:09.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers were using.

01:25:09.135 --> 01:25:11.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
They humbly explained,

01:25:11.804 --> 01:25:15.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It all belongs to another King.”

01:25:15.683 --> 01:25:18.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sobhuza wanted to know who this was.

01:25:19.937 --> 01:25:22.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is Jesus Christ.”

01:25:22.899 --> 01:25:27.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sobhuza replied: “Oh, he’s a great King.

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:31.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t want to take anything
that belongs to him.”

01:25:32.909 --> 01:25:35.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers continue loyally announcing

01:25:35.828 --> 01:25:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom.

01:25:37.413 --> 01:25:40.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Currently, there are

01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:43.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 3,000 publishers
conducting

01:25:43.378 --> 01:25:45.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 4,000 Bible studies.

01:25:45.839 --> 01:25:48.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
The country also hosts

01:25:48.049 --> 01:25:52.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
refugees from Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda,

01:25:52.262 --> 01:25:54.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and various other countries.

01:25:55.515 --> 01:25:57.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
And publishers go to the camp

01:25:57.434 --> 01:26:02.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach, extending a warm welcome
and a message of hope.

01:26:03.106 --> 01:26:07.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can feel the love our brothers
in the Nkoyoyo Congregation

01:26:07.694 --> 01:26:11.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
have for neighbor and each other.

01:26:11.364 --> 01:26:15.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wish to send that love to you,

01:26:15.202 --> 01:26:17.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
the worldwide brotherhood.

01:26:17.496 --> 01:26:21.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:26:21.708 --> 01:26:24.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
