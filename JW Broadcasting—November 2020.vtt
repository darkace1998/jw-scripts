Welcome to our program!

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s theme is

00:00:08.625 --> 00:00:11.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Paying Attention?”

00:00:11.127 --> 00:00:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Strained relationships,

00:00:13.596 --> 00:00:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
illnesses,

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:18.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
careers,

00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:20.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entertainment

00:00:20.804 --> 00:00:25.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—we’ll learn how to stay focused on Jehovah

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:28.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite these potential distractions.

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:31.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how our ministry
is more effective

00:00:31.381 --> 00:00:33.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we focus
on reaching the hearts of people.

00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:37.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new song was written

00:00:37.487 --> 00:00:40.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially for you young adults

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help you keep your eyes

00:00:42.726 --> 00:00:44.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the prize of life.

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:47.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting®

00:00:47.397 --> 00:00:49.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for November 2020.

00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:11.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you paying attention?

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:13.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you’ve been asked that question

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by your parents, a teacher,

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:19.229 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or someone else in authority.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a good question
for each of us to ask ourselves.

00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:27.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you think
of occasions associated with our worship

00:01:27.704 --> 00:01:31.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that require us to pay special attention?

00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:36.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when reading the Bible,
attending meetings,

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:38.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
elders when shepherding,

00:01:38.982 --> 00:01:43.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you children
when being instructed by your parents.

00:01:43.186 --> 00:01:45.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to pay attention,

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet there are so many distractions

00:01:48.825 --> 00:01:50.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—electronic gadgets,

00:01:50.827 --> 00:01:54.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the conversations and activities
of those around us.

00:01:54.764 --> 00:01:59.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, it can be a challenge
to pay attention.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know that the phrase “pay attention”

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:07.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
occurs dozens of times
in the <i>New World Translation?</i>

00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:10.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many of those occurrences,

00:02:10.013 --> 00:02:14.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is instructing his people
to pay attention.

00:02:15.852 --> 00:02:17.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to “pay attention”?

00:02:17.987 --> 00:02:20.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how important is it

00:02:20.356 --> 00:02:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you and I pay attention to Jehovah?

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:28.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account in 1 Samuel chapter 15

00:02:28.198 --> 00:02:31.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to answer those questions.

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:35.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 3, Jehovah instructs King Saul

00:02:35.505 --> 00:02:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to strike down the Amalekites

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to devote them
and everything they have to destruction.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, verses 8 and 9 tell us

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Saul did not obey.

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:52.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He spared the king of Amalek

00:02:52.522 --> 00:02:55.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the best of the animals.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Saul respond

00:02:58.461 --> 00:03:02.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Samuel confronted him?

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:05.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read verses 13-15,

00:03:05.468 --> 00:03:10.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note how Saul tried to justify
his disobedience:

00:03:11.407 --> 00:03:14.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When Samuel finally came to him,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Saul said to him:

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘May Jehovah bless you.

00:03:18.414 --> 00:03:22.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have carried out the word of Jehovah.’

00:03:22.218 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But Samuel said:

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:28.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Then what is this sound
of the flock in my ears

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:31.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the sound of the cattle that I hear?’

00:03:31.327 --> 00:03:33.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To this Saul said:

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They were brought from the Amalekites,

00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because the people spared
the best of the flock and the herd

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for sacrificing them to Jehovah your God;

00:03:44.707 --> 00:03:49.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what was left
we devoted to destruction.’”

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:51.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice?

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:56.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saul attempted to justify his disobedience,

00:03:56.052 --> 00:04:00.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
claiming that the animals
would be sacrificed to Jehovah.

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:05.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was Jehovah pleased with Saul?

00:04:05.094 --> 00:04:07.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read verse 22,

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please note the connection
between paying attention

00:04:11.401 --> 00:04:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and obedience:

00:04:14.804 --> 00:04:17.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Samuel then said:

00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:22.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Does Jehovah take as much pleasure
in burnt offerings and sacrifices

00:04:22.712 --> 00:04:26.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?

00:04:26.649 --> 00:04:28.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look!

00:04:28.017 --> 00:04:32.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘To obey is better than a sacrifice,

00:04:32.355 --> 00:04:36.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to pay attention than the fat of rams.’”

00:04:36.826 --> 00:04:41.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was one of the causes
of Saul’s disobedience?

00:04:41.831 --> 00:04:46.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t pay attention
to Jehovah’s instructions.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His failure to pay attention
resulted in disobedience

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and brought Jehovah’s disapproval.

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful lesson for us!

00:04:57.347 --> 00:04:59.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As happened with Saul,

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our worship
could become unacceptable to Jehovah

00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:05.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we fail to pay attention!

00:05:07.256 --> 00:05:12.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now that we understand
why it is important to pay attention,

00:05:12.095 --> 00:05:15.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider
three aspects of paying attention

00:05:15.832 --> 00:05:18.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are discussed in the Bible.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:21.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first scripture we’ll consider

00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:25.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is 2 Chronicles 19:6:

00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:32.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And he [Jehoshaphat] said to the judges:

00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Pay attention to what you are doing,

00:05:36.886 --> 00:05:41.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘for you do not judge for man
but for Jehovah,

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is with you when you pass judgment.’”

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:50.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This admonition to “pay attention”

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was given by King Jehoshaphat

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to appointed judges
throughout the land of Judah.

00:05:55.872 --> 00:05:59.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a sobering reminder!

00:05:59.075 --> 00:06:01.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those judges had good reason

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:04.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay attention to what they were doing.

00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:06.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:09.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were responsible to Jehovah.

00:06:09.685 --> 00:06:11.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They represented him,

00:06:11.687 --> 00:06:16.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their decisions
affected the lives of fellow worshippers.

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, they needed to be familiar
with Jehovah’s thinking on matters

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:23.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to hold to his unprejudiced viewpoint

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when handling matters.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is an excellent reminder
for those who serve as elders.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good elders are good students of the Bible

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:36.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Bible-based publications.

00:06:36.546 --> 00:06:38.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:38.114 --> 00:06:41.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their attentiveness to Jehovah

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enables them to pay attention
to what they are doing.

00:06:45.855 --> 00:06:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they are going to represent Jehovah

00:06:48.357 --> 00:06:52.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reflect his thinking accurately
as they handle matters

00:06:52.428 --> 00:06:55.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether they’re shepherding
the congregation,

00:06:55.231 --> 00:06:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delivering a part at a meeting,

00:06:57.633 --> 00:07:00.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for a challenging assignment,

00:07:00.236 --> 00:07:02.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or addressing wrongdoing

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:06.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—they must pay attention
to what they are doing.

00:07:06.809 --> 00:07:10.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why they must be familiar
with Jehovah’s thinking

00:07:10.113 --> 00:07:14.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then take care to follow his direction.

00:07:14.317 --> 00:07:18.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they do, they show
that they are paying attention

00:07:18.187 --> 00:07:21.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what they are doing.

00:07:21.057 --> 00:07:24.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s interest in assisting the elders

00:07:24.093 --> 00:07:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is demonstrated
in the ongoing education he provides.

00:07:28.664 --> 00:07:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each time the circuit overseer
visits the congregation,

00:07:32.268 --> 00:07:37.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he presents material
prepared especially for the elders.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom Ministry School
and the School for Congregation Elders

00:07:41.811 --> 00:07:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provide more intensive instruction.

00:07:44.814 --> 00:07:46.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important

00:07:46.516 --> 00:07:49.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that elders pay close attention to

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:52.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply such instruction!

00:07:52.622 --> 00:07:56.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their doing so protects,
not just themselves

00:07:56.392 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also fellow worshippers.

00:07:59.595 --> 00:08:02.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By paying attention, elders will be able

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:07.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to convey direction
to the congregations accurately.

00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:11.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can be especially important
if our worship is banned

00:08:11.073 --> 00:08:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or restricted
in the event of a natural disaster

00:08:15.077 --> 00:08:18.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other catastrophic event.

00:08:18.447 --> 00:08:21.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This brings us
to the second aspect of paying attention

00:08:21.984 --> 00:08:24.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll consider.

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Luke 8:18:

00:08:28.658 --> 00:08:31.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore,

00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:35.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“pay attention to how you listen,

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for whoever has will be given more,

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whoever does not have,

00:08:41.037 --> 00:08:45.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even what he imagines he has
will be taken away from him.”

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did Jesus mean when he said:

00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:54.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay attention to how you listen”?

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:57.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those in Jesus’ audience in the first century

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had the wonderful privilege
of hearing Jesus’ literal voice

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he instructed them.

00:09:04.594 --> 00:09:09.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we can’t hear
the voice of Jesus today,

00:09:09.065 --> 00:09:13.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can read his words
and learn of his actions

00:09:13.302 --> 00:09:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as revealed in the Gospel accounts.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we have many opportunities to listen

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:23.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah, Jesus,

00:09:23.212 --> 00:09:25.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders in our congregation,

00:09:28.751 --> 00:09:30.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our marriage mate, 

00:09:30.753 --> 00:09:32.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our children.

00:09:32.989 --> 00:09:35.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No wonder the Bible writer James stated

00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:40.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “everyone must be quick to listen.”

00:09:40.529 --> 00:09:42.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it:

00:09:42.531 --> 00:09:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Saul had truly listened receptively

00:09:45.201 --> 00:09:48.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah’s direction
regarding the Amalekites,

00:09:48.704 --> 00:09:53.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would likely have grasped
the importance of the direction he received

00:09:53.209 --> 00:09:56.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and would have been motivated to obey.

00:09:56.746 --> 00:09:59.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, his lack of attentiveness

00:09:59.448 --> 00:10:04.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
led to disobedience
and Jehovah’s disapproval.

00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we don’t pay attention to how we listen,

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:11.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could find ourselves becoming critical

00:10:11.727 --> 00:10:13.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or unappreciative

00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:17.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even disobedient.

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:21.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as Jehovah instructs and directs us,

00:10:21.037 --> 00:10:24.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to think
about what we are being told,

00:10:24.373 --> 00:10:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ponder over its meaning,

00:10:26.609 --> 00:10:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mull it over in our mind
and, most important,

00:10:30.713 --> 00:10:34.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply the instruction in our own lives.

00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:37.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re a young person,

00:10:37.653 --> 00:10:41.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how can you show that you’re paying attention

00:10:41.023 --> 00:10:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how you listen?

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:48.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the admonition
at Ephesians 6:1-3:

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:54.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Children, be obedient to your parents

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in union with the Lord,

00:10:56.305 --> 00:10:58.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for this is righteous.

00:10:58.441 --> 00:11:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Honor your father and your mother’

00:11:01.177 --> 00:11:03.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is the first command with a promise:

00:11:03.913 --> 00:11:05.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘That it may go well with you

00:11:05.915 --> 00:11:09.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you may remain a long time
on the earth.’”

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You children, who do you think
is the source of this direction?

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:21.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that these words come from Jehovah.

00:11:21.597 --> 00:11:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice that the verses state not only

00:11:24.734 --> 00:11:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that children
should “be obedient” to their parents

00:11:28.738 --> 00:11:33.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also that they should
“honor” their parents?

00:11:35.044 --> 00:11:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can you show that you’re paying attention

00:11:37.847 --> 00:11:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how you listen to this direction?

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:45.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a boy, I can remember occasions

00:11:45.054 --> 00:11:47.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when my parents would ask me
to do something,

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps to take out the trash.

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:53.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would always obey.

00:11:53.863 --> 00:11:56.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times, I’d make it very clear

00:11:56.599 --> 00:12:00.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I didn’t really want to do
what was asked.

00:12:00.536 --> 00:12:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think you young ones know what I mean.

00:12:05.107 --> 00:12:07.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, if we’re truly paying attention

00:12:07.777 --> 00:12:11.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how we listen to Jehovah’s words,

00:12:11.614 --> 00:12:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll be careful to honor our parents,

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:18.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is an essential element of obedience.

00:12:18.687 --> 00:12:22.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, we contribute
to the peace of the family,

00:12:22.892 --> 00:12:27.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we make Jehovah’s heart glad.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:32.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally,
as the promise in verse 3 indicates,

00:12:32.034 --> 00:12:36.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paying attention to how you listen
will protect you

00:12:36.338 --> 00:12:39.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and contribute to your success in other ways

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:42.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout your adult life.

00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, all of us should remember

00:12:45.414 --> 00:12:47.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our everlasting welfare will depend

00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:52.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our willingness to listen and obey.

00:12:52.688 --> 00:12:55.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important, then, that all of us

00:12:55.591 --> 00:12:59.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pay attention to how we listen.

00:12:59.929 --> 00:13:03.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third aspect of paying attention is found

00:13:03.332 --> 00:13:08.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 21:34, 35:

00:13:10.773 --> 00:13:14.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But pay attention to yourselves

00:13:14.443 --> 00:13:17.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that your hearts never become weighed down

00:13:17.313 --> 00:13:20.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with overeating and heavy drinking

00:13:20.082 --> 00:13:22.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and anxieties of life,

00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suddenly that day
be instantly upon you as a snare.”

00:13:30.192 --> 00:13:32.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus admonished his followers

00:13:32.628 --> 00:13:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to pay attention to themselves,

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:40.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he didn’t have in mind the selfish thinking
that characterized King Saul

00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:45.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s so common, even encouraged,
in today’s world.

00:13:46.141 --> 00:13:48.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, Jesus’ words reveal

00:13:48.143 --> 00:13:51.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the key to paying attention to ourselves

00:13:51.514 --> 00:13:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is knowing ourselves

00:13:54.116 --> 00:13:58.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—knowing what’s in our figurative heart.

00:13:58.053 --> 00:14:00.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a challenge for all of us.

00:14:00.756 --> 00:14:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:14:02.424 --> 00:14:07.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible explains at Jeremiah 17:9:

00:14:07.062 --> 00:14:11.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The heart is more treacherous
than anything else

00:14:11.066 --> 00:14:13.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and is desperate.

00:14:13.702 --> 00:14:16.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who can know it?”

00:14:16.739 --> 00:14:19.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 10 answers:

00:14:19.141 --> 00:14:22.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I, Jehovah, am searching the heart,

00:14:22.211 --> 00:14:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
examining the innermost thoughts.”

00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:29.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah knows what is in our heart,

00:14:29.985 --> 00:14:32.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he can help us to know.

00:14:32.988 --> 00:14:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can help us to examine
our motives and goals

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:40.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to discern why we do certain things.

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:45.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Carefully and honestly looking at ourselves
in the mirror of God’s Word

00:14:45.834 --> 00:14:48.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can reveal areas in our thinking, words,

00:14:48.938 --> 00:14:50.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actions

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:53.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that need attention.

00:14:53.008 --> 00:14:56.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, some of Jehovah’s people

00:14:56.378 --> 00:14:58.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—including those of retirement age

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have enjoyed
very comfortable circumstances—

00:15:01.884 --> 00:15:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have concluded that they needed to make
adjustments in their lifestyle,

00:15:05.888 --> 00:15:08.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simplifying their lives

00:15:08.057 --> 00:15:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they can serve Jehovah more fully.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who have done so have had the privilege

00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of attending
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:15:19.034 --> 00:15:22.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it meant
stepping out of their comfort zone,

00:15:22.571 --> 00:15:26.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps moving to a new congregation,

00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:31.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve experienced Jehovah’s blessing
in ways that they couldn’t have anticipated

00:15:31.447 --> 00:15:34.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they share
the benefits of their experience

00:15:34.416 --> 00:15:36.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and theocratic education

00:15:36.585 --> 00:15:38.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their new assignments.

00:15:39.688 --> 00:15:41.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How grateful we are

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is providing ongoing,
life-saving instruction

00:15:45.861 --> 00:15:49.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of his Word and organization.

00:15:49.698 --> 00:15:53.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May each of us be determined
to “pay attention”

00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:55.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to what we are doing,

00:15:55.571 --> 00:15:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to how we listen,

00:15:57.573 --> 00:16:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to ourselves.

00:16:00.376 --> 00:16:05.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By doing so, we’ll avoid falling
into the trap of disobedience

00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:07.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as King Saul did.

00:16:07.449 --> 00:16:12.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, as attentive and obedient servants,

00:16:12.287 --> 00:16:15.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll enjoy Jehovah’s friendship forever.

00:16:17.626 --> 00:16:19.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders play an important role

00:16:19.995 --> 00:16:22.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in helping us stay focused on Jehovah,

00:16:22.765 --> 00:16:26.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
particularly when we’re facing
difficult problems.

00:16:26.835 --> 00:16:28.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our first video,

00:16:28.837 --> 00:16:33.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how elders provide loving assistance.

00:16:33.942 --> 00:16:36.779 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Everything was going fine in my marriage

00:16:36.779 --> 00:16:38.747 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—or so I thought.

00:16:38.747 --> 00:16:42.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My ex-husband was disfellowshipped,

00:16:42.151 --> 00:16:43.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
left home

00:16:43.986 --> 00:16:46.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in less than a month,
we divorced.

00:16:51.293 --> 00:16:53.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Right after the divorce,
I had to figure out

00:16:53.962 --> 00:16:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how I would provide for the girls,

00:17:00.502 --> 00:17:04.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I began working as a cleaner.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:08.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had to provide for them spiritually.

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:14.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But many times,
because of discouragement and tiredness,

00:17:14.883 --> 00:17:18.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t be there for them
as much as they needed me to be.

00:17:20.823 --> 00:17:22.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides all of this,

00:17:22.858 --> 00:17:26.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had to deal
with very negative feelings.

00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:29.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a very difficult time in my life.

00:17:38.173 --> 00:17:40.309 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I had never been so sick.

00:17:40.309 --> 00:17:42.544 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t even get up to go to the hospital.

00:17:46.782 --> 00:17:50.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To cope with this problem,
I just kept praying.

00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:54.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not able to walk,
and I was not able to get to the meetings.

00:17:57.926 --> 00:18:00.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders realized
that I was missing from the meetings.

00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:09.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders quickly came to my aid.

00:18:11.206 --> 00:18:14.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that one of the things

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that touched me the most

00:18:16.378 --> 00:18:19.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was when the elders read a scripture.

00:18:20.315 --> 00:18:23.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 139:3:

00:18:24.219 --> 00:18:28.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You observe me when I travel
and when I lie down;

00:18:28.023 --> 00:18:31.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are familiar with all my ways.”

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:35.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that I am precious to Jehovah.

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:38.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was as if Jehovah was healing me.

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now knew that Jehovah
was interested in me

00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he was looking after me.

00:18:44.072 --> 00:18:46.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was making sure that I knew it.

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something else that I remember fondly

00:18:50.546 --> 00:18:53.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was after a meeting at the Kingdom Hall.

00:18:53.081 --> 00:18:57.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the elders gave me
some scriptures to read at home

00:18:57.252 --> 00:19:00.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and said that if we needed any help,

00:19:00.088 --> 00:19:03.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the elders were there for us.

00:19:05.093 --> 00:19:08.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two elders lovingly came to see me,

00:19:08.096 --> 00:19:10.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah uses them as shepherds.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I live very far from the Kingdom Hall.

00:19:16.672 --> 00:19:19.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the brothers made the sacrifice
to get public transport,

00:19:19.241 --> 00:19:21.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get off at the main road,

00:19:21.643 --> 00:19:24.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from there they walked 40 minutes

00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:26.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach my house.

00:19:26.815 --> 00:19:29.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know what I would have done.

00:19:30.752 --> 00:19:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the elders arrived,
they listened to me,

00:19:34.323 --> 00:19:37.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they cried with me,
and they read the Bible with me.

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:42.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves me.

00:19:42.998 --> 00:19:46.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I started to feel better,

00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:48.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went back to the group.

00:19:49.204 --> 00:19:52.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really happy
to be back with my brothers.

00:19:57.946 --> 00:20:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after all the help we have received,
we are doing well.

00:20:03.352 --> 00:20:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation is our second home,
and we feel very good there.

00:20:09.191 --> 00:20:13.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything I have today,
I owe to the brothers and sisters,

00:20:13.028 --> 00:20:16.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially the elders.

00:20:16.331 --> 00:20:20.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see shepherding calls
as a very evident way

00:20:20.135 --> 00:20:24.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which Jehovah demonstrates
his full love for us.

00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:27.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that at times

00:20:27.542 --> 00:20:30.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these visits might be
a challenge for the elders,

00:20:31.079 --> 00:20:33.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the results are really good.

00:20:33.515 --> 00:20:36.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt,
they can see that all the work

00:20:36.518 --> 00:20:38.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all the effort is worthwhile.

00:20:39.588 --> 00:20:42.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will never forget the help
that I received from the elders.

00:20:43.158 --> 00:20:47.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This situation taught me that Jehovah
will not let his sheep get lost,

00:20:47.429 --> 00:20:49.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even one.

00:20:49.431 --> 00:20:52.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 23:4 says:

00:20:52.067 --> 00:20:54.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will raise up over them shepherds

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘who will really shepherd them.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:21:00.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘They will no longer be afraid or be terrified,

00:21:00.042 --> 00:21:02.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and none will be missing,’ declares Jehovah.”

00:21:04.479 --> 00:21:08.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the elders help Mariana and Elias?

00:21:08.116 --> 00:21:10.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As good shepherds,

00:21:10.118 --> 00:21:13.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were attentive to Jehovah’s flock,

00:21:13.622 --> 00:21:16.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they were quick to notice
that help was needed.

00:21:16.992 --> 00:21:20.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They visited Mariana and Elias
in their homes,

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:25.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shared encouraging scriptures, and listened.

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They showed that Jehovah
cares for every one of his sheep.

00:21:30.105 --> 00:21:34.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those brothers,
like the elders in your congregation,

00:21:34.576 --> 00:21:38.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
paid attention
to the loving training and instruction

00:21:38.313 --> 00:21:40.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’d received from Jehovah.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:44.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To expand their ministry,

00:21:44.353 --> 00:21:46.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many Witnesses
have learned another language.

00:21:46.655 --> 00:21:48.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you?

00:21:48.657 --> 00:21:53.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, Jehovah knows
your selfless effort and hard work

00:21:53.428 --> 00:21:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach and teach in that language.

00:21:57.132 --> 00:22:00.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is preaching to people
in their native language

00:22:00.736 --> 00:22:03.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sufficient to reach their heart?

00:22:03.872 --> 00:22:06.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see in this dramatization.

00:22:10.212 --> 00:22:13.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our family had been learning Chinese
for over a year.

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:15.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t easy.

00:22:16.284 --> 00:22:18.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God has many titles.

00:22:18.487 --> 00:22:21.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you know he has only one name?

00:22:21.656 --> 00:22:34.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[Speaking Chinese]

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was ready, or at least I thought so.

00:22:37.773 --> 00:22:38.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew!

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:41.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, I’ll be right there.

00:22:48.016 --> 00:22:50.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were making progress,

00:22:50.285 --> 00:22:52.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we weren’t giving up.

00:23:16.378 --> 00:23:20.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed like most people
just weren’t interested.

00:23:23.118 --> 00:23:25.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were not having a good morning.

00:23:33.128 --> 00:23:35.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What happened?

00:23:35.897 --> 00:23:39.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mom and Liz weren’t having
a good morning either.

00:23:42.637 --> 00:23:44.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother and Sister Lin joined us.

00:23:44.873 --> 00:23:48.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been a big help to us.

00:23:48.176 --> 00:23:50.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We told them about our morning.

00:23:50.545 --> 00:23:54.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were finally able to converse a little
and give presentations,

00:23:54.316 --> 00:23:56.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but everything seemed to fall flat.

00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You ask good questions at the door

00:24:01.022 --> 00:24:04.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but not always the right one.

00:24:04.993 --> 00:24:07.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, when you learn the language,

00:24:07.362 --> 00:24:10.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not forget to learn about people.

00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:14.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was right.

00:24:14.169 --> 00:24:19.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our questions started conversations
in our old territory, but not here.

00:24:20.442 --> 00:24:22.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your pronunciation is very good, see.

00:24:22.911 --> 00:24:23.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Brother Lin.

00:24:23.912 --> 00:24:26.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed a different approach

00:24:26.715 --> 00:24:28.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we didn’t just learn the language

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:32.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also how to reach the heart
of someone who speaks it.

00:24:34.089 --> 00:24:36.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the July 2019 <i>Watchtower,</i>

00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:39.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read about “Reaching the Hearts
of Nonreligious People.”

00:24:39.794 --> 00:24:41.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in paragraph 7,

00:24:41.796 --> 00:24:45.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how do you think that we could be more
like the apostle Paul?

00:24:45.934 --> 00:24:47.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Paul was a Jew,

00:24:47.936 --> 00:24:50.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when he was talking to other people,

00:24:50.105 --> 00:24:52.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had to adapt his presentation.

00:24:52.474 --> 00:24:56.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like what 1 Corinthians 9:20-23 says:

00:24:56.811 --> 00:25:00.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To the Jews I became as a Jew
in order to gain Jews;

00:25:00.615 --> 00:25:02.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to those under law I became . . .”

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Liz was right.

00:25:04.553 --> 00:25:07.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Paul spoke to fellow Jews in Athens,

00:25:07.289 --> 00:25:09.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he reasoned from the Scriptures.

00:25:10.392 --> 00:25:14.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when he spoke to the Greeks
at the Areopagus, he adapted,

00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:16.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reasoning with them first without the Bible.

00:25:16.798 --> 00:25:19.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He later wrote:

00:25:19.401 --> 00:25:22.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:25:22.971 --> 00:25:27.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I might by all possible means
save some.”

00:25:27.676 --> 00:25:30.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we needed to do.

00:25:31.479 --> 00:25:34.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned more about the people.

00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:42.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started to listen more
and talk about things

00:25:42.157 --> 00:25:45.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that interested them.

00:25:50.365 --> 00:25:53.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We found different ways
to start conversations.

00:26:00.542 --> 00:26:03.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we kept learning more about the culture.

00:26:03.612 --> 00:26:06.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Part of a Chinese proverb I found says:

00:26:06.481 --> 00:26:09.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He who comes near ink is stained black.”

00:26:09.651 --> 00:26:11.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a great way to introduce

00:26:11.653 --> 00:26:13.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 13:20:

00:26:13.722 --> 00:26:17.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The one walking with the wise
will become wise.”

00:26:31.706 --> 00:26:35.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all comes down to showing love.

00:26:48.556 --> 00:26:52.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The more we paid attention
to how we were teaching,

00:26:53.695 --> 00:26:57.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more we were able to show people
the God who loves them.

00:27:03.004 --> 00:27:06.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder
that in the ministry,

00:27:06.174 --> 00:27:08.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to pay attention to people

00:27:08.877 --> 00:27:12.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to what interests them
and to what helps them!

00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we saw,

00:27:14.616 --> 00:27:18.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may need to analyze
and adapt our teaching methods,

00:27:18.653 --> 00:27:20.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as Paul did.

00:27:22.223 --> 00:27:26.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even as we endeavor to reach the hearts
of people in the ministry,

00:27:26.227 --> 00:27:29.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must safeguard our own heart.

00:27:29.597 --> 00:27:31.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A recent <i>Watchtower</i> article

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:35.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered practical suggestions
to help us do that.

00:27:35.403 --> 00:27:37.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our next video,

00:27:37.405 --> 00:27:41.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how our brothers
benefited from applying what they learned.

00:27:57.258 --> 00:27:59.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, very good friends of ours

00:27:59.961 --> 00:28:03.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
decided they wanted
to go their own way and leave Jehovah.

00:28:03.531 --> 00:28:07.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the interim,
they became bad association for us.

00:28:07.535 --> 00:28:09.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had many good times together.

00:28:09.971 --> 00:28:13.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We drove to isolated territory together;

00:28:13.208 --> 00:28:17.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we even visited a brother who was sick
in the hospital to encourage him.

00:28:20.115 --> 00:28:22.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel heartbroken

00:28:22.117 --> 00:28:24.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’re no longer serving Jehovah.

00:28:24.185 --> 00:28:27.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really hard to lose a friend spiritually
—very hard.

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:31.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was about to enter into full-time service,

00:28:31.126 --> 00:28:34.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I still needed reassurance.

00:28:34.195 --> 00:28:38.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised by my mother as a Witness.

00:28:38.199 --> 00:28:41.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though I had
very little contact with my father,

00:28:41.069 --> 00:28:43.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he still tried to oppose
my spiritual progress.

00:28:43.872 --> 00:28:46.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I kept fighting for the truth,

00:28:46.574 --> 00:28:49.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I got baptized when I was 11.

00:28:49.711 --> 00:28:52.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess I felt like I was doing OK.

00:28:52.147 --> 00:28:55.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after high school, I went to university.

00:28:55.984 --> 00:29:00.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to make some changes
in my choice of entertainment.

00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:05.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really never stop learning.

00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:09.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do enjoy relaxing and watching television.

00:29:09.564 --> 00:29:13.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I must admit
that it is more and more difficult

00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:16.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find something decent to watch these days.

00:29:16.738 --> 00:29:19.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’m not saying
that I watch bad programs.

00:29:19.874 --> 00:29:22.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would never do that,

00:29:22.377 --> 00:29:25.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but still I wonder

00:29:25.413 --> 00:29:29.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if what I watch
is spiritually healthy for me.

00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way of thinking
I was exposed to in university

00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:41.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was pressuring me to find security in my life
through material things

00:29:41.262 --> 00:29:44.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—like having my own place to live
and economic stability.

00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:48.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at what cost?

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that paragraph.

00:29:54.242 --> 00:29:57.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said that Satan promotes making money

00:29:57.412 --> 00:29:58.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the only way

00:29:58.413 --> 00:30:00.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can find security in this world.

00:30:00.548 --> 00:30:02.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one could sacrifice

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so much to achieve it.

00:30:04.085 --> 00:30:05.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could even lose

00:30:05.153 --> 00:30:06.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your friendship with Jehovah.

00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:09.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That article—it was just what we needed.

00:30:09.991 --> 00:30:12.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It described a watchman

00:30:12.126 --> 00:30:13.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would protect the city

00:30:13.761 --> 00:30:17.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by sounding out an alarm on impending danger.

00:30:17.632 --> 00:30:19.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And at sounding that alarm,

00:30:19.801 --> 00:30:22.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would shut the gates
to the city to protect the city.

00:30:22.971 --> 00:30:25.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I needed to do that.

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We both needed to do that.

00:30:27.175 --> 00:30:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true.

00:30:28.176 --> 00:30:31.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s not even a question.

00:30:31.579 --> 00:30:33.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loyalty to Jehovah comes first

00:30:33.681 --> 00:30:37.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—before we’re loyal
to any friends we have in this world.

00:30:39.454 --> 00:30:41.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said

00:30:41.456 --> 00:30:43.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that storytelling

00:30:43.458 --> 00:30:46.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does more than entertain us.

00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:52.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Bana, the city of Cameroon
where I was born,

00:30:52.433 --> 00:30:56.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mothers spend their evenings
with their children, telling them stories.

00:30:57.438 --> 00:30:59.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though I was young,

00:30:59.474 --> 00:31:02.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stories my mother told me

00:31:02.677 --> 00:31:05.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue to influence me even today.

00:31:05.647 --> 00:31:10.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I said to myself: ‘Oh, no.
Wait a minute, Happy!

00:31:10.184 --> 00:31:13.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘It means that the stories
that I watch on television

00:31:13.855 --> 00:31:17.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘will also affect me sooner or later,

00:31:17.158 --> 00:31:19.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Devil knows that too.’

00:31:20.461 --> 00:31:23.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to completely cut out a number

00:31:23.298 --> 00:31:25.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of programs that I used to watch.

00:31:27.068 --> 00:31:29.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I’m serving in full-time service,

00:31:29.137 --> 00:31:31.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I love it!

00:31:31.139 --> 00:31:34.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is really taking care of me,

00:31:34.309 --> 00:31:36.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I don’t want to forget

00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:38.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the beautiful principles
I’ve learned from that article.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:42.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still have to safeguard my heart.

00:31:42.817 --> 00:31:46.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to give my best to my Father, Jehovah.

00:31:46.521 --> 00:31:51.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not a day goes by where we don’t think
about these friends of ours.

00:31:51.359 --> 00:31:53.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s certainly our hope
that they come back to Jehovah

00:31:53.728 --> 00:31:56.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that we can serve Jehovah
together shoulder to shoulder.

00:31:56.931 --> 00:31:59.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we’ve also learned

00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:01.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep our “little watchman” in check.

00:32:01.669 --> 00:32:06.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to make sure he does his job
to “sound the alarm” and “shut those gates.”

00:32:06.407 --> 00:32:09.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, we never stop learning.

00:32:09.944 --> 00:32:13.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, true, it’s easier said than done,

00:32:13.114 --> 00:32:15.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is up to us.

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:19.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so important to safeguard your heart!

00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:35.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all enjoy reading <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:32:35.203 --> 00:32:38.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and commenting at the <i>Watchtower</i>  Study.

00:32:38.272 --> 00:32:40.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But truly paying attention

00:32:40.541 --> 00:32:44.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means putting what we learn into action.

00:32:44.245 --> 00:32:48.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else goes
into being a discerning student?

00:32:48.816 --> 00:32:52.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the topic
of a recent Morning Worship program

00:32:52.754 --> 00:32:55.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
presented by Brother Joel Dellinger.

00:32:56.858 --> 00:32:59.093 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our focus in the <i>Watchtower</i> study article

00:32:59.093 --> 00:33:00.695 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is on how we can unleash

00:33:00.695 --> 00:33:02.263 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the power of God’s Word

00:33:02.263 --> 00:33:05.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when teaching from the platform.

00:33:05.466 --> 00:33:07.135 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But, you know, whether we’re teaching

00:33:07.135 --> 00:33:09.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in a congregation setting,

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.939 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on a Bible study, or in the family,

00:33:11.939 --> 00:33:14.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it true that all of us,
brothers and sisters,

00:33:14.942 --> 00:33:18.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
need to ‘pay constant attention
to ourselves and to our teaching’?

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:23.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know why that’s so important
—because lives are at stake.

00:33:23.551 --> 00:33:27.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all of us, younger or older,

00:33:27.155 --> 00:33:29.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
touch the lives of other people.

00:33:29.490 --> 00:33:31.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we teach effectively,

00:33:31.793 --> 00:33:34.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are giving opportunity to others

00:33:34.729 --> 00:33:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attain the wisdom and the discernment
that God’s Word can give them.

00:33:39.067 --> 00:33:42.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we need to approach
any teaching opportunity

00:33:42.403 --> 00:33:45.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seriously and prayerfully.

00:33:45.973 --> 00:33:49.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 20 years ago, a kind elder gave me

00:33:49.077 --> 00:33:51.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some constructive counsel
after a public talk.

00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:54.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, with a warm smile, he said this,

00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:59.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember, none of us teach like Jesus did.”

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I’ll never forget that counsel.

00:34:02.056 --> 00:34:05.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why were those observations so helpful?

00:34:05.293 --> 00:34:07.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it reminded me that when teaching,

00:34:07.829 --> 00:34:12.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our model needs to be Jesus,
the Great Teacher.

00:34:12.066 --> 00:34:14.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s more to learn from him.

00:34:14.268 --> 00:34:17.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus’ example reminds us of the need

00:34:17.071 --> 00:34:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain humble and diligent
students of Jehovah

00:34:21.709 --> 00:34:24.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the Grand Instructor.

00:34:24.812 --> 00:34:28.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though all of us are teachers on occasion,

00:34:28.116 --> 00:34:30.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it true that most often

00:34:30.251 --> 00:34:33.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the role we play during spiritual programs

00:34:33.855 --> 00:34:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that of students?

00:34:36.557 --> 00:34:40.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just for a moment, think about the many hours

00:34:40.061 --> 00:34:44.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we spend as students
—not teachers—

00:34:44.098 --> 00:34:47.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re in the audience
at congregation meetings,

00:34:47.135 --> 00:34:50.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at assemblies, and at conventions.

00:34:50.037 --> 00:34:53.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add to that the time we are students

00:34:53.274 --> 00:34:56.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we buy out time to watch
the monthly broadcast,

00:34:56.878 --> 00:35:01.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for meetings,
to engage in family and personal study.

00:35:01.249 --> 00:35:05.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then think of the added privilege
that many of us here have

00:35:05.052 --> 00:35:09.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to enjoy morning worship five days a week.

00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:11.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, a typical program
of morning worship

00:35:11.492 --> 00:35:14.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lasts between 20 to 25 minutes.

00:35:14.095 --> 00:35:18.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you multiply that by 5 days a week
and then by 52 weeks,

00:35:18.399 --> 00:35:21.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a minimum, we are exposed

00:35:21.202 --> 00:35:24.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to at least 86 hours

00:35:24.539 --> 00:35:27.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of divine instruction each year.

00:35:27.742 --> 00:35:29.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we’re not careful,

00:35:29.744 --> 00:35:33.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some or much of that valuable instruction,

00:35:33.014 --> 00:35:37.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouragement, and counsel
could just wash over us.

00:35:37.518 --> 00:35:40.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for the remaining time
for our program this morning,

00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:42.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider some things all of us can do

00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:45.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to listen more effectively

00:35:45.159 --> 00:35:47.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at spiritual programs.

00:35:47.862 --> 00:35:50.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, for our first point, open your Bible

00:35:50.097 --> 00:35:53.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Ezra 7:10,

00:35:53.334 --> 00:35:56.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s consider Ezra’s example.

00:35:56.637 --> 00:36:01.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s Ezra 7:10,

00:36:01.142 --> 00:36:03.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and notice the reading carefully:

00:36:03.845 --> 00:36:07.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Ezra had prepared his heart

00:36:07.014 --> 00:36:09.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to consult the Law of Jehovah

00:36:09.517 --> 00:36:11.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to practice it,

00:36:11.519 --> 00:36:13.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to teach its regulations

00:36:13.721 --> 00:36:16.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and judgments in Israel.”

00:36:16.724 --> 00:36:19.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if you have the Bible with the asterisk

00:36:19.861 --> 00:36:22.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
next to “prepared his heart,”

00:36:22.063 --> 00:36:26.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you tap on that, you’ll notice
that that could be rendered as

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“had determined in his heart.”

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:31.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what do we learn from Ezra?

00:36:31.172 --> 00:36:35.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had the right attitude
going into a period of study.

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:39.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He had the right approach
to study and learning.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He recognized that it was Jehovah

00:36:41.883 --> 00:36:44.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would be teaching him through His Law.

00:36:44.452 --> 00:36:48.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the verse goes on to say,
he first recognized

00:36:48.155 --> 00:36:53.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he needed to personally practice
what he was learning.

00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:56.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only then would he be in a rightful position

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:58.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to effectively teach others.

00:36:58.933 --> 00:37:02.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this scripture emphasizes the point
we’ve already made, doesn’t it?

00:37:02.937 --> 00:37:05.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though we are teachers on occasion,

00:37:05.673 --> 00:37:08.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are always first and foremost

00:37:08.576 --> 00:37:11.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
students of God’s Word.

00:37:11.545 --> 00:37:13.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we imitate Ezra’s example

00:37:13.714 --> 00:37:17.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prepare our hearts before study,

00:37:17.685 --> 00:37:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before attending a spiritual program

00:37:19.887 --> 00:37:22.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(whether here at Bethel
or in the congregation),

00:37:22.723 --> 00:37:26.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before watching a monthly broadcast?

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we need to prepare our hearts
by specifically praying to Jehovah,

00:37:31.265 --> 00:37:35.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizing him
as the Source of the teaching.

00:37:35.636 --> 00:37:38.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we pray specifically about?

00:37:38.806 --> 00:37:43.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for one, we want to pray
that we remain humble

00:37:43.477 --> 00:37:46.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while listening to theocratic instruction.

00:37:46.447 --> 00:37:48.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to listen

00:37:48.449 --> 00:37:51.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—no matter how long
we’ve been in Jehovah’s classroom—

00:37:51.752 --> 00:37:54.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because none of us know it all,

00:37:54.422 --> 00:37:56.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will we ever know it all.

00:37:56.757 --> 00:37:59.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 1:5 reminds us

00:37:59.026 --> 00:38:03.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “a wise person listens
and takes in more instruction.”

00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:06.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this leads to another question:

00:38:06.734 --> 00:38:09.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we find we have
a somewhat negative attitude

00:38:09.737 --> 00:38:12.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward a certain presentation

00:38:12.073 --> 00:38:15.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—perhaps the material doesn’t interest us,

00:38:15.576 --> 00:38:19.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or we have a negative attitude
toward a certain brother

00:38:19.013 --> 00:38:21.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his teaching ability?

00:38:21.048 --> 00:38:23.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should we do?

00:38:23.050 --> 00:38:25.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prepare our heart.

00:38:25.086 --> 00:38:29.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to Jehovah
to recognize and appreciate

00:38:29.256 --> 00:38:32.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the instruction is from him.

00:38:32.626 --> 00:38:35.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray to have a thankful spirit.

00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:39.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, back in 2002,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  made this helpful point

00:38:39.467 --> 00:38:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in an article that was entitled
“Pay More Than the Usual Attention.”

00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I quote: “Some may tend to gauge
the quality of a meeting

00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:50.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by the teaching abilities
of the participants. . . .

00:38:50.211 --> 00:38:53.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Though the teaching ability
of participants is important,

00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:57.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is not the sole factor contributing
to a meeting’s success.

00:38:57.685 --> 00:39:00.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you not agree
that our prime concern should be,

00:39:00.855 --> 00:39:03.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not how well the speaker delivers his talk,

00:39:03.891 --> 00:39:07.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but how well we incline our ear?

00:39:07.628 --> 00:39:10.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we attend meetings,”
the article continues,

00:39:10.598 --> 00:39:13.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and pay attention
to what is being presented,

00:39:13.234 --> 00:39:16.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we are worshiping God
in harmony with his will.

00:39:16.170 --> 00:39:19.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“That is what makes the meeting a success.

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:21.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If we are eager
to take in the knowledge of God,

00:39:21.709 --> 00:39:23.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“we will benefit from meetings,

00:39:23.744 --> 00:39:27.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of a speaker’s abilities.”

00:39:27.348 --> 00:39:29.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder for all of us!

00:39:29.984 --> 00:39:32.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our first point: Like Ezra,

00:39:32.319 --> 00:39:35.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s prepare our hearts with prayer,

00:39:35.956 --> 00:39:39.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as students who are determined to always

00:39:39.994 --> 00:39:44.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
accept and apply
what Jehovah has to teach us.

00:39:44.165 --> 00:39:46.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider a second point:

00:39:46.267 --> 00:39:49.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the need to focus our attention.

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you faced the challenge
of staying focused

00:39:52.406 --> 00:39:54.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during spiritual programs?

00:39:54.909 --> 00:39:57.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our minds may be distracted

00:39:57.511 --> 00:40:00.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with anxieties and many other things.

00:40:00.548 --> 00:40:04.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Noise and movements around us
could distract us.

00:40:04.318 --> 00:40:06.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re watching morning worship 

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a location other than
the Bethel dining room,

00:40:08.756 --> 00:40:12.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likely we well know the numerous distractions

00:40:12.693 --> 00:40:15.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that fight for our attention.

00:40:15.196 --> 00:40:17.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of us have ailments
and physical discomforts

00:40:17.898 --> 00:40:20.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may make it difficult to concentrate.

00:40:20.534 --> 00:40:23.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, a sister in our congregation

00:40:23.204 --> 00:40:27.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
told us about her long-term battle
with migraine headaches.

00:40:27.975 --> 00:40:30.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried to put myself in her shoes,

00:40:30.644 --> 00:40:34.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
having a migraine headache
while attending a spiritual program

00:40:34.815 --> 00:40:37.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—difficult to concentrate.

00:40:37.151 --> 00:40:39.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, whatever the case may be, we know
—we admit—

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there are many challenges
and distractions.

00:40:42.056 --> 00:40:44.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we do about it?

00:40:44.058 --> 00:40:47.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since the eyes strongly influence

00:40:47.094 --> 00:40:49.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we focus our attention,

00:40:49.196 --> 00:40:52.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Benefit</i>  book provides this suggestion:

00:40:52.099 --> 00:40:56.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Use your eyes to help you concentrate
by keeping them on the speaker.

00:40:56.804 --> 00:40:59.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When he cites a Bible text
—even a familiar one—

00:40:59.473 --> 00:41:02.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look it up, and follow along as he reads it.”

00:41:02.343 --> 00:41:05.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then it said this:
“Resist the temptation to turn your head

00:41:05.913 --> 00:41:08.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the direction of every noise or movement.

00:41:08.816 --> 00:41:12.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If the eyes are flooding your mind
with distracting information,

00:41:12.820 --> 00:41:17.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will miss much
of what is presented from the platform.”

00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:21.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And think about, too,
the use of electronic devices.

00:41:21.729 --> 00:41:26.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever been alerted,
messaged, or e-mailed

00:41:26.033 --> 00:41:29.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while looking at the Bible on your device?

00:41:29.436 --> 00:41:33.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How wise it is when we turn
those devices to a mode

00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that eliminates unnecessary distractions!

00:41:37.645 --> 00:41:41.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about anxieties
or disquieting thoughts?

00:41:41.182 --> 00:41:43.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could we do about that?

00:41:43.684 --> 00:41:46.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, here, again, is where we can remember

00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who the Grand Instructor is
and how close he can be to us

00:41:50.558 --> 00:41:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re in a teaching environment.

00:41:53.694 --> 00:41:57.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Open, please, your Bible to Psalm 94:19

00:41:57.264 --> 00:42:01.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recall what the psalmist said to Jehovah.

00:42:01.101 --> 00:42:05.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 94:19,

00:42:07.174 --> 00:42:09.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we read:

00:42:09.176 --> 00:42:11.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:16.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you [Jehovah] comforted and soothed me.”

00:42:16.283 --> 00:42:18.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder!

00:42:18.819 --> 00:42:21.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can soothe and comfort us

00:42:21.488 --> 00:42:23.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when attending spiritual programs

00:42:23.757 --> 00:42:27.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can focus
on what he’s teaching us.

00:42:27.528 --> 00:42:30.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, spiritual programs
are a provision from him

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:32.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a spiritual lifeline.

00:42:32.233 --> 00:42:35.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as needed during a spiritual program,

00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:38.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should pray to Jehovah
to help us stay focused.

00:42:38.572 --> 00:42:41.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray repeatedly as needed.

00:42:42.643 --> 00:42:44.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in summary, what have we learned?

00:42:44.912 --> 00:42:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us are teachers from time to time,

00:42:47.915 --> 00:42:51.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but first and foremost, we are students

00:42:51.752 --> 00:42:55.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the classroom of the Great Teacher
and the Grand Instructor.

00:42:55.656 --> 00:42:58.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Ezra, humility and appreciation

00:42:58.492 --> 00:43:02.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
should move us to ‘prepare our hearts’
before every spiritual program.

00:43:02.963 --> 00:43:05.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t want to miss anything

00:43:05.966 --> 00:43:08.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has for us.

00:43:08.702 --> 00:43:10.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re determined ‘to consult that Law

00:43:10.704 --> 00:43:13.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can practice it
and then teach it.’

00:43:13.974 --> 00:43:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in view
of all the potential distractions,

00:43:16.443 --> 00:43:20.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s make it our aim to use
our eyes, our mind, and our heart

00:43:20.781 --> 00:43:25.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus attention on the goodness
of Jehovah’s spiritual provisions.

00:43:27.655 --> 00:43:31.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are a young Christian
who recently graduated from school

00:43:31.692 --> 00:43:33.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or will soon graduate,

00:43:33.927 --> 00:43:38.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll make many decisions
that will affect your future.

00:43:38.032 --> 00:43:41.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How, though, can you make decisions

00:43:41.168 --> 00:43:44.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that let you
successfully run the race for life?

00:43:44.705 --> 00:43:48.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the subject of our new music video.

00:43:51.912 --> 00:43:57.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t look back
To the things behind.

00:44:01.121 --> 00:44:07.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep your eyes straight ahead
On that finish line.

00:44:10.597 --> 00:44:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now’s the time to be strong.
Keep building your faith.

00:44:20.474 --> 00:44:24.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t let the world
slow you down.

00:44:24.878 --> 00:44:29.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Put off ev’ry weight.

00:44:29.717 --> 00:44:34.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s
Run the race; run the race.

00:44:34.221 --> 00:44:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race
for life.

00:44:36.724 --> 00:44:39.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s run the race;
yes, run the race.

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep your eye

Got to keep on moving.

Let’s run the race.
Let’s run the race.

00:44:50.671 --> 00:44:58.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prize we gain—
It’ll never fade away.

00:45:00.981 --> 00:45:09.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the blessings in store—
Soon we’ll see the day.

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:14.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s
Run the race; run the race.

00:45:14.428 --> 00:45:16.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race
for life.

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:19.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s run the race;
yes, run the race.

00:45:19.233 --> 00:45:21.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep your eye

00:45:21.835 --> 00:45:24.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s run the race;

00:45:24.238 --> 00:45:26.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve got to keep on going—
Got to keep on moving.

00:45:26.607 --> 00:45:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s run the race.
Let’s run the race.

00:45:30.444 --> 00:45:34.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race
for life.

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:42.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This world would like
to have you turn around

00:45:42.289 --> 00:45:48.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And lose yourself in this life.
But don’t let your hands drop down.

00:45:48.061 --> 00:45:52.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s
Run the race; run the race.

00:45:54.401 --> 00:45:57.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race;
run the race.

00:45:57.604 --> 00:46:01.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s
Run the race; run the race.

00:46:01.975 --> 00:46:04.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race
for life.

00:46:04.278 --> 00:46:07.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s run the race;

00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:09.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep your eye

00:46:09.283 --> 00:46:11.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s run the race;

00:46:28.469 --> 00:46:35.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve got to run the race, yes.
Come on, and run the race.

00:46:35.442 --> 00:46:40.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race.
Let’s run the race.

00:46:40.414 --> 00:46:44.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Run the race.
Run the race for life!

Volunteering
for theocratic construction projects

00:46:52.793 --> 00:46:54.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a goal for many.

00:46:54.795 --> 00:46:58.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, thousands of brothers and sisters

00:46:58.432 --> 00:47:01.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sacrificed their time and energy

00:47:01.068 --> 00:47:05.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build a beautiful new
branch facility in Britain.

00:47:05.572 --> 00:47:08.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to see
the results of their hard work

00:47:08.909 --> 00:47:11.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the blessings they received?

00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:13.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy this report.

00:47:15.816 --> 00:47:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How will you feel
when all we came here to do

00:47:19.887 --> 00:47:22.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is finally completed?

00:47:22.523 --> 00:47:24.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt, we will find a moment to reflect

00:47:24.691 --> 00:47:28.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the words of Philippians 2:13.

00:47:28.228 --> 00:47:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Jehovah energized us

00:47:31.398 --> 00:47:34.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave each and every one of us
“both the desire

00:47:34.201 --> 00:47:37.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the power to act.”

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:41.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has sharing on this project
affected your life?

00:47:42.576 --> 00:47:45.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started over seven years ago.

00:48:00.894 --> 00:48:04.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine how excited
you’re going to be

00:48:04.364 --> 00:48:08.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we hear
that the new branch facility at Chelmsford

00:48:08.035 --> 00:48:10.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been approved by the City Council?

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, guess what?

00:48:12.205 --> 00:48:16.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yesterday afternoon we received the approval.

00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:48.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whilst the buildings are beautiful,

00:50:48.295 --> 00:50:51.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of the day,
they are just buildings.

00:50:51.732 --> 00:50:53.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The really special part of this project

00:50:53.867 --> 00:50:55.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been the people;

00:50:56.870 --> 00:51:00.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even non-Witnesses saw that something special

00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was taking place on our site.

00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:04.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a very friendly site to work on.

00:51:04.878 --> 00:51:06.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just how friendly everyone is.

00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You walk in, and it just—
I find it mind-blowing.

00:51:10.317 --> 00:51:12.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a negative (sometimes) society,

00:51:12.252 --> 00:51:15.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you come here,
it just puts a smile on your face.

00:51:15.388 --> 00:51:18.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A truly unexpected success

00:51:18.091 --> 00:51:20.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the visitors’ center.

00:51:20.393 --> 00:51:22.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we underestimated the appreciation

00:51:22.763 --> 00:51:25.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s people have

00:51:25.098 --> 00:51:27.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for theocratic activities.

00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:30.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Visitors from all around the globe witnessed

00:51:30.504 --> 00:51:32.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the activities of Jehovah for themselves.

00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is partly why

00:51:35.942 --> 00:51:39.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m actually studying the Bible
to get baptized,

00:51:39.513 --> 00:51:42.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because when I came here,
it just hit me somewhere, you know?

00:51:44.684 --> 00:51:47.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Me and Alicia can’t see,

00:51:47.554 --> 00:51:50.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so everyone has been
so encouraging and thoughtful.

00:51:50.190 --> 00:51:54.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really feel like Jehovah is with us
and he’s supported us.

00:51:55.295 --> 00:51:59.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really liked the ladies driving tractors.

00:52:01.768 --> 00:52:04.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone wanted to have
a part in the project.

00:52:05.038 --> 00:52:07.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every single contribution warmed our hearts

00:52:08.375 --> 00:52:11.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes our heads too.

00:52:12.479 --> 00:52:15.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another beautiful project highlight

00:52:15.348 --> 00:52:17.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the day-volunteer program.

The effort and expense brothers and sisters

00:52:20.453 --> 00:52:22.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sacrificed reminded all of us

00:52:22.923 --> 00:52:26.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what a privilege it is
to work for Jehovah.

00:52:26.626 --> 00:52:29.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how about the commuters
who helped on the project?

00:52:29.763 --> 00:52:32.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would the BRD family have had

00:52:32.165 --> 00:52:34.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the same spirit without our commuters?

00:52:37.170 --> 00:52:41.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you just love being a part
of this amazing family?

00:52:45.178 --> 00:52:48.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were regularly reminded that spirituality

00:52:48.615 --> 00:52:50.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is of the utmost importance.

00:52:51.651 --> 00:52:53.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you ever say that a monthly meeting

00:52:53.653 --> 00:52:55.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the best one yet?

00:52:56.523 --> 00:53:00.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What lies outside the comfort zone

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the faith zone.

00:53:02.562 --> 00:53:04.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t cry because it’s over;

00:53:04.998 --> 00:53:07.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
smile because it happened.

00:53:08.969 --> 00:53:12.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is your story?

00:53:12.339 --> 00:53:15.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The center of all of our stories is Jehovah.

00:53:15.542 --> 00:53:18.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one who energized us;

00:53:18.345 --> 00:53:21.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is the one who gave us
both the desire

00:53:21.047 --> 00:53:23.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the power to act.

00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:25.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is the one we can thank

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:27.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the lifelong friendships we have formed,

00:53:27.587 --> 00:53:29.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the training we have received,

00:53:29.389 --> 00:53:32.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the challenges
we have been able to overcome.

00:53:32.993 --> 00:53:35.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember your story.

00:53:35.962 --> 00:53:39.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, it’s only just beginning.

00:53:48.441 --> 00:53:50.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this month’s program,

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:54.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learned what it means
to pay attention to Jehovah.

00:53:54.881 --> 00:53:58.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how we can stay focused on Jehovah

00:53:58.685 --> 00:54:02.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite potential distractions.

00:54:02.355 --> 00:54:05.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders are good shepherds

00:54:05.292 --> 00:54:07.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they are attentive
to Jehovah’s instruction.

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:13.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our ministry is more effective

00:54:13.767 --> 00:54:17.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we focus
on reaching the hearts of people.

00:54:18.204 --> 00:54:19.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new song

00:54:19.739 --> 00:54:23.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds our young adults
to keep their eyes

00:54:23.643 --> 00:54:27.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the prize of life.

00:54:27.147 --> 00:54:29.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we say goodbye,

00:54:29.549 --> 00:54:32.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s go to the southwest tip of Japan

00:54:32.385 --> 00:54:36.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and visit our brothers and sisters
in the Ishigaki Congregation.

00:54:38.591 --> 00:54:41.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory includes the Yaeyama Islands,

00:54:41.428 --> 00:54:43.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an archipelago

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:47.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 12 islands
and more than 360 coral reefs.

00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:51.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Emerald-green waters
surround these lush,

00:54:51.638 --> 00:54:53.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jungle-covered islands.

00:54:53.640 --> 00:54:55.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With almost no light pollution,

00:54:55.842 --> 00:54:59.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is an ideal place to observe

00:54:59.212 --> 00:55:01.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s beautiful heavenly creation.

00:55:03.483 --> 00:55:08.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Vast distances between the islands
make the ministry a challenge.

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:11.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach remote communities,

00:55:11.057 --> 00:55:15.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
publishers take ferries and small airplanes.

00:55:15.061 --> 00:55:19.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is costly,
and economic conditions here aren’t easy.

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:24.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Transportation includes bicycles

00:55:24.337 --> 00:55:27.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as carts and wagons
pulled by water buffalo.

00:55:29.209 --> 00:55:31.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Public witnessing is an effective way

00:55:31.277 --> 00:55:33.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share the good news

00:55:33.513 --> 00:55:35.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the many tourists who travel here.

00:55:35.515 --> 00:55:37.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than one million

00:55:37.550 --> 00:55:41.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
visited during one recent year.

00:55:41.121 --> 00:55:43.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Contact cards also produce good results.

00:55:45.125 --> 00:55:49.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Ishigaki Congregation has 112 publishers,

00:55:49.396 --> 00:55:53.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including 35 regular pioneers.

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re conducting
more than 100 Bible studies every month.

00:55:59.472 --> 00:56:03.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom Hall
is in Ishigaki City on the main island.

00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:05.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talks from this Kingdom Hall

00:56:05.812 --> 00:56:08.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are streamed to this small meeting place

00:56:08.648 --> 00:56:10.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the seven brothers and sisters

00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:13.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who live on remote Iriomote Island.

00:56:15.755 --> 00:56:19.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers work together
to maintain the Kingdom Hall,

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they enjoy upbuilding association

00:56:23.530 --> 00:56:26.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this beautiful land.

00:56:26.499 --> 00:56:30.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in the Ishigaki Congregation

00:56:30.370 --> 00:56:32.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their warm love and greetings.

00:56:32.405 --> 00:56:34.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters

00:56:34.307 --> 00:56:36.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:39.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
