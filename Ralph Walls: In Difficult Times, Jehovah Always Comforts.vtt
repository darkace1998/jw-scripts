There is no doubt that we’re living

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:06.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in “critical times hard to deal with,”

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.559 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
just as the apostle Paul prophesied

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.596 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
under inspiration in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:18.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times, we’ve read Matthew chapter 24,

00:00:18.568 --> 00:00:21.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark chapter 13, Luke chapter 21,

00:00:21.838 --> 00:00:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Revelation chapter 6.

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:27.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But who would ever have known

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how deeply a pandemic,

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so-called natural disasters,
violence, and unrest

00:00:35.685 --> 00:00:37.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would affect us economically,

00:00:37.887 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physically, and even emotionally?

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:47.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you dear friends
face unimaginable hardships.

00:00:47.497 --> 00:00:51.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many have experienced loss of loved ones,

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:54.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
imprisonment, physical abuse,

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sickness, financial problems,

00:00:56.706 --> 00:00:59.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes a number of these

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:04.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other circumstances all at the same time.

00:01:04.047 --> 00:01:09.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You dear brothers and sisters
are in our prayers.

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:11.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this in mind, the theme for our program

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:15.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “In Difficult Times,

00:01:15.024 --> 00:01:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah Always Comforts.”

00:01:19.095 --> 00:01:22.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that’s become familiar
to Jehovah’s people

00:01:22.732 --> 00:01:27.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is 2 Corinthians 1:3, 4:

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Praised be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:36.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Father of tender mercies

00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the God of all comfort,

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:41.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who comforts us in all our trials

00:01:41.718 --> 00:01:44.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that we may be able to comfort others

00:01:44.354 --> 00:01:47.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in any sort of trial with the comfort

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive from God.”

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:53.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>Study Bible </i> says this

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:58.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding the expression
“the Father of tender mercies”:

00:01:58.468 --> 00:02:01.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Greek noun
rendered ‘tender mercies’ . . .

00:02:01.404 --> 00:02:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is here used to describe a feeling
of compassion,

00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or pity, for others.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:12.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God is called <b>the Father,</b>
or the Source, <b>of tender mercies</b>

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because compassion emanates
from him and is part of his nature.

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:20.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Such tender feelings move him

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to act mercifully in behalf
of his faithful servants

00:02:24.594 --> 00:02:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are suffering tribulation.”

00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:31.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regarding the phrase,
“the God of all comfort,”

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it continues: “The Greek noun . . .
here rendered ‘comfort,’

00:02:36.272 --> 00:02:39.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“literally means ‘a calling to one’s side.’

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It conveys the idea
of standing next to a person,

00:02:43.213 --> 00:02:45.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“helping or encouraging him

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when he is undergoing trials
or feeling sad. . . .

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:51.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God uses his powerful active force

00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:55.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to give comfort and help in situations

00:02:55.191 --> 00:02:59.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that from a human viewpoint seem hopeless.”

00:03:00.096 --> 00:03:02.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about what that means.

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:07.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to know
that whatever we face,

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:10.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is by our side, helping us

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re undergoing any sort of trial.

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, he did not promise
that he’d remove our trials.

00:03:16.813 --> 00:03:20.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, he eases our misery, or grief,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whenever we undergo difficulties.

00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:28.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful word picture
of God standing next to us,

00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:31.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when things seem hopeless!

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We invite you to do a personal study project.

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Using the publication
<i>Research Guide for Jehovah’s Witnesses</i>

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:43.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the <i>Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY™,</i>

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do a word search on “comfort.”

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:50.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will be drawn even closer to Jehovah

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:53.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appreciate his unmatched desire

00:03:53.983 --> 00:03:56.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ability to comfort.

00:03:58.388 --> 00:04:01.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also inspired Paul to show

00:04:01.257 --> 00:04:04.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he would stand by us to comfort us.

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:11.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Romans 15:4:

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:15.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“</b>For all the things
that were written beforehand

00:04:15.738 --> 00:04:18.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were written for our instruction,

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:20.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that through our endurance

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:24.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and through the comfort from the Scriptures

00:04:24.814 --> 00:04:26.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might have hope.”

00:04:26.849 --> 00:04:30.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Comfort from the Scriptures”

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:33.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—time limits us from going
into all of the ways

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:35.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Bible does this.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:38.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s take some examples.

00:04:38.494 --> 00:04:43.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A scripture that Jehovah’s people
have often meditated on in recent times

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is found in Jeremiah chapter 29.

00:04:49.038 --> 00:04:54.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah inspired Jeremiah
to convey his message to the Jews,

00:04:54.043 --> 00:04:56.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had been taken from Jerusalem

00:04:56.846 --> 00:04:59.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were captives in Babylon.

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:01.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were downhearted.

00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:04.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even while in captivity,

00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:07.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided a comforting message.

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice his words

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 29:10:

00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:16.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When 70 years at Babylon are fulfilled,

00:05:16.733 --> 00:05:20.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will turn my attention to you.”

00:05:20.636 --> 00:05:23.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God told these Jewish exiles

00:05:23.306 --> 00:05:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would remain
in captivity for a long time.

00:05:27.276 --> 00:05:32.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he made it clear to them
that he had a peaceful future in mind.

00:05:32.281 --> 00:05:35.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The latter part of that verse says:

00:05:35.251 --> 00:05:38.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And I will make good my promise

00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by bringing you back to this place.”

00:05:40.723 --> 00:05:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 11, he says:

00:05:42.725 --> 00:05:44.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I well know the thoughts

00:05:44.727 --> 00:05:46.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I am thinking toward you,’

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah, ‘thoughts of peace,

00:05:49.399 --> 00:05:51.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and not of calamity,

00:05:51.401 --> 00:05:55.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give you a future and a hope.’”

00:05:55.471 --> 00:05:59.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God did make good
on his promise to those Israelites.

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:03.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He let them know
that their future was to be a bright one.

00:06:03.946 --> 00:06:08.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Regarding Jeremiah 29:11,

00:06:08.384 --> 00:06:11.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one commentary states:

00:06:11.954 --> 00:06:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is difficult to find
a more wonderful promise

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“anywhere in Scripture
that expresses the tender compassion

00:06:20.663 --> 00:06:23.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of Yahweh [Jehovah]

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“toward these exiles
and setting before them, at last,

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a real reason for optimism and expectation.”

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s promise strengthened men

00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:39.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel.

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:43.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah reassured the Jews
by repeating his promise

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:47.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 31:17:

00:06:47.056 --> 00:06:50.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there is a hope for your future . . .

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:54.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your sons will return
to their own territory.”

00:06:55.731 --> 00:07:00.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sure enough, just as Jehovah foretold,

00:07:00.136 --> 00:07:03.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Babylon was conquered
by the Persian King Cyrus,

00:07:03.806 --> 00:07:07.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who allowed the exiled Jews
to return to their homeland.

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After 70 years of captivity,

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were back in Jerusalem.

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah ‘made good on his promise.’

00:07:18.654 --> 00:07:22.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that have to do with us today?

00:07:22.225 --> 00:07:26.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fulfilled promises of Jehovah assure us

00:07:26.696 --> 00:07:30.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that his promises to us will come true

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:33.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in spite of surrounding circumstances.

00:07:33.002 --> 00:07:37.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As he said: “I will make good my promise.”

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:39.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How comforting to know that!

00:07:39.942 --> 00:07:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know that the greatest expression
of Jehovah’s comfort

00:07:44.547 --> 00:07:49.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is his only-begotten Son, Jesus.

00:07:49.218 --> 00:07:52.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During his time on earth,
he gave people hope.

00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:56.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus engaged in a marvelous ministry

00:07:56.292 --> 00:07:59.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—healing the sick, performing powerful works

00:07:59.162 --> 00:08:03.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most important,
teaching people about God’s Kingdom.

00:08:05.134 --> 00:08:10.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the greatest expression
of hope to us humans

00:08:10.139 --> 00:08:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is Jesus’ ransom sacrifice.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through his inspired Word,

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:20.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that Jehovah assures us

00:08:20.683 --> 00:08:24.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he not only understands what we face

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:29.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also desires
to console and strengthen us.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:31.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loving heavenly Father

00:08:31.928 --> 00:08:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially watches over all
who endeavor to do his will.

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:38.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in all of his mercy,

00:08:38.334 --> 00:08:42.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he also draws humble people
who may not yet know him.

00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How many of us were in dire straits

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:49.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only to be introduced to the truth

00:08:49.212 --> 00:08:53.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to get to know Jehovah at the right time?

00:08:53.149 --> 00:08:55.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was no coincidence.

00:08:55.251 --> 00:08:58.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a consequence of Jehovah’s love

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:02.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his desire to give people comfort
through the hope he provides.

00:09:05.294 --> 00:09:07.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we get closer to the great tribulation,

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:15.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will face more distressing circumstances.

00:09:15.605 --> 00:09:17.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during the great tribulation,

00:09:17.873 --> 00:09:21.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our trust in Jehovah must be solid.

00:09:21.644 --> 00:09:24.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be sensitive
and receptive to the ways

00:09:24.747 --> 00:09:27.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in which he consoles and strengthens us.

00:09:27.283 --> 00:09:30.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to keep in mind what Paul says

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:33.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 1:4,

00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:35.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps even memorizing it.

00:09:35.958 --> 00:09:38.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is a God

00:09:38.127 --> 00:09:42.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who comforts us in all our trials.”

00:09:45.301 --> 00:09:48.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some time ago,
we interviewed two longtime members

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:51.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the United States Bethel family:

00:09:51.073 --> 00:09:53.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Gerald Grizzle,

00:09:53.142 --> 00:09:55.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a helper to the Personnel Committee,

00:09:55.811 --> 00:09:58.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Sam Roberson.

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:00.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These two brothers served
as traveling overseers

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many years prior to coming to Bethel.

00:10:03.586 --> 00:10:07.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle has served
at Bethel since 1978,

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:12.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Brother Roberson
has served here for nearly 20 years.

00:10:12.728 --> 00:10:15.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve been assigned
by the Governing Body

00:10:15.164 --> 00:10:19.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to assist them in shepherding
the United States Bethel family.

00:10:19.735 --> 00:10:22.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Shepherding the Bethel family?’ you may ask.

00:10:22.038 --> 00:10:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘After all, Bethelites
don’t have any distressing trials!’

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:29.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen to what our dear brothers have to say.

00:10:29.912 --> 00:10:33.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle,
what are some of the challenges

00:10:33.649 --> 00:10:36.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that members of the Bethel family face?

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:38.721 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The worldwide Bethel family

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:43.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is a representation of the brotherhood.

00:10:43.492 --> 00:10:45.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By that I mean that

00:10:45.661 --> 00:10:49.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just as 1 Peter 5:9 says,

00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:52.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they face ‘the same kind of sufferings

00:10:52.835 --> 00:10:56.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘being experienced by the entire association

00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:58.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers in the world.’

00:10:58.374 --> 00:11:02.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some deal with serious health problems,

00:11:02.611 --> 00:11:05.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they continue to serve.

00:11:05.548 --> 00:11:07.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:11.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have concerns over aging parents,

00:11:11.253 --> 00:11:16.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some have to give up
their beloved Bethel service.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:21.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still others contend
with bouts of depression.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the spirit
of these dear brothers and sisters

00:11:25.668 --> 00:11:30.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
impels them to have the determination

00:11:30.072 --> 00:11:34.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to allow these challenges
to dominate them.

00:11:34.243 --> 00:11:36.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, their faith in Jehovah

00:11:36.746 --> 00:11:39.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strengthens their resolve

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:42.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to focus on their assignments.

00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:43.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for that insight,

00:11:43.786 --> 00:11:45.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle.

00:11:45.821 --> 00:11:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Roberson, how have you been able
to comfort such ones?

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:52.895 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When we find out a Bethelite

00:11:52.895 --> 00:11:54.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is going through a tragedy,

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.233 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
there are four things that we do.

00:11:57.233 --> 00:12:00.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number one, we pray for them

00:12:00.536 --> 00:12:03.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and develop specific spiritual points

00:12:03.639 --> 00:12:06.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to their needs.

00:12:06.242 --> 00:12:09.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s before we make the call.

00:12:09.044 --> 00:12:12.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number two, when we actually make the call,

00:12:12.047 --> 00:12:13.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we really listen.

00:12:13.749 --> 00:12:16.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t mean
we just listen with our ears.

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:19.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to listen with our hearts.

00:12:19.889 --> 00:12:22.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to feel what they feel.

00:12:22.758 --> 00:12:25.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We try to have compassion.

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:29.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Number three, when we use God’s Word

00:12:29.865 --> 00:12:33.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remind them
they’re not facing their crisis alone,

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:35.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is very effective.

00:12:35.137 --> 00:12:38.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
we called on a brother recently

00:12:38.307 --> 00:12:41.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was going through a great trial,

00:12:41.043 --> 00:12:43.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we shared, among other things,

00:12:43.045 --> 00:12:47.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 3:7, 12.

00:12:47.383 --> 00:12:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look at that:

00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:52.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have certainly seen the affliction

00:12:52.221 --> 00:12:54.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of my people who are in Egypt,

00:12:54.723 --> 00:12:56.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I have heard their outcry

00:12:56.725 --> 00:12:59.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of those who force them to work.”

00:12:59.795 --> 00:13:04.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And note the ending point here
—it’s very beautiful.

00:13:04.133 --> 00:13:09.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah doesn’t say,
‘I know how my people feel’;

00:13:09.138 --> 00:13:11.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says: “I <i>well </i> know

00:13:11.474 --> 00:13:14.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the pains [of my people].”

00:13:14.176 --> 00:13:17.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in giving assurance

00:13:17.079 --> 00:13:20.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dealing with Moses
fearing to go before Pharaoh,

00:13:20.883 --> 00:13:24.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in verse 12, just the <i>A</i>  part:

00:13:24.119 --> 00:13:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“To this he said:
‘I will prove to be with you.’”

00:13:30.392 --> 00:13:33.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just a few words but so powerful,

00:13:33.496 --> 00:13:36.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where Jehovah is guaranteeing

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:41.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s going to give them undeniable proof

00:13:41.403 --> 00:13:46.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s backing them up
and never moving away from them one inch.

00:13:46.408 --> 00:13:48.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this gives us comfort.

00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:50.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, number four,

00:13:50.613 --> 00:13:53.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we conclude the call,

00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:56.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have an ending prayer with them.

00:13:56.218 --> 00:13:58.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we use their names,

00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this is very comforting
since we’re calling on Jehovah,

00:14:01.857 --> 00:14:03.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Great Shepherd.

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:06.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Thessalonians 5:14,

00:14:06.629 --> 00:14:09.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says: “We urge you, brothers, to . . .

00:14:09.131 --> 00:14:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“speak consolingly to those
who are depressed,

00:14:12.535 --> 00:14:16.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[to] support the weak,
be patient toward all.”

00:14:16.338 --> 00:14:18.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is exactly what we’re trying to do.

00:14:19.575 --> 00:14:23.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks for sharing those thoughts
—very interesting.

00:14:23.078 --> 00:14:26.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers Grizzle and Roberson:

00:14:26.749 --> 00:14:29.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has comforting others affected you?

00:14:29.552 --> 00:14:31.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Grizzle first, please.

00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:34.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During these challenging times,

00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:38.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I sense Jehovah’s love for his people.

00:14:38.861 --> 00:14:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years,

00:14:40.863 --> 00:14:45.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have seen and experienced his care

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when facing difficult times.

00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:50.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago,

00:14:50.406 --> 00:14:54.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my mother, my brother,

00:14:54.777 --> 00:14:59.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my father in death all within a year.

00:14:59.782 --> 00:15:02.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 2017,

00:15:02.685 --> 00:15:06.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my dear wife, Bonnie,

00:15:06.055 --> 00:15:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after we had served Jehovah together

00:15:08.991 --> 00:15:12.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for nearly 65 years.

00:15:12.494 --> 00:15:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with much prayer,

00:15:14.530 --> 00:15:18.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
research, and love of the friends,

00:15:18.167 --> 00:15:20.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has comforted me.

00:15:20.936 --> 00:15:23.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now, thankfully,

00:15:23.038 --> 00:15:26.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been able
to offer encouragement to others.

00:15:26.508 --> 00:15:27.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very touching, Brother Grizzle,

00:15:27.509 --> 00:15:28.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thank you.

00:15:29.912 --> 00:15:32.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Roberson,
how has comforting others

00:15:32.982 --> 00:15:34.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affected you?

00:15:34.883 --> 00:15:37.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most memorable challenges

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:39.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was while my wife, Linda, and I
were in the circuit work

00:15:39.888 --> 00:15:41.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several years ago.

00:15:41.957 --> 00:15:44.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lost my voice.

00:15:44.193 --> 00:15:47.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to have surgery on my vocal cords,

00:15:47.096 --> 00:15:50.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for six weeks, I could not talk.

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:54.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a circuit overseer,
that’s like being a bird without its wings.

00:15:55.771 --> 00:15:58.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote more notes in that six weeks

00:15:58.974 --> 00:16:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than I had written in my whole life!

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in spite of that
and along with other situations and tragedies

00:16:06.582 --> 00:16:09.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we faced similar to Gerald’s,

00:16:09.284 --> 00:16:12.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has seen us through them all.

00:16:12.054 --> 00:16:14.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And let me say, it’s been a real pleasure

00:16:14.623 --> 00:16:18.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share Jehovah’s comfort with so many.

00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:21.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do,
we see the Governing Body’s interest

00:16:21.563 --> 00:16:23.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all of Jehovah’s people,

00:16:23.599 --> 00:16:26.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including those with added responsibility.

00:16:26.669 --> 00:16:29.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They truly reflect Jehovah’s feelings

00:16:29.905 --> 00:16:32.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “the God of all comfort.”

00:16:32.841 --> 00:16:34.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you, brothers.

00:16:34.943 --> 00:16:37.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really appreciate your comments.

00:16:37.479 --> 00:16:41.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And more than the shepherding that you do

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the example that you have set

00:16:44.219 --> 00:16:46.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in enduring trials,

00:16:46.388 --> 00:16:48.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in experiencing Jehovah’s comfort,

00:16:48.724 --> 00:16:50.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in comforting others.

00:16:50.559 --> 00:16:51.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much.

00:16:53.562 --> 00:16:57.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body has instituted
similar shepherding arrangements

00:16:57.566 --> 00:17:00.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in branch offices around the world.

00:17:02.705 --> 00:17:06.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we want to talk
to some of you in our audience.

00:17:07.509 --> 00:17:11.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of stresses, disappointments,

00:17:11.413 --> 00:17:14.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hurt feelings caused by fellow believers,

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:18.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some have strayed
from Jehovah’s organization.

00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others may have been removed
from the congregation

00:17:22.091 --> 00:17:25.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now would like to return.

00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To you we say:

00:17:27.596 --> 00:17:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Allow Jehovah to comfort and strengthen you.

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:36.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants you to draw close to him,
and he will help you.”

00:17:37.673 --> 00:17:40.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 4:8 says:

00:17:40.743 --> 00:17:43.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Draw close to God,

00:17:43.479 --> 00:17:45.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he will draw close to you.”

00:17:47.082 --> 00:17:51.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has great care for such ones.

00:17:51.053 --> 00:17:53.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what he says

00:17:53.055 --> 00:17:57.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ezekiel 34:16:

00:17:57.993 --> 00:18:02.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The stray I will bring back,

00:18:02.197 --> 00:18:05.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the injured I will bandage,

00:18:05.134 --> 00:18:08.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the weak I will strengthen.”

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some who have recovered have said

00:18:10.639 --> 00:18:13.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that one of the most
difficult things for them to do

00:18:13.208 --> 00:18:16.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was to cross the threshold
of the Kingdom Hall.

00:18:16.678 --> 00:18:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember, it’s Jehovah who bandages you,

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:25.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his sheep, helping you to heal.

00:18:25.053 --> 00:18:29.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the same chapter, in verse 12, he says:

00:18:29.391 --> 00:18:33.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will care for my sheep . . . 

00:18:33.762 --> 00:18:37.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will rescue them from all the places

00:18:37.199 --> 00:18:39.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they were scattered.”

00:18:40.235 --> 00:18:45.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In imitation of that love,
the faithful slave says,

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:49.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We view you as lost sheep,

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:51.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not a lost cause.”

00:18:52.347 --> 00:18:54.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To all we say,

00:18:54.416 --> 00:18:57.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No matter what you face, remember:

00:18:57.219 --> 00:18:59.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In difficult times,

00:18:59.354 --> 00:19:02.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah always comforts.”
