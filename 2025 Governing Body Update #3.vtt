00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:02.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this update,
we will talk about planning now

00:00:06.047 --> 00:00:07.820 line:10% position:50% align:center
for spiritual activities

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.467 line:10% position:50% align:center
over the next few months.

00:00:09.467 --> 00:00:12.595 line:10% position:50% align:center
But first, here are a few updates.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:15.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
On March 28, 2025,

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:18.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
a 7.7 magnitude earthquake

00:00:18.831 --> 00:00:21.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
struck Myanmar and Thailand.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
The epicenter was in Myanmar,
in the city of Mandalay.

00:00:26.234 --> 00:00:29.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many brothers and sisters
had fled to Mandalay

00:00:29.592 --> 00:00:33.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of war
in various parts of the country.

00:00:33.158 --> 00:00:37.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, a married couple
serving as missionaries in Mandalay

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:42.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
died when the apartment building
they were living in collapsed.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:47.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can only imagine the pain and grief
felt by their family members

00:00:47.005 --> 00:00:51.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the many brothers and sisters
who loved them dearly.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray that Jehovah
gives these ones the strength

00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
and comfort they need at this time.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:02.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another missionary couple
living in that same building survived

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
but sustained serious injuries.

00:01:05.023 --> 00:01:07.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have received emergency medical care,

00:01:07.942 --> 00:01:12.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thankfully, they are expected
to make a full recovery.

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:17.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seven other Witnesses
sustained mostly minor injuries.

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:20.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Six homes owned
by our brothers were destroyed,

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:23.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 77 more were damaged.

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:26.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Six Kingdom Halls were also damaged.

00:01:26.461 --> 00:01:29.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Branch Committee
is coordinating relief efforts,

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
including repairs and reconstruction.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
In South America
and in southern and eastern Africa,

00:01:38.723 --> 00:01:42.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of our brothers and sisters
are suffering from famine.

00:01:43.478 --> 00:01:47.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
To address these needs,
we are providing food relief

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:52.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
to over 8,000 brothers and sisters
in six countries.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
We sincerely thank you

00:01:54.885 --> 00:01:57.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your generous contributions

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
that make this relief work possible.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:05.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we continue to support
our brothers and sisters in their challenges,

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:10.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also have some positive news
to share from around the world.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re pleased to inform you

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:16.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
that on February 12, 2025,

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
72-year-old Sister Alganesh Tekle

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:24.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
was released from prison in Eritrea.

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:27.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on March 12, 2025,

00:02:27.417 --> 00:02:31.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
80-year-old Sister Berekti Gebretatyos

00:02:31.421 --> 00:02:33.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
was also released.

00:02:33.528 --> 00:02:36.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have been reunited with their families

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:38.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are receiving the care they need.

00:02:38.783 --> 00:02:42.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both sisters were among
the 23 brothers and sisters

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:46.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
previously reported on who were arrested

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:48.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
in September 2024.

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re also happy to report

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
that six brothers
were recently released from prison

00:02:55.737 --> 00:02:59.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Russia after serving their sentences.

00:02:59.304 --> 00:03:02.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes Brother Dmitriy Golik,

00:03:02.244 --> 00:03:05.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
who served about four years in prison.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon release, Dmitriy was met by his wife

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a group of family members and friends.

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:16.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also recently released
was Brother Inver Siyukhov.

00:03:16.946 --> 00:03:21.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
His sister and her husband
were there to share his joy.

00:03:20.992 --> 00:03:25.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inver spent four years
in a pretrial detention center.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:29.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is a record for the amount of time
that one of our brothers

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
has spent in pretrial detention,

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:37.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
where conditions are often harsher
than a penal colony.

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:40.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite such conditions,

00:03:40.365 --> 00:03:44.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inver gave a good witness by his conduct.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, a fellow prisoner
sent him a letter of gratitude

00:03:49.103 --> 00:03:50.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
that says in part:

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:53.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank you for being you!

00:03:53.775 --> 00:03:57.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are making this world a better place,

00:03:57.278 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“showing by example what we should be

00:04:00.344 --> 00:04:02.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and what we can become.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your eyes always shine with warmth.

00:04:05.787 --> 00:04:10.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Even here, you help people
feel happy at least for a moment.

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You managed to restore my faith in people.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:19.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
This world needs you; we all need you!”

00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:22.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are so proud

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:26.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our imprisoned brothers and sisters!

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although many are enduring harsh conditions,

00:04:29.143 --> 00:04:32.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
they continue to glorify Jehovah

00:04:32.292 --> 00:04:34.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
by their fine conduct.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Matthew 5:16 says:

00:04:38.674 --> 00:04:41.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let your light shine before men,

00:04:41.489 --> 00:04:44.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they may see your fine works

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:47.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give glory to your Father
who is in the heavens.”

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah continue
to strengthen and support

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:54.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of our brothers and sisters

00:04:54.523 --> 00:04:56.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are in prison for their faith.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:00.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s another recent development.

00:05:00.883 --> 00:05:03.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
In March 2025,

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body invited
Branch Committee members

00:05:06.368 --> 00:05:08.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
80 years of age or older

00:05:08.787 --> 00:05:11.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
to consider their circumstances.

00:05:11.477 --> 00:05:16.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, some of these dear brothers
have made a personal decision

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:19.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they will no longer
serve as Branch Committee members.

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:22.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear from a few.

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:25.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Old age sneaks up on you,

00:05:25.846 --> 00:05:28.432 line:10% position:50% align:center
and you don’t realize at times

00:05:28.432 --> 00:05:30.955 line:10% position:50% align:center
the limitations that you have.

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.395 line:10% position:50% align:center
So this was a way for the Governing Body

00:05:33.374 --> 00:05:37.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us to just accept the reality

00:05:37.774 --> 00:05:41.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
of old age and the consequences.

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.177 line:10% position:50% align:center
During my almost 77 years

00:05:44.197 --> 00:05:45.824 line:10% position:50% align:center
of full-time service,

00:05:45.824 --> 00:05:47.805 line:10% position:50% align:center
I have always experienced

00:05:47.805 --> 00:05:49.307 line:10% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s guidance

00:05:49.327 --> 00:05:53.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the faithful slave
brings joy and contentment.

00:05:55.104 --> 00:05:57.857 line:10% position:50% align:center
I truly believe that this arrangement

00:05:57.836 --> 00:06:01.590 line:10% position:50% align:center
is an expression of Jehovah’s deep love.

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if our assignments change in the future,

00:06:06.261 --> 00:06:09.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of what assignment it may be,

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:14.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
this arrangement will be an opportunity
to enjoy our service

00:06:14.165 --> 00:06:17.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
while constantly thinking
about pleasing Jehovah.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:22.173 line:10% position:50% align:center
This is the answer to a prayer;

00:06:22.152 --> 00:06:24.008 line:10% position:50% align:center
we cannot keep up.

00:06:24.008 --> 00:06:27.053 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let somebody else—younger, stronger—

00:06:27.073 --> 00:06:29.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
do the job, and they’re doing it.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes me very happy to see

00:06:31.912 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
younger brothers now on our Branch Committee,

00:06:34.143 --> 00:06:36.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re doing a great job.

00:06:36.145 --> 00:06:40.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know that allowing
for other younger brothers to come in

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it’s going to help the organization.

00:06:43.528 --> 00:06:46.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does help me to appreciate

00:06:46.301 --> 00:06:49.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do what you can and not what you can’t do,

00:06:49.512 --> 00:06:51.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
and love it.

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow Jehovah’s direction;

00:06:53.558 --> 00:06:55.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll always be happy.

00:06:58.626 --> 00:07:01.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body deeply loves

00:07:01.441 --> 00:07:04.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
and respects these dear brothers.

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
If their circumstances permit,

00:07:06.863 --> 00:07:10.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will continue to share
in teaching assignments,

00:07:10.325 --> 00:07:12.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as conducting morning worship,

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:16.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving as branch representatives
at circuit assemblies,

00:07:16.853 --> 00:07:20.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in giving talks at regional conventions.

00:07:20.481 --> 00:07:25.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that way, our brothers and sisters
will continue to benefit

00:07:25.194 --> 00:07:28.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their many years of faithful service.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re all looking forward

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:35.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the 2025 “Pure Worship” Conventions!

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:37.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
This convention series began

00:07:37.852 --> 00:07:42.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
the weekend of May 9-11, 2025,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will continue into early 2026.

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:50.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will include 19 special conventions

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be held in 13 countries.

00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:56.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first special convention
was held the weekend

00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:01.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
of May 9-11 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

00:08:01.397 --> 00:08:05.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peak attendance was 12,380,

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:08.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 177 were baptized.

00:08:09.947 --> 00:08:14.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure we are all looking forward
to attending a convention.

00:08:14.535 --> 00:08:18.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a reminder,
so that everyone can get the most

00:08:18.059 --> 00:08:20.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of the convention program,

00:08:20.333 --> 00:08:24.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body requests
that we all please be seated

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:29.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can listen
to the convention’s musical preludes.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will allow us to prepare
our minds and hearts

00:08:33.616 --> 00:08:36.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the convention program.

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:40.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of conventions,
here’s another update.

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:43.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, the brothers at world headquarters

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:46.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
reviewed the audio and video equipment needs

00:08:46.546 --> 00:08:51.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
for regional conventions
in 20 African branches.

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Outstandingly,

00:08:53.052 --> 00:08:56.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
the attendance in these 20 branch territories

00:08:56.702 --> 00:09:01.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
was nearly two and a half times
the number of publishers!

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:06.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
This represents close to 5 million attendees!

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
But not all of the convention locations

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:12.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
have sufficient audio and video equipment

00:09:12.426 --> 00:09:16.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy the convention program
like our brothers in other lands.

00:09:17.014 --> 00:09:19.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re pleased to inform you

00:09:19.037 --> 00:09:21.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Governing Body has approved to spend

00:09:21.789 --> 00:09:25.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
21.1 million dollars

00:09:25.084 --> 00:09:27.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
over a three-year period

00:09:27.316 --> 00:09:30.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
to purchase
additional audio and video equipment

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:33.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
for conventions in Africa.

00:09:33.447 --> 00:09:36.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
A phased approach will be used to purchase

00:09:36.471 --> 00:09:39.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
and deploy the equipment for Assembly Halls,

00:09:39.578 --> 00:09:43.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
rented facilities, expandable Kingdom Halls,

00:09:43.102 --> 00:09:46.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even open fields.

00:09:46.043 --> 00:09:48.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
For 2026,

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:51.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
the focus will be primarily
on equipping conventions

00:09:51.632 --> 00:09:55.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
with sufficient
audio equipment and generators.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:10:00.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some convention sites
will be prepared to install new video setups

00:10:00.036 --> 00:10:02.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to enhance existing setups.

00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:06.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank you for your generosity

00:10:06.084 --> 00:10:09.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
in making it possible
for us to provide this equipment

00:10:09.712 --> 00:10:13.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will greatly benefit
our brothers and sisters

00:10:13.029 --> 00:10:16.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as many interested ones.

00:10:17.825 --> 00:10:22.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s talk
about planning spiritual activities.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Northern Hemisphere,
as we move into summer,

00:10:26.792 --> 00:10:30.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
many of us will have
our conventions in the weeks ahead.

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in the Southern Hemisphere,

00:10:32.777 --> 00:10:36.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
many conventions will be held
in the next few months.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you may be planning
other activities or possibly vacations too.

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:45.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you look ahead,
what is a good principle to remember?

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:49.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest joy and satisfaction

00:10:49.961 --> 00:10:54.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
will come from giving
to our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:10:54.487 --> 00:10:57.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Proverbs 3:9, 10 says:

00:10:58.094 --> 00:11:01.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Honor Jehovah with your valuable things,

00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:05.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with the firstfruits of all your produce;

00:11:05.289 --> 00:11:09.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then your storehouses
will be completely filled,

00:11:09.021 --> 00:11:13.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your vats will overflow with new wine.”

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:18.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as we plan our activities
for the next few months,

00:11:18.052 --> 00:11:21.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s consider
what opportunities we might have

00:11:21.075 --> 00:11:24.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expand our service to Jehovah.

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones, if you have time off of school
during the next few months,

00:11:29.605 --> 00:11:32.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
could you spend more time in the ministry?

00:11:32.775 --> 00:11:35.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the weeks leading up to each convention,

00:11:35.486 --> 00:11:39.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll invite our neighbors
to attend the convention with us.

00:11:39.824 --> 00:11:44.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s an excellent time
to expand our ministry.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you auxiliary pioneer?

00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:50.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us have fond memories
of auxiliary pioneering

00:11:50.396 --> 00:11:52.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
during school breaks.

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:56.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, this applies
not only to our younger ones.

00:11:56.173 --> 00:12:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us want to consider
if we could auxiliary pioneer.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:04.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we might even be able
to do so as a family.

00:12:04.765 --> 00:12:09.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could we reach out to work some unassigned
or seldom-worked territory?

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:11.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt such activities

00:12:11.876 --> 00:12:16.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
would bring us deep joy and satisfaction.

00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:20.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you young ones
are finishing school in the coming months.

00:12:20.406 --> 00:12:24.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, have you prayerfully
considered the goal

00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:26.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
of regular pioneering?

00:12:26.954 --> 00:12:30.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
The new service year
is just a few months away.

00:12:30.374 --> 00:12:34.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not consider putting in your application?

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are also opportunities to volunteer

00:12:37.818 --> 00:12:40.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Kingdom Hall
maintenance and construction.

00:12:40.551 --> 00:12:43.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you apply to share in this work?

00:12:43.387 --> 00:12:47.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember
that baptized brothers and sisters

00:12:47.433 --> 00:12:50.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
18 years of age and older

00:12:50.248 --> 00:12:53.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
may now apply for Bethel.

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:57.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s another wonderful way
to serve Jehovah.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:01.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is also an excellent time
to think about attending

00:13:01.572 --> 00:13:04.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers (SKE).

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:07.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, the Governing Body encouraged

00:13:07.556 --> 00:13:11.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
young ones to consider
the goal of missionary service.

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:16.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
SKE is the door to missionary service.

00:13:16.545 --> 00:13:20.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you put in your application for SKE?

00:13:20.341 --> 00:13:23.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that baptized brothers and sisters

00:13:23.844 --> 00:13:26.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are at least 21 years of age

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:29.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who have been serving as regular pioneers

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:33.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
for at least two years may apply to attend.

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:38.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many exciting opportunities!

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please carefully consider which ones

00:13:41.799 --> 00:13:44.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be open to you.

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we are also making plans

00:13:47.013 --> 00:13:51.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend a convention
in person if at all possible.

00:13:51.789 --> 00:13:55.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if we have limited health or strength,

00:13:55.209 --> 00:13:58.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
could we attend in person one day

00:13:58.566 --> 00:14:02.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even a half day of the convention?

00:14:02.049 --> 00:14:06.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing so would allow us
the joy of praying together,

00:14:06.407 --> 00:14:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
singing together,

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being with our dear brothers and sisters
in person.

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:18.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this update,
we have considered a variety of ways

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can be busy in spiritual activities.

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:26.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
With good planning,
we can accomplish much!

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our prayer for all of you

00:14:28.971 --> 00:14:33.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
is contained in the words of Psalm 20:4,
which says:

00:14:34.498 --> 00:14:38.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May he grant you the desires of your heart

00:14:38.397 --> 00:14:42.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give success to all your plans.”

00:14:42.923 --> 00:14:47.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
we love you all very much.

00:14:47.553 --> 00:14:51.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:14:51.243 --> 00:14:54.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.
