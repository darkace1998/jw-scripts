Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a glimpse of what’s ahead.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you do
when a situation seems hopeless?

00:00:10.948 --> 00:00:12.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll meet three young people

00:00:12.908 --> 00:00:15.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Congo (Kinshasa) whose Christian hope

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
stabilized them when disaster struck.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does the stress of this world

00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:24.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes follow you home
and weigh on your marriage?

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:27.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll examine a Bible principle
that can strengthen

00:00:27.214 --> 00:00:30.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
your relationship and preserve your home

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:33.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a haven of peace.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:34.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we have doubts

00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:38.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
from time to time, they need not weaken us.

00:00:38.976 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our music video this month will

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:42.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
inspire us to feed our faith.

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:48.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the March 2024 edition
of JW Broadcasting!

00:01:07.963 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our theme this month is “Feed Your Hope.”

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.220 line:10% position:50% align:center
Hope is essential for peace,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.223 line:10% position:50% align:center
happiness, courage, and life.

00:01:18.223 --> 00:01:20.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is hope?

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:22.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Bible uses the word “hope,”

00:01:22.353 --> 00:01:26.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s referring not only
to the desire for something good

00:01:26.857 --> 00:01:30.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to the basis
for believing it will happen.

00:01:30.903 --> 00:01:35.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
So hope is more than just wishful thinking
or even expectation.

00:01:35.074 --> 00:01:37.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s based on fact.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:39.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s evidence to back it up.

00:01:39.954 --> 00:01:42.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, true hope
can come only from the One

00:01:42.998 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has the power to fulfill
whatever he promises—Jehovah God.

00:01:47.461 --> 00:01:51.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provides hope in abundance.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what Romans 15:13 says about Jehovah:

00:01:55.636 --> 00:01:59.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the God who gives hope

00:01:59.682 --> 00:02:03.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fill you with all joy and peace

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by your trusting in him,

00:02:05.145 --> 00:02:07.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may abound in hope

00:02:07.272 --> 00:02:09.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
with power of holy spirit.”

00:02:10.192 --> 00:02:12.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah gives us what we need

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “abound in hope.”

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:18.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, the apostle Paul also wrote,

00:02:18.492 --> 00:02:21.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Colossians 1:23,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a Christian could be
“shifted away from the hope.”

00:02:24.957 --> 00:02:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we must never take our hope for granted.

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to feed it.

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:32.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you need to feed hope?

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:36.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two things are mentioned at Romans 15:4:

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:40.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all the things that were written beforehand

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:43.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were written for our instruction,

00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:46.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that through our endurance

00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:50.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and through the comfort from the Scriptures

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:52.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might have hope.”

00:02:53.402 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
So did you notice what feeds hope?

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:58.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our endurance”

00:02:58.991 --> 00:03:02.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “the comfort from the Scriptures.”

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:05.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures
—what we take into our minds

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
is vital to keeping our hope strong.

00:03:08.125 --> 00:03:12.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, recall what happened
shortly after Jesus was executed,

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded in Luke chapter 24.

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:16.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is part of the conversation

00:03:16.508 --> 00:03:20.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
between an unidentified traveler
and the disheartened disciples.

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:24.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples were beside themselves
with grief over Jesus’ death.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
The traveler, though,
was in fact the resurrected Jesus.

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:30.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples didn’t yet realize this.

00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:34.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they said, as recorded at Luke 24:21:

00:03:34.985 --> 00:03:38.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But we were hoping that this man was the one

00:03:38.655 --> 00:03:40.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who was going to deliver Israel.

00:03:40.866 --> 00:03:43.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, and besides all these things,

00:03:43.035 --> 00:03:46.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is the third day since these things occurred.”

00:03:47.122 --> 00:03:52.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
This scripture shows just how susceptible
we can be to discouragement

00:03:52.127 --> 00:03:55.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
when things don’t turn out as we expect.

00:03:55.714 --> 00:03:58.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what Jesus did to help them

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:02.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 25-27:

00:04:02.346 --> 00:04:05.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he said to them:
‘O senseless ones

00:04:05.641 --> 00:04:09.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and slow of heart to believe all the things
the prophets have spoken!

00:04:09.937 --> 00:04:13.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Was it not necessary
for the Christ to suffer these things

00:04:13.774 --> 00:04:15.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to enter into his glory?’

00:04:15.818 --> 00:04:18.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And starting with Moses

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all the Prophets,

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he interpreted to them things

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:27.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
pertaining to himself in all the Scriptures.”

00:04:27.496 --> 00:04:31.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Jesus feed their hope?

00:04:31.333 --> 00:04:34.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, by showing them that they were right

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hope in the fulfillment of the Scriptures

00:04:37.047 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then by teaching them
how those Scriptures had been fulfilled.

00:04:42.261 --> 00:04:44.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we do the same today?

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re facing challenges
that threaten our hope,

00:04:48.767 --> 00:04:52.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should ask Jehovah for guidance
by means of his holy spirit,

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then, with the help of the publications
of “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:59.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should meditate carefully
on how the Scriptures are being fulfilled.

00:05:01.196 --> 00:05:04.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be difficult to find time for this
in these hectic days.

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:09.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many claims on our attention
—so many things to know and do.

00:05:10.622 --> 00:05:13.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what you take into your mind

00:05:13.208 --> 00:05:16.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
is vital to keeping your hope alive.

00:05:18.255 --> 00:05:21.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
The humanitarian crises facing mankind today

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:24.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
could make any one of us feel anxious.

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:28.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Experts in fields of technology,
finance, and government

00:05:28.098 --> 00:05:30.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
have found it necessary to coin new words

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:33.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
to convey the gravity of the situation.

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:35.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2023,

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:40.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
the word “polycrisis” began to soar in usage.

00:05:40.694 --> 00:05:42.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
A polycrisis refers

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:46.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
to many global threats
happening at the same time

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the overlapping of health emergencies,

00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:52.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
climate change, wars, forced migrations,

00:05:52.623 --> 00:05:55.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters, and economic collapse

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
all happening simultaneously.

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:00.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
A polycrisis

00:06:00.547 --> 00:06:04.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
could throw a person
off balance spiritually.

00:06:04.927 --> 00:06:07.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as students
of Jesus’ sign of the last days,

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:10.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have fully anticipated
that there would be

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:15.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
many serious problems
facing mankind at the same time

00:06:15.687 --> 00:06:18.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and on an unprecedented scale.

00:06:18.398 --> 00:06:20.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
But isn’t it interesting

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the world itself has seen fit
to come up with an expression

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:26.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
that adequately matches
what we are going through?

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether they realize it or not,

00:06:29.117 --> 00:06:33.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re acknowledging
that Jesus’ words are being fulfilled.

00:06:33.914 --> 00:06:37.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
So rather than become eaten up by anxiety,

00:06:37.918 --> 00:06:42.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can find hope in these very same facts

00:06:42.005 --> 00:06:44.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if we meditate

00:06:44.716 --> 00:06:48.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the fulfillment of the Scriptures.

00:06:49.388 --> 00:06:53.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures contain the promise of God

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:56.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a promise of salvation.

00:06:56.436 --> 00:07:00.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah God . . . [will] bring to ruin
those ruining the earth.”

00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:04.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is going to be a resurrection.”

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:06.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Death will be no more.”

00:07:06.697 --> 00:07:11.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The righteous will possess the earth,
and they will live forever on it.”

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:14.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understanding how the Scriptures apply

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:18.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they’re fulfilled builds our faith.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stronger our faith is,
the stronger our hope will be

00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
because “faith is the assured

00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:31.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
[the assured] expectation
of what is hoped for.”

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:35.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think often about your hope?

00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:39.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you meditate on what it means?

00:07:39.187 --> 00:07:42.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Thessalonians 5:8 says:

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:45.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let us . . . put on . . .
the hope of salvation

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:47.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a helmet.”

00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:50.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a helmet protects the head,

00:07:50.115 --> 00:07:52.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
so hope protects the mind.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who of us does not need such a helmet?

00:07:56.872 --> 00:08:01.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you have a favorite Kingdom song
or original song from jw.org

00:08:01.209 --> 00:08:05.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
that keeps Jehovah’s promises
shining brightly in your mind.

00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:09.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you recall that song,
you’re feeding your hope,

00:08:09.301 --> 00:08:12.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
which in turn guards your thinking.

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:16.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hope has to be so real to us

00:08:16.308 --> 00:08:18.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can see ourselves in the new world

00:08:18.727 --> 00:08:22.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no longer battling illness and depression,

00:08:22.564 --> 00:08:25.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
but waking up each day with better hearing,

00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:29.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
better vision, better looks, better outlooks;

00:08:29.696 --> 00:08:32.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
no longer mourning the death of those we love

00:08:32.908 --> 00:08:37.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather, experiencing the thrill
of seeing them come back to life.

00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:42.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the longest life span
you’ve ever heard of?

00:08:42.459 --> 00:08:46.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the greatest number you can think of?

00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:48.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now combine the two concepts.

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:50.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living for—

00:08:50.634 --> 00:08:54.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we could attempt to explain
googolplexes of galactic millenniums.

00:08:54.638 --> 00:08:58.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact is that no matter
how great a period of time

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:00.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can possibly fathom,

00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:04.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises us life
that cannot be defined by any number

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:07.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it never stops.

00:09:07.234 --> 00:09:09.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what the Bible means

00:09:09.236 --> 00:09:12.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
by its many references to everlasting life.

00:09:13.698 --> 00:09:16.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Visualize a project

00:09:16.618 --> 00:09:19.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would take several thousand years

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:21.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
to plan and complete.

00:09:21.957 --> 00:09:25.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of forests would you like to grow?

00:09:25.168 --> 00:09:29.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine having millions of years to observe,

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
analyze, and draw new conclusions

00:09:31.842 --> 00:09:35.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s activities and creative works.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
What possibilities exist

00:09:37.722 --> 00:09:41.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an earth filled with loyal, loving people

00:09:41.393 --> 00:09:45.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cooperate with the many systems
Jehovah has created?

00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:48.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of knowledge
would you like to acquire

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is currently out of reach
because of our limited life span?

00:09:53.071 --> 00:09:55.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will it be like to build

00:09:55.365 --> 00:09:59.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the knowledge of hundreds of generations?

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:02.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Picture whom you will meet
in the resurrection.

00:10:02.747 --> 00:10:06.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we think of family members
and faithful ones of old.

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
But consider what it will be like

00:10:09.171 --> 00:10:11.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand how you are related

00:10:11.798 --> 00:10:14.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
to every person on this planet

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:17.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all the way back to the beginning!

00:10:17.512 --> 00:10:22.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine all intelligent creation
in heaven and on earth

00:10:22.434 --> 00:10:27.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
united as one happy family praising Jehovah!

00:10:29.316 --> 00:10:31.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this just wishful thinking?

00:10:31.943 --> 00:10:34.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
happy thoughts? a dream?

00:10:34.863 --> 00:10:37.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, this is hope.

00:10:37.616 --> 00:10:42.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s meditation on the promise of God,
“who cannot lie”;

00:10:42.621 --> 00:10:46.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditation on what he has done
to fulfill his promise

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:49.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
—providing the ransom
and establishing a heavenly Kingdom

00:10:49.336 --> 00:10:51.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will bring mankind back to perfection;

00:10:51.922 --> 00:10:55.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditation on Jehovah’s personality

00:10:55.008 --> 00:10:59.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a personality revealed
in his creative works, in the Scriptures,

00:10:59.387 --> 00:11:02.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
and mirrored perfectly
by his only-begotten Son—

00:11:02.516 --> 00:11:07.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
a personality we know
not only through deep study

00:11:07.062 --> 00:11:10.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also through our own experience.

00:11:10.315 --> 00:11:14.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this leads us
to the second way we feed our hope.

00:11:14.986 --> 00:11:17.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recall that Romans 15:4 said

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are two ways to feed your hope

00:11:20.283 --> 00:11:22.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“through the comfort from the Scriptures”

00:11:22.619 --> 00:11:26.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also “through our endurance.”

00:11:26.456 --> 00:11:30.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does endurance feed your hope?

00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:32.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice what Paul said about this

00:11:32.462 --> 00:11:36.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
back at Romans 5:3-5:

00:11:38.343 --> 00:11:41.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not only that,

00:11:41.179 --> 00:11:45.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but let us rejoice while in tribulations,

00:11:45.225 --> 00:11:49.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“since we know that tribulation
produces endurance;

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:52.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“endurance, in turn, an approved condition;

00:11:52.774 --> 00:11:55.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the approved condition, in turn, hope,

00:11:55.569 --> 00:11:57.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the hope

00:11:57.612 --> 00:12:00.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not lead to disappointment.”

00:12:00.991 --> 00:12:02.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the “hope” mentioned here

00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:05.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
is referring not to our initial hope.

00:12:05.287 --> 00:12:07.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
We already had that when we learned

00:12:07.289 --> 00:12:09.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
the promise of God
contained in the Scriptures.

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:13.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why Paul begins verse 3
with the words “not only that.”

00:12:13.128 --> 00:12:17.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, not only do we rejoice
in our initial hope

00:12:17.173 --> 00:12:20.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we rejoice in our reinforced hope

00:12:20.135 --> 00:12:24.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hope made even stronger
through new experiences with Jehovah

00:12:24.431 --> 00:12:27.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
as our personal Helper.

00:12:27.517 --> 00:12:32.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the only way
to understand this process fully

00:12:32.314 --> 00:12:34.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by going through it.

00:12:34.566 --> 00:12:36.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s been your experience?

00:12:36.901 --> 00:12:40.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have you done
when undergoing tribulation?

00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:43.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you turned to Jehovah for help.

00:12:43.617 --> 00:12:45.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then what happened?

00:12:45.243 --> 00:12:46.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped you.

00:12:46.661 --> 00:12:49.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, the trial
might not have disappeared,

00:12:49.581 --> 00:12:51.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you discovered

00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:55.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you somehow
had the strength to endure it,

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:57.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the wisdom to manage it,

00:12:57.964 --> 00:13:02.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
or practical aid or encouragement
at just the right time,

00:13:02.052 --> 00:13:06.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the courage
to continue bearing witness to the truth.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:11.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you feel in that moment?

00:13:11.144 --> 00:13:16.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you sense
that Jehovah heard your prayer?

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:18.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you perceive Jehovah reassuring you

00:13:18.818 --> 00:13:22.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you and he have a relationship?

00:13:22.614 --> 00:13:25.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you go through that
—even once—

00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:28.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
you no longer wonder
whether you could endure a crisis.

00:13:28.995 --> 00:13:31.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know you can with Jehovah’s help.

00:13:31.998 --> 00:13:34.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is hope

00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:37.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not simply a desire for something good,

00:13:37.128 --> 00:13:40.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the basis for believing it will happen.

00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:44.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our dear brothers and sisters

00:13:44.094 --> 00:13:48.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
have built up a lifetime of such experiences.

00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:50.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why their hope hasn’t weakened

00:13:50.433 --> 00:13:53.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite waiting for the new world
for decades.

00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
To the contrary, their hope
has been strengthened through experience.

00:13:57.273 --> 00:14:02.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
They know firsthand
what Romans 5:3-5 is talking about

00:14:02.112 --> 00:14:05.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and likely you do as well.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank God for hope!

00:14:08.827 --> 00:14:11.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is “the God who gives hope.”

00:14:11.746 --> 00:14:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never become
“shifted away from [our] hope.”

00:14:15.625 --> 00:14:19.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
When difficulties arise, feed your hope!

00:14:19.254 --> 00:14:22.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to meditate
on “the comfort from the Scriptures.”

00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:26.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep trusting in Jehovah
for strength and wisdom.

00:14:26.886 --> 00:14:31.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And each day,
take note of how he reassures you

00:14:31.850 --> 00:14:35.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
that hope
—your hope—

00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:37.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
is real.

00:14:38.064 --> 00:14:40.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can read and listen to so many accounts

00:14:40.859 --> 00:14:42.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
right here on jw.org

00:14:42.944 --> 00:14:45.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your brothers and sisters
who are going through

00:14:45.530 --> 00:14:48.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
this exact process.

00:14:48.658 --> 00:14:53.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear from three young people
in Congo (Kinshasa) right now.

00:14:55.248 --> 00:14:58.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
We began to hear a lot of noise outside.

00:15:00.044 --> 00:15:02.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I came out, I saw volcano fire.

00:15:02.922 --> 00:15:05.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw many people running.

00:15:05.216 --> 00:15:07.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was the only grown-up at home at the time.

00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:09.429 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was very afraid

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:10.638 line:10% position:50% align:center
because it was my first time

00:15:10.638 --> 00:15:12.098 line:10% position:50% align:center
seeing such a disaster.

00:15:13.057 --> 00:15:15.727 line:10% position:50% align:center
Before the war, we had many things.

00:15:16.603 --> 00:15:20.440 line:10% position:50% align:center
But it became worse in July 2017.

00:15:25.987 --> 00:15:28.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we left,

00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:30.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our goods were destroyed.

00:15:34.621 --> 00:15:36.748 line:10% position:50% align:center
When we heard that there would be war

00:15:36.748 --> 00:15:39.000 line:10% position:50% align:center
at our village,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.044 line:10% position:50% align:center
people were very afraid.

00:15:43.296 --> 00:15:46.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t take many things,
and we went to Uganda.

00:15:51.179 --> 00:15:53.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the morning,
we were informed

00:15:53.473 --> 00:15:56.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our house was among the houses
destroyed by the volcano.

00:15:58.102 --> 00:16:01.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
This news affected us very much
because when we left,

00:16:01.648 --> 00:16:03.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
we took nothing.

00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:05.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we lost everything.

00:16:06.152 --> 00:16:08.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we were running away,

00:16:08.321 --> 00:16:11.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
my father said that we must go to the beach
to look for a boat.

00:16:13.117 --> 00:16:15.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was on a motorbike.

00:16:17.038 --> 00:16:20.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had an accident, and he was wounded.

00:16:21.251 --> 00:16:24.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
That wound made him suffer for a time,

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:27.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that lead to his death.

00:16:31.970 --> 00:16:34.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
We fled from Blukwa to Bunia.

00:16:34.806 --> 00:16:37.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bunia is very far from Blukwa.

00:16:41.312 --> 00:16:43.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were very afraid
because in Bunia,

00:16:43.731 --> 00:16:48.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
we didn’t have a field
and we didn’t have a house.

00:16:48.027 --> 00:16:50.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wondered,
‘How will we live in Bunia?’

00:16:53.616 --> 00:16:57.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way the brothers and sisters helped me
strengthened my faith.

00:16:59.455 --> 00:17:02.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
That strong faith made me joyful.

00:17:02.166 --> 00:17:04.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we came back to Congo,

00:17:04.168 --> 00:17:06.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
I continued studying until I got baptized.

00:17:13.887 --> 00:17:17.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization did much,
very much, for us.

00:17:19.434 --> 00:17:22.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, they took care of us
spiritually and physically.

00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:27.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second,
they gave us a place to live, a home.

00:17:28.192 --> 00:17:31.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of that,
I am so thankful to Jehovah.

00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:39.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped at that period of time

00:17:39.704 --> 00:17:43.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the thought we find
at Psalm 46:1, 2.

00:17:44.459 --> 00:17:48.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
That scripture shows
that “God is our refuge.”

00:17:49.756 --> 00:17:54.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have nothing to fear
even though the world changes.

00:17:55.386 --> 00:17:58.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even though ‘the mountain topples
to the depths of the sea,’

00:17:58.890 --> 00:18:01.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
we cannot fear.

00:18:01.059 --> 00:18:04.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I saw the fulfillment of that scripture
in my life.

00:18:11.945 --> 00:18:15.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though I’ve had difficult circumstances
in my life,

00:18:15.782 --> 00:18:18.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cannot give up.

00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:21.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will serve Jehovah for all my life.

00:18:23.289 --> 00:18:25.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I’m feeling very well.

00:18:27.293 --> 00:18:30.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am very happy
to be in Jehovah’s organization.

00:18:30.338 --> 00:18:33.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m determined to serve Jehovah all my days

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:35.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to keep my integrity.

00:18:36.719 --> 00:18:39.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided to show Jehovah

00:18:39.013 --> 00:18:41.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
the same love and happiness shown to me.

00:18:41.724 --> 00:18:43.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I’m a regular pioneer.

00:18:45.144 --> 00:18:47.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I’m an auxiliary pioneer.

00:18:51.067 --> 00:18:52.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I’m a regular pioneer

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:56.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a ministerial servant
in our congregation.

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also work as a remote volunteer for Bethel.

00:19:08.626 --> 00:19:11.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Huguette, Espérance, and Moïse

00:19:11.629 --> 00:19:15.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusted in Jehovah
during a time of great distress,

00:19:15.425 --> 00:19:18.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their hope grew stronger as a result.

00:19:20.722 --> 00:19:23.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time we see Jehovah fulfill a promise,

00:19:23.975 --> 00:19:26.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
it strengthens our hope.

00:19:26.144 --> 00:19:28.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this episode of <i>Our History in Motion,</i>

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
see how theocratic building projects
show evidence of Jehovah’s blessing.

00:19:36.404 --> 00:19:38.197 line:10% position:50% align:center
To advance true worship

00:19:38.197 --> 00:19:39.907 line:10% position:50% align:center
and spread the good news,

00:19:39.907 --> 00:19:42.493 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people must build.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.122 line:10% position:50% align:center
Theocratic building projects

00:19:46.122 --> 00:19:47.623 line:10% position:50% align:center
strengthen our faith

00:19:47.623 --> 00:19:49.333 line:10% position:50% align:center
and feed our hope.

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:50.752 line:10% position:50% align:center
How?

00:19:50.752 --> 00:19:53.046 line:10% position:50% align:center
Let’s see in this episode

00:19:53.046 --> 00:19:55.965 line:10% position:50% align:center
of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:20:04.766 --> 00:20:06.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
In ancient times,

00:20:06.309 --> 00:20:08.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah was moved to exclaim:

00:20:08.478 --> 00:20:12.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The good hand of my God was upon me.”

00:20:12.106 --> 00:20:14.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, against daunting odds,

00:20:14.692 --> 00:20:16.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provided what was needed

00:20:16.819 --> 00:20:20.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the right time to advance pure worship.

00:20:20.198 --> 00:20:23.409 line:10% position:50% align:center
The same has proved true in modern times.

00:20:24.035 --> 00:20:27.330 line:10% position:50% align:center
As the significant year 1914 approached,

00:20:27.330 --> 00:20:30.124 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Bible Students, as we were then called,

00:20:30.124 --> 00:20:33.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
prepared for an all-out preaching campaign

00:20:33.086 --> 00:20:35.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
to publicize the long-hoped-for fulfillment

00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Bible prophecy.

00:20:37.882 --> 00:20:41.135 line:10% position:50% align:center
So in 1909, C. T. Russell

00:20:41.135 --> 00:20:42.887 line:10% position:50% align:center
moved world headquarters

00:20:42.887 --> 00:20:45.973 line:10% position:50% align:center
from Pennsylvania to Brooklyn, New York.

00:20:45.973 --> 00:20:48.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two newly purchased and renovated buildings,

00:20:48.893 --> 00:20:51.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
renamed Bethel and the Brooklyn Tabernacle,

00:20:51.813 --> 00:20:54.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
accommodated the increased workload.

00:20:54.524 --> 00:20:56.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the time though,

00:20:56.234 --> 00:20:57.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
some thought the preaching work

00:20:57.693 --> 00:20:59.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
would end with the birth of the Kingdom

00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:01.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1914.

00:21:01.072 --> 00:21:02.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little did they realize

00:21:02.782 --> 00:21:04.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much work remained to be done.

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:07.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Opposition to the Kingdom work

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:09.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
sparked by World War I

00:21:09.872 --> 00:21:11.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
peaked with the imprisonment

00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:14.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
of eight responsible brothers in 1918.

00:21:15.086 --> 00:21:18.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Combined with the wartime
shortages of supplies,

00:21:18.339 --> 00:21:22.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
it appeared impossible
to continue operations in Brooklyn.

00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:25.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Brooklyn Tabernacle was sold.

00:21:25.096 --> 00:21:29.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
But efforts to sell
124 Columbia Heights failed.

00:21:30.059 --> 00:21:32.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had plans for it.

00:21:33.062 --> 00:21:36.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 1920’s saw
a renewed zeal for the ministry

00:21:36.649 --> 00:21:38.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
and consequently a massive increase

00:21:38.985 --> 00:21:41.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the publication and distribution

00:21:41.279 --> 00:21:43.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
of books and magazines.

00:21:43.406 --> 00:21:45.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than using commercial printers

00:21:45.408 --> 00:21:47.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
to produce our literature,

00:21:47.243 --> 00:21:50.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
the decision was made to print it ourselves.

00:21:50.329 --> 00:21:53.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
This required
an expanded presence in Brooklyn.

00:21:53.624 --> 00:21:56.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
After outgrowing a small printery
in a rented building

00:21:56.961 --> 00:21:58.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then outgrowing another,

00:21:58.963 --> 00:22:02.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
construction commenced
on a new eight-story factory

00:22:02.425 --> 00:22:03.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
just a few blocks away

00:22:03.885 --> 00:22:05.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the expanded Brooklyn Bethel.

00:22:09.056 --> 00:22:11.225 line:10% position:50% align:center
Just over a decade later,

00:22:11.225 --> 00:22:13.186 line:10% position:50% align:center
during World War II,

00:22:13.186 --> 00:22:16.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hitler had built
his infamous concentration camps

00:22:16.814 --> 00:22:20.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persecution of our brothers
increased around the world.

00:22:20.193 --> 00:22:21.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite that,

00:22:21.819 --> 00:22:23.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of Kingdom publishers

00:22:23.738 --> 00:22:25.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
doubled during the war!

00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:29.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knew this was no time to slow down.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:34.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1940, construction began
on a three-story building

00:22:34.749 --> 00:22:38.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Kingdom Farm in South Lansing, New York.

00:22:38.127 --> 00:22:40.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what would it be used for?

00:22:40.588 --> 00:22:42.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only Jehovah knew.

00:22:42.882 --> 00:22:46.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1943, the war had made

00:22:46.093 --> 00:22:48.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
building materials extremely scarce,

00:22:48.721 --> 00:22:51.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the brothers
had already finished construction.

00:22:51.599 --> 00:22:56.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wanted it used
as the school to train missionaries:

00:22:56.103 --> 00:22:59.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:22:59.607 --> 00:23:01.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
This marked the beginning of a period

00:23:01.609 --> 00:23:03.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
of astounding growth.

00:23:03.945 --> 00:23:07.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
To keep pace with the ever-increasing demand
for Bible literature,

00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:10.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1955 construction began

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:13.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a second Brooklyn factory building.

00:23:13.371 --> 00:23:17.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, the printery complex
covered five city blocks.

00:23:18.918 --> 00:23:20.962 line:10% position:50% align:center
In a 22-year period,

00:23:20.962 --> 00:23:23.005 line:10% position:50% align:center
the number of Kingdom publishers worldwide

00:23:23.005 --> 00:23:24.423 line:10% position:50% align:center
tripled.

00:23:24.423 --> 00:23:27.051 line:10% position:50% align:center
In 1971, a printery was constructed

00:23:27.051 --> 00:23:29.637 line:10% position:50% align:center
at Watchtower Farms in upstate New York

00:23:29.637 --> 00:23:32.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has expanded several times over the years

00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:35.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
to increase its printing capacity.

00:23:35.226 --> 00:23:37.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the mid-1980’s,

00:23:37.395 --> 00:23:39.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Argentina to Zimbabwe,

00:23:39.814 --> 00:23:41.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
we expanded our facilities

00:23:41.857 --> 00:23:45.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
at more than 40 branches around the world.

00:23:46.404 --> 00:23:50.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
As stated in the January 1, 1986, <i>Watchtower:</i>

00:23:50.616 --> 00:23:54.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There appears to be no end
to the modern-day expansion . . . 

00:23:54.787 --> 00:23:57.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s organization is building

00:23:57.915 --> 00:24:00.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
for an eternal future.”

00:24:01.335 --> 00:24:05.339 line:10% position:50% align:center
Currently, in Africa 13 branch facilities

00:24:05.339 --> 00:24:07.508 line:10% position:50% align:center
need to be enlarged or renovated.

00:24:07.508 --> 00:24:09.427 line:10% position:50% align:center
Over 50 approved

00:24:09.427 --> 00:24:11.554 line:10% position:50% align:center
remote translation office projects

00:24:11.554 --> 00:24:12.972 line:10% position:50% align:center
are being developed.

00:24:12.972 --> 00:24:14.432 line:10% position:50% align:center
And in order to keep up

00:24:14.432 --> 00:24:16.017 line:10% position:50% align:center
with publisher growth,

00:24:16.017 --> 00:24:19.520 line:10% position:50% align:center
over five major Kingdom Hall projects

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:23.107 line:10% position:50% align:center
need to be completed every single day!

00:24:23.107 --> 00:24:25.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are producing more videos,

00:24:25.318 --> 00:24:27.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of which feed our hope.

00:24:27.361 --> 00:24:30.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means we need more studio space.

00:24:30.656 --> 00:24:34.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since 2015, studios have been constructed

00:24:34.493 --> 00:24:37.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States, Canada, Britain,

00:24:37.997 --> 00:24:41.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
South Africa, and most recently Australasia,

00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:43.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
where <i>The Good News According to Jesus </i>

00:24:43.836 --> 00:24:45.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
is being produced.

00:24:45.504 --> 00:24:48.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
And coming soon is the new media center

00:24:48.841 --> 00:24:50.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ramapo, New York.

00:24:51.635 --> 00:24:54.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have overwhelming evidence

00:24:54.347 --> 00:24:55.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah directs

00:24:55.931 --> 00:24:58.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
his people’s building work.

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:00.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can be confident

00:25:00.728 --> 00:25:02.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good hand of [Jehovah]”

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue upon us

00:25:05.399 --> 00:25:08.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we build for an eternal future!

00:25:17.244 --> 00:25:19.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has blessed our efforts

00:25:19.288 --> 00:25:21.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build and advance Kingdom interests,

00:25:21.957 --> 00:25:24.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our most important building effort

00:25:24.335 --> 00:25:27.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
will always be our faith.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever wondered
if you could endure a severe trial,

00:25:31.092 --> 00:25:33.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as persecution?

00:25:33.344 --> 00:25:36.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please listen as Brother Mark Sanderson
of the Governing Body

00:25:36.305 --> 00:25:40.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
explains how we can receive peace
in any situation.

00:25:41.644 --> 00:25:44.647 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our text this morning is so encouraging

00:25:44.647 --> 00:25:47.817 line:10% position:50% align:center
and so strengthening for us.

00:25:47.817 --> 00:25:51.779 line:10% position:50% align:center
It reminds us of a special type of peace

00:25:51.779 --> 00:25:53.781 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we can experience

00:25:53.781 --> 00:25:57.326 line:10% position:50% align:center
that’s not dependent on our circumstances

00:25:57.326 --> 00:26:00.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
or on what’s going on around us.

00:26:01.205 --> 00:26:05.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you define
that “peace of God”

00:26:05.042 --> 00:26:07.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s referred to in our text?

00:26:07.336 --> 00:26:09.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
What exactly is it?

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, <i>Insight, </i>Volume 2,
page 592,

00:26:13.843 --> 00:26:15.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
says this:

00:26:15.886 --> 00:26:17.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The peace of God,’

00:26:17.888 --> 00:26:21.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is the calmness
and tranquility that result

00:26:21.851 --> 00:26:26.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from a Christian’s precious relationship
with Jehovah God,

00:26:26.856 --> 00:26:30.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“guards his heart and mental powers

00:26:30.025 --> 00:26:33.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from becoming anxious about his needs.

00:26:33.737 --> 00:26:38.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He has the assurance that Jehovah God
provides for his servants

00:26:38.492 --> 00:26:41.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and answers their prayers.

00:26:41.537 --> 00:26:45.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
This puts his heart and mind at rest.”

00:26:46.041 --> 00:26:49.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, now, what do you understand
from that definition?

00:26:49.753 --> 00:26:52.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, if we look
at Philippians chapter 4

00:26:52.548 --> 00:26:56.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look at verses 6 and 7 together,

00:26:56.343 --> 00:26:58.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
we understand from those verses

00:26:58.345 --> 00:27:01.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when we pour out
our heart to Jehovah,

00:27:01.849 --> 00:27:03.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we supplicate him,

00:27:03.934 --> 00:27:07.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we beg him for his help,

00:27:07.396 --> 00:27:10.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we do so
with a thankful spirit,

00:27:10.774 --> 00:27:14.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
always being grateful
for the good things that Jehovah gives us

00:27:14.528 --> 00:27:18.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being confident
that he will bless us and he will help us,

00:27:18.908 --> 00:27:21.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can receive from Jehovah

00:27:21.452 --> 00:27:24.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
that wonderful calmness and tranquility

00:27:24.663 --> 00:27:28.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
that puts our minds and hearts to rest.

00:27:28.709 --> 00:27:32.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as Paul goes on to say
there in verse 7,

00:27:32.213 --> 00:27:37.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “peace of God . . .
surpasses all understanding.”

00:27:37.218 --> 00:27:41.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s look at some examples,
first of all, in the Scriptures,

00:27:41.138 --> 00:27:45.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we see individuals
who experience that peace of God.

00:27:45.142 --> 00:27:48.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first of all,
let’s go to Daniel chapter 3

00:27:50.231 --> 00:27:52.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Daniel chapter 3—

00:27:52.650 --> 00:27:56.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s go down here to verse 16.

00:27:56.070 --> 00:28:00.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, now this is the account
of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.

00:28:00.574 --> 00:28:02.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember the situation.

00:28:02.576 --> 00:28:04.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar had erected this image

00:28:04.745 --> 00:28:07.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had required everyone
to bow down before it.

00:28:07.873 --> 00:28:09.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when it became evident

00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:12.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
would not do this,

00:28:12.586 --> 00:28:14.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were brought before the king.

00:28:14.213 --> 00:28:15.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s what they said.

00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:17.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at verse 16:

00:28:17.633 --> 00:28:22.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need
to answer you in this matter.

00:28:22.054 --> 00:28:25.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If it must be,
our God whom we serve

00:28:25.099 --> 00:28:28.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is able to rescue us
from the burning fiery furnace, O king,

00:28:28.394 --> 00:28:30.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to rescue us from your hand.

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But even if he does not,

00:28:33.357 --> 00:28:35.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let it be known to you, O king,

00:28:35.484 --> 00:28:38.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we will not serve your gods

00:28:38.487 --> 00:28:42.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
or worship the image of gold
that you have set up.”

00:28:43.409 --> 00:28:46.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now,
the Bible doesn’t record the prayer

00:28:46.078 --> 00:28:49.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego said.

00:28:49.123 --> 00:28:54.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when you listen to their words,
do you hear their calmness?

00:28:54.128 --> 00:28:57.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you hear the tranquility in their voices?

00:28:57.047 --> 00:29:00.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no panic here.
There’s no terror.

00:29:00.634 --> 00:29:03.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
They speak confidently and calmly

00:29:03.721 --> 00:29:06.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
with full trust in Jehovah.

00:29:06.098 --> 00:29:09.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as you look on at verse 19,

00:29:09.810 --> 00:29:13.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see that Nebuchadnezzar
becomes furious at this

00:29:13.772 --> 00:29:18.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has the furnace heated
seven times hotter than normal.

00:29:18.193 --> 00:29:23.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 22 says
that the king’s command was so harsh

00:29:23.198 --> 00:29:25.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the furnace was so hot

00:29:25.701 --> 00:29:29.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the men who were to throw
Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in

00:29:29.455 --> 00:29:34.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
were all killed
(because the furnace was so hot).

00:29:34.293 --> 00:29:36.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, this is real.

00:29:36.962 --> 00:29:40.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is real persecution.
This is real fire.

00:29:40.341 --> 00:29:41.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happens?

00:29:41.759 --> 00:29:44.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at verse 24.

00:29:44.136 --> 00:29:46.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nebuchadnezzar looks in the fire.

00:29:46.805 --> 00:29:50.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Did we not tie up three men
and throw them into the fire?”

00:29:50.309 --> 00:29:51.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes.”

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:56.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said: ‘Look!
I see four men walking about free

00:29:56.565 --> 00:29:59.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in the midst of the fire,
and they are unharmed,

00:29:59.109 --> 00:30:01.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the fourth one
looks like a son of the gods

00:30:01.737 --> 00:30:03.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
[like a son of the gods].’”

00:30:04.782 --> 00:30:08.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, you talk about “peace of God”

00:30:08.077 --> 00:30:11.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
—three men walking about  
in the fiery furnace.

00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder what they were saying.

00:30:13.457 --> 00:30:15.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, what are you going to do today,
Shadrach?

00:30:15.459 --> 00:30:18.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are we going to do
when we get out of this fiery furnace?”

00:30:18.212 --> 00:30:21.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, not in terror and not in panic

00:30:21.882 --> 00:30:24.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a picture of calmness.

00:30:24.551 --> 00:30:27.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the peace of God.

00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:30.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Jehoshaphat?

00:30:30.307 --> 00:30:34.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Chronicles chapter 20,
let’s look at this one too.

00:30:34.395 --> 00:30:36.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Chronicles chapter 20

00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:42.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
—now you’ll see here
that Jehoshaphat and the people of Judah

00:30:42.945 --> 00:30:45.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
are surrounded by enemy armies.

00:30:45.531 --> 00:30:48.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 12,
look at what he says in his prayer:

00:30:48.534 --> 00:30:53.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are powerless before this large crowd
that is coming against us;

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we do not know what we should do,

00:30:55.624 --> 00:30:57.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our eyes are toward you.”

00:30:59.044 --> 00:31:01.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the concern in his heart.

00:31:01.088 --> 00:31:03.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at verse 13.

00:31:03.090 --> 00:31:06.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, it says that ‘all those of Judah
were standing before Jehovah,

00:31:06.885 --> 00:31:11.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
including their little ones, their wives,
and their children.’

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, Jehoshaphat was

00:31:13.183 --> 00:31:17.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps a little bit
in a state of anxiety here,

00:31:17.146 --> 00:31:20.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if saying:
‘Jehovah, we just don’t know what to do.’

00:31:20.023 --> 00:31:22.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
But just like Philippians 4:6, 7 says,

00:31:22.818 --> 00:31:25.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat supplicated Jehovah.

00:31:25.404 --> 00:31:27.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
He begged Him for his help.

00:31:27.239 --> 00:31:30.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had a thankful heart,
even recounting the ways

00:31:30.242 --> 00:31:33.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah had blessed the nation.

00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:35.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what happened?

00:31:35.122 --> 00:31:38.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the message came from Jehovah
in verse 15:

00:31:38.083 --> 00:31:42.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid or be terrified
because of this large crowd,

00:31:42.129 --> 00:31:45.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the battle is not yours but God’s.”

00:31:45.632 --> 00:31:48.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in verse 17, Jehovah told him:

00:31:48.469 --> 00:31:50.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will not need to fight this battle.

00:31:50.637 --> 00:31:53.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take your position, stand still,

00:31:53.265 --> 00:31:56.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and see the salvation of Jehovah
in your behalf. . . .

00:31:56.059 --> 00:31:59.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not be afraid or be terrified.”

00:31:59.855 --> 00:32:04.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s immediately a different spirit
in Jehoshaphat.

00:32:04.693 --> 00:32:07.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can tell
that he’s experienced the peace of God

00:32:07.321 --> 00:32:10.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
because—look at verse 20 and 21—

00:32:10.532 --> 00:32:12.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
he immediately says to the people:

00:32:12.701 --> 00:32:15.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Listen to me, O Judah
and you inhabitants of Jerusalem!

00:32:15.662 --> 00:32:19.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Put faith in Jehovah your God
so that you may be able to stand firm.

00:32:19.792 --> 00:32:24.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Put faith in his prophets,
and you will be successful.”

00:32:24.421 --> 00:32:27.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he appointed men
to go out and sing

00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:31.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and go before the armies of Israel
as they praised Jehovah.

00:32:31.762 --> 00:32:35.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as a result, of course,
the nation was saved.

00:32:35.599 --> 00:32:39.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat experienced that calmness,

00:32:39.311 --> 00:32:41.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
that tranquility,

00:32:41.355 --> 00:32:44.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes from the peace
that only God can give.

00:32:45.651 --> 00:32:48.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the same is true
in our modern times.

00:32:48.654 --> 00:32:52.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1975 <i>Yearbook</i>,
there’s a beautiful experience

00:32:52.241 --> 00:32:56.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our dear Brother Daniel Sydlik
who served on the Governing Body.

00:32:56.245 --> 00:33:00.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was jailed
because of his Christian neutrality in 1944.

00:33:00.833 --> 00:33:03.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
On his first night in prison,

00:33:03.293 --> 00:33:06.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was lying on top of his bunk

00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:09.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was listening as the steel gates,

00:33:09.633 --> 00:33:14.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
he says,
“‘like rumbling thunder, rolled to a close.’

00:33:14.304 --> 00:33:18.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One by one the sound of those gates
came closer [and closer]

00:33:18.225 --> 00:33:20.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until his cell gate quivered

00:33:20.894 --> 00:33:24.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then rolled slowly shut.”

00:33:24.273 --> 00:33:26.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Suddenly,

00:33:26.275 --> 00:33:31.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“an overwhelmingly sickening sensation
swept over me,

00:33:31.154 --> 00:33:35.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which made me feel trapped,
without a way out.

00:33:35.325 --> 00:33:39.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then just as quickly
followed another sensation

00:33:39.997 --> 00:33:42.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
“equally overwhelming,

00:33:42.374 --> 00:33:45.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which made me feel great peace and joy,

00:33:45.419 --> 00:33:48.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the kind of peace
that the Bible speaks about

00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:53.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the peace of God
[that surpasses all understanding].”

00:33:53.218 --> 00:33:54.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that wonderful?

00:33:55.512 --> 00:33:56.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about this one?

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a farewell letter
that a young brother wrote to his parents

00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:05.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the time of Nazi Germany.

00:34:05.522 --> 00:34:07.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what he wrote to them:

00:34:07.774 --> 00:34:11.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is now 9 o’clock of the day of my trial,

00:34:11.278 --> 00:34:14.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I must wait till 11:30.

00:34:14.114 --> 00:34:18.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am writing these lines in a solitary cell
of the state military court.

00:34:18.911 --> 00:34:23.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have such peace,
which is really hardly believable;

00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:25.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I have also committed
all to the Lord . . .

00:34:25.375 --> 00:34:28.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
so [that] I can calmly wait for [that] hour.”

00:34:28.754 --> 00:34:31.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, at 12:35,
he continued his letter:

00:34:31.548 --> 00:34:33.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is all over now.

00:34:33.592 --> 00:34:36.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In view of the fact
that I maintained my objection,

00:34:36.428 --> 00:34:38.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the death sentence was decreed.

00:34:38.805 --> 00:34:41.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I listened,
and then after I had spoken the words

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:45.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Be thou faithful unto death’
and a few other words of our Lord,

00:34:45.604 --> 00:34:47.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it was all over.

00:34:47.606 --> 00:34:49.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But never mind that now.

00:34:49.608 --> 00:34:53.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have such peace, such tranquility,

00:34:53.236 --> 00:34:55.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can’t possibly imagine.”

00:34:55.948 --> 00:34:57.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

00:34:57.658 --> 00:35:01.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peace of God
came upon that dear brother

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:03.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
before he was executed.

00:35:04.081 --> 00:35:06.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, in Russia, what do we see?

00:35:06.416 --> 00:35:09.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers are facing
armed and masked men

00:35:09.086 --> 00:35:11.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
breaking down the doors of their homes,

00:35:11.964 --> 00:35:14.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing home searches,
breaking up meetings

00:35:14.424 --> 00:35:16.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
—court cases, imprisonment.

00:35:16.969 --> 00:35:19.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there are
so many wonderful experiences

00:35:19.179 --> 00:35:23.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how Jehovah has given
the peace of God to our brothers.

00:35:23.058 --> 00:35:26.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
During one search at a brother’s home,

00:35:26.186 --> 00:35:28.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother began to worry and feel anxiety.

00:35:28.814 --> 00:35:33.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
He prayed to Jehovah,
“I don’t know what to do; give me advice.”

00:35:33.610 --> 00:35:36.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just then the investigator
doing the home search

00:35:36.363 --> 00:35:40.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
began looking at the magnets
on the brother’s refrigerator

00:35:40.367 --> 00:35:42.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
and loudly and expressively read

00:35:42.703 --> 00:35:44.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
the inscription
on one of the fridge magnets:

00:35:44.955 --> 00:35:48.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.”

00:35:50.544 --> 00:35:54.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother understood right away
what he needed to do.

00:35:55.549 --> 00:35:57.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, brothers, what’s the point?

00:35:57.926 --> 00:36:01.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regardless of what
may be happening around us

00:36:01.138 --> 00:36:03.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what persecution we may face

00:36:03.724 --> 00:36:07.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how challenging the situation may be,

00:36:07.144 --> 00:36:11.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we supplicate Jehovah
with a thankful heart,

00:36:11.523 --> 00:36:14.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will give us a precious gift,

00:36:14.443 --> 00:36:19.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the peace of God
that surpasses all understanding.”

00:36:20.574 --> 00:36:25.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
How refreshing that if we look to Jehovah
for the way out of a trial,

00:36:25.203 --> 00:36:29.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll help us to endure
with inner peace and calm!

00:36:30.834 --> 00:36:34.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that could disturb our inner peace

00:36:34.087 --> 00:36:37.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
is conflict in a marriage.

00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:39.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can respect help a couple

00:36:39.384 --> 00:36:42.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
reduce conflict and maintain peace?

00:36:42.721 --> 00:36:47.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see in this episode
of <i>For a Happy Marriage.</i>

00:37:04.993 --> 00:37:06.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Respect:

00:37:08.205 --> 00:37:11.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we work so hard to show it

00:37:14.211 --> 00:37:16.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
but receive little in return.

00:37:32.104 --> 00:37:34.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question is,

00:37:34.147 --> 00:37:37.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it really have to be that way at home?

00:37:48.703 --> 00:37:50.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might need to change habits

00:37:50.705 --> 00:37:52.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we learned growing up.

00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:01.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or we may realize

00:38:01.967 --> 00:38:04.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to change
our choice of entertainment.

00:38:05.554 --> 00:38:09.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it may not be easy, it is possible

00:38:09.182 --> 00:38:12.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cultivate the mutual respect we once had.

00:38:13.979 --> 00:38:17.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
A helpful principle
was stated long ago in the Bible:

00:38:17.732 --> 00:38:20.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as you want [others] to do to you,

00:38:20.527 --> 00:38:22.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
do the same way to them.”

00:38:29.703 --> 00:38:33.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Husbands especially need to feel respected.

00:38:48.263 --> 00:38:51.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
But wives also need to feel valued, 

00:38:52.976 --> 00:38:57.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
loved, and heard by their husbands.

00:38:58.523 --> 00:39:00.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we start by doing things

00:39:00.567 --> 00:39:03.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
that show we honor our mate,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:06.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll create an atmosphere
where respect can grow.

00:39:18.919 --> 00:39:23.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always remember to consider
how your words will affect your mate

00:39:25.467 --> 00:39:27.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
—whether in public

00:39:32.015 --> 00:39:33.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even in private.

00:39:35.727 --> 00:39:39.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you must correct a matter,
wait until you are alone.

00:39:40.732 --> 00:39:44.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use a kind tone and gentle speech.

00:39:44.527 --> 00:39:46.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when you disagree,

00:39:46.446 --> 00:39:49.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
keep showing
that you value your mate’s opinion.

00:40:01.628 --> 00:40:04.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about everything your spouse does,

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:11.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
both the big things and the little things,

00:40:12.597 --> 00:40:14.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take good care of your family.

00:40:26.736 --> 00:40:30.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try not to focus on your mate’s flaws.

00:40:36.079 --> 00:40:38.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Commend more than you criticize.

00:40:56.725 --> 00:40:58.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
And tell your mate every day

00:40:58.727 --> 00:41:01.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
something specific
you appreciate about them.

00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:05.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peace is the beautiful result

00:41:05.859 --> 00:41:08.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
when both husband and wife show respect

00:41:08.403 --> 00:41:12.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the person who deserves it most
—one another.

00:41:14.409 --> 00:41:16.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are three questions for you to discuss

00:41:16.953 --> 00:41:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help
to build respect in your marriage.

00:41:20.832 --> 00:41:24.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is simply a chance
to openly express how each of you feels.

00:41:25.587 --> 00:41:28.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be ready to listen and willing to change.

00:41:29.424 --> 00:41:33.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if it’s convenient,
pause this video now

00:41:33.428 --> 00:41:35.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really talk.

00:41:39.642 --> 00:41:41.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you catch that?

00:41:41.686 --> 00:41:44.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a happy marriage, show respect

00:41:44.314 --> 00:41:47.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the person who truly deserves it
—your mate.

00:41:49.527 --> 00:41:51.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if a couple works well together,

00:41:51.988 --> 00:41:55.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
raising children may demand greater teamwork.

00:41:55.992 --> 00:41:57.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the way the Macías family

00:41:57.994 --> 00:42:00.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
is teaching their son with special needs

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:03.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
to build a relationship with Jehovah.

00:42:04.417 --> 00:42:06.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when I saw my son for the first time,

00:42:06.669 --> 00:42:09.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw his big eyes open, and I just thought,

00:42:09.923 --> 00:42:12.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah, what a blessing
you’ve given to me!’

00:42:12.967 --> 00:42:16.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t believe that this was our boy.

00:42:16.971 --> 00:42:19.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was overwhelming!

00:42:19.307 --> 00:42:20.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was told

00:42:20.934 --> 00:42:24.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jaden is autistic,
I didn’t know what it was.

00:42:25.897 --> 00:42:28.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I immediately started doing my homework.

00:42:28.566 --> 00:42:30.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need to know what it is so I can succeed,

00:42:30.693 --> 00:42:35.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I love this boy,
and I don’t want to fail him.

00:42:36.199 --> 00:42:38.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being a new mom,

00:42:38.201 --> 00:42:41.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started doing the research
and talking to our pediatrician.

00:42:42.330 --> 00:42:44.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every day was like a mystery.

00:42:44.707 --> 00:42:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need that time to process together.

00:42:46.709 --> 00:42:49.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were like, you know, “Now what do we do?”

00:42:49.337 --> 00:42:53.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was key to talk to Jehovah because

00:42:53.299 --> 00:42:57.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
this can be overwhelming,
just trying to understand the challenges

00:42:57.637 --> 00:43:00.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have to prepare yourself for

00:43:00.432 --> 00:43:03.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
to endure as an advocate for your child.

00:43:04.561 --> 00:43:07.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think being present, in our case,

00:43:07.564 --> 00:43:09.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been very important with Jaden

00:43:09.858 --> 00:43:12.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there are just glimpses

00:43:12.485 --> 00:43:16.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his personality
that you’re able to capture

00:43:16.531 --> 00:43:19.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you might not see it again.

00:43:19.993 --> 00:43:22.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
So those are the things that drive us.

00:43:24.164 --> 00:43:26.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve been fortunate enough to have

00:43:26.916 --> 00:43:30.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
such a strong set of friends.

00:43:30.462 --> 00:43:33.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re the ones that call us and say:
“How are you doing,

00:43:35.633 --> 00:43:39.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you know, outside of Jaden?

00:43:39.012 --> 00:43:41.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How are you doing?

00:43:41.014 --> 00:43:42.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s keeping you going?”

00:43:42.849 --> 00:43:46.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, those are the things
that really stay with us

00:43:46.394 --> 00:43:50.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help us just keep moving along
and chugging along.

00:43:51.941 --> 00:43:54.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jaden’s vocabulary is limited.

00:43:54.903 --> 00:43:58.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he’s angry, we ask him,
“Are you feeling angry?”

00:43:58.907 --> 00:44:00.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, I’m angry.”

00:44:00.325 --> 00:44:01.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, why?”

00:44:01.951 --> 00:44:03.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t know.”

00:44:03.453 --> 00:44:05.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“OK, well, what happened?”

00:44:05.955 --> 00:44:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll take a picture with my phone.

00:44:08.333 --> 00:44:11.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see, you don’t look happy,”
and he’s sad.

00:44:11.169 --> 00:44:12.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m like, “Why?”

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:15.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll slowly let it out, you know.

00:44:15.089 --> 00:44:17.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I’ll find a picture on my phone
with him happy.

00:44:17.634 --> 00:44:20.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m like, “That’s Jaden, right there.”

00:44:21.095 --> 00:44:23.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we work at it.

00:44:23.306 --> 00:44:27.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I think it helps him to see it
because he sees himself.

00:44:29.145 --> 00:44:31.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with Jaden,
reading words and writing words

00:44:31.689 --> 00:44:36.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not really the thing that’s going
to cement anything into his heart or brain,

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:40.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
so most of it is going to be drawn
or like acted out.

00:44:40.031 --> 00:44:42.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank goodness
we have so much video content now.

00:44:42.784 --> 00:44:44.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he loves the Sophia and Caleb videos.

00:44:44.911 --> 00:44:48.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
When that came, we were just so grateful
to Jehovah because it really

00:44:48.665 --> 00:44:50.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
felt like it was made for us.

00:44:50.875 --> 00:44:55.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we had the illustrated Bible stories,
it had dialogue and an action title.

00:44:55.338 --> 00:44:57.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would act those out with him.

00:44:58.216 --> 00:45:00.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we prepare for an assembly,

00:45:00.009 --> 00:45:02.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
we sing the songs
throughout the whole program 

00:45:02.887 --> 00:45:06.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he feels
that he has an idea of what’s coming.

00:45:07.267 --> 00:45:11.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were serving in the Spanish congregation,
but we realized we needed 

00:45:11.688 --> 00:45:14.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
to move to the English congregation

00:45:14.566 --> 00:45:16.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that Jaden could thrive.

00:45:17.944 --> 00:45:21.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been a fun ride with getting Jaden
to comment at meetings,

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:23.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
telling the friends,
“Hey, you know, he wants to comment, 

00:45:23.074 --> 00:45:26.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s going to be something
you don’t understand.”

00:45:26.286 --> 00:45:27.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were so good about it.

00:45:27.704 --> 00:45:32.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
That constant support was enough for him
to want to do it on his own.

00:45:32.959 --> 00:45:35.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that we have to share our faith.

00:45:35.044 --> 00:45:37.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that others don’t have our hope.

00:45:37.088 --> 00:45:38.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our ministry is part of our life,

00:45:38.381 --> 00:45:41.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that means we’re publishers
who get that done.

00:45:41.092 --> 00:45:42.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we helped him to get to that place.

00:45:42.802 --> 00:45:44.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s going to talk about his faith.

00:45:44.721 --> 00:45:46.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s going to share it the way he can.

00:45:47.223 --> 00:45:49.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to get baptized.

00:45:53.104 --> 00:45:56.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I think that, you know,
when we make it to the new world,

00:45:56.774 --> 00:45:59.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s going to know everything
that’s been done

00:45:59.319 --> 00:46:01.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get us there and to be there as a family.

00:46:02.739 --> 00:46:05.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just put the water in there.

00:46:05.033 --> 00:46:06.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice.

00:46:06.618 --> 00:46:08.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nice pour, sir.

00:46:08.244 --> 00:46:09.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many?

00:46:09.162 --> 00:46:10.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many animals.

00:46:10.163 --> 00:46:11.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many.

00:46:12.498 --> 00:46:14.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love you, Mom.

00:46:14.125 --> 00:46:15.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, my love.

00:46:15.418 --> 00:46:17.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so proud of you.

00:46:17.712 --> 00:46:19.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks, Mom.

00:46:19.172 --> 00:46:24.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think of us

00:46:25.178 --> 00:46:28.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
being over a hill, for some reason,

00:46:28.056 --> 00:46:32.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I think of him being between us

00:46:32.435 --> 00:46:34.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
—because that’s always kind of the dynamic—

00:46:34.937 --> 00:46:37.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s holding us and saying: “We did it.

00:46:37.148 --> 00:46:38.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
We did it together.”

00:46:38.816 --> 00:46:41.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has given us the best gift,

00:46:41.778 --> 00:46:43.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is our son, Jaden.

00:46:46.824 --> 00:46:50.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll be glad to know
that shortly after this video was filmed,

00:46:50.286 --> 00:46:54.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jaden symbolized his dedication
by water baptism.

00:46:57.418 --> 00:47:01.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever had a doubt
that weakened your faith?

00:47:01.422 --> 00:47:05.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you struggle to believe
that God loves you?

00:47:05.259 --> 00:47:07.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video encourages us

00:47:07.679 --> 00:47:11.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
to face those doubts with Jehovah’s help.

00:47:11.015 --> 00:47:18.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
<b>‘</b>Is it true that this is the path
I should choose?’

00:47:18.398 --> 00:47:20.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked myself.

00:47:22.402 --> 00:47:28.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a mind full of questions
and, not to mention,

00:47:28.449 --> 00:47:30.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
This world didn’t help.

00:47:32.412 --> 00:47:39.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I made the time to prove
I really have the truth.

00:47:42.672 --> 00:47:49.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I have to deal
with what distorts my view,

00:47:49.220 --> 00:47:52.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what I do:

00:47:52.432 --> 00:47:58.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feed my faith and starve my doubts.

00:47:58.062 --> 00:48:08.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
I beg Jehovah, “Help me out
To feed my faith and starve my doubts.”

00:48:08.072 --> 00:48:16.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he answers me by giving me what I need
To feed my faith,

00:48:16.706 --> 00:48:22.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
To feed my faith,
To feed my faith.

00:48:23.796 --> 00:48:33.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can see that the Devil tries
to blur the lines of right and wrong.

00:48:35.183 --> 00:48:40.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I won’t be complacent,
thinking I can face this

00:48:40.813 --> 00:48:45.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
On my own and be strong.

00:48:45.401 --> 00:48:52.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I look away from what misleads;
I’m not deceived.

00:48:55.578 --> 00:49:05.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s words have proven trustworthy.
My hope is guaranteed!

00:49:05.254 --> 00:49:10.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feed my faith and starve my doubts.

00:49:10.593 --> 00:49:20.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
I beg Jehovah, “Help me out
To feed my faith and starve my doubts.”

00:49:20.770 --> 00:49:29.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he answers me by giving me what I need
To feed my faith,

00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:35.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
To feed my faith,
To feed my faith.

00:49:35.326 --> 00:49:47.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be a well-known verse, meditation,
The words of a song or a conversation

00:49:47.046 --> 00:49:52.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
That answers my silent prayers
all through the day

00:49:52.176 --> 00:49:57.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
To feed my faith.

00:50:18.578 --> 00:50:23.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feed my faith and starve my doubts.

00:50:23.916 --> 00:50:33.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
I beg Jehovah, “Help me out
To feed my faith and starve my doubts.”

00:50:33.968 --> 00:50:40.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always answers me
by giving me just what I need

00:50:40.182 --> 00:50:45.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
To feed my faith,
To feed my faith,

00:50:45.271 --> 00:50:53.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
To feed my faith,
To feed my faith,

00:50:53.112 --> 00:50:58.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
To feed my faith,
To feed my faith.

00:51:09.128 --> 00:51:13.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah always gives us just what we need.

00:51:13.799 --> 00:51:16.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
True hope is built on the promises

00:51:16.302 --> 00:51:19.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a God who simply “cannot lie.”

00:51:19.221 --> 00:51:23.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we are young or old,
our hope can stabilize us

00:51:23.726 --> 00:51:27.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
through both man-made conflict
or natural disasters.

00:51:27.855 --> 00:51:31.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Theocratic building projects
are tangible evidence

00:51:31.275 --> 00:51:33.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the God of hope is speeding up

00:51:33.277 --> 00:51:36.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
the global preaching work
before the end comes.

00:51:36.447 --> 00:51:39.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we apply Bible principles

00:51:39.075 --> 00:51:42.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our marriage, our hope is strengthened

00:51:42.203 --> 00:51:46.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we see how Jehovah’s Word
promotes peace in our home.

Our postcard this month is from a country

00:51:50.294 --> 00:51:54.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s been called the land of the volcanoes,
El Salvador.

00:51:54.882 --> 00:51:59.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of its 20 youngest volcanoes,
some are still active.

00:51:59.136 --> 00:52:01.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
The picturesque Lake Coatepeque

00:52:01.138 --> 00:52:03.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
was formed
when a group of volcanoes collapsed,

00:52:03.891 --> 00:52:07.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowing rainwater to fill the crater.

00:52:07.103 --> 00:52:10.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite its mountainous terrain, El Salvador

00:52:10.314 --> 00:52:13.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
is known for its agriculture,
especially coffee.

00:52:14.443 --> 00:52:17.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fertile volcanic soil produces

00:52:17.196 --> 00:52:20.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
a highly sought-after coffee
known for its sweetness,

00:52:20.199 --> 00:52:24.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
notes of chocolate and caramel,
and gentle acidity.

00:52:25.287 --> 00:52:28.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
El Salvador
is Central America’s smallest country

00:52:28.499 --> 00:52:31.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also its most densely populated.

00:52:31.961 --> 00:52:33.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses have been active

00:52:33.963 --> 00:52:37.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the country since
the first missionaries arrived in 1945.

00:52:38.592 --> 00:52:41.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those intrepid missionaries
faced the daunting task

00:52:41.846 --> 00:52:45.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
of declaring the good news
to roughly one and a half million people.

00:52:46.642 --> 00:52:50.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Salvadoran people
are kind and industrious,

00:52:50.187 --> 00:52:54.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
very hospitable,
and ready to talk about the Bible.

00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:55.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those first seeds

00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:59.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Kingdom truth grew rapidly, and in 1972,

00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:03.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses gained legal recognition.

00:53:03.325 --> 00:53:07.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, the more than 37,000 publishers

00:53:07.038 --> 00:53:09.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
conduct almost 20,000 Bible studies.

00:53:09.915 --> 00:53:13.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
They preach in Spanish,
Salvadoran Sign Language,

00:53:13.919 --> 00:53:17.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Mandarin Chinese,
and they declare the good news to inmates

00:53:17.923 --> 00:53:19.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 20 different prisons.

00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:24.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nearly one in seven publishers
serves as a pioneer.

00:53:25.097 --> 00:53:26.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
This past service year saw

00:53:26.932 --> 00:53:31.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than a 20 percent increase
in total hours spent preaching.

00:53:32.063 --> 00:53:36.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers enjoy harbor witnessing
in the coastal town of Acajutla.

00:53:37.651 --> 00:53:39.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
The El Boqueron Congregation

00:53:39.445 --> 00:53:41.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
is located in the coffee-growing region

00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:44.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
of El Progreso La Libertad.

00:53:44.533 --> 00:53:47.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a delicious cup in the morning,

00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:50.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers walk from house to house
and farm to farm.

00:53:50.539 --> 00:53:52.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
They conduct on average

00:53:52.458 --> 00:53:55.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
50 Bible studies, and this past year,

00:53:55.836 --> 00:53:58.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
174 attended the Memorial.

00:53:59.590 --> 00:54:03.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 66 publishers
of the El Boqueron Congregation

00:54:03.302 --> 00:54:06.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their warm Christian love and affection.

00:54:06.514 --> 00:54:09.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:54:09.767 --> 00:54:12.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
