My comments this month

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:07.490 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are drawn from 1 Corinthians 3:10:

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.492 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one keep watching

00:00:09.492 --> 00:00:11.528 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how he is building.”

00:00:11.528 --> 00:00:13.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Building

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—are we talking
about the upcoming construction

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:21.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a facility for headquarters departments
in Ramapo, New York?

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:26.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or are we referring to the building
of new Kingdom Halls in your country?

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as important
as those building projects are,

00:00:31.648 --> 00:00:36.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my comments are directed
to an even more important building work.

00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:40.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at the context

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:44.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 3:5.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:49.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apollos and Paul are mentioned by name.

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:53.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was their specific role
identified to be?

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 5 says

00:00:55.238 --> 00:01:00.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“ministers through whom you
became believers.”

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apollos and Paul had taught
the Scriptures to many in Corinth.

00:01:05.248 --> 00:01:07.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verses 6 through 9,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul likens this teaching activity
to the planting of a field.

00:01:12.355 --> 00:01:16.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeds of truth are planted
in the heart of a person.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:20.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of return visits and Bible studies,

00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the seeds are watered.

00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:25.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if the person is receptive,

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:28.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then with Jehovah’s spirit and blessing,

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:31.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the truth will blossom

00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and grow to the point of dedication
and baptism.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:39.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice in verse 9

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Bible teachers are described
as “God’s fellow workers”?

00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:49.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an awesome privilege we have
to assist Jehovah

00:01:49.726 --> 00:01:54.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in gathering “the precious things
of all the nations”!

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:59.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we now know the topic of these verses

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:02.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1 Corinthians chapter 3.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:04.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s discussing Bible teachers

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:08.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who help others to become believers.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:12.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you also notice that in verse 9,

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:15.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul changes illustrations?

00:02:15.018 --> 00:02:20.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“You are God’s field under cultivation”

00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:22.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s agricultural.

00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:24.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then he changes the analogy,

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:27.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying “God’s building”

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s architectural; that’s construction.

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:36.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why the change in illustrations?

00:02:36.606 --> 00:02:41.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The building analogy
highlights a specific point.

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:44.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, the illustration of the farmer

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t focus on the farmer’s impact
on the growth of a plant.

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:53.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that illustration,
the farmer waters the seedling,

00:02:53.556 --> 00:02:58.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s God that makes the plant grow.

00:02:58.161 --> 00:03:03.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the illustration of building,
or construction,

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:06.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focuses on the builder’s involvement,

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the Bible teacher’s involvement.

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The one constructing a building
has considerable influence

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over the quality of the end product.

00:03:17.647 --> 00:03:21.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What kind of materials does he select?

00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:24.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is he thorough in his work,

00:03:24.153 --> 00:03:27.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or does he cut corners
to get the job done faster

00:03:27.857 --> 00:03:30.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with less effort?

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s read the 10th verse

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:37.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 1 Corinthians chapter 3:

00:03:37.834 --> 00:03:42.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“According to the undeserved kindness of God
that was given to me,

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:47.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I laid a foundation
as a skilled master builder,

00:03:47.577 --> 00:03:49.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but someone else is building on it.

00:03:49.646 --> 00:03:52.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let each one keep watching

00:03:52.282 --> 00:03:55.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he is building on it.”

00:03:55.251 --> 00:03:59.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There in Corinth,
Paul, as a “master builder,”

00:03:59.088 --> 00:04:03.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had initially acquainted many with the truth.

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:06.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, he “laid a foundation”

00:04:06.896 --> 00:04:09.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for others to build on.

00:04:09.532 --> 00:04:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what was that foundation?

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:13.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 11 says:

00:04:13.836 --> 00:04:18.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For no one can lay any other foundation

00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:22.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“than what is laid,
which is Jesus Christ.”

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:27.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul had helped establish
the congregation there in Corinth

00:04:27.116 --> 00:04:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
based on the teachings of Jesus,

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:33.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the foundation of the truth.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Building on that foundation,

00:04:36.025 --> 00:04:39.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others would become Bible teachers

00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:43.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help still others
to progress toward baptism.

00:04:43.366 --> 00:04:46.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why Paul cautioned in verse 10

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:50.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “keep watching how” we build.

00:04:50.273 --> 00:04:53.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can affect the outcome.

00:04:53.543 --> 00:04:58.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to all of us Bible teachers,
including parents,

00:04:58.114 --> 00:05:00.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we ask the question,

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:03.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are we building on the foundation?

00:05:05.388 --> 00:05:08.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why does it really matter?

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:12.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 12 and 13:

00:05:12.261 --> 00:05:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now if anyone builds on the foundation

00:05:15.965 --> 00:05:19.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“gold, silver, precious stones,

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“wood, hay, or straw,

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each one’s work
will be shown for what it is,

00:05:24.841 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the day will show it up,

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because it will be revealed
by means of fire,

00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:33.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the fire itself will prove

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:36.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what sort of work each one has built.”

00:05:37.553 --> 00:05:39.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we understand how important it is

00:05:39.989 --> 00:05:43.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to analyze our teaching techniques?

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will we use the best techniques possible

00:05:47.964 --> 00:05:51.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach our student’s or our child’s heart?

00:05:52.402 --> 00:05:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do we just try to get by
with the bare essentials,

00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:59.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in effect, a halfhearted effort,

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:03.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using hay or straw, as it were?

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some years ago in one developing country

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during an economic boom,

00:06:09.886 --> 00:06:11.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became a priority

00:06:11.888 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build more and more schools.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unfortunately, building requirements
and materials

00:06:19.962 --> 00:06:21.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were substandard.

00:06:22.899 --> 00:06:27.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what happened
when a 7.9-magnitude earthquake

00:06:27.537 --> 00:06:29.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hit one of the areas?

00:06:29.872 --> 00:06:34.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many schools in the earthquake zone crumbled

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while buildings around them
remained standing.

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:41.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An official report indicated

00:06:41.184 --> 00:06:46.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that over 5,000 students died.

00:06:46.189 --> 00:06:48.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it.

00:06:48.391 --> 00:06:52.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prior to the earthquake,
schools were in session

00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everything seemed fine.

00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:56.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Students and faculty

00:06:56.833 --> 00:07:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were coming and going on a daily basis.

00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:04.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the unforeseen earthquake proved

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the building methods used

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:10.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were not of the quality needed
to prevent collapse

00:07:10.546 --> 00:07:12.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and terrible carnage.

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:18.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 3:13 makes clear

00:07:18.955 --> 00:07:23.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that how we build spiritually
when teaching Bible students

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:25.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our children

00:07:25.161 --> 00:07:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is just as important.

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:33.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now notice the sobering point

00:07:33.402 --> 00:07:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made in verses 14 and 15:

00:07:39.609 --> 00:07:43.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If anyone’s work
that he has built on it remains,

00:07:43.779 --> 00:07:46.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he will receive a reward;

00:07:46.582 --> 00:07:51.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if anyone’s work is burned up,
he will suffer loss,

00:07:51.187 --> 00:07:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but he himself will be saved;

00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:57.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yet, if so, it will be as through fire.”

00:07:58.861 --> 00:08:03.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point in verse 14 is
that if we’re conscientious

00:08:03.699 --> 00:08:06.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reach the hearts of our Bible students,

00:08:06.536 --> 00:08:09.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that may be what gives them
the needed fortitude

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to withstand unexpected trials.

00:08:13.342 --> 00:08:17.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In that case, our diligent work “remains.”

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then verse 15 makes the point

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if our teaching techniques
were inconsistent

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or were in some way slipshod,

00:08:27.056 --> 00:08:31.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our student
may not successfully weather a “fire,”

00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:35.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stormy trial in his life.

00:08:35.765 --> 00:08:38.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We personally may survive,

00:08:38.568 --> 00:08:42.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we might suffer the loss
of the one we studied with,

00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:44.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether a Bible student

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or our own child.

00:08:47.843 --> 00:08:50.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why Paul is highlighting the need

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:53.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be the best Bible teacher

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:55.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we personally can be.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:08:59.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we should mention

00:08:59.989 --> 00:09:04.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that if a person who progresses
to dedication and baptism

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
later leaves the truth,

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:12.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not necessarily the responsibility
of the Bible teacher.

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher may have been very diligent

00:09:16.906 --> 00:09:20.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and used
the best of spiritual building materials.

00:09:21.477 --> 00:09:26.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the student or child
may not have responded from his heart.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:31.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or possibly he allowed
human imperfection or temptation

00:09:31.387 --> 00:09:35.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cause him to deviate from the way.

00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:40.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the takeaway point
from 1 Corinthians chapter 3

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:45.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to do our best
to build in our students or children

00:09:45.368 --> 00:09:48.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
fire-resistant materials.

00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want them to remain

00:09:51.140 --> 00:09:54.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to endure the tests
that are sure to come their way.

00:09:56.379 --> 00:10:00.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What might be likened
to building with inferior materials

00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:03.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when studying the Bible with someone?

00:10:03.286 --> 00:10:07.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly, we initially
aroused a person’s interest

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by telling him about the hope
of everlasting life in Paradise.

00:10:12.128 --> 00:10:14.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s indeed Scriptural.

00:10:14.463 --> 00:10:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that in itself building in such a way

00:10:17.867 --> 00:10:19.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the person will survive

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:23.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a fiery trial of faith in the future?

00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:29.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if our teaching
consisted solely of saying,

00:10:29.312 --> 00:10:31.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you want to live forever in Paradise,

00:10:31.847 --> 00:10:35.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you must study, go to the meetings,

00:10:35.151 --> 00:10:38.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and share in the preaching work”?

00:10:38.154 --> 00:10:41.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, we are not building

00:10:41.657 --> 00:10:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way to ensure

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the student or child

00:10:46.195 --> 00:10:49.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will resist the fire of trials

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stand the test of time.

00:10:52.435 --> 00:10:57.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, we’re using wood, hay, or straw.

00:10:59.375 --> 00:11:03.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember that Paul said
we are to build “on the foundation”?

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said the foundation “is Jesus Christ.”

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:11.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is <i>solid.</i>

00:11:11.187 --> 00:11:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 3:16, 17

00:11:16.192 --> 00:11:19.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help us to understand what it means

00:11:19.295 --> 00:11:21.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to build with quality materials

00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as gold, silver, and precious stones.

00:11:26.736 --> 00:11:31.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 16, it makes clear
that there’s a way

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can “be made mighty
in the [person we] are inside.”

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verse 17:

00:11:40.383 --> 00:11:42.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And that through your faith

00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:46.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“you may have the Christ
dwell in your hearts with love.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:51.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May you be rooted and established
on the foundation.”

00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:55.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we help our child or Bible student

00:11:55.598 --> 00:11:59.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become strong, or mighty, spiritually?

00:11:59.535 --> 00:12:02.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, verse 17 said

00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:06.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s by having
“the Christ dwell in your hearts,”

00:12:06.942 --> 00:12:10.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just knowing Jesus in the head

00:12:10.579 --> 00:12:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but sounding
his teachings and personality down

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:17.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into our student’s heart.

00:12:17.353 --> 00:12:20.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means to know Jesus so well

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:25.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it’s as if he lives, or dwells,
inside of us

00:12:25.661 --> 00:12:29.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and motivates us as Christians.

00:12:29.398 --> 00:12:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The result?

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 17 concluded by saying

00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the student would become

00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:39.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“rooted and established on the foundation.”

00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:42.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, solidly grounded

00:12:42.411 --> 00:12:45.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Jesus Christ.

00:12:45.014 --> 00:12:47.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Hebrews 1:3

00:12:47.016 --> 00:12:50.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that
“[Jesus] is the reflection of God’s glory

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the exact representation
of his very being.”

00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:58.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus himself said:

00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:02.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No one comes to the Father
except through me.”

00:13:02.731 --> 00:13:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So building with fire-resistant materials
means

00:13:06.235 --> 00:13:09.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helping the student to love Jesus, yes,

00:13:09.839 --> 00:13:13.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to have a close, loving relationship

00:13:13.676 --> 00:13:15.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Jehovah God himself.

00:13:17.413 --> 00:13:20.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But why are we considering the theme

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:24.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Keep Watching How You Are Building’ now?

00:13:24.887 --> 00:13:29.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is this more urgent than ever before?

00:13:30.559 --> 00:13:33.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because all indications,

00:13:33.162 --> 00:13:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Scripturally and circumstantially,

00:13:36.332 --> 00:13:41.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
point to Satan’s evil system of things
coming to an abrupt end.

00:13:42.838 --> 00:13:47.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The physical indications
of Matthew chapter 24

00:13:47.176 --> 00:13:49.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the bizarre temperament described

00:13:49.712 --> 00:13:52.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Timothy 3:1-5

00:13:52.648 --> 00:13:55.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become more and more precise

00:13:55.951 --> 00:13:59.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we watch “the scene of this world” unfold.

00:14:01.123 --> 00:14:05.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can expect
even more opposition and persecution

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from those who are opposed to our resolve

00:14:09.798 --> 00:14:12.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stand on the side of Jehovah.

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:15.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers in Russia and other lands

00:14:15.638 --> 00:14:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are experiencing this now.

00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:21.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some have been beaten

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:23.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and brutalized in other ways.

00:14:23.913 --> 00:14:26.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve heard,

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others have been sentenced
to years in prison.

00:14:30.819 --> 00:14:35.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years, the organization
has reminded us of what we can expect

00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:38.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the great tribulation begins.

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:42.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember this video clip

00:14:42.865 --> 00:14:46.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the <i>Pursue What Builds Loyalty</i>
video series

00:14:46.735 --> 00:14:50.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shown at the 2016 regional convention?

00:14:50.773 --> 00:14:52.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be reminded.

00:14:54.276 --> 00:14:58.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And your faith has led you here

00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as loyal servants of Jehovah,

00:15:01.617 --> 00:15:05.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
confident that Psalm 97:10

00:15:05.821 --> 00:15:08.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applies to you personally:

00:15:08.891 --> 00:15:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[Jehovah] is guarding
the lives of his loyal ones.”

00:15:23.872 --> 00:15:25.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are they?

00:15:27.776 --> 00:15:29.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try the basement!

00:15:34.216 --> 00:15:36.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Check that door!

00:16:16.191 --> 00:16:20.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That video series
has been affectionately called

00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:23.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the basement video.

00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:25.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was depicting one possible scenario

00:16:25.934 --> 00:16:28.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could be considered a “fire”

00:16:28.904 --> 00:16:32.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to 1 Corinthians 3:13.

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:36.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The serious question
we want to ask ourselves is,

00:16:36.879 --> 00:16:39.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Would my Bible student or child

00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:44.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be in the basement with those other
faithful brothers and sisters?’

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:48.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If not, would the reason be

00:16:48.023 --> 00:16:51.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of his own lack of faith?

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or might it, at least in part, be

00:16:54.663 --> 00:16:59.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we did not take
our responsibility as a teacher

00:16:59.168 --> 00:17:01.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seriously enough?

00:17:02.738 --> 00:17:06.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did we build with fire-resistant materials

00:17:06.008 --> 00:17:10.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, in effect, with hay or straw?

00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:13.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same verse said:

00:17:13.582 --> 00:17:17.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For the day will show it up . . .

00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:19.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the fire itself will prove

00:17:19.388 --> 00:17:22.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what sort of work each one has built.”

00:17:22.491 --> 00:17:26.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a sobering thought, isn’t it?

00:17:26.528 --> 00:17:29.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you recall in the May 2020

00:17:29.198 --> 00:17:32.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
JW Broadcasting® monthly program,

00:17:32.768 --> 00:17:36.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lett addressed the concern
a few parents have expressed

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:38.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about some of our videos that depict

Biblical or modern-day situations.

00:17:42.911 --> 00:17:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these, at times,
true worshippers are depicted

00:17:45.748 --> 00:17:48.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as having their faith tested 

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if by fire.

00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:54.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The concern expressed is that some scenes

00:17:54.356 --> 00:17:56.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have an effect on children

00:17:56.925 --> 00:18:01.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been protected
from all negative circumstances on TV,

00:18:01.463 --> 00:18:05.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including daily news reports of catastrophes

00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:08.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being faced by real people.

00:18:08.737 --> 00:18:11.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The basement scene we just reviewed

00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was one of our videos

00:18:13.408 --> 00:18:16.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that produced such a reaction.

00:18:16.979 --> 00:18:20.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another one was the reenactment
of the Bible account

00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:25.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depicting Jehovah’s saving acts
in the time of King Hezekiah.

00:18:25.587 --> 00:18:29.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was shown at the 2016 regional convention,

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:31.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the video is entitled

00:18:31.293 --> 00:18:35.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“O Jehovah, . . . I Trust in You.”</i>

00:18:35.297 --> 00:18:40.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look again
at that portrayal of Jehovah’s saving acts.

00:18:59.621 --> 00:19:02.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My lord!

00:19:05.828 --> 00:19:08.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If a parent has shielded his child

00:19:08.697 --> 00:19:11.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from viewing all scenes on the news

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:16.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other visual images
depicting negative realities,

00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:21.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s understandable
that there may be a concern.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:25.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, as Brother Lett stated:

00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Parents need to give their children
a realistic idea

00:19:29.918 --> 00:19:34.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of what we will face in the near future.

00:19:34.423 --> 00:19:37.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Many parents choose to help
their children appreciate

00:19:37.993 --> 00:19:42.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘the graphic visual imagery
of a Bible-based account

00:19:42.364 --> 00:19:46.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘while at the same time
building trust in Jehovah,

00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:49.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be with them in times of distress.’

00:19:49.605 --> 00:19:51.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is, friends,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible warns us, young and old alike,

00:19:54.576 --> 00:19:59.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a time of fiery testing
looms on the horizon.

00:19:59.214 --> 00:20:02.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want to be realistic
and face these events

00:20:02.217 --> 00:20:05.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with faith and courage.

00:20:05.754 --> 00:20:09.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our videos depict such circumstances

00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:12.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a tasteful and sanitized way,

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:17.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not showing any actual acts of bloodshed
or violence.

00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:21.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be assured that the Governing Body

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not trying to scare anyone.

00:20:25.674 --> 00:20:27.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead, we are trying

00:20:27.943 --> 00:20:31.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare everyone.

00:20:31.179 --> 00:20:34.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We feel responsible
to fortify the brotherhood

00:20:34.583 --> 00:20:38.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by using fire-resistant building materials

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:42.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the spirit of 1 Corinthians chapter 3.

00:20:42.157 --> 00:20:45.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As teachers of the Word of God,

00:20:45.427 --> 00:20:49.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may we all give prayerful thought
to the methods,

00:20:49.364 --> 00:20:53.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
techniques, and the diligence we display

00:20:53.201 --> 00:20:56.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when conducting Bible studies.

00:20:56.338 --> 00:21:00.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re motivated
by the very spirit of Jehovah God.

00:21:01.743 --> 00:21:05.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The words at 2 Peter 3:9 come to mind.

00:21:05.314 --> 00:21:07.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of Jehovah, it says:

00:21:07.849 --> 00:21:12.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He does not desire anyone to be destroyed

00:21:12.254 --> 00:21:17.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but desires all to attain to repentance.”

00:21:17.225 --> 00:21:19.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May that be our resolve

00:21:19.695 --> 00:21:24.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we take to heart
the inspired words of 1 Corinthians 3:10:

00:21:24.199 --> 00:21:28.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one keep watching
how he is building”!
