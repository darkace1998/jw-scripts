Welcome to JW Broadcasting®

00:00:04.054 --> 00:00:06.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
for February 2022!

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:27.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Last month,

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.012 line:10% position:50% align:center
we enjoyed Part 1

00:00:29.012 --> 00:00:31.881 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the 2021 annual meeting.

00:00:31.881 --> 00:00:33.950 line:10% position:50% align:center
That program was filled

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
with exciting announcements,

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:38.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
videos, and stirring talks

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:42.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
delivered by several members
of the Governing Body.

00:00:42.158 --> 00:00:44.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was so heartwarming to see

00:00:44.994 --> 00:00:48.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
a live audience of Bethel family members

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:52.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
come together to enjoy this spiritual feast.

00:00:52.068 --> 00:00:56.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this month,
we’re happy to present the second half

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the annual meeting program.

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:01.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know you’re going to thoroughly enjoy

00:01:01.244 --> 00:01:05.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
the encouraging updates,
interviews, and talks to follow.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know that the pandemic
has altered all of our lives,

00:01:11.354 --> 00:01:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we commend all
in the worldwide brotherhood

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:18.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your loyal response to direction.

00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:20.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you likely know,

00:01:20.597 --> 00:01:24.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
more specific direction
and restrictions were recommended

00:01:24.601 --> 00:01:28.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those who serve
as special full-time servants in the field.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:31.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear now from some of them

00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:34.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the unique circumstances
they experienced.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:39.783 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provides

00:01:39.783 --> 00:01:41.351 line:10% position:50% align:center
all of the things that we need

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.952 line:10% position:50% align:center
to accomplish our ministry

00:01:42.952 --> 00:01:44.387 line:10% position:50% align:center
and to feel secure

00:01:44.387 --> 00:01:47.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what tribulation we face.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
We truly have experienced
Jehovah’s loving support

00:01:51.027 --> 00:01:53.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this pandemic.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:56.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our heavenly Father,
through his organization,

00:01:56.232 --> 00:01:58.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
has provided just what we’ve needed

00:01:58.234 --> 00:02:00.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
to endure faithfully in our ministry

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to stay strong spiritually.

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:05.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
How has the direction

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
to shelter in place
affected circuit overseers,

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:12.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
construction servants, field missionaries,

00:02:12.582 --> 00:02:14.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
and special pioneers?

00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:17.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have they been able
to continue in their ministry

00:02:17.587 --> 00:02:20.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving Jehovah whole-souled and with joy?

00:02:21.457 --> 00:02:23.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
What practical lessons have they learned?

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:28.064 line:10% position:50% align:center
To follow the Governing Body’s direction

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:29.232 line:10% position:50% align:center
to shelter in place,

00:02:29.232 --> 00:02:32.068 line:10% position:50% align:center
we couldn’t go in to see Steve’s mother.

00:02:32.068 --> 00:02:36.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was in aged care just ten minutes away

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
from where we’re based.

00:02:38.308 --> 00:02:41.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
She died while we were sheltering in place.

00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:43.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
This led to another challenge

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
—grieving in isolation.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.651 line:10% position:50% align:center
At the beginning

00:02:48.651 --> 00:02:50.687 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the shelter-in-place direction,

00:02:50.687 --> 00:02:53.323 line:10% position:50% align:center
I had a very difficult time.

00:02:53.323 --> 00:02:56.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had flashbacks

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were very difficult for me.

00:02:59.262 --> 00:03:02.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the Vietnam War,

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:07.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was imprisoned
because of taking a neutral stand.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:11.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a reaction to this lockdown

00:03:11.307 --> 00:03:13.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
of being confined.

00:03:35.031 --> 00:03:37.033 line:10% position:50% align:center
We especially discerned

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:40.036 line:10% position:50% align:center
the value of the direction in November 2020

00:03:40.036 --> 00:03:41.638 line:10% position:50% align:center
when, suddenly,

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:45.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was taken to the hospital
because of a serious heart disease

00:03:45.708 --> 00:03:47.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
and severe pneumonia.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
It turned out that my life was in danger.

00:03:51.648 --> 00:03:55.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
The doctors evaluated
that if I had contracted the coronavirus

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:57.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that condition,

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would not have had a chance to survive it.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
While sheltering in place,

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:06.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
how did these obedient brothers and sisters
stay positive

00:04:06.062 --> 00:04:09.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintain their physical, emotional,
and spiritual health?

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:14.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even through that difficult time,

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
having <i>Zoom</i>  meetings,

00:04:16.906 --> 00:04:19.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
having the meetings for field service,

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:21.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing witnessing by <i>Zoom</i>,

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:23.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being with the brothers and sisters

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:26.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I can’t say enough good about it.

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:30.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
In being able
not to meet an hour requirement

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by going ahead
and being very busy spiritually,

00:04:34.557 --> 00:04:37.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
we did a phenomenal amount of shepherding,

00:04:37.593 --> 00:04:41.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthening, and upbuilding
our brothers and sisters

00:04:41.064 --> 00:04:44.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
—folks literally from around the world
that we knew needed help.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:49.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Governing Body
removed the specific hour requirement,

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:56.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we felt their trust.

00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:59.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
That gave us more flexibility,

00:04:59.148 --> 00:05:01.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this enabled us to reach out

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:04.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
to relatives not in the truth

00:05:04.954 --> 00:05:07.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to support them during the pandemic.

00:05:07.924 --> 00:05:09.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that has led

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:13.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
to two, regular, continuing Bible studies.

00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:16.966 line:10% position:50% align:center
I really feel how much

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:19.102 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body cares for us

00:05:19.102 --> 00:05:21.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
every time they mention in their letters

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:24.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they do not require us
to reach the required hours.

00:05:25.508 --> 00:05:29.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many brothers and sisters today are depressed

00:05:29.112 --> 00:05:31.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experiencing pandemic fatigue.

00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:33.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually they need someone

00:05:33.783 --> 00:05:36.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
who they can talk to about their problems.

00:05:36.185 --> 00:05:38.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because of these adjustments,

00:05:38.354 --> 00:05:40.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
I now have more time to encourage them

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help them to remain spiritually strong.

00:06:11.487 --> 00:06:13.489 line:10% position:50% align:center
Since most congregations I serve

00:06:13.489 --> 00:06:14.824 line:10% position:50% align:center
don’t have Internet access,

00:06:15.992 --> 00:06:18.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
I make video recordings for all the talks.

00:06:20.163 --> 00:06:24.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
I make a simple platform
and set up the microphone and cell phone

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:26.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I use to create the video.

00:06:26.135 --> 00:06:29.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I stand in front
and start giving the talk.

00:06:31.741 --> 00:06:34.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
What blessings did they receive
from their obedience?

00:06:35.678 --> 00:06:40.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy to start
a Bible study during the pandemic,

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:44.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when I saw how quickly
the student was making progress.

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of my health,

00:06:46.422 --> 00:06:50.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
each study session
was about 15 to 20 minutes long.

00:06:50.193 --> 00:06:54.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to find a good place
to conduct the study at the hospital,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
mainly in the hallway.

00:06:56.532 --> 00:06:58.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day after the concluding prayer,

00:06:58.868 --> 00:07:02.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed the door
to a doctor’s office was open.

00:07:02.672 --> 00:07:06.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
The doctor was listening
to our whole Bible study discussion.

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:09.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy
she attended the study as well.

00:07:38.107 --> 00:07:40.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, in my circuit,

00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:43.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
59 Bible students progressed to baptism.

00:07:45.314 --> 00:07:47.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unity within families is another blessing.

00:07:48.985 --> 00:07:51.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents are spending a lot of time

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
conducting Bible studies with their children.

00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:01.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Christian life is compared to a race,

00:08:01.264 --> 00:08:03.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is not a short race.

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:07.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are unexpected things
that can happen to us.

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:13.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
By striving to obey from the heart now,

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:16.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be prepared to obey the directions

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:19.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are going to receive
in the great tribulation.

00:08:22.518 --> 00:08:25.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are sure that this is not the last time

00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:27.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have to be obedient.

00:08:27.356 --> 00:08:29.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see Bible prophecies being fulfilled

00:08:29.358 --> 00:08:32.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
right in front of our eyes,
and ahead of us are

00:08:32.628 --> 00:08:35.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
even greater events
that will bring larger trials.

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:41.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
James 1:2, 3 helps us
despite trials to keep joy

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:44.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
—deep joy—
in our hearts,

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:46.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it assures us
that all difficult situations

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:49.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to work on endurance.

00:08:49.312 --> 00:08:52.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this quality will help us
to cope with trials to come.

00:08:55.051 --> 00:08:57.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
I personally have benefited from following

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body’s direction.

00:09:00.489 --> 00:09:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve actually felt joy every day,

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:09.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I can only put that down
to the blessing from Jehovah God

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:12.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our efforts to be obedient.

00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:17.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve both benefited
from the direction from the Governing Body

00:09:17.006 --> 00:09:19.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we trust

00:09:19.008 --> 00:09:21.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they are
“the faithful and discreet slave.”

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:23.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christ Jesus is directing them.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am so absolutely grateful

00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:32.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Governing Body for providing direction

00:09:32.021 --> 00:09:36.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is blessing every single one of us
around the earth.

00:09:37.593 --> 00:09:39.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like you,

00:09:39.695 --> 00:09:42.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
these dear ones have made great sacrifices

00:09:42.598 --> 00:09:47.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue serving Jehovah
whole-souled during this pandemic,

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and no doubt we’ve all learned the value

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:52.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
of applying the words at 2 Timothy 4:2:

00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:57.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Preach the word; be at it urgently

00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:00.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
in favorable times and difficult times.”

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:04.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a certainty, neither this pandemic

00:10:04.654 --> 00:10:06.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor any other difficult times to come

00:10:06.756 --> 00:10:09.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
will stop our preaching work

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:12.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, more importantly, prevent

00:10:12.495 --> 00:10:14.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s loving care.

00:10:23.673 --> 00:10:26.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
We certainly express
our love and appreciation

00:10:26.409 --> 00:10:28.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all of our special full-time servants
in the field

00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:32.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the excellent example they’ve set
in following direction.

00:10:33.716 --> 00:10:36.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as a very appropriate follow-up

00:10:36.018 --> 00:10:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the two preceding video presentations,

00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:42.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re happy now to have
our very dear Brother Gerrit Lösch,

00:10:42.825 --> 00:10:44.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

00:10:44.827 --> 00:10:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
provide comfort for all of us

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:50.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his talk entitled

00:10:50.066 --> 00:10:53.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No Resident Will Say: ‘I Am Sick.’”

00:10:55.204 --> 00:10:58.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aren’t we all glad that we are healthy enough

00:10:58.507 --> 00:11:02.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to listen
to the annual meeting program?

00:11:02.411 --> 00:11:06.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we don’t want to take it for granted.

00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:10.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Worldwide, some 20,000
of our brothers and sisters

00:11:10.519 --> 00:11:15.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
have died so far from the effects
of the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:18.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
But tens of thousands
of our brothers and sisters,

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
including many relatives,

00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:25.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been and are now
affected emotionally by this fact.

00:11:26.402 --> 00:11:29.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Death tolls affect friends and family,

00:11:29.538 --> 00:11:32.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the feeling of loss is deep.

00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:37.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Secular sources say that the overall
death rate in the United States

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:42.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
is about 1 percent
of the population each year.

00:11:42.618 --> 00:11:44.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every year around the world,

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:49.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
an average of over 60 million people die.

00:11:49.358 --> 00:11:54.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
The daily average is about 164,000.

00:11:54.296 --> 00:11:56.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
How sad!

00:11:57.967 --> 00:12:00.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the COVID-19 plague,

00:12:00.035 --> 00:12:03.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of total deaths
worldwide is, of course, higher.

00:12:04.673 --> 00:12:09.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the United States, over 600,000 citizens

00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
have died from COVID-19 alone.

00:12:13.349 --> 00:12:17.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when tempered
by the hope of the resurrection,

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:21.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
the death of a loved one
is still a traumatic loss

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is deeply felt.

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:29.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Years, perhaps decades,
of close companionship and sharing

00:12:29.331 --> 00:12:34.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
are suddenly and tragically ended.

00:12:34.136 --> 00:12:38.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, if those that died
were part of our family,

00:12:38.374 --> 00:12:42.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
it affects us much more emotionally.

00:12:43.179 --> 00:12:47.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also affected
because we did not expect them to die,

00:12:47.316 --> 00:12:51.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
except perhaps if some
were in their 80’s or 90’s.

00:12:52.855 --> 00:12:55.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though we know that they will come back,

00:12:55.724 --> 00:12:59.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
we still feel hurt and are very sorry

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:02.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have temporarily lost them.

00:13:03.432 --> 00:13:06.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is very sad to lose somebody in death,

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:09.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
even temporarily, isn’t it?

00:13:11.373 --> 00:13:13.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the case of Lazarus,

00:13:13.375 --> 00:13:17.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible shows that even Jesus shed tears

00:13:17.012 --> 00:13:19.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he saw the emotional pain

00:13:19.982 --> 00:13:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced by Lazarus’ sisters.

00:13:23.986 --> 00:13:27.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be sad and to cry
in the case of somebody’s death

00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:30.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not an indication
of somebody’s lack of faith

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
or an emotional imbalance.

00:13:34.129 --> 00:13:38.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never feel ashamed in such a case.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Feel free to “[give] way to tears.”

00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:49.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 5:28, 29,

00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:52.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ promise is comforting.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:54.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:56.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be amazed at this,

00:13:56.886 --> 00:13:58.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[because] the hour is coming

00:13:58.888 --> 00:14:01.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in which all those in the memorial tombs

00:14:01.557 --> 00:14:03.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will hear [the Son of God’s] voice

00:14:03.859 --> 00:14:07.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and come out, those who did good things

00:14:07.029 --> 00:14:09.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to a resurrection of life,

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those who practiced vile things

00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:13.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a resurrection of judgment.”

00:14:14.436 --> 00:14:18.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jehovah foretold
that sickness and death

00:14:18.641 --> 00:14:21.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not continue forever

00:14:21.076 --> 00:14:23.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
but are temporary now

00:14:23.245 --> 00:14:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will soon end as the new world arrives.

00:14:27.983 --> 00:14:31.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in the past, Jehovah miraculously proved

00:14:31.554 --> 00:14:35.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’s able to prevent sickness
and subsequent death.

00:14:35.925 --> 00:14:38.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he proved that he has the power

00:14:38.527 --> 00:14:41.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring back humans to life.

00:14:42.064 --> 00:14:45.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
As much as we are sorry
to have lost relatives

00:14:45.634 --> 00:14:48.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
or friends in death

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:51.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of COVID-19 or any other reason,

00:14:51.774 --> 00:14:56.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can rejoice that Jehovah
will bring them back in the resurrection.

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah brought back some of his servants

00:15:00.749 --> 00:15:03.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the resurrection in the past.

00:15:03.886 --> 00:15:08.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible speaks of nine
specific resurrections of individuals.

00:15:09.491 --> 00:15:12.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of reading a list with their names,

00:15:12.428 --> 00:15:16.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can try to recall who these persons were.

00:15:16.532 --> 00:15:19.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t come up with nine persons,

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:24.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
why not make it a part of a conversation
with friends to complete the list?

00:15:25.341 --> 00:15:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
It refers to Jesus and eight additional ones.

00:15:30.546 --> 00:15:35.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is so encouraging and comforting
to talk about it.

00:15:36.552 --> 00:15:41.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 11:35
speaks of a better resurrection,

00:15:42.157 --> 00:15:47.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
better than the resurrection
of the eight persons mentioned in the Bible

00:15:47.162 --> 00:15:50.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had to die again at a later date.

00:15:51.867 --> 00:15:54.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
The future resurrection is better

00:15:54.503 --> 00:15:57.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it contains the possibility

00:15:57.239 --> 00:16:01.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
to never die again in all eternity.

00:16:02.878 --> 00:16:06.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine living not only for a thousand years

00:16:06.482 --> 00:16:08.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for a million years,

00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:12.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ten million years,
for a hundred million years,

00:16:12.488 --> 00:16:15.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a hundred billion years, and so on.

00:16:17.159 --> 00:16:20.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for those being
brought back in the resurrection,

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:24.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
the resurrection will be
perceived like having happened

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:27.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the blink of an eye after their death,

00:16:27.036 --> 00:16:31.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
although they may have been
dead for quite some time.

00:16:32.775 --> 00:16:35.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
when Lazarus was resurrected,

00:16:35.978 --> 00:16:40.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did not recall
that he was laying in the tomb.

00:16:40.516 --> 00:16:42.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he was resurrected,

00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:44.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
to him it was like the next moment

00:16:44.787 --> 00:16:49.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
after he lost consciousness from dying.

00:16:49.024 --> 00:16:51.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he came to,

00:16:51.026 --> 00:16:54.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had no perception that he was in the tomb.

00:16:54.763 --> 00:16:58.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created man originally.

00:16:58.534 --> 00:17:01.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can also re-create a human.

00:17:02.671 --> 00:17:07.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 104:29, 30 says:

00:17:08.444 --> 00:17:10.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When you hide your face,

00:17:10.612 --> 00:17:12.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they are disturbed.

00:17:12.614 --> 00:17:14.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you take away their spirit,

00:17:14.683 --> 00:17:17.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they die and return to the dust.

00:17:17.319 --> 00:17:19.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you send out the spirit,

00:17:19.555 --> 00:17:21.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are created.”

00:17:21.657 --> 00:17:24.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will give the resurrected ones a body

00:17:24.827 --> 00:17:27.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as it pleases him.

00:17:27.229 --> 00:17:29.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their bodies will be physically sound

00:17:29.832 --> 00:17:33.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obviously look similar
to the original body

00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:37.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they will be recognized
by their loved ones.

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:42.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithful Christians who die late
during the time of the end

00:17:42.444 --> 00:17:46.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
will likely be among
the first ones to be raised again.

00:17:47.583 --> 00:17:50.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also expect an early resurrection

00:17:50.385 --> 00:17:52.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some of the faithful men of old

00:17:52.688 --> 00:17:57.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will join others
as “princes” in the new world.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:03.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless, we should not be
dogmatic on such matters.

00:18:03.098 --> 00:18:06.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
On many issues related to the resurrection,

00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:08.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible is silent.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:11.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not spell out details of how,

00:18:11.473 --> 00:18:13.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
when, or at what locations

00:18:13.909 --> 00:18:17.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
the resurrection of individuals will occur.

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:20.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not tell us how those returning

00:18:20.949 --> 00:18:24.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be housed, fed, and clothed.

00:18:24.887 --> 00:18:27.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would be unwise to spend a lot of time

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:32.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to find answers
that are at present unanswerable.

00:18:32.895 --> 00:18:35.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is best to just focus

00:18:35.397 --> 00:18:38.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the fact of the resurrection to come.

00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:43.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 15:52

00:18:43.438 --> 00:18:45.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
also speaks of the resurrection

00:18:45.941 --> 00:18:48.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not of an earthly resurrection,

00:18:48.677 --> 00:18:52.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a heavenly, spiritual one.

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:55.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
This text refers to anointed ones

00:18:55.284 --> 00:18:59.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would die and be raised
“in the blink of an eye.”

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:04.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
This resurrection began during our time,
the time of the end.

00:19:05.961 --> 00:19:09.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they die,
they go to heaven in an instant

00:19:09.565 --> 00:19:12.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like during “the blink of an eye.”

00:19:13.302 --> 00:19:18.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
But those who have the earthly hope
to live forever on earth in Paradise

00:19:18.106 --> 00:19:21.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
also will have the same perception later

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:24.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they will be
resurrected in the Paradise.

00:19:26.048 --> 00:19:30.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
The time from their death
to the moment of their resurrection

00:19:30.118 --> 00:19:34.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be consciously experienced by them.

00:19:34.656 --> 00:19:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be for them
like the ‘blinking of an eye.’

00:19:40.028 --> 00:19:42.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those resurrected to heaven

00:19:42.397 --> 00:19:45.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
will obtain immortality.

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:49.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those resurrected on earth
will not be immortal

00:19:49.905 --> 00:19:54.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
but have the chance to live
forever as long as they remain faithful.

00:19:56.845 --> 00:20:00.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
In connection with the ancient Israelites,

00:20:00.015 --> 00:20:03.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also proved that he’s able to protect

00:20:03.018 --> 00:20:05.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
his people from sicknesses.

00:20:05.554 --> 00:20:09.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he did it
when the Israelites remained faithful.

00:20:10.993 --> 00:20:13.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deuteronomy 7:15 foretold

00:20:13.829 --> 00:20:17.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
in connection with those
who escaped from Egypt:

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:21.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will take away
from you all sickness,

00:20:21.937 --> 00:20:24.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will not bring upon you

00:20:24.072 --> 00:20:28.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
any of the terrible diseases
that you have known in Egypt.”

00:20:30.245 --> 00:20:33.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can trust that Jehovah
fulfilled his promise.

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:37.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did so when the Israelites were faithful.

00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:42.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
He blessed the Israelites
with good health and long life.

00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:47.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
This shows his past love
for the people of Israel.

00:20:47.229 --> 00:20:49.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also indicates his power

00:20:49.564 --> 00:20:53.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that if he wishes to repeat this miracle,

00:20:53.135 --> 00:20:55.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
he can do it, of course.

00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:00.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will do so after Armageddon,

00:21:00.175 --> 00:21:04.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the Millennium,
or Thousand Year Reign of Christ.

00:21:05.614 --> 00:21:09.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 22:2 foretells

00:21:09.117 --> 00:21:11.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the healing of the nations.”

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes physical and emotional
healing in the new world.

00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:20.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Death is really an enemy,

00:21:20.429 --> 00:21:23.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah will do away with it.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 33:24, it says

00:21:27.970 --> 00:21:30.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in the new world

00:21:30.005 --> 00:21:34.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:21:36.511 --> 00:21:38.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no hospitals.

00:21:38.513 --> 00:21:40.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no drugstores.

00:21:40.816 --> 00:21:43.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no physicians.

00:21:43.118 --> 00:21:45.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be no professional nurses.

00:21:47.255 --> 00:21:51.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 21:4,
it foretells that in the new world

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be ‘neither mourning
nor outcry nor pain anymore.’

00:21:58.333 --> 00:22:01.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are very sad
about what happened around the world

00:22:01.403 --> 00:22:03.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
with so many of our brothers and sisters

00:22:03.772 --> 00:22:06.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
falling asleep from COVID-19 recently,

00:22:06.808 --> 00:22:10.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we know they will come back.

00:22:10.712 --> 00:22:13.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will come back healthy.

00:22:13.015 --> 00:22:17.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will not come back
looking like old people,

00:22:17.652 --> 00:22:20.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if they died at 80 years.

00:22:20.222 --> 00:22:24.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
They might look like they are
in their 30’s when resurrected.

00:22:25.694 --> 00:22:27.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
As stated earlier,

00:22:27.696 --> 00:22:31.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will look reasonably similar
to their original body

00:22:31.666 --> 00:22:35.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they will be recognized
by their loved ones.

00:22:37.005 --> 00:22:40.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
How it fills our hearts with love for Jehovah

00:22:40.642 --> 00:22:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he will bring back
in the resurrection our loved ones!

00:22:46.148 --> 00:22:49.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul had a firm hope.

00:22:49.718 --> 00:22:54.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
He explained at 2 Corinthians 1:7:

00:22:54.723 --> 00:22:58.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our hope for you is unwavering,

00:22:58.994 --> 00:23:01.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“knowing as we do that,

00:23:01.063 --> 00:23:04.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you are sharers of the sufferings,

00:23:04.299 --> 00:23:07.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the same way
you will also share the comfort.”

00:23:10.005 --> 00:23:14.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the conclusion of his letter, Paul urged:

00:23:14.076 --> 00:23:17.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue . . . to be comforted, . . .

00:23:17.179 --> 00:23:21.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the God of love and of peace
will be with you.”

00:23:23.218 --> 00:23:27.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an important lesson
we can learn from this!

00:23:27.055 --> 00:23:29.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
All members of the Christian congregation

00:23:29.624 --> 00:23:34.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to share the comfort
that God provides through his Word,

00:23:34.629 --> 00:23:39.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
his holy spirit,
and his earthly organization.

00:23:39.401 --> 00:23:44.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
The principal source of comfort is,
of course, Jehovah himself.

00:23:44.339 --> 00:23:49.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no real lasting comfort
that does not originate with God.

00:23:50.645 --> 00:23:53.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appropriately, then, Paul wrote:

00:23:53.115 --> 00:23:57.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Blessed] be the God and Father
of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:23:57.819 --> 00:24:00.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Father of tender mercies

00:24:00.088 --> 00:24:02.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the God of all comfort,

00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
who comforts us in all our [tribulation].”

00:24:06.561 --> 00:24:09.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
What inspiring words!

00:24:11.366 --> 00:24:14.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Greek word here rendered “comfort”

00:24:14.302 --> 00:24:18.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
is linked to “a calling to one side.”

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:23.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, it is the standing
beside a person to encourage him

00:24:23.645 --> 00:24:26.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he’s undergoing severe testing.

00:24:27.782 --> 00:24:30.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Biblical scholar wrote:

00:24:30.385 --> 00:24:32.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The word . . . always means

00:24:32.854 --> 00:24:36.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
“far more than soothing sympathy. . . .

00:24:36.258 --> 00:24:40.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Christian comfort
is the comfort which brings courage,

00:24:40.162 --> 00:24:42.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the comfort which enables a man to cope

00:24:42.764 --> 00:24:45.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all that life can do to him.”

00:24:47.602 --> 00:24:49.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also includes comforting words

00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:52.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are based on a solid promise and hope

00:24:52.874 --> 00:24:56.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that of the resurrection of the dead.

00:24:57.546 --> 00:25:02.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we do
to enhance the comfort for others?

00:25:03.251 --> 00:25:04.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the most helpful things you can do

00:25:07.222 --> 00:25:11.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to share
the bereaved one’s pain by listening.

00:25:11.826 --> 00:25:15.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may ask,
“Would you care to talk about it?”

00:25:16.464 --> 00:25:20.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Christian recalls when his father died,

00:25:20.168 --> 00:25:24.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It really helped me
when others asked what happened

00:25:24.039 --> 00:25:26.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then really listened.”

00:25:27.442 --> 00:25:31.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen patiently and sympathetically.

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Weep with [people] who weep”

00:25:33.582 --> 00:25:37.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
recommends the Bible at Romans 12:15.

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:40.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be available.

00:25:40.121 --> 00:25:43.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make yourself available
not just for the first few days

00:25:43.758 --> 00:25:47.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
when many friends and relatives are present,

00:25:47.596 --> 00:25:50.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
but for months later, if necessary,

00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:53.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
when others have returned
to their normal routine.

00:25:55.337 --> 00:25:59.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Christian interest and sympathy
can mean so much

00:25:59.307 --> 00:26:02.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
in any time of need.

00:26:02.577 --> 00:26:05.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says that “there exists a friend

00:26:05.814 --> 00:26:08.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
sticking closer than a brother.”

00:26:10.518 --> 00:26:14.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about the good qualities
of the deceased person.

00:26:14.856 --> 00:26:17.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is another great help.

00:26:17.726 --> 00:26:20.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Share positive anecdotes

00:26:20.495 --> 00:26:23.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you recall about the individual,

00:26:23.298 --> 00:26:26.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not be afraid
to use the person’s name.

00:26:27.869 --> 00:26:32.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Write a letter or send a comforting card.

00:26:32.173 --> 00:26:36.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often overlooked
is the value of a condolence letter

00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:38.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a beautiful sympathy card.

00:26:38.613 --> 00:26:40.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its advantage?

00:26:40.615 --> 00:26:44.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be read over and over again.

00:26:44.386 --> 00:26:47.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such a letter need not be long,

00:26:47.555 --> 00:26:49.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it should show your compassion.

00:26:51.726 --> 00:26:53.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
 Pray with them.

00:26:53.728 --> 00:26:57.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not underestimate
the value of your prayers

00:26:57.666 --> 00:27:01.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
with and for bereaved fellow Christians.

00:27:01.603 --> 00:27:05.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible says at James 5:16:

00:27:05.407 --> 00:27:10.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A righteous man’s supplication . . .
has much force.”

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Encourage sufferers to meditate on Jehovah.

00:27:16.484 --> 00:27:19.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s the God of all comfort.

00:27:19.721 --> 00:27:22.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said in Isaiah:

00:27:22.157 --> 00:27:25.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I [I] myself am the One

00:27:25.694 --> 00:27:28.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is comforting you [people].”

00:27:28.563 --> 00:27:30.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also said:

00:27:30.632 --> 00:27:34.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like a man whom
his own mother keeps comforting,

00:27:34.369 --> 00:27:37.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I myself shall
keep comforting you people.”

00:27:41.476 --> 00:27:45.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Find with me Psalm 119.

00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:50.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s first read verses 50, 52:

00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my comfort in my affliction,

00:27:54.889 --> 00:27:58.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your saying has preserved me alive.”

00:27:59.027 --> 00:28:00.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 52:

00:28:00.695 --> 00:28:03.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I remember your judgments from of old,

00:28:03.798 --> 00:28:07.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah, and I find comfort in them.”

00:28:08.236 --> 00:28:11.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now even verse 76:

00:28:11.573 --> 00:28:15.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May your loyal love please comfort me,

00:28:15.944 --> 00:28:17.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to the promise

00:28:17.679 --> 00:28:19.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
you made to your servant.”

00:28:21.049 --> 00:28:23.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note that the word “comfort”

00:28:23.518 --> 00:28:27.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
is used repeatedly in those passages.

00:28:27.655 --> 00:28:32.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we can find true comfort
for ourselves and for others

00:28:32.694 --> 00:28:37.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
by turning to Jehovah’s Word
in our time of affliction.

00:28:37.699 --> 00:28:42.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
This combined
with the love and compassion of the brothers

00:28:42.003 --> 00:28:47.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to live
through our loss and fill our lives again

00:28:47.008 --> 00:28:50.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
with joyful activity
in the Christian ministry.

00:28:51.479 --> 00:28:54.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege to worship the Almighty,

00:28:54.516 --> 00:28:56.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
our loving God, Jehovah,

00:28:56.751 --> 00:29:01.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will bring back
our loved ones in the resurrection!

00:29:01.156 --> 00:29:03.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will never again be a pandemic

00:29:03.992 --> 00:29:07.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
to claim the life of faithful servants.

00:29:07.228 --> 00:29:09.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because at that time

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:13.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“no resident will say: ‘I am sick.’”

00:29:18.473 --> 00:29:20.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we truly thank you, Brother Lösch,

00:29:20.542 --> 00:29:23.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those very comforting, loving words.

00:29:23.244 --> 00:29:26.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really felt your love
for the worldwide brotherhood.

00:29:26.681 --> 00:29:30.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
And certainly those words
were “food at the proper time.”

00:29:31.753 --> 00:29:35.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we’re going
to change the direction somewhat

00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a talk from another member
of the Governing Body,

00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:40.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Stephen Lett.

00:29:40.562 --> 00:29:42.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
His topic is

00:29:42.564 --> 00:29:46.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We Can Be Victorious Over Satan’s Attack!”

00:29:48.636 --> 00:29:53.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will you do
in the face of Satan’s attack?

00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:57.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s a relevant question
for all of us here

00:29:57.178 --> 00:29:59.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
because without exception,

00:29:59.247 --> 00:30:03.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re under a vicious, intense attack.

00:30:03.084 --> 00:30:05.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question is,

00:30:05.086 --> 00:30:10.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the battle intensifies
in our individual cases,

00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:12.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
will we be able to stand our ground,

00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:14.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
bravely fight,

00:30:14.762 --> 00:30:16.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come off victorious?

00:30:16.865 --> 00:30:20.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, obviously your desire
is to be victorious—isn’t it?—

00:30:20.301 --> 00:30:23.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you wouldn’t be attending
this special program.

00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:28.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need more than just the desire

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:31.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re going to ensure victory.

00:30:31.813 --> 00:30:34.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, to win any battle,

00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:38.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need accurate knowledge of three things:

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to know our enemy,

00:30:40.922 --> 00:30:42.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
know his strategy,

00:30:42.924 --> 00:30:45.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and know what we have to defend ourselves.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:49.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first,
let’s talk about our enemy, Satan.

00:30:49.797 --> 00:30:52.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is no ordinary foe.

00:30:52.867 --> 00:30:57.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah educates us
regarding this enemy we’re fighting.

00:30:57.872 --> 00:31:01.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
For one thing,
he’s a premeditative murderer.

00:31:01.743 --> 00:31:04.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at what he did to Job’s attendants

00:31:04.746 --> 00:31:07.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
—slaughtered them with marauder bands.

00:31:07.582 --> 00:31:10.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others were consumed with fire.

00:31:10.218 --> 00:31:13.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at what he did to Job’s ten children.

00:31:13.655 --> 00:31:16.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
He simultaneously murdered

00:31:16.591 --> 00:31:19.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
all ten of them with a violent windstorm.

00:31:19.694 --> 00:31:22.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he’s a premeditative murderer.

00:31:22.163 --> 00:31:27.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to murder into everlasting death
every one of us here.

00:31:27.168 --> 00:31:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, on top of this,
he is highly intelligent.

00:31:31.472 --> 00:31:33.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
As one brother said,

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:38.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He may be evil, wicked, murderous,
but he’s not stupid.”

00:31:38.346 --> 00:31:40.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s highly intelligent.

00:31:40.348 --> 00:31:42.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, think about this:

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:44.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact that he was once in the truth

00:31:44.385 --> 00:31:48.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes him more intelligent in a sense,
or (we could say) clever,

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he has knowledge
of having been in the truth.

00:31:52.126 --> 00:31:54.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 8:44 says:

00:31:54.128 --> 00:31:56.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He did not stand fast in the truth.”

00:31:56.431 --> 00:31:57.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he was in the truth.

00:31:57.498 --> 00:32:01.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to illustrate
how this makes him more dangerous,

00:32:01.302 --> 00:32:04.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about a few of the false brothers

00:32:04.973 --> 00:32:07.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
during World War II

00:32:07.008 --> 00:32:09.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
who left the truth

00:32:09.043 --> 00:32:14.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
and joined the Nazis
in persecuting the brothers in the truth.

00:32:14.048 --> 00:32:16.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had knowledge
of who were taking the lead.

00:32:16.918 --> 00:32:18.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew where they lived.

00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
They knew the strategy
that was being utilized.

00:32:21.923 --> 00:32:23.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were more dangerous, weren’t they?

00:32:23.491 --> 00:32:25.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s the same with Satan.

00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:28.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Corinthians 11:14 says:

00:32:28.463 --> 00:32:32.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Satan . . . keeps disguising himself

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an angel of light.”

00:32:34.068 --> 00:32:36.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s very easy for him

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pretend to be what he used to be.

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:41.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that makes him more dangerous.

00:32:41.376 --> 00:32:44.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, open up, please,
to Revelation chapter 12

00:32:44.579 --> 00:32:46.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a very familiar scripture.

00:32:46.614 --> 00:32:50.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s reason on this to help us further

00:32:50.385 --> 00:32:55.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to underestimate, or underrate, our enemy

00:32:55.023 --> 00:32:57.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Revelation 12:7.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:01.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And war broke out in heaven:

00:33:01.796 --> 00:33:05.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Michael and his angels battled
with the dragon,

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the dragon and its angels battled

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they did not prevail,

00:33:10.872 --> 00:33:14.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor was a place found for them
any longer in heaven.

00:33:14.175 --> 00:33:17.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So down the great dragon was hurled,

00:33:17.645 --> 00:33:21.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the original serpent,
the one called Devil and Satan,

00:33:21.783 --> 00:33:25.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who is misleading
the entire inhabited earth;

00:33:25.453 --> 00:33:27.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was hurled down to the earth,

00:33:27.722 --> 00:33:30.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his angels were hurled down with him.”

00:33:30.925 --> 00:33:32.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then look at verse 12:

00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:35.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On this account be glad,

00:33:35.329 --> 00:33:39.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you heavens and you who reside in them!

00:33:39.033 --> 00:33:41.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Woe for the earth and for the sea,

00:33:41.736 --> 00:33:45.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the Devil has come down to you,

00:33:45.606 --> 00:33:47.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“having great anger,

00:33:47.608 --> 00:33:51.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing that he has a short period of time.”

00:33:51.079 --> 00:33:54.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you notice, he’s not just mad.

00:33:54.248 --> 00:33:56.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has “great anger.”

00:33:56.851 --> 00:33:59.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is he so angry?

00:33:59.654 --> 00:34:03.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,
after he lost the war in heaven,

00:34:03.658 --> 00:34:05.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wasn’t merely asked to leave heaven

00:34:05.927 --> 00:34:08.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he quietly left.

00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:11.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read that “he was hurled” out of heaven,

00:34:11.999 --> 00:34:15.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that denotes thrown with great force.

00:34:15.336 --> 00:34:18.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that undoubtedly added to his great anger.

00:34:18.973 --> 00:34:21.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
But also think about this:

00:34:21.042 --> 00:34:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tremendous reduction
of his sphere of movement

00:34:24.879 --> 00:34:27.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
adds undoubtedly to his great anger.

00:34:27.715 --> 00:34:29.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before being cast out of heaven,

00:34:29.851 --> 00:34:31.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
apparently he had access

00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:35.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
to both the vast, vast physical
and spiritual heavens,

00:34:35.423 --> 00:34:39.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now he’s confined to the vicinity

00:34:39.727 --> 00:34:42.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this little, tiny earth.

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:45.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think about it,
not only does that make him mad,

00:34:45.867 --> 00:34:47.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
it makes him more dangerous, doesn’t it?

00:34:47.969 --> 00:34:50.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before being cast out of heaven,

00:34:50.471 --> 00:34:55.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
undoubtedly he would try to turn away
the angels part of the time

00:34:55.143 --> 00:34:57.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would try to turn away humans.

00:34:57.378 --> 00:34:59.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was divided in his attention.

00:34:59.547 --> 00:35:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we have his undivided attention,
don’t we?

00:35:04.152 --> 00:35:07.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s bad for us,
and that makes him dangerous.

00:35:07.021 --> 00:35:11.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s another illustration
about the increasing of the danger.

00:35:11.459 --> 00:35:16.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like you to imagine
that all of the Mafia members,

00:35:16.464 --> 00:35:19.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the drug cartel members,

00:35:19.867 --> 00:35:24.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all of the terrorists
on the entire planet Earth were gathered up

00:35:24.572 --> 00:35:28.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
and were confined to New York City,
the city limits,

00:35:28.176 --> 00:35:30.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you lived there too.

00:35:30.178 --> 00:35:33.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can you imagine
the escalation of crime and evil

00:35:33.815 --> 00:35:35.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would take place there?

00:35:35.817 --> 00:35:39.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, we read that he’s mad and angry

00:35:39.987 --> 00:35:42.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he knows his time is short.

00:35:42.824 --> 00:35:46.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if that was true back around 1914,

00:35:46.828 --> 00:35:49.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
what about today, over 100 years later?

00:35:49.864 --> 00:35:53.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows his expiration date is almost here.

00:35:53.301 --> 00:35:55.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you add it all up,
and his anger

00:35:55.937 --> 00:36:00.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
is truly, really white hot,
you could say.

00:36:00.942 --> 00:36:03.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he has hordes of demon helpers.

00:36:03.377 --> 00:36:05.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
That makes him more dangerous too.

00:36:05.379 --> 00:36:07.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think it would be possible

00:36:07.682 --> 00:36:11.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a demon to block
one of Jehovah’s good angels?

00:36:11.719 --> 00:36:13.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, be careful how you answer that.

00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:16.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel 10:13

00:36:16.624 --> 00:36:19.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
talks about the demon prince of Persia

00:36:19.727 --> 00:36:24.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
blocking Jehovah’s good angel “for 21 days.”

00:36:24.432 --> 00:36:26.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how was that possible?

00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:27.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t know for sure,

00:36:27.902 --> 00:36:29.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
but perhaps the demon prince

00:36:29.904 --> 00:36:34.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
before becoming a demon
had been a cherub or a seraph.

00:36:34.742 --> 00:36:38.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe the one sent on the assignment
was a messenger angel.

00:36:38.145 --> 00:36:41.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
Michael came to help the good angel,

00:36:41.115 --> 00:36:44.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was able to get past that demon.

00:36:44.185 --> 00:36:46.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that scripture and others

00:36:46.587 --> 00:36:50.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us not to underestimate the demons.

00:36:50.057 --> 00:36:52.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t underestimate
“the ruler of the demons”

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor these demons
who work under his supervision.

00:36:57.098 --> 00:36:59.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
So adding it up,

00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find that Satan
is a premeditative murderer.

00:37:03.838 --> 00:37:06.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s highly intelligent.

00:37:06.374 --> 00:37:08.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has great anger

00:37:08.376 --> 00:37:11.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his great reduction
of sphere of movement

00:37:11.712 --> 00:37:14.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because of his expiration of time,

00:37:14.382 --> 00:37:17.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has hordes of demon helpers.

00:37:17.318 --> 00:37:20.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jehovah has given us
all this information,

00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:23.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just to fill up pages in the Bible

00:37:23.324 --> 00:37:25.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
but so that we are determined

00:37:25.426 --> 00:37:28.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
to recognize the enemy we’re up against

00:37:28.162 --> 00:37:30.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we’re determined
to fight even harder

00:37:30.464 --> 00:37:33.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can be victorious.

00:37:33.801 --> 00:37:35.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s take a little time

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:39.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get to know our enemy’s strategy.

00:37:39.106 --> 00:37:42.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, thanks to Jehovah,
we’re not in the dark, are we?

00:37:42.777 --> 00:37:45.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Corinthians 2:11 says

00:37:45.446 --> 00:37:49.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that we may not be overreached by Satan,

00:37:49.383 --> 00:37:54.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
for we are not ignorant of his designs.”

00:37:54.288 --> 00:37:56.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are we not ignorant?

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:59.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, very kindly Jehovah has exposed

00:37:59.093 --> 00:38:03.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
the full spectrum of Satan’s designs,

00:38:03.397 --> 00:38:05.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
his strategies, his maneuvers.

00:38:05.399 --> 00:38:09.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s exposed all of them
in his Word, the Bible.

00:38:09.136 --> 00:38:11.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that’s very kind of Jehovah
—isn’t it?—

00:38:11.706 --> 00:38:13.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
very kind of Jehovah.

00:38:13.207 --> 00:38:17.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though the Bible was written
(the completion of it)

00:38:17.378 --> 00:38:19.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 1,900 years ago,

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:24.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah, let’s say 100 years
after the Bible had been written,

00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:26.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t come to the realization:

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:31.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh, no! I forgot to put one
of Satan’s tricks in the Bible.

00:38:31.092 --> 00:38:33.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, no! My people won’t be ready for it.’

00:38:33.995 --> 00:38:37.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, Jehovah has exposed every one of them

00:38:37.665 --> 00:38:40.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his Word, the Bible.

00:38:40.167 --> 00:38:43.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what two basic categories

00:38:43.004 --> 00:38:45.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
does God’s Word indicate

00:38:45.406 --> 00:38:48.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Satan’s strategies can be divided into?

00:38:48.676 --> 00:38:51.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first, we have the frontal attack.

00:38:51.112 --> 00:38:55.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s characterized
by bannings, imprisonments,

00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:58.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
threats, and acts of violence,

00:38:58.185 --> 00:39:01.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as were used on our brothers
in Malawi in the past

00:39:01.689 --> 00:39:05.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are being used today
in Russia on our brothers.

00:39:05.693 --> 00:39:07.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you don’t have to scratch
your head and say,

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:10.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I wonder if I’m being persecuted.’

00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:12.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you have the frontal attack,
it’s obvious, isn’t it?

00:39:12.867 --> 00:39:15.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s clear—the frontal attack.

00:39:15.936 --> 00:39:20.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has this proved to be
Satan’s most successful method of attack?

00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:23.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not really.

00:39:23.444 --> 00:39:25.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s just one experience

00:39:25.579 --> 00:39:29.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of thousands that could be related
to substantiate this point.

00:39:29.517 --> 00:39:32.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this experience centers

00:39:32.019 --> 00:39:34.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
around a 29-year-old brother

00:39:34.755 --> 00:39:37.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
named August Dickmann.

00:39:37.024 --> 00:39:39.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you probably remember this experience.

00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was put
in Sachsenhausen concentration camp

00:39:42.563 --> 00:39:44.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1937,

00:39:44.565 --> 00:39:46.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
but then three days

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
after World War II began

00:39:50.004 --> 00:39:52.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1939,

00:39:52.006 --> 00:39:56.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was ordered to sign
his military induction slip.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:58.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, he refused to do that.

00:39:58.612 --> 00:40:01.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the camp commander was furious.

00:40:01.048 --> 00:40:04.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he got permission from Himmler,

00:40:04.785 --> 00:40:07.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
the head of the SS guard,

00:40:07.388 --> 00:40:10.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
to publicly execute August

00:40:10.825 --> 00:40:13.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
in front of all the camp inmates.

00:40:13.461 --> 00:40:17.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he arranged a special assembly

00:40:17.264 --> 00:40:19.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
after he got this permission,

00:40:19.266 --> 00:40:21.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had Jehovah’s Witnesses
right down in front,

00:40:21.769 --> 00:40:26.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they would get the full impact
of the execution of our dear brother.

00:40:26.574 --> 00:40:29.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after he was executed,

00:40:29.009 --> 00:40:32.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the other inmates were dismissed,

00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:34.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah’s Witnesses had to stay.

00:40:34.548 --> 00:40:37.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with great enthusiasm,

00:40:37.551 --> 00:40:41.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
the camp commander
said to the Witnesses there,

00:40:41.222 --> 00:40:46.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said,
“Who is now ready to sign the declaration?”

00:40:47.061 --> 00:40:49.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, not one

00:40:49.063 --> 00:40:52.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
of more than 400 Witnesses responded.

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:56.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then two stepped forward.

00:40:56.137 --> 00:40:58.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, not to sign

00:40:58.139 --> 00:41:02.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to ask that their signatures
given about a year earlier

00:41:02.743 --> 00:41:04.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
be annulled.

00:41:04.778 --> 00:41:07.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a slap in Satan’s face!

00:41:07.581 --> 00:41:09.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that really illustrates

00:41:09.583 --> 00:41:12.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
the poor success rate
of this frontal attack, see,

00:41:12.987 --> 00:41:15.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many other experiences could be related.

00:41:15.523 --> 00:41:17.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s certainly proving true

00:41:17.525 --> 00:41:20.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers in Russia today,
including elderly ones.

00:41:20.194 --> 00:41:24.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
The frontal attack
has a very poor success rate

00:41:24.031 --> 00:41:26.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a slap in Satan’s face.

00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:30.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now,
what is the second category of strategy

00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:34.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
that sadly has claimed
many spiritual victims?

00:41:34.508 --> 00:41:38.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Ephesians chapter 6,

00:41:38.012 --> 00:41:42.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here we can identify in verse 11

00:41:42.483 --> 00:41:45.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
this second category.

00:41:45.186 --> 00:41:49.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Put on the complete suit of armor from God

00:41:49.557 --> 00:41:52.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may be able to stand firm

00:41:52.526 --> 00:41:57.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
against the crafty acts of the Devil.”

00:41:57.331 --> 00:42:01.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
So notice that
—“crafty,” sneaky, underhanded, devious.

00:42:01.468 --> 00:42:04.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan uses these,

00:42:04.338 --> 00:42:09.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s brought down many
away from Jehovah and out of the truth.

00:42:09.276 --> 00:42:12.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
These “crafty acts” remind me

00:42:12.413 --> 00:42:14.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
of an illustration years ago

00:42:14.415 --> 00:42:17.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
in one of our publications of a soldier

00:42:17.084 --> 00:42:21.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was looking in the distance
for the enemy to come over the horizon.

00:42:21.155 --> 00:42:23.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was looking for the frontal attack,

00:42:23.457 --> 00:42:26.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he wasn’t looking
in the rocks down by his feet.

00:42:26.527 --> 00:42:29.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a poisonous snake lurking.

00:42:29.263 --> 00:42:30.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that powerfully made the point:

00:42:30.798 --> 00:42:33.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to watch,
yes, for the frontal attack

00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:38.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially for the snake-in-the-rocks
attacks of the Devil

00:42:38.272 --> 00:42:42.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can really bring you down
without you realizing what has happened.

00:42:42.876 --> 00:42:46.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah assures us that we can succeed

00:42:46.647 --> 00:42:51.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
in triumphing over both
of these categories of attacks.

00:42:51.151 --> 00:42:55.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, Psalm 91:13 is a beautiful thought.

00:42:55.256 --> 00:42:57.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says, and Jehovah assures:

00:42:57.858 --> 00:43:00.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will trample underfoot

00:43:00.995 --> 00:43:03.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the maned lion

00:43:03.364 --> 00:43:06.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>and</i>  the big snake.”

00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:10.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the <i>Insight</i>  book explains
that apparently in that scripture,

00:43:10.638 --> 00:43:13.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the maned lion”
represents the frontal attack,

00:43:13.474 --> 00:43:16.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
the open attacks of Satan,

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas “the big snake” represents
the sneaky, crafty acts of the Devil.

00:43:20.681 --> 00:43:25.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah says
“you will trample” both of them “underfoot.”

00:43:25.519 --> 00:43:28.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can be successful over both of them.

00:43:28.856 --> 00:43:32.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what are some
of these snakelike, crafty acts?

00:43:32.159 --> 00:43:34.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s just discuss two examples.

00:43:34.895 --> 00:43:37.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one: materialism.

00:43:37.665 --> 00:43:42.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this has brought down
many elders, ministerial servants,

00:43:42.503 --> 00:43:46.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
pioneers, publishers
—a very successful crafty act of the Devil.

00:43:46.707 --> 00:43:50.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s no coincidence that this world

00:43:50.277 --> 00:43:55.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
is powerfully geared to promote materialism.

00:43:55.149 --> 00:43:57.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Relentless advertising messages

00:43:57.885 --> 00:44:00.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
are designed to indoctrinate deeply

00:44:00.621 --> 00:44:05.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
the idea that acquiring
abundant material possessions

00:44:05.492 --> 00:44:07.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
and acquiring happiness

00:44:07.795 --> 00:44:11.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
are inseparably linked
and directly proportional.

00:44:11.699 --> 00:44:14.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s really the message the world gives.

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:16.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:44:16.303 --> 00:44:19.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we’re not careful,
we can begin to think

00:44:19.707 --> 00:44:22.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
like these advertising messages
want us to think

00:44:22.943 --> 00:44:25.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that we’re a poor, poor loser

00:44:25.446 --> 00:44:28.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we don’t acquire abundant material things.

00:44:28.782 --> 00:44:29.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can happen?

00:44:29.817 --> 00:44:32.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could get sucked
into this little by little.

00:44:32.519 --> 00:44:33.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
We buy one item.

00:44:33.554 --> 00:44:36.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
No problem, we can handle that.

00:44:36.990 --> 00:44:38.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
We buy something else.

00:44:38.158 --> 00:44:40.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we need
to work a little bit of overtime

00:44:40.861 --> 00:44:42.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make the payments.

00:44:42.296 --> 00:44:43.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
We keep buying.

00:44:43.797 --> 00:44:45.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we need to take a second job.

00:44:45.999 --> 00:44:48.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Little by little,
we’re missing meetings, service,

00:44:48.969 --> 00:44:52.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s less time for personal study
—“the more important things.”

00:44:52.506 --> 00:44:54.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
And little by little

00:44:54.575 --> 00:44:58.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
(we could call Satan the god of gradualism),

00:44:58.445 --> 00:45:02.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll take us away from Jehovah
by means of materialism.

00:45:02.616 --> 00:45:04.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s one more example:

00:45:04.918 --> 00:45:07.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
bad association.

00:45:07.287 --> 00:45:11.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Corinthians 15:33, Jehovah says:

00:45:11.258 --> 00:45:14.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be misled.

00:45:14.695 --> 00:45:19.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bad associations spoil useful habits.”

00:45:19.933 --> 00:45:21.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might try to mislead ourselves:

00:45:21.935 --> 00:45:24.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh, I can handle it; I’m strong enough.

00:45:24.338 --> 00:45:27.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I’ll even bring this person
into the truth.’

00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:29.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or others may try to mislead us.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:32.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah says: “Do not be misled.”

00:45:32.946 --> 00:45:36.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he gives the terrible consequences.

00:45:36.383 --> 00:45:38.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of this illustration:

00:45:38.385 --> 00:45:42.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you lock a man and a skunk in a closet,

00:45:44.091 --> 00:45:49.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they come out,
will the skunk smell like the man

00:45:49.062 --> 00:45:51.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
or will the man smell like the skunk?

00:45:51.465 --> 00:45:53.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know the answer,

00:45:53.634 --> 00:45:57.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah knows it works the same way
with bad association.

00:45:59.039 --> 00:46:03.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, those are just two examples
of crafty acts of the Devil.

00:46:03.477 --> 00:46:05.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many others.

00:46:05.078 --> 00:46:06.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re all exposed, though,
as we said before.

00:46:06.814 --> 00:46:09.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah kindly has done that.

00:46:09.049 --> 00:46:10.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now think of this.

00:46:10.050 --> 00:46:13.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of this illustration:
If you’re walking in darkness

00:46:13.687 --> 00:46:15.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a loving friend

00:46:15.789 --> 00:46:19.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he shines a flashlight on a trap

00:46:19.827 --> 00:46:22.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is right in front of you,

00:46:22.095 --> 00:46:25.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
does the light of that flashlight
remove the trap?

00:46:25.699 --> 00:46:28.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, it just shows you where it is.

00:46:28.802 --> 00:46:31.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now it’s up to us to go around the trap.

00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:32.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that true?

00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:34.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
How foolish to go ahead and step in that trap

00:46:34.641 --> 00:46:36.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our friend has illuminated!

00:46:36.743 --> 00:46:40.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah is the Friend
in that illustration.

00:46:40.013 --> 00:46:42.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have to do our part, don’t we?

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:47.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve thus far discussed our evil enemy

00:46:47.754 --> 00:46:51.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his sinister strategy,
which Jehovah has exposed.

00:46:51.425 --> 00:46:54.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now,
what do we have to defend ourselves?

00:46:54.628 --> 00:46:58.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
One major component of our defenses

00:46:58.265 --> 00:47:00.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
is knowledge, see,

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we’ve just discussed:

00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:06.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing our enemy, knowing his strategy,

00:47:06.173 --> 00:47:09.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then wisely utilizing that knowledge

00:47:09.443 --> 00:47:12.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
provides a real protection for us.

00:47:12.779 --> 00:47:16.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a saying,
“To be forewarned

00:47:16.316 --> 00:47:18.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to be forearmed.”

00:47:18.852 --> 00:47:23.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, Proverbs 4:5, 6 says in part:

00:47:24.458 --> 00:47:28.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Acquire wisdom,
acquire understanding . . . ,

00:47:28.695 --> 00:47:31.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it will protect you.”

00:47:31.031 --> 00:47:34.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, additionally,
we have our spiritual armor.

00:47:34.501 --> 00:47:38.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 6:12, 13 says in part:

00:47:38.138 --> 00:47:40.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We have a struggle . . .

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:45.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“against the wicked spirit forces
in the heavenly places.

00:47:45.145 --> 00:47:47.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this reason

00:47:47.414 --> 00:47:51.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“take up
the complete suit of armor from God,

00:47:51.652 --> 00:47:54.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that you may be able to resist . . .

00:47:54.288 --> 00:47:56.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
and . . . stand firm.”

00:47:56.657 --> 00:48:00.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had some beautiful
<i>Watchtower</i>  study articles recently

00:48:00.961 --> 00:48:04.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
about each of those six pieces of that armor

00:48:04.431 --> 00:48:08.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can put on
and keep on each piece of the armor.

00:48:08.535 --> 00:48:12.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without our armor,
we are defenseless.

00:48:12.739 --> 00:48:16.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d be like a soldier
on a raging battlefield,

00:48:16.977 --> 00:48:19.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
dressed only in his underwear.

00:48:21.114 --> 00:48:23.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
How long do you think he would survive?

00:48:23.617 --> 00:48:25.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Minutes, if that long.

00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:30.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
And not only do we need the armor,
but we need every piece of the armor.

00:48:30.123 --> 00:48:35.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what Ephesians 6:13 says,
“the complete suit of armor.”

00:48:35.128 --> 00:48:39.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
One piece of armor missing could be tragic.

00:48:39.633 --> 00:48:41.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s illustrate this.

00:48:41.201 --> 00:48:45.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s say a soldier forgets
to put on his bootlike sandals.

00:48:45.872 --> 00:48:48.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
He goes out into this raging battlefield,

00:48:48.575 --> 00:48:52.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he steps on a long, sharp thorn

00:48:52.012 --> 00:48:54.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as he’s attacked by an enemy soldier.

00:48:54.848 --> 00:48:56.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is going to win?

00:48:56.216 --> 00:48:57.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s obvious.

00:48:57.351 --> 00:49:00.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need every piece of the armor.

00:49:00.020 --> 00:49:04.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, an indispensable part
of our defense system

00:49:04.491 --> 00:49:06.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:49:06.727 --> 00:49:11.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Zechariah 4:6, the thought is made:

00:49:11.264 --> 00:49:15.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Not by a military force, nor by power,

00:49:15.302 --> 00:49:20.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
but by my spirit,’
says Jehovah of armies.”

00:49:20.307 --> 00:49:23.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, we don’t fight this battle
in our own strength.

00:49:23.844 --> 00:49:26.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to have Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:30.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we have holy spirit 
and we’re empowered by it,

00:49:30.017 --> 00:49:35.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we think about it,
there is no breaking point to our integrity.

00:49:35.022 --> 00:49:37.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
You probably have heard the illustration

00:49:37.024 --> 00:49:39.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the straw that broke the camel’s back.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
And literally with a camel,

00:49:41.762 --> 00:49:44.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could keep piling
more and more weight,

00:49:44.798 --> 00:49:46.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that finally you could put so much weight

00:49:46.833 --> 00:49:48.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
(just a little more weight)
that you could break its back.

00:49:48.835 --> 00:49:51.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan could do that to us
—couldn’t he?—

00:49:51.004 --> 00:49:53.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we were on our own.

00:49:53.073 --> 00:49:56.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah knows when we’ve done our part

00:49:56.076 --> 00:49:59.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve gone as far
as our imperfect flesh will take us,

00:49:59.179 --> 00:50:04.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then he steps in
and makes up any deficit.

00:50:04.184 --> 00:50:08.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan piles more;
Jehovah makes up for the shortfall.

00:50:08.455 --> 00:50:12.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan piles more;
Jehovah makes us equal to that challenge.

00:50:12.526 --> 00:50:14.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And since Jehovah is the Almighty,

00:50:14.695 --> 00:50:19.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is literally no breaking point
to our integrity.

00:50:19.099 --> 00:50:22.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
one brother living in a banned country

00:50:22.169 --> 00:50:25.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
refused to violate his Christian neutrality,

00:50:25.772 --> 00:50:29.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he was stripped naked,
forced to lie facedown,

00:50:29.643 --> 00:50:34.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ruthlessly beaten for six hours
on his back and his legs.

00:50:34.614 --> 00:50:37.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spectators fainted
because it was so ruthless.

00:50:37.384 --> 00:50:40.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
But yet,
here’s what that brother said sometime later.

00:50:40.087 --> 00:50:42.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:
“Regardless of the amount

00:50:42.556 --> 00:50:46.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of insulting and beatings that we received,

00:50:46.860 --> 00:50:49.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a few seconds would pass

00:50:49.329 --> 00:50:51.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we would not feel anything more

00:50:51.832 --> 00:50:54.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even though the beatings continued.

00:50:54.601 --> 00:50:59.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were feeling
that Jehovah God was always with us.”

00:51:00.574 --> 00:51:04.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there we have three aspects
of our defense system.

00:51:04.444 --> 00:51:05.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are others.

00:51:05.846 --> 00:51:09.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we discussed
that we have God-given knowledge:

00:51:09.015 --> 00:51:11.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know our enemy,
we know his strategy,

00:51:11.218 --> 00:51:13.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know what we have
to defend ourselves.

00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:16.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we have our spiritual armor,

00:51:16.223 --> 00:51:18.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:51:18.925 --> 00:51:21.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do our part,

00:51:21.061 --> 00:51:25.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
unquestionably Jehovah always does his part.

00:51:25.732 --> 00:51:29.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this combination
is going to be unconquerable.

00:51:29.102 --> 00:51:34.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the battle intensifies
in our individual cases,

00:51:34.107 --> 00:51:38.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not going to have to turn
and cowardly flee.

00:51:38.345 --> 00:51:41.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be able to stand our ground.

00:51:41.114 --> 00:51:43.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll be able to bravely fight,

00:51:43.450 --> 00:51:45.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with Jehovah’s help,

00:51:45.485 --> 00:51:48.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will come off completely victorious

00:51:48.922 --> 00:51:52.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the face of Satan’s attack.

00:51:58.265 --> 00:52:00.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank you so much, Brother Lett,

00:52:00.567 --> 00:52:03.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
for that encouragement and that strength

00:52:03.203 --> 00:52:06.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “no weapon formed
against [God’s people]

00:52:06.373 --> 00:52:08.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have any success.”

00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:14.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a good opportunity
to remember the 129

00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:17.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our dear brothers and sisters
around the world

00:52:17.284 --> 00:52:20.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are presently in prison
because of their faith.

00:52:20.921 --> 00:52:24.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what Hebrews 13:3 says?

00:52:24.825 --> 00:52:27.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep in mind those in prison,

00:52:27.994 --> 00:52:31.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as though you were imprisoned with them,

00:52:31.431 --> 00:52:33.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those being mistreated,

00:52:33.767 --> 00:52:37.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
since you yourselves also are in the body.”

00:52:37.571 --> 00:52:39.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
We certainly love and respect

00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:42.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers in Russia
and in many other lands

00:52:42.876 --> 00:52:45.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are facing cruel persecution.

00:52:46.713 --> 00:52:48.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we still have two members

00:52:48.715 --> 00:52:51.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Governing Body
that we want to hear from.

00:52:51.218 --> 00:52:55.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before we do,
we would like to give you an update

00:52:55.055 --> 00:52:57.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the project that Audio/Video Services

00:52:57.824 --> 00:53:01.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
is spearheading at the Australasia branch.

00:53:01.361 --> 00:53:05.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll recall that it was announced
at last year’s annual meeting.

00:53:05.232 --> 00:53:07.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what has been happening

00:53:07.234 --> 00:53:09.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this video project
in this intervening time?

00:53:09.903 --> 00:53:12.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention.

00:53:14.207 --> 00:53:16.543 line:10% position:50% align:center
At the 2020 annual meeting,

00:53:16.543 --> 00:53:19.546 line:10% position:50% align:center
we announced an exciting new video project,

00:53:19.546 --> 00:53:22.349 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

00:53:22.349 --> 00:53:26.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Anthony Morris made
the following encouraging statement.

00:53:27.187 --> 00:53:29.189 line:10% position:50% align:center
Will there be challenges?

00:53:29.189 --> 00:53:31.224 line:10% position:50% align:center
Oh yeah, guaranteed.

00:53:31.224 --> 00:53:33.526 line:10% position:50% align:center
But if Jehovah wants something done,

00:53:33.526 --> 00:53:35.528 line:10% position:50% align:center
that’s what happens.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:40.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
How true those words have proven to be!

00:53:40.166 --> 00:53:43.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
To date,
the largest feature drama

00:53:43.303 --> 00:53:45.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Audio/Video Services had produced

00:53:45.605 --> 00:53:49.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a little over 100 minutes in length. 

00:53:49.542 --> 00:53:54.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>
spans nearly 1,000 minutes of content!

00:53:55.749 --> 00:53:59.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy to update you
on this exciting project

00:53:59.786 --> 00:54:04.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and share different ways Jehovah
has helped us to overcome various challenges.

00:54:06.459 --> 00:54:11.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters already serving
at the Australasia branch were key

00:54:11.298 --> 00:54:14.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
to helping us get the facilities ready.

00:54:14.601 --> 00:54:19.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they handle this special assignment,
especially during the pandemic?

00:54:21.241 --> 00:54:23.076 line:10% position:50% align:center
We were all very excited,

00:54:23.076 --> 00:54:24.678 line:10% position:50% align:center
but as the scope

00:54:24.678 --> 00:54:26.313 line:10% position:50% align:center
of this project became clear,

00:54:26.313 --> 00:54:28.448 line:10% position:50% align:center
there were times when we wondered how

00:54:28.448 --> 00:54:31.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
our small publisher base
of around 68,000

00:54:31.284 --> 00:54:34.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be able to fully support
this large undertaking.

00:54:34.621 --> 00:54:36.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re a small department,

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:38.792 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it’s a small branch that we’re at.

00:54:38.792 --> 00:54:40.260 line:10% position:50% align:center
And all of a sudden,

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:42.262 line:10% position:50% align:center
we had this project highlighted

00:54:42.262 --> 00:54:44.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was three times our normal workload.

00:54:44.497 --> 00:54:49.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right after we received approval
for the project, the branch territory

00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:53.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced terrible bushfires
raging right throughout the country.

00:54:54.274 --> 00:54:56.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Straight after this were floods.

00:54:56.276 --> 00:54:59.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, many of our brothers
experienced double disasters.

00:54:59.779 --> 00:55:02.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we then started to recover from this

00:55:02.315 --> 00:55:04.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build momentum to start the project,

00:55:04.584 --> 00:55:06.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
the COVID-19 pandemic began.

00:55:09.789 --> 00:55:11.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of the deliveries
of construction materials

00:55:11.858 --> 00:55:13.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
coming into the branch
had to be quarantined

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:17.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
(all of the bulk supplies
that the Construction Department was using).

00:55:17.163 --> 00:55:19.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so that meant there was a time period

00:55:19.232 --> 00:55:21.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those things to be unavailable for use.

00:55:21.668 --> 00:55:23.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the logistics 

00:55:23.303 --> 00:55:25.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
of (once all those bulk supplies
came out of quarantine)

00:55:25.739 --> 00:55:27.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
then moving them to where they’re needed
on the site 

00:55:27.974 --> 00:55:30.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
when new deliveries
are coming in and managing

00:55:30.510 --> 00:55:32.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
that safely
with the COVID-19 risks

00:55:32.312 --> 00:55:36.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the risks of interaction
with the delivery drivers and the contractors

00:55:36.249 --> 00:55:40.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it was complicated
and very time-consuming for all involved.

00:55:40.086 --> 00:55:43.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
We needed help from our brothers 
and sisters outside of Bethel.

00:55:43.757 --> 00:55:46.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we put the call out,
and they came from all over

00:55:46.459 --> 00:55:48.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch territory to help.

00:55:48.561 --> 00:55:52.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of them traveled days on rough
and rugged roads

00:55:52.132 --> 00:55:53.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come and help us.

00:55:53.566 --> 00:55:55.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they arrived,

00:55:55.001 --> 00:55:57.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
they spent a time in quarantine,
and then they were able to come

00:55:57.937 --> 00:56:01.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help us safely on-site.

00:56:01.074 --> 00:56:02.108 line:10% position:50% align:center
There were specific items

00:56:02.108 --> 00:56:03.576 line:10% position:50% align:center
needed for the project.

00:56:03.576 --> 00:56:05.245 line:10% position:50% align:center
So we asked the brothers and sisters

00:56:05.245 --> 00:56:07.080 line:10% position:50% align:center
to help to see where or how

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could obtain them.

00:56:08.948 --> 00:56:12.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so heartwarming
to see all the responses flooding in.

00:56:12.519 --> 00:56:15.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within a short amount of time,
we had received offers

00:56:15.688 --> 00:56:19.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
for donations or loans 
for much of the heavy machinery

00:56:19.592 --> 00:56:21.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
or large equipment we needed

00:56:21.594 --> 00:56:24.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even things like plants for landscaping.

00:56:25.532 --> 00:56:27.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we brought in a number
of temporary workers,

00:56:27.367 --> 00:56:30.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a number of remote workers
as well were added to the team.

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:33.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Branch Committee
made available a large car parking area

00:56:33.706 --> 00:56:35.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could
quarantine off all of the deliveries

00:56:35.909 --> 00:56:39.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
and handle those things safely
and in line with the guidelines.

00:56:39.112 --> 00:56:40.814 line:10% position:50% align:center
So at the beginning of the project,

00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:43.216 line:10% position:50% align:center
the number was about 200 people

00:56:43.216 --> 00:56:44.751 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the family,

00:56:44.751 --> 00:56:47.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that quickly grew to around 500.

00:56:47.954 --> 00:56:52.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while we have a beautiful kitchen
here to serve food from,

00:56:52.725 --> 00:56:56.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
it wasn’t really designed
for 500 meals each day.

00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:58.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Branch Committee

00:56:58.465 --> 00:57:00.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as our various departments,

00:57:00.467 --> 00:57:02.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
although they had
a heavy workload themselves,

00:57:02.969 --> 00:57:05.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to extend a helping hand.

00:57:05.105 --> 00:57:07.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where we lost commuters,

00:57:07.907 --> 00:57:11.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
we gained some workers
from various departments

00:57:11.711 --> 00:57:16.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
who helped us in various tasks
within Food Service.

00:57:16.483 --> 00:57:20.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was clear to everybody
in the department and at the branch

00:57:20.086 --> 00:57:22.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it really needed to be a team effort,

00:57:22.755 --> 00:57:25.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everybody went above and beyond
to make this work.

00:57:25.959 --> 00:57:28.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that only takes you so far.

00:57:28.128 --> 00:57:30.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s blessing on the arrangements,

00:57:30.630 --> 00:57:32.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
the qualities that he helps us to show,

00:57:32.932 --> 00:57:34.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
the motivation that he helps us to have

00:57:34.934 --> 00:57:39.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
to overcome those challenges
and to take on things that really

00:57:39.439 --> 00:57:42.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
are beyond what we can normally cope with

00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:44.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
—seeing that particularly
as we look back on a number

00:57:44.911 --> 00:57:47.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those challenges
and how they’ve been overcome—

00:57:47.147 --> 00:57:49.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see Jehovah’s involvement day to day.

00:57:49.749 --> 00:57:53.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother had a trailer 
that was going to be donated to the project,

00:57:53.353 --> 00:57:57.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he didn’t have the funds
to pay for the freight.

00:57:57.357 --> 00:58:00.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the very same time,
a sister contacted the branch

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:03.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wanted to donate specifically
to the project.

00:58:03.997 --> 00:58:06.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
The amount she donated
was the amount that was needed

00:58:06.666 --> 00:58:09.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cover the freight
to bring the trailer to Bethel.

00:58:09.569 --> 00:58:13.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother made a 30-hour
round-trip to deliver

00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:16.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
a large quantity of goods
he manufactured for us.

00:58:16.509 --> 00:58:20.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made this trip, not once or twice,
but multiple times,

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:24.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
even planning the work 
around two surgeries he had to have.

00:58:24.851 --> 00:58:28.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
A number of trucks were required
to freight the goods,

00:58:28.321 --> 00:58:30.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
so members of his family and congregation

00:58:30.890 --> 00:58:35.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
shared in the driving
while local brothers extended hospitality.

00:58:35.128 --> 00:58:37.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m very impressed

00:58:37.397 --> 00:58:40.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the level of appreciation

00:58:40.166 --> 00:58:43.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sense of gratitude
that permeates the family.

00:58:43.736 --> 00:58:46.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
And seeing that is

00:58:46.272 --> 00:58:50.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
a real boost for us and a real blessing.

00:58:50.109 --> 00:58:54.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel very appreciative for everyone
who’s been able to help on this project,

00:58:54.614 --> 00:58:56.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we recognize the personal

00:58:56.616 --> 00:58:59.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
and collective sacrifices
that have been made.

00:58:59.519 --> 00:59:02.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those who have been able
to come in and help us on the project

00:59:02.755 --> 00:59:06.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
tell us how thankful they are
to have had a share in the project.

00:59:06.626 --> 00:59:10.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only Jehovah can create
a situation like this.

00:59:11.898 --> 00:59:16.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah always finds a way
to help us do his will,

00:59:16.536 --> 00:59:21.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
often providing solutions
we never thought possible.

00:59:21.541 --> 00:59:25.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to preparing
the Australasia facility for the project,

00:59:25.912 --> 00:59:27.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
much work has been done

00:59:27.914 --> 00:59:32.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
with script development, casting,
and location scouting.

00:59:32.919 --> 00:59:34.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
How has this progressed?

00:59:36.322 --> 00:59:38.324 line:10% position:50% align:center
We recognized that there

00:59:38.324 --> 00:59:42.228 line:10% position:50% align:center
would be many needed adjustments

00:59:42.228 --> 00:59:43.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
to the branch there

00:59:43.563 --> 00:59:46.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
as far as facilities are concerned.

00:59:46.099 --> 00:59:48.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
We knew that there would be the need

00:59:48.301 --> 00:59:50.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
for many volunteers to be involved

00:59:50.803 --> 00:59:54.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the project,
and we knew it was going to be

00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
coordinated from halfway around the world.

00:59:58.244 --> 00:59:59.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
The challenge with finding locations

00:59:59.946 --> 01:00:01.447 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the Gospel accounts

01:00:01.447 --> 01:00:04.083 line:10% position:50% align:center
is that they need to look like ancient lands

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:06.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
but be placed in a modern world.

01:00:06.953 --> 01:00:10.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
They need to have no signs of civilization

01:00:10.356 --> 01:00:14.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet be close enough to civilization
to support our modern filming operations.

01:00:16.262 --> 01:00:19.465 line:10% position:50% align:center
You’re asked to flesh out an entire world,

01:00:19.465 --> 01:00:21.334 line:10% position:50% align:center
a culture,

01:00:21.334 --> 01:00:23.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hundreds or,
actually, thousands

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
of characters that appear in these accounts

01:00:26.606 --> 01:00:28.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to do so with very limited information

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually in the Bible.

01:00:30.476 --> 01:00:33.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we add enough details
to connect with the audience

01:00:33.746 --> 01:00:37.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
but do so without overstepping
by introducing teachings

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:42.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ideas that contradict
the Bible’s message?

01:00:42.355 --> 01:00:46.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can truly say it was a worldwide effort
on the part of our brothers and sisters.

01:00:46.926 --> 01:00:49.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was especially encouraging

01:00:49.796 --> 01:00:51.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how young ones

01:00:51.798 --> 01:00:53.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
responded to this need.

01:00:53.466 --> 01:00:55.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were looking to extend themselves

01:00:55.468 --> 01:00:57.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their service to Jehovah,
and they were willing

01:00:57.704 --> 01:00:59.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
to adjust their secular jobs.

01:00:59.706 --> 01:01:01.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were willing to move

01:01:01.641 --> 01:01:04.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
to other locations in order to be able

01:01:04.010 --> 01:01:06.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support this project.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.981 line:10% position:50% align:center
We were looking at how we could

01:01:08.981 --> 01:01:11.784 line:10% position:50% align:center
accomplish so many auditions

01:01:11.784 --> 01:01:13.786 line:10% position:50% align:center
in a shorter period of time.

01:01:13.786 --> 01:01:17.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we came up with the idea
of a self-guided audition

01:01:17.323 --> 01:01:20.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we put a package together

01:01:20.159 --> 01:01:22.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
identifying how the audition needs

01:01:22.895 --> 01:01:27.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be accomplished and we send it
to the publisher that’s being auditioned,

01:01:27.433 --> 01:01:29.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they record their own audition

01:01:29.836 --> 01:01:31.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and send it back to us for processing.

01:01:33.873 --> 01:01:36.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we were at some of the locations,
we actually did test filming.

01:01:36.175 --> 01:01:40.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
We put actors in wardrobe in front
of the camera and re-created certain scenes

01:01:40.713 --> 01:01:44.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how this location
could be used for our project.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:48.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to travel to more than
a dozen locations during a month,

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:52.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everyone returned happy and healthy.

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.026 line:10% position:50% align:center
There are some accounts in the Gospels

01:01:54.026 --> 01:01:55.928 line:10% position:50% align:center
that reference large groups,

01:01:55.928 --> 01:01:57.597 line:10% position:50% align:center
such as the Sermon on the Mount

01:01:57.597 --> 01:01:59.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when Jesus preached from the boat.

01:01:59.332 --> 01:02:01.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would we show that many people?

01:02:01.801 --> 01:02:04.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
The team took time to test various methods,

01:02:04.971 --> 01:02:09.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
including some computer graphics
as well as different styles

01:02:09.308 --> 01:02:12.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
and methods to be used
to duplicate people

01:02:12.378 --> 01:02:14.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
for these large crowds.

01:02:14.981 --> 01:02:17.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
The production team was able to see

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:21.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did and did not work,
and this is very beneficial because it helps

01:02:21.554 --> 01:02:25.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
us to plan appropriately
for the actual production day.

01:02:26.325 --> 01:02:28.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it’s simply a matter
of going and doing

01:02:28.694 --> 01:02:30.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
as much research as possible
to find out what is known.

01:02:30.797 --> 01:02:33.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
there’s an entire team

01:02:33.866 --> 01:02:35.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
devoted to doing research
for our publications.

01:02:35.868 --> 01:02:38.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have access
to those brothers and sisters.

01:02:38.337 --> 01:02:41.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that has been
incredibly valuable for every screenwriter

01:02:41.741 --> 01:02:44.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
on this project is to see

01:02:44.243 --> 01:02:48.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
members of the Teaching Committee
sit at every table read for each script

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:50.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then proceed to give us direction,

01:02:50.349 --> 01:02:53.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask questions, give us direction

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:57.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
on what to go and research further,
what to remove, and (in many cases)

01:02:57.390 --> 01:02:58.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
what to add.

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:00.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shows how deeply they’re

01:03:00.359 --> 01:03:02.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
invested in the story of Jesus’ life.

01:03:03.496 --> 01:03:06.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
It felt like Jehovah
had taken us and placed us

01:03:06.098 --> 01:03:08.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a land thousands of years ago.

01:03:10.436 --> 01:03:14.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we got to these various locations,
we literally would

01:03:14.006 --> 01:03:16.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
jump out of the vehicles
and run across the landscape

01:03:16.008 --> 01:03:18.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
in excitement for how
we could potentially use them.

01:03:19.612 --> 01:03:23.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the biggest challenges we had
was getting everyone back into the vehicles

01:03:23.316 --> 01:03:26.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we could go on to the next location.

01:03:26.452 --> 01:03:29.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
We went to one property,
and when we talked with the brother,

01:03:29.622 --> 01:03:32.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said: “This isn’t my property.

01:03:32.425 --> 01:03:34.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This belongs to Jehovah.

01:03:34.427 --> 01:03:37.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m holding onto it (I’m not sure why),

01:03:37.563 --> 01:03:40.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
hoping that perhaps Jehovah
can use it in some way.”

01:03:40.766 --> 01:03:44.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you think 
about all of our brothers and sisters

01:03:44.504 --> 01:03:47.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
coming together to support this initiative,

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:50.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
it really has been a blessing
to be able to witness that.

01:03:50.409 --> 01:03:52.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really reminds me of what is said

01:03:52.545 --> 01:03:56.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 133:1,
where it said it would be “good”

01:03:56.415 --> 01:03:59.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see brothers and sisters
‘dwelling together in unity.’

01:03:59.318 --> 01:04:01.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ve seen that goodness.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:05.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve seen our brotherhood really
rally around supporting this project

01:04:05.992 --> 01:04:07.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
in so many ways.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it has contributed toward

01:04:09.695 --> 01:04:12.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
a spirit that has allowed Jehovah
to bless the work.

01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to see how the design
and construction aspects

01:04:17.937 --> 01:04:21.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the work are progressing,
including the historical sets?

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:25.111 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, one of the biggest challenges we’ve had

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:27.113 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the Design/Construction world

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:29.549 line:10% position:50% align:center
is to get the mentality

01:04:29.549 --> 01:04:32.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’re designing
and building something

01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:34.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
that needs to look 2,000 years old.

01:04:36.656 --> 01:04:38.224 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, we’re used to building modern buildings,

01:04:38.224 --> 01:04:39.625 line:10% position:50% align:center
and we’re used to using the materials

01:04:39.625 --> 01:04:40.793 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we have today,

01:04:40.793 --> 01:04:42.028 line:10% position:50% align:center
but to now use those

01:04:42.028 --> 01:04:43.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide something that was ancient,

01:04:43.863 --> 01:04:45.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was going
to be quite the challenge.

01:04:47.366 --> 01:04:48.167 line:10% position:50% align:center
In Jesus’ ministry,

01:04:48.167 --> 01:04:50.202 line:10% position:50% align:center
he went to numerous different towns,

01:04:50.202 --> 01:04:51.437 line:10% position:50% align:center
and those towns

01:04:51.437 --> 01:04:52.805 line:10% position:50% align:center
would have had different looks

01:04:52.805 --> 01:04:54.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the natural products

01:04:54.574 --> 01:04:58.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were available to the tradesmen then
to build those buildings.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.715 line:10% position:50% align:center
Back in ancient Israel,

01:05:02.715 --> 01:05:04.917 line:10% position:50% align:center
the building materials would have been stone,

01:05:04.917 --> 01:05:07.486 line:10% position:50% align:center
so they would have used limestone, basalt,

01:05:07.486 --> 01:05:09.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
field stones,
and even clay bricks.

01:05:09.956 --> 01:05:11.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s probably

01:05:11.824 --> 01:05:15.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
just over 100 doors and gates out there.

01:05:15.561 --> 01:05:18.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are also over 200 windows,

01:05:18.097 --> 01:05:20.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve got shutters,
and all of these need

01:05:20.666 --> 01:05:23.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
either timber lintels or timber sills.

01:05:24.236 --> 01:05:27.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have tradesmen
who are used to getting things,

01:05:27.306 --> 01:05:29.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could say, nearly perfect.

01:05:29.408 --> 01:05:33.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Normally as a renderer, or a plasterer,
you would cover up cracks,

01:05:33.713 --> 01:05:36.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here we’re having
to actually create these.

01:05:36.549 --> 01:05:38.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can be quite a challenge.

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:42.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back a few years ago,
there were various branches

01:05:42.488 --> 01:05:46.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were put forward as possibilities,
as options.

01:05:46.392 --> 01:05:49.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the end,
the Australasia branch was chosen.

01:05:49.695 --> 01:05:52.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time
in the Design/Construction world,

01:05:52.565 --> 01:05:55.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
we thought,
‘Well, that was an interesting choice.’

01:05:55.635 --> 01:06:00.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
But during 2020, during the pandemic,
we found out in retrospect

01:06:00.506 --> 01:06:03.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was one
of the only places on earth

01:06:03.142 --> 01:06:05.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
where this project could be completed now.

01:06:05.144 --> 01:06:09.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the low incidence
of COVID in the country,

01:06:09.181 --> 01:06:11.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were able to use outside contractors

01:06:11.784 --> 01:06:15.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come in to the project
to do part of the site work for us.

01:06:15.621 --> 01:06:19.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s been a blessing to have
the project take place

01:06:19.458 --> 01:06:21.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
at this location.

01:06:21.927 --> 01:06:24.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those that we had on-site here
already were very

01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:28.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
open-minded,
and they had a lot of creative thinking

01:06:28.601 --> 01:06:31.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it came to building historical

01:06:31.103 --> 01:06:34.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
sets now with modern materials.

01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:39.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have about 7,000 square meters
of render to accomplish,

01:06:39.578 --> 01:06:43.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll have two teams working full-time

01:06:43.649 --> 01:06:46.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
for several months to accomplish this.

01:06:51.824 --> 01:06:55.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this particular type of work,
nobody’s trade really counted;

01:06:55.661 --> 01:06:57.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
everybody had to try.

01:06:57.663 --> 01:06:59.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many of our sisters, in fact,

01:06:59.665 --> 01:07:01.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
were the ones that had the skills
that were needed to create

01:07:01.901 --> 01:07:05.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
the historical effect that was required.

01:07:07.940 --> 01:07:11.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
To achieve the weathering
that would happen on the stone

01:07:11.310 --> 01:07:14.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it sat there for hundreds of years
out in the weather—

01:07:14.447 --> 01:07:18.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
The water would get into the stone
and slowly break it down.

01:07:18.818 --> 01:07:20.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then there are going to be areas

01:07:20.853 --> 01:07:23.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the stone that are softer,
so they’ll wear away quicker.

01:07:23.889 --> 01:07:26.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
So then that’s done with the wire brush.

01:07:27.693 --> 01:07:30.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then some spots with the acetone,

01:07:30.229 --> 01:07:32.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
it puts little divots into the stone,

01:07:32.932 --> 01:07:36.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
which occur naturally in limestone.

01:07:36.368 --> 01:07:38.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once the project is completed in the backlot,

01:07:38.904 --> 01:07:40.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers and sisters will have applied 

01:07:40.906 --> 01:07:45.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
up to four and a half thousand square meters
of stone finish to the buildings.

01:07:50.950 --> 01:07:53.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been amazing to see how

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:57.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a variety of backgrounds (despite this),

01:07:57.223 --> 01:08:00.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ve been able to achieve
quite amazing things

01:08:01.527 --> 01:08:05.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
with just their willing spirit,
prepared to take

01:08:05.231 --> 01:08:06.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
on board the instruction.

01:08:06.932 --> 01:08:10.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can see Jehovah’s blessing behind it.

01:08:10.035 --> 01:08:14.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the temple area, in the backlot,
there are a little over 4,000 square meters

01:08:14.373 --> 01:08:18.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
of concrete that has been made
to look like stone.

01:08:18.511 --> 01:08:22.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one of the contractors who quoted
on the job was actually a brother.

01:08:22.181 --> 01:08:25.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that particular brother said:
“Well, you know what?

01:08:25.084 --> 01:08:26.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can volunteer to do this.

01:08:26.418 --> 01:08:29.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And there are enough brothers around
that we can bring together,

01:08:29.255 --> 01:08:33.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we would be more than happy
to be able to do it on a volunteer basis.”

01:08:33.259 --> 01:08:35.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
So an isolated area was set up

01:08:35.828 --> 01:08:39.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
where these brothers
could test and sample and produce

01:08:39.331 --> 01:08:42.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
the concrete that was needed
for the floor finish of the temple.

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:45.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for over 27 days of straight pours,

01:08:45.538 --> 01:08:48.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had approximately 30 brothers and sisters

01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:50.810 line:10% position:50% align:center
each day come in and work tirelessly

01:08:50.810 --> 01:08:51.977 line:10% position:50% align:center
to be able to accomplish

01:08:51.977 --> 01:08:53.979 line:10% position:50% align:center
this temple floor for us.

01:08:55.548 --> 01:08:57.850 line:10% position:50% align:center
The last day of the concrete pour,

01:08:57.850 --> 01:09:00.553 line:10% position:50% align:center
we wanted to surprise the brothers,

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:03.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
because someone had made
a sign saying: “United in spirit.”

01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:07.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
But actually,
the construction Bethelites surprised us.

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:11.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
They all had balloons and signs,
and it spelled out “Thank you.”

01:09:11.530 --> 01:09:14.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think that just reflected
how we love each other

01:09:14.633 --> 01:09:16.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we’d give our life for each other

01:09:16.936 --> 01:09:20.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we both serve the same God
and we love Jehovah.

01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:24.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through lots of sleepless nights
and a bit of prayer about it,

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:28.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
we ended up finding a brother
who owned a sawmill and had property

01:09:28.480 --> 01:09:32.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
with trees on it,
and he willingly chopped down the trees

01:09:32.351 --> 01:09:34.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
on his property
and provided them for us

01:09:34.553 --> 01:09:37.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
—delivered them to site
and actually donated them to us.

01:09:37.756 --> 01:09:39.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they were exactly what we needed.

01:09:40.993 --> 01:09:44.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also had specific prayers
at certain times about certain matters,

01:09:44.730 --> 01:09:47.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then 30 minutes later,
we’d receive answers.

01:09:47.566 --> 01:09:49.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
That definitely also is no coincidence.

01:09:49.668 --> 01:09:54.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then obviously getting
the right approvals just at the right time

01:09:54.206 --> 01:09:57.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite objections—we know
that there’s no one else other than

01:09:57.509 --> 01:09:59.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah that could have a hand in that.

01:09:59.879 --> 01:10:04.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s obvious that Satan has put
everything he can in front of us,

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:08.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah has provided every time
at the right time.

01:10:08.254 --> 01:10:11.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s no coincidence that his hand
has been on this,

01:10:11.657 --> 01:10:16.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there is no doubt that he
wants people to know about his Son, Jesus.

01:10:16.095 --> 01:10:19.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing the collaboration in our
monthly meetings

01:10:19.531 --> 01:10:21.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the entire team where we have

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:25.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
the World Headquarters Legal Department,
the World Headquarters Computer Department,

01:10:25.037 --> 01:10:28.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the Purchasing Department,
we have Design/Construction,

01:10:28.007 --> 01:10:31.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have the Regional Video Teams,
we have Audio/Video Services

01:10:31.710 --> 01:10:35.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of these groups
along with the branch in Australasia—

01:10:35.748 --> 01:10:39.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
working together for a common goal
as a team

01:10:40.786 --> 01:10:43.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been amazing
and a very faith-strengthening experience.

01:10:45.391 --> 01:10:48.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were happy to share this update with you.

01:10:48.761 --> 01:10:51.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you might still be wondering:

01:10:51.263 --> 01:10:56.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How are actors being prepared to reach
our hearts through their performance?

01:10:57.069 --> 01:11:01.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How will the tone and filming style
be selected to represent

01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:03.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gospel accounts?’

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:06.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe the biggest question you have is,

01:11:06.111 --> 01:11:09.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will cameras start rolling?

01:11:09.248 --> 01:11:12.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay tuned for a future update.

01:11:13.585 --> 01:11:16.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the powerful impact

01:11:16.322 --> 01:11:19.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
this video series will have on people!

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:23.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will help you and me
follow Jesus’ footsteps closely.

01:11:23.929 --> 01:11:27.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will help us draw closer to Jehovah,

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:30.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom Jesus
perfectly imitated as a human.

01:11:30.803 --> 01:11:33.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the benefits go far beyond you and me.

01:11:34.773 --> 01:11:37.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
As stated in the 2020 annual meeting,

01:11:37.776 --> 01:11:42.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is likely that this series will be used
to touch the hearts and minds

01:11:42.448 --> 01:11:47.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
of billions of resurrected ones
in the coming new world.

01:11:47.453 --> 01:11:51.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think how
this video series could help them

01:11:51.957 --> 01:11:55.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
learn about the example that Jesus set.

01:11:55.394 --> 01:12:00.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine how the visual portrayal
of his warm, humble,

01:12:00.132 --> 01:12:02.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
and approachable personality

01:12:02.201 --> 01:12:06.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help them
to come to know Jehovah intimately.

01:12:06.972 --> 01:12:11.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
How exactly will we use this new series
to teach resurrected ones?

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:16.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will have to wait and see
what Jehovah directs.

01:12:16.015 --> 01:12:20.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are confident Jehovah
is blessing this work.

01:12:20.586 --> 01:12:24.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will continue 
to look to Jehovah for direction

01:12:24.089 --> 01:12:28.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we move ahead
with <i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

01:12:42.508 --> 01:12:44.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as you likely noticed,

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:47.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
when this video production
was first starting,

01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Australia was one of the countries

01:12:50.082 --> 01:12:52.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
that had the least impact from the pandemic.

01:12:52.985 --> 01:12:55.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so that allowed this large project

01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:57.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
to move ahead and gain momentum.

01:12:57.823 --> 01:13:00.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though later the pandemic

01:13:00.159 --> 01:13:03.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
affected Australia much more seriously,

01:13:03.362 --> 01:13:06.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of the preparations were underway.

01:13:06.865 --> 01:13:10.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
We truly thank Jehovah
for the tremendous progress

01:13:10.969 --> 01:13:13.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
that has been made on this project so far.

01:13:15.207 --> 01:13:17.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we have another treat.

01:13:17.976 --> 01:13:21.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to hear
from another member of the Governing Body,

01:13:21.013 --> 01:13:23.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Samuel Herd.

01:13:23.015 --> 01:13:26.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
His theme is actually a quote from the Bible.

01:13:26.718 --> 01:13:28.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

01:13:28.454 --> 01:13:33.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title is
“I Will Never Abandon You.”

01:13:36.061 --> 01:13:39.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
I spoke to Jehovah
just before I stepped out here.

01:13:39.698 --> 01:13:41.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I asked him:

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:45.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please don’t abandon me.

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:50.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I’ve ever needed you, I need you now.”

01:13:50.909 --> 01:13:51.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

01:13:51.743 --> 01:13:55.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s because of all
of these beautiful sheep

01:13:55.247 --> 01:14:00.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I have the privilege
to speak to for 19 minutes.

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:04.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I want to make
the most of these 19 minutes,

01:14:04.089 --> 01:14:07.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
because sometimes
we have to make adjustments.

01:14:07.659 --> 01:14:10.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you may have heard of a few adjustments

01:14:10.295 --> 01:14:14.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our understanding of things already today.

01:14:14.433 --> 01:14:16.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there could be more adjustments

01:14:16.768 --> 01:14:19.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will have to be made later on.

01:14:21.039 --> 01:14:23.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you may recall that we

01:14:23.909 --> 01:14:28.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
used to think a certain way
some ten years ago

01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:31.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the following matter.

01:14:31.016 --> 01:14:33.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
We felt that some of the anointed

01:14:33.785 --> 01:14:37.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
would survive Armageddon

01:14:37.122 --> 01:14:39.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
and move right on into the Paradise

01:14:39.992 --> 01:14:42.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the other sheep

01:14:42.094 --> 01:14:46.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe stay there for a given time

01:14:46.298 --> 01:14:50.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then be brought to life in heaven.

01:14:51.503 --> 01:14:55.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we understand it,

01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:58.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
some things Jehovah
will not permit us to see,

01:14:58.877 --> 01:15:03.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we read over it many, many times.

01:15:03.248 --> 01:15:06.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t see it until Jehovah

01:15:06.785 --> 01:15:09.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
puts the light on it.

01:15:09.288 --> 01:15:13.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what I’m about to reveal to you today,

01:15:13.458 --> 01:15:16.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is behind it

01:15:16.094 --> 01:15:18.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not the Governing Body,

01:15:18.130 --> 01:15:22.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
not any human here on the earth,
but Jehovah God.

01:15:22.301 --> 01:15:24.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helps us to see things.

01:15:24.770 --> 01:15:27.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, you may recall

01:15:27.239 --> 01:15:29.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew chapter 24

01:15:29.741 --> 01:15:32.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 29-31.

01:15:32.678 --> 01:15:36.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve read it many times; I have too.

01:15:36.281 --> 01:15:39.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what it says,

01:15:39.585 --> 01:15:42.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though we felt
a little differently

01:15:42.588 --> 01:15:46.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
earlier on when we read it

01:15:46.592 --> 01:15:48.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
—verse 29:

01:15:48.594 --> 01:15:53.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Immediately after the tribulation
of those days

01:15:53.599 --> 01:15:55.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now remember this,

01:15:55.701 --> 01:15:59.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“immediately
after the tribulation of those days],

01:15:59.938 --> 01:16:03.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the sun will be darkened,
and the moon will not give its light,

01:16:03.575 --> 01:16:06.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the stars will fall from heaven,

01:16:06.211 --> 01:16:09.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the powers
of the heavens will be shaken.

01:16:09.915 --> 01:16:14.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then the sign of the Son of man
will appear in heaven,

01:16:14.519 --> 01:16:18.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all the tribes of the earth

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:20.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will beat themselves in grief,

01:16:20.926 --> 01:16:25.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will see the Son of man
coming on the clouds of heaven

01:16:25.497 --> 01:16:30.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with power and great glory.

01:16:30.135 --> 01:16:32.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he will send out his angels

01:16:32.904 --> 01:16:36.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with a great trumpet sound,

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:38.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[now note the following]

01:16:38.043 --> 01:16:41.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will gather his chosen ones

01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:44.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“together from the four winds,

01:16:44.449 --> 01:16:48.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from one extremity of the heavens

01:16:48.453 --> 01:16:52.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the other extremity.”

01:16:52.391 --> 01:16:55.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, do you see the point?

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understand now

01:16:57.996 --> 01:17:01.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of Christ’s anointed brothers

01:17:01.133 --> 01:17:04.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be in heaven with him

01:17:04.303 --> 01:17:08.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
before Armageddon starts.

01:17:08.473 --> 01:17:12.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the understanding that we have today.

01:17:12.411 --> 01:17:14.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is exciting!

01:17:14.546 --> 01:17:18.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think so because of a few reasons,

01:17:18.317 --> 01:17:20.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here are a few.

01:17:20.686 --> 01:17:23.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few of the other sheep

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:27.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
have expressed a concern on this subject.

01:17:27.526 --> 01:17:30.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have said: “Does this

01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:32.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“new understanding mean

01:17:32.764 --> 01:17:37.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we will lose
all the anointed Christians,

01:17:37.436 --> 01:17:40.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
“including the Governing Body

01:17:40.605 --> 01:17:43.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just when we need them

01:17:43.809 --> 01:17:46.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the most?

01:17:46.211 --> 01:17:49.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Will we feel abandoned

01:17:49.281 --> 01:17:51.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our time of need?”

01:17:51.983 --> 01:17:54.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let me reassure you

01:17:54.453 --> 01:17:57.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you will not be abandoned.

01:17:57.823 --> 01:18:01.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what this talk is all about.

01:18:01.360 --> 01:18:05.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need not think that you will be abandoned

01:18:05.764 --> 01:18:08.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the anointed

01:18:08.033 --> 01:18:11.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
not being in your midst any longer.

01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:14.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re going to discuss three questions.

01:18:14.806 --> 01:18:18.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here they are
if you’re writing things down.

01:18:18.276 --> 01:18:20.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number one:

01:18:20.412 --> 01:18:22.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will not happen

01:18:22.414 --> 01:18:26.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the last of the anointed
leaves the earthly scene?

01:18:27.986 --> 01:18:31.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
And number two:

01:18:31.323 --> 01:18:33.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know

01:18:33.558 --> 01:18:37.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
that such things will not happen?

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:39.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen?

01:18:39.731 --> 01:18:42.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re going to look at these questions.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:44.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, then, what will not happen?

01:18:44.469 --> 01:18:48.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’d like to tell you very briefly

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:51.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
two sad stories

01:18:51.576 --> 01:18:55.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
to illustrate what will not happen.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:59.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now here is sad story number one:

01:18:59.017 --> 01:19:01.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember Jehoiada?

01:19:02.387 --> 01:19:05.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a faithful high priest,
one of the best.

01:19:05.857 --> 01:19:10.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he died, he was given an unusual honor.

01:19:10.228 --> 01:19:12.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was buried with the kings.

01:19:14.132 --> 01:19:18.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his life,
he protected the young King Jehoash

01:19:18.470 --> 01:19:21.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped him to be a good king

01:19:21.306 --> 01:19:24.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
who stayed faithful to Jehovah.

01:19:24.142 --> 01:19:29.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when old Jehoiada died,

01:19:29.147 --> 01:19:32.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
the young king soon went bad.

01:19:32.784 --> 01:19:35.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
He listened to wicked princes,

01:19:35.220 --> 01:19:39.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he turned away from Jehovah.

01:19:39.991 --> 01:19:42.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s sad story number one.

01:19:43.962 --> 01:19:47.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
On its heels, we have sad story number two:

01:19:49.434 --> 01:19:53.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
You remember
that the apostle John took great joy

01:19:53.138 --> 01:19:55.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his spiritual children.

01:19:55.807 --> 01:19:58.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a good influence on them.

01:19:58.276 --> 01:20:02.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped many Christians to remain faithful.

01:20:02.314 --> 01:20:06.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what happened when John died?

01:20:06.051 --> 01:20:08.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he was

01:20:08.253 --> 01:20:11.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sole surviving apostle,

01:20:11.289 --> 01:20:15.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
the last restraint against apostasy.

01:20:15.627 --> 01:20:19.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after John passed off the scene,

01:20:19.264 --> 01:20:23.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was not long

01:20:23.835 --> 01:20:27.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
before something happened.

01:20:27.572 --> 01:20:29.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it?

01:20:29.641 --> 01:20:32.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened when John died?

01:20:33.578 --> 01:20:37.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the last restraint against apostasy

01:20:40.819 --> 01:20:45.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he was the last restraint,
and now he’s gone.

01:20:46.825 --> 01:20:51.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after John passed off this earthly scene,

01:20:51.796 --> 01:20:55.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was not long before apostasy

01:20:55.634 --> 01:20:59.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
spread like wildfire.

01:20:59.070 --> 01:21:01.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
And within a few decades,

01:21:01.439 --> 01:21:05.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Christian congregation
went off into captivity

01:21:05.310 --> 01:21:07.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Babylon the Great

01:21:07.979 --> 01:21:12.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the world empire of false religion.

01:21:12.183 --> 01:21:15.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why mention

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
those sad stories?

01:21:18.423 --> 01:21:20.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s the reason:

01:21:21.927 --> 01:21:25.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some may wonder

01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:29.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
(in our midst today
in the Christian congregation):

01:21:33.238 --> 01:21:37.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What’s going to happen when all the anointed

01:21:37.375 --> 01:21:40.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘are taken to heaven?

01:21:40.111 --> 01:21:42.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will the great crowd be left

01:21:42.714 --> 01:21:45.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘in the lurch?

01:21:45.550 --> 01:21:47.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will they

01:21:47.886 --> 01:21:51.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘stray into some kind of trouble,

01:21:51.056 --> 01:21:54.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe even apostasy?’

01:21:54.559 --> 01:21:56.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what do you think?

01:21:58.930 --> 01:22:02.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you heard any signs of that already?

01:22:04.369 --> 01:22:08.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s the answer: No.

01:22:08.373 --> 01:22:12.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re not going to stray into apostasy

01:22:12.043 --> 01:22:15.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
—absolutely not.

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:17.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those Bible accounts actually

01:22:17.849 --> 01:22:21.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
teach us what will not happen.

01:22:22.887 --> 01:22:25.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings us to the second question:

01:22:25.857 --> 01:22:28.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know

01:22:28.493 --> 01:22:30.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
that such things will not happen?

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:35.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer has a lot to do

01:22:35.166 --> 01:22:38.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
with when we live.

01:22:40.305 --> 01:22:42.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not live in ancient Israel.

01:22:47.312 --> 01:22:50.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t see anyone dressed like

01:22:50.482 --> 01:22:52.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
an Israelite.

01:22:54.919 --> 01:22:58.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of you brothers wear skirts.

01:22:58.556 --> 01:23:00.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, there’s one!
No, there’s none.

01:23:03.094 --> 01:23:06.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no,

01:23:06.631 --> 01:23:09.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t live in ancient Israel.

01:23:09.034 --> 01:23:12.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now you may wonder,
‘Why does that matter?’

01:23:12.137 --> 01:23:14.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that nation was heading

01:23:14.806 --> 01:23:17.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
for trouble from its early days.

01:23:19.844 --> 01:23:24.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Deuteronomy 31:29,

01:23:24.015 --> 01:23:26.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses uttered

01:23:26.851 --> 01:23:28.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
this inspired prophecy

01:23:28.853 --> 01:23:31.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
about those rebellious people.

01:23:31.956 --> 01:23:34.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is how it reads:

01:23:34.459 --> 01:23:37.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know that after my death

01:23:37.095 --> 01:23:39.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will surely act wickedly

01:23:39.564 --> 01:23:41.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and turn aside from the way

01:23:41.599 --> 01:23:44.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
about which I have commanded you.”

01:23:44.502 --> 01:23:47.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Moses’ words came true

01:23:47.238 --> 01:23:49.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
many times, not just once.

01:23:49.541 --> 01:23:53.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, Jehovah had to cast off
those wicked people.

01:23:53.411 --> 01:23:57.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when King Jehoash went bad,

01:23:57.949 --> 01:24:00.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was just acting like many other

01:24:00.852 --> 01:24:03.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
kings of Judah and Israel.

01:24:03.722 --> 01:24:07.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today things are
different among God’s people.

01:24:07.592 --> 01:24:10.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind, we do not live at the end

01:24:10.929 --> 01:24:13.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the first century C.E.

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:15.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why does that matter?

01:24:17.736 --> 01:24:19.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember in Matthew 13

01:24:19.838 --> 01:24:24.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his illustration
of the wheat and the weeds,

01:24:24.175 --> 01:24:28.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus had foretold
that a great apostasy would take place.

01:24:28.713 --> 01:24:31.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,

01:24:31.549 --> 01:24:35.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul confirmed that Jesus’ prophecy
was already beginning

01:24:35.286 --> 01:24:39.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come true in the first century.

01:24:39.791 --> 01:24:43.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter and John verified
the same in their writings.

01:24:43.995 --> 01:24:47.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the second century C.E.,

01:24:47.065 --> 01:24:49.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Christian congregation

01:24:49.100 --> 01:24:52.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
was corrupted and went off
into spiritual captivity

01:24:52.937 --> 01:24:55.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Babylon the Great.

01:24:55.306 --> 01:24:58.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus’ inspired prophecy

01:24:58.676 --> 01:25:02.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
was fulfilled; it came true.

01:25:02.413 --> 01:25:05.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, today, things are very different

01:25:05.850 --> 01:25:08.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
among God’s people—much different.

01:25:08.987 --> 01:25:12.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
At what time are we living?

01:25:12.590 --> 01:25:15.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we said, “Not back then.”

01:25:15.426 --> 01:25:17.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know the answer to that.

01:25:17.595 --> 01:25:22.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re blessed to be living
in a special time period.

01:25:23.768 --> 01:25:27.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this began as far back as 1914.

01:25:27.772 --> 01:25:30.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s more than just “the last days”

01:25:30.708 --> 01:25:33.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this old system of things.

01:25:35.814 --> 01:25:37.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, why is that?

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:43.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what the Bible says—Acts 3:21.

01:25:43.321 --> 01:25:45.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says it’s also called

01:25:45.924 --> 01:25:50.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the times of restoration of all things.”

01:25:50.695 --> 01:25:55.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let the word “restoration”
linger in your mind.

01:25:55.633 --> 01:25:58.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why does that matter?

01:25:58.269 --> 01:26:02.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re living in “the times
of restoration of all things”

01:26:02.707 --> 01:26:05.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
because pure worship has been restored.

01:26:07.612 --> 01:26:09.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re bathing in it.

01:26:09.848 --> 01:26:13.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the worship of Jehovah will <i>never </i>

01:26:13.718 --> 01:26:17.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
be corrupted <i>ever</i>  again

01:26:17.155 --> 01:26:20.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all eternity.

01:26:20.391 --> 01:26:24.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now that is something to swallow

01:26:24.062 --> 01:26:27.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s tasty indeed.

01:26:27.632 --> 01:26:31.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s read Isaiah 54:17 together.

01:26:32.971 --> 01:26:37.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made this long-range prophecy
through Isaiah.

01:26:37.575 --> 01:26:40.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is what it says:

01:26:40.044 --> 01:26:43.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No weapon formed against you
will have any success,

01:26:43.615 --> 01:26:46.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you will condemn
any tongue that rises up

01:26:46.284 --> 01:26:48.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘against you in the judgment.

01:26:48.286 --> 01:26:51.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This is the heritage

01:26:51.055 --> 01:26:53.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘of the servants of Jehovah,

01:26:53.524 --> 01:26:56.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and their righteousness is from me,’

01:26:56.728 --> 01:26:58.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
declares Jehovah.”

01:26:58.963 --> 01:27:01.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about that, please.

01:27:01.699 --> 01:27:04.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No weapon

01:27:04.502 --> 01:27:06.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
“formed against you

01:27:06.671 --> 01:27:11.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have any success.”

01:27:11.009 --> 01:27:13.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
The prophecy says that this is

01:27:13.378 --> 01:27:15.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
our “heritage.”

01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:18.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those inspired words are being fulfilled

01:27:18.983 --> 01:27:21.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
now—today.

01:27:21.953 --> 01:27:24.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing can take that away,

01:27:24.989 --> 01:27:28.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even “the god of this system things,”

01:27:28.793 --> 01:27:31.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan himself.

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:34.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, remember our second question:

01:27:34.766 --> 01:27:37.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know

01:27:37.001 --> 01:27:39.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when the anointed are taken to heaven,

01:27:39.470 --> 01:27:43.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
the great crowd
won’t drift away into trouble?

01:27:43.308 --> 01:27:45.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know

01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:47.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they won’t rebel

01:27:47.912 --> 01:27:50.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way that Jehoash did

01:27:50.281 --> 01:27:53.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehoiada died

01:27:53.351 --> 01:27:55.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
or drift off into apostasy

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:58.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way the second-century Christians did

01:27:58.456 --> 01:28:00.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the last of the apostles,

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:02.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
John, died off?

01:28:04.729 --> 01:28:08.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know

01:28:08.299 --> 01:28:12.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s just a matter of turning the page.

01:28:15.039 --> 01:28:17.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the answer is

01:28:20.078 --> 01:28:24.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we do not live in ancient Israel

01:28:24.315 --> 01:28:26.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we do not live

01:28:26.317 --> 01:28:30.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the second century C.E.

01:28:30.421 --> 01:28:33.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
We live in a wonderful time

01:28:33.191 --> 01:28:35.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
of—what?—

01:28:35.026 --> 01:28:37.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
restoration

01:28:40.198 --> 01:28:43.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah has guaranteed us

01:28:43.668 --> 01:28:48.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘no weapon formed
against us will succeed.’

01:28:48.006 --> 01:28:50.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, our third question:

01:28:50.008 --> 01:28:52.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen when the anointed
are taken to heaven?

01:28:54.746 --> 01:28:58.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, try to imagine that time.

01:28:58.249 --> 01:29:00.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a second.
It’s over.

01:29:01.686 --> 01:29:04.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
The great tribulation is underway.

01:29:04.856 --> 01:29:09.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babylon the Great, the world empire
of false religion, is destroyed first.

01:29:09.761 --> 01:29:10.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of it!

01:29:10.962 --> 01:29:13.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Events that God’s organization

01:29:13.464 --> 01:29:18.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
has prepared us for over many decades

01:29:18.136 --> 01:29:21.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
are happening before our eyes.

01:29:21.806 --> 01:29:24.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then comes something else

01:29:24.208 --> 01:29:27.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have been told to expect.

01:29:27.812 --> 01:29:29.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s that?

01:29:29.814 --> 01:29:32.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time during the great tribulation

01:29:32.316 --> 01:29:35.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and before the war of Armageddon,

01:29:35.186 --> 01:29:39.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
the remaining ones of Christ’s anointed
are taken to heaven.

01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:42.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think will happen next?

01:29:44.862 --> 01:29:49.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will the great crowd wander
about lost and confused

01:29:49.667 --> 01:29:51.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
like sheep without a shepherd?

01:29:51.769 --> 01:29:53.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not.

01:29:53.971 --> 01:29:58.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Jesus is the Shepherd.

01:29:58.276 --> 01:30:01.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will never fail to do his job.

01:30:03.181 --> 01:30:05.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind that the anointed

01:30:05.850 --> 01:30:08.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not the head of our organization.

01:30:11.956 --> 01:30:13.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is.

01:30:15.626 --> 01:30:19.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we hope all parents today
raising children

01:30:19.664 --> 01:30:21.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
will teach them that fact.

01:30:23.401 --> 01:30:26.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s own Son in charge,

01:30:26.003 --> 01:30:29.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christ’s followers here on earth
will have nothing to fear.

01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:33.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we do not know every detail

01:30:33.144 --> 01:30:36.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how Christ will lead
his people at that time.

01:30:36.948 --> 01:30:39.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there are some Bible examples

01:30:39.083 --> 01:30:41.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may reassure us.

01:30:43.087 --> 01:30:46.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, when Moses died
before Israel entered the Promised Land,

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:49.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
what happened to God’s people?

01:30:49.393 --> 01:30:51.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, without that faithful man,

01:30:53.965 --> 01:30:56.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
were they left in the lurch?

01:30:56.334 --> 01:30:58.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is no, not at all.

01:30:58.769 --> 01:31:02.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
As long as they were Jehovah’s people,

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:04.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah provided for them.

01:31:04.442 --> 01:31:06.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he provided richly for them.

01:31:06.544 --> 01:31:08.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had an abundance.

01:31:09.614 --> 01:31:11.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before Moses died,

01:31:11.616 --> 01:31:16.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told him to commission Joshua
to lead the people.

01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:19.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses had been training Joshua for decades.

01:31:19.790 --> 01:31:23.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, there were many
other capable men taking the lead

01:31:23.327 --> 01:31:26.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
—‘chiefs of thousands, hundreds,
fifties, and even tens.’

01:31:26.831 --> 01:31:30.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people were well cared for.

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:35.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank God for Moses and Joshua.

01:31:35.806 --> 01:31:38.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example is that of Elijah.

01:31:38.776 --> 01:31:41.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had been taking the lead in pure worship

01:31:41.012 --> 01:31:43.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
among the Israelites for decades.

01:31:43.381 --> 01:31:46.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the time came for Jehovah to transfer him

01:31:46.484 --> 01:31:50.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a different assignment
down south in Judah.

01:31:50.788 --> 01:31:55.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were faithful people in the ten-tribe kingdom
of Israel left in the lurch?

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Far from it.

01:31:57.562 --> 01:32:00.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah had been training

01:32:00.198 --> 01:32:02.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha for years.

01:32:02.900 --> 01:32:05.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then there were also
“the sons of the prophets”

01:32:05.636 --> 01:32:08.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
evidently organized into schools

01:32:08.272 --> 01:32:10.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
of some kind; we don’t know.

01:32:10.441 --> 01:32:12.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there were many faithful men

01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:15.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
helping to lead God’s people.

01:32:16.480 --> 01:32:20.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s purpose kept advancing,
and he cared for his faithful people.

01:32:20.985 --> 01:32:23.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with those examples in mind,
what do you think

01:32:23.955 --> 01:32:27.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
will happen when the anointed
are taken to heaven?

01:32:27.391 --> 01:32:30.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t need to wonder.

01:32:32.530 --> 01:32:35.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open your Bibles or iPads, and look

01:32:35.032 --> 01:32:39.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 13:5b.

01:32:40.538 --> 01:32:43.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “For he has said:
‘I will never leave you,

01:32:43.241 --> 01:32:45.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will never abandon you.’”

01:32:47.578 --> 01:32:51.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
That tells us the simple, reassuring truth

01:32:51.249 --> 01:32:55.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
will “never abandon” his faithful ones.

01:32:56.554 --> 01:33:00.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Moses and Elijah, faithful anointed ones

01:33:00.157 --> 01:33:03.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
who take the lead today
understand the importance

01:33:03.261 --> 01:33:05.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
of training others.

01:33:05.796 --> 01:33:07.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s ongoing.

01:33:07.031 --> 01:33:09.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has been training men

01:33:09.467 --> 01:33:13.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the other sheep to take
the lead for many decades now.

01:33:13.504 --> 01:33:15.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re familiar with the many schools

01:33:15.706 --> 01:33:18.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
to train elders and missionaries
and traveling overseers

01:33:18.976 --> 01:33:21.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and branch personnel.

01:33:21.145 --> 01:33:25.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to that, the Governing Body
has personally been training helpers

01:33:25.616 --> 01:33:28.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the various committees
of the Governing Body.

01:33:28.586 --> 01:33:31.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
These faithful men are right now

01:33:31.155 --> 01:33:34.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
carrying a very heavy load of responsibility.

01:33:34.625 --> 01:33:36.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Believe me,

01:33:36.627 --> 01:33:38.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a member of the Governing Body,

01:33:38.696 --> 01:33:41.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can say for the rest of us

01:33:41.098 --> 01:33:43.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need the helpers

01:33:43.601 --> 01:33:46.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given us.

01:33:46.203 --> 01:33:48.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for them every day.

01:33:48.939 --> 01:33:52.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re well-prepared
to continue in this work,

01:33:52.843 --> 01:33:54.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
caring for Christ’s sheep

01:33:54.879 --> 01:33:59.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the direction of Jesus himself,
the head of the congregation.

01:33:59.216 --> 01:34:00.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is the point?

01:34:00.818 --> 01:34:02.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply this:

01:34:02.820 --> 01:34:05.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the anointed are taken
to heaven near the very end

01:34:05.623 --> 01:34:09.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the great tribulation
but before Armageddon,

01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:13.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
there will be no interruption
of pure worship here on the earth.

01:34:13.531 --> 01:34:16.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pure worship will keep right on going.

01:34:16.801 --> 01:34:20.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
So thank

01:34:20.137 --> 01:34:24.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah for the leadership
of Jesus Christ.

01:34:24.809 --> 01:34:27.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of God’s worshippers in heaven

01:34:27.211 --> 01:34:30.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
or on earth will miss a beat.

01:34:32.016 --> 01:34:35.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, there will be an attack
from Gog of Magog,

01:34:35.252 --> 01:34:37.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it will not get very far.

01:34:37.254 --> 01:34:38.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to fail.

01:34:38.789 --> 01:34:41.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will not stop the great crowd
from worshipping Jehovah

01:34:41.992 --> 01:34:44.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looking to him to rescue them.

01:34:44.729 --> 01:34:49.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a Rescuer he will prove to be!

01:34:49.133 --> 01:34:51.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how do we answer the third question?

01:34:51.235 --> 01:34:54.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we partly know what will happen

01:34:54.171 --> 01:34:57.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the great crowd when
the anointed are taken to heaven,

01:34:57.208 --> 01:35:00.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that may still leave us wondering:

01:35:00.511 --> 01:35:02.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What about the anointed?

01:35:02.513 --> 01:35:07.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What will they do after they
depart the earthly scene?

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:11.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to know.’

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:18.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible answers that directly.

01:35:18.963 --> 01:35:21.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation chapter 17,

01:35:21.799 --> 01:35:26.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are able to learn in verse 14

01:35:26.404 --> 01:35:30.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the political elements of this world
will foolishly battle with the Lamb.

01:35:30.808 --> 01:35:32.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will lose, of course.

01:35:32.810 --> 01:35:36.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
The verse says: “The Lamb will conquer them.”

01:35:36.213 --> 01:35:38.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
And who will help him?

01:35:38.315 --> 01:35:41.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
The verse continues: “Also, those with him

01:35:41.352 --> 01:35:45.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are called and chosen
and faithful will do so.”

01:35:45.322 --> 01:35:48.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, who are called, chosen, and faithful?

01:35:48.859 --> 01:35:52.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, it will be
 the resurrected anointed.

01:35:52.096 --> 01:35:54.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when the anointed are called to heaven,

01:35:54.365 --> 01:35:58.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the first assignments is to fight.

01:35:58.836 --> 01:36:00.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yay!

01:36:02.740 --> 01:36:05.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s interesting.

01:36:05.142 --> 01:36:07.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of us were fighters

01:36:07.645 --> 01:36:10.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
before we became true Christians.

01:36:10.714 --> 01:36:14.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some even served
in various branches of the military

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:20.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
—didn’t we, Brother Morris?

01:36:25.229 --> 01:36:28.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some were green berets
but not Brother Morris.

01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:35.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we became Christians.

01:36:35.272 --> 01:36:39.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned “the way of peace,”
and we let go of such warfare.

01:36:39.376 --> 01:36:42.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Figuratively speaking, we pulled the pin

01:36:42.446 --> 01:36:45.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
on our last hand-grenade

01:36:45.382 --> 01:36:48.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tossed it into the air,

01:36:48.519 --> 01:36:51.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
killing no one or nothing

01:36:51.689 --> 01:36:55.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just a loud kaboom.

01:36:56.961 --> 01:37:00.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in heaven, we will serve along
with Christ and his holy angels,

01:37:00.965 --> 01:37:04.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
waging the final war against God’s enemies.

01:37:04.635 --> 01:37:09.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you’ve ever thought
that you might feel left in the lurch

01:37:09.273 --> 01:37:12.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the anointed are taken to heaven,
think of this:

01:37:12.409 --> 01:37:15.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
On earth, none of us Christians
are allowed to fight.

01:37:15.946 --> 01:37:18.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us anointed ones
are too old to fight,

01:37:18.782 --> 01:37:22.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we were allowed to.

01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:24.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in heaven,

01:37:24.922 --> 01:37:27.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be mighty spirit creatures

01:37:27.558 --> 01:37:31.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
fighting alongside
our Warrior-King Jesus Christ.

01:37:31.695 --> 01:37:36.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Believe me, we can and will do

01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
you significantly more good in heaven

01:37:39.603 --> 01:37:43.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
than we ever could as imperfect humans

01:37:43.674 --> 01:37:46.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
here on this earth!

01:38:03.928 --> 01:38:08.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m not done, but I should be.

01:38:09.867 --> 01:38:12.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
As for the other sheep,

01:38:12.436 --> 01:38:16.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
what will you need to do
during that climactic time?

01:38:16.206 --> 01:38:19.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply this: hide.

01:38:19.143 --> 01:38:20.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s right.

01:38:20.678 --> 01:38:22.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 26:20, he wrote:

01:38:22.746 --> 01:38:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Enter your inner rooms,

01:38:24.915 --> 01:38:27.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and shut your doors behind you.

01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:29.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hide yourself for a brief moment

01:38:29.553 --> 01:38:32.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the wrath has passed by.”

01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:35.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be hide-and-seek.

01:38:35.626 --> 01:38:38.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will hide,
and they will seek to find you,

01:38:38.829 --> 01:38:41.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they will not.

01:38:41.832 --> 01:38:44.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have anything to worry about?

01:38:44.435 --> 01:38:47.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have nothing to worry about

01:38:47.771 --> 01:38:50.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nothing at all—

01:38:50.007 --> 01:38:53.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah will never

01:38:53.277 --> 01:38:55.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
abandon you.

01:38:55.946 --> 01:39:00.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no justifiable reason
to worry about the future.

01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:04.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just be there,
brothers and sisters, to enjoy it.

01:39:04.421 --> 01:39:09.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Jehovah loves you
and he will never abandon you.

01:39:09.994 --> 01:39:11.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please believe it.

01:39:11.996 --> 01:39:15.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will not be disappointed.

01:39:22.906 --> 01:39:25.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we said it would be a treat,

01:39:25.175 --> 01:39:27.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was a treat.

01:39:27.745 --> 01:39:30.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Herd,

01:39:30.547 --> 01:39:35.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
for helping us to realize
that God’s people are completely safe,

01:39:35.185 --> 01:39:38.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
even as we approach
the great tribulation and Armageddon.

01:39:39.556 --> 01:39:44.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now the question is,
When will those events occur?

01:39:44.061 --> 01:39:47.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention
to Brother Anthony Morris,

01:39:47.598 --> 01:39:49.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
another member of the Governing Body,

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he speaks to us on this subject:

01:39:52.269 --> 01:39:55.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why ‘Keep on the Watch’?”

01:39:56.607 --> 01:39:59.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to answer the question,

01:39:59.710 --> 01:40:02.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why keep on the watch?

01:40:02.813 --> 01:40:04.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a simple, direct answer.

01:40:04.848 --> 01:40:08.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have a second reason as well

01:40:08.052 --> 01:40:10.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share during this talk.

01:40:10.654 --> 01:40:12.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Find Mark,

01:40:15.259 --> 01:40:17.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re going to read

01:40:17.695 --> 01:40:20.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 13.

01:40:20.631 --> 01:40:24.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it leads to our main reason why,

01:40:24.902 --> 01:40:28.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the context will really help us

01:40:28.372 --> 01:40:30.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 32.

01:40:31.909 --> 01:40:36.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read that:
“Concerning that day or the hour

01:40:36.580 --> 01:40:38.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nobody knows,

01:40:38.782 --> 01:40:43.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
“neither the angels in heaven nor the Son,
but the Father.

01:40:43.787 --> 01:40:46.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep looking, keep awake,

01:40:46.490 --> 01:40:50.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you do not know
when the appointed time is.

01:40:50.327 --> 01:40:53.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is like a man traveling abroad
who left his house

01:40:53.797 --> 01:40:57.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and gave the authority to his slaves,
to each one his work,

01:40:57.568 --> 01:41:01.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and commanded the doorkeeper
to keep on the watch.

01:41:01.605 --> 01:41:04.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep on the watch, therefore,

01:41:04.341 --> 01:41:09.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you do not know
when the master of the house is coming,

01:41:09.346 --> 01:41:12.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether late in the day or at midnight

01:41:12.116 --> 01:41:15.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or [at] dawn or early in the morning,

01:41:15.986 --> 01:41:19.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order that when he comes suddenly,

01:41:19.890 --> 01:41:23.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
he does not find you sleeping.”

01:41:24.128 --> 01:41:27.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s our Lord and Master

01:41:27.231 --> 01:41:29.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
—very direct.

01:41:29.299 --> 01:41:32.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s compassionate (true) but direct.

01:41:32.836 --> 01:41:37.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then the main reason why—verse 37:

01:41:37.808 --> 01:41:41.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What I say to you, I say to all

01:41:41.812 --> 01:41:46.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[so it’s being repeated
to all of us listening]:

01:41:46.617 --> 01:41:49.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep on the watch.”

01:41:49.820 --> 01:41:53.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very simple, very direct.

01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:55.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what is expected.

01:41:55.759 --> 01:41:57.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, and I appreciated—

01:41:57.895 --> 01:42:01.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hadn’t heard Brother Cook’s talk

01:42:01.498 --> 01:42:03.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
(knew about the details and such),

01:42:03.834 --> 01:42:08.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he emphasized for all of us,
and it’s connected here,

01:42:08.472 --> 01:42:13.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah as a God of comfort.

01:42:13.143 --> 01:42:17.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while it’s true that we want
to sometimes address directly

01:42:17.981 --> 01:42:20.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
the things that Jesus has taught us,

01:42:20.984 --> 01:42:23.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t mean that Jehovah is

01:42:23.787 --> 01:42:27.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
no longer a God of comfort.

01:42:27.057 --> 01:42:29.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to comfort us.

01:42:29.226 --> 01:42:31.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is the second reason.

01:42:31.728 --> 01:42:34.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ll find Isaiah,

01:42:34.631 --> 01:42:39.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to read in chapter 48.

01:42:39.203 --> 01:42:42.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s a very fine thought

01:42:42.039 --> 01:42:45.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
about why keep on the watch.

01:42:45.676 --> 01:42:48.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 17—very familiar to us—

01:42:48.011 --> 01:42:51.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see the point:

01:42:51.148 --> 01:42:54.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah says, your Repurchaser,

01:42:54.518 --> 01:42:56.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Holy One of Israel:

01:42:56.987 --> 01:43:00.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I, Jehovah, am your God,

01:43:00.324 --> 01:43:04.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the One teaching you to benefit yourself,

01:43:04.995 --> 01:43:09.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
the One guiding you
in the way you should walk.’”

01:43:09.433 --> 01:43:13.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how we appreciate the footnote

01:43:13.971 --> 01:43:18.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
that adds depth
to what Jehovah is saying here:

01:43:18.976 --> 01:43:22.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or ‘for your own good’”!

01:43:22.846 --> 01:43:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that priceless?

01:43:24.915 --> 01:43:27.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why keep on the watch?

01:43:29.519 --> 01:43:31.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s for our own good.

01:43:31.755 --> 01:43:34.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
It really is.

01:43:34.057 --> 01:43:39.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s the point
Jesus and Jehovah want us to take away.

01:43:39.029 --> 01:43:42.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re trying to address that with this talk

01:43:42.165 --> 01:43:45.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
because some of you
have been serving Jehovah

01:43:45.869 --> 01:43:48.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a long time.

01:43:48.238 --> 01:43:50.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m not going to stare at anybody

01:43:50.407 --> 01:43:52.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I know different ones,

01:43:52.876 --> 01:43:57.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s just amazing how Jehovah

01:43:57.047 --> 01:44:01.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been there for you all these years.

01:44:01.919 --> 01:44:03.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you’re only human.

01:44:03.787 --> 01:44:07.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll address some concerns
that some raise.

01:44:07.057 --> 01:44:11.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I just want to have you
think about this here

01:44:11.228 --> 01:44:13.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a personal experience.

01:44:13.230 --> 01:44:18.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many years ago, my sons, Jesse and Paul,

01:44:18.101 --> 01:44:21.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
were in the early years of school

01:44:21.471 --> 01:44:24.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
—elementary school.

01:44:24.007 --> 01:44:27.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
And back at the time—
I haven’t heard it a lot lately,

01:44:27.411 --> 01:44:32.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
but from time to time,
this would come up at a social gathering.

01:44:32.015 --> 01:44:33.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, mind you, they’re

01:44:33.717 --> 01:44:37.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
in second grade and first grade,

01:44:37.187 --> 01:44:40.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
but these boys were thinkers.

01:44:40.657 --> 01:44:44.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they’d listen,
and they appreciated all these older ones.

01:44:44.461 --> 01:44:47.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a number of them in Rhode Island

01:44:47.731 --> 01:44:50.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
—longtime servants of Jehovah God.

01:44:50.467 --> 01:44:53.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, from time to time—this statement—

01:44:53.303 --> 01:44:56.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’d be looking at my sons and say:

01:44:56.073 --> 01:45:01.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, you’ll never graduate in this system.

01:45:01.078 --> 01:45:03.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not going to happen.”

01:45:03.613 --> 01:45:07.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, you know, I’m at their house;
they just fed us.

01:45:09.853 --> 01:45:12.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lord, help me.
What am I going to do here?

01:45:12.723 --> 01:45:17.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this would come up from time to time,
at least during those years.

01:45:17.027 --> 01:45:19.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe it was post-1975.

01:45:19.896 --> 01:45:21.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know.

01:45:21.398 --> 01:45:23.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they’d make these statements.

01:45:23.133 --> 01:45:25.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m going to give you a big confession

01:45:25.335 --> 01:45:29.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
because, you know,
this one comes clear to mind.

01:45:29.106 --> 01:45:32.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Driving back from the gathering,

01:45:32.542 --> 01:45:37.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesse and Paul are, you know,
thinking and they’re troubled.

01:45:37.147 --> 01:45:39.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re puzzled.
What is this about?

01:45:39.850 --> 01:45:41.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because, you know, they had goals.

01:45:41.918 --> 01:45:43.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What are we going to do?”

01:45:43.086 --> 01:45:46.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re thinking
of the things in the future for them

01:45:46.423 --> 01:45:50.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they’re growing in their love for Jehovah.

01:45:51.061 --> 01:45:53.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is that true, Dad?”

01:45:53.597 --> 01:45:55.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I’d say, “Look . . .”

01:45:55.332 --> 01:45:57.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let me tell you,
these people saying these things

01:45:57.567 --> 01:46:01.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
were longtime servants—experienced people.

01:46:01.471 --> 01:46:05.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
If any of you are guilty, God loves you.
He forgives you.

01:46:05.242 --> 01:46:09.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you did that back then,
you didn’t help anybody.

01:46:11.048 --> 01:46:14.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m going to give you a big confession.

01:46:14.151 --> 01:46:17.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that one particular night,
we’re driving back

01:46:17.154 --> 01:46:19.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it was a little distance from where we were—

01:46:19.589 --> 01:46:21.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they brought that up.

01:46:21.792 --> 01:46:24.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re sitting in the back seat,
and we’re having this conversation.

01:46:24.828 --> 01:46:29.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I told them—I said:
“Look, you boys remember,

01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:32.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you got to keep on the watch.

01:46:34.171 --> 01:46:39.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
This thing could go on,
and be ready for it to go to 2020.”

01:46:40.343 --> 01:46:42.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honest.

01:46:42.345 --> 01:46:47.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, we’re talking almost 40 years
—almost 40 years.

01:46:47.284 --> 01:46:49.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt pretty safe with that.

01:46:53.390 --> 01:46:55.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you know what year this is.

01:46:55.959 --> 01:46:58.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are you going to do?

01:46:58.829 --> 01:47:01.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at least I’m happy to say

01:47:01.498 --> 01:47:06.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they and my wife and their wives

01:47:06.069 --> 01:47:08.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
are all still keeping on the watch.

01:47:08.772 --> 01:47:12.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have been and plan to continue

01:47:12.909 --> 01:47:15.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep on the watch.

01:47:15.378 --> 01:47:18.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is just something to address

01:47:18.782 --> 01:47:21.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the feelings that some have.

01:47:21.718 --> 01:47:24.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these are beautiful friends

01:47:24.855 --> 01:47:29.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
—different ones worshipping Jehovah
for many decades.

01:47:29.826 --> 01:47:32.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re only human.

01:47:32.262 --> 01:47:34.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the truth,

01:47:34.531 --> 01:47:37.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we’re only human.

01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:40.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one brother wrote,

01:47:40.036 --> 01:47:42.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I appreciated his sincerity.

01:47:42.873 --> 01:47:45.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

01:47:45.041 --> 01:47:47.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During the annual meeting of 2019,

01:47:47.978 --> 01:47:51.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Ramapo project was announced.

01:47:51.848 --> 01:47:53.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And if I remember right,

01:47:53.984 --> 01:47:57.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it was stated that the project
would be complete in a few years.

01:47:59.356 --> 01:48:01.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With recent <i>Watchtower</i>  articles telling us

01:48:01.758 --> 01:48:06.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we are in ‘the last of “the last days”’

01:48:06.730 --> 01:48:10.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[beautiful expression,
but words are powerful],

01:48:10.934 --> 01:48:13.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it seemed a little disappointing

01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:18.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this may push
Armageddon off a few years.”

01:48:18.808 --> 01:48:22.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was his sincere concern—really.

01:48:22.379 --> 01:48:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know he’s not alone.

01:48:26.049 --> 01:48:28.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re only human.

01:48:28.818 --> 01:48:31.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how should we respond?

01:48:31.321 --> 01:48:33.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother wrote that in.

01:48:33.957 --> 01:48:38.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, remember, Jehovah is a God of comfort.

01:48:38.628 --> 01:48:40.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
You want to go direct.

01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:43.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what we addressed there
with what Jesus told us.

01:48:43.967 --> 01:48:48.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can we comfort him too?

01:48:48.872 --> 01:48:52.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bring the truth as it is,
and be straight with it.

01:48:56.046 --> 01:48:59.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body wants all of you to know

01:48:59.516 --> 01:49:02.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
(including those that will see it later)

01:49:02.352 --> 01:49:06.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are determined to remain active

01:49:06.723 --> 01:49:10.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to faithfully deliver spiritual food

01:49:10.227 --> 01:49:13.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the right time.

01:49:13.230 --> 01:49:18.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also looking beyond the last days.

01:49:18.068 --> 01:49:20.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re getting that message.

01:49:20.804 --> 01:49:23.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me expound on that thought:

01:49:23.873 --> 01:49:26.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking beyond the last days.

01:49:26.876 --> 01:49:31.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a quote from the <i>Proclaimers</i>  book.

01:49:31.147 --> 01:49:33.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
I treasured it when the book came out,

01:49:33.583 --> 01:49:37.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a lot of work went into that publication.

01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there, referring to God’s people,
it stated—

01:49:43.093 --> 01:49:45.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, there was
a lot of international construction

01:49:45.262 --> 01:49:48.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
going on at the time too,
if you were in the truth then.

01:49:48.865 --> 01:49:53.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m quoting it now:
“With the help of Jehovah’s spirit,

01:49:53.203 --> 01:49:57.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they [God’s people] want to give
the greatest witness possible

01:49:57.841 --> 01:50:01.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“during the time that remains
before Armageddon.

01:50:01.411 --> 01:50:03.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are convinced

01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:07.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that God’s new world is very close at hand,

01:50:07.284 --> 01:50:09.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they have faith

01:50:09.286 --> 01:50:13.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that they will survive
as an organized people

01:50:13.223 --> 01:50:16.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“into that new world, under the rule

01:50:16.559 --> 01:50:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s Messianic Kingdom.”

01:50:18.995 --> 01:50:22.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, please note the rest of this quote:

01:50:24.768 --> 01:50:28.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is also their hope that perhaps

01:50:28.104 --> 01:50:30.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[key word]

01:50:30.140 --> 01:50:33.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
“many of the fine facilities
that they have built

01:50:33.576 --> 01:50:35.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and dedicated to Jehovah

01:50:35.845 --> 01:50:39.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will continue to be used after Armageddon

01:50:39.582 --> 01:50:43.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as centers from which knowledge
of the only true God

01:50:43.653 --> 01:50:48.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be diffused
until it truly fills the earth.”

01:50:48.591 --> 01:50:50.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful thought.

01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:54.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s right there—still valid.

01:50:54.464 --> 01:50:59.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in harmony
with what the faithful slave said then,

01:50:59.469 --> 01:51:02.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
the faithful slave now says

01:51:02.339 --> 01:51:06.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
that many of the projects
that are being worked on now

01:51:06.876 --> 01:51:11.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like Ramapo, the <i>Good News</i>
<i>According to Jesus  </i>video series—

01:51:11.881 --> 01:51:15.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
may or perhaps

01:51:17.220 --> 01:51:20.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
will carry over into the new world

01:51:20.457 --> 01:51:24.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
to assist the great crowd with the work ahead

01:51:24.994 --> 01:51:27.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps

01:51:27.030 --> 01:51:30.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
include resurrected ones.

01:51:30.033 --> 01:51:32.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s comforting.

01:51:32.035 --> 01:51:36.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to let that sink in.

01:51:36.740 --> 01:51:39.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we want to conclude

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:43.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
with expressions from two friends of mine

01:51:43.847 --> 01:51:47.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
—longtime hardworking supporters

01:51:47.650 --> 01:51:51.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the faithful slave for decades.

01:51:51.454 --> 01:51:54.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love these men,
and we’ll keep it anonymous.

01:51:54.324 --> 01:51:59.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I asked them
to write their personal feelings

01:51:59.329 --> 01:52:04.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
because, you know, they’ve been supporting
the slave for all these decades.

01:52:05.301 --> 01:52:08.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have they benefited

01:52:08.037 --> 01:52:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
from keeping on the watch?

01:52:11.741 --> 01:52:14.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s what the first one said:

01:52:16.446 --> 01:52:19.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I come from a long line of people

01:52:19.549 --> 01:52:23.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who believed in keeping in expectation
of the end.

01:52:23.853 --> 01:52:27.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My mother died just last year,

01:52:27.424 --> 01:52:31.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and she always felt that the end
was close at hand.

01:52:31.461 --> 01:52:35.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She just knew that she would live to see it,

01:52:35.899 --> 01:52:38.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but she didn’t.

01:52:38.501 --> 01:52:42.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She had first learned the truth
from her mother-in-law, my grandmother,

01:52:42.639 --> 01:52:44.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“an anointed Christian who often told me

01:52:44.974 --> 01:52:48.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that she hoped to see the end
come in her lifetime.

01:52:48.978 --> 01:52:51.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She didn’t.

01:52:51.014 --> 01:52:55.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She had learned the truth from her mother,
who died when I was a teenager

01:52:55.385 --> 01:52:59.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and firmly believed
she would see the end in her lifetime.

01:52:59.656 --> 01:53:01.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She didn’t.

01:53:01.724 --> 01:53:03.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And she, my great-grandmother,

01:53:03.760 --> 01:53:05.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“had learned the truth from her mother-in-law

01:53:05.995 --> 01:53:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who died long before I was born

01:53:08.631 --> 01:53:12.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and surely felt the same way
about seeing the end.

01:53:12.202 --> 01:53:14.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She didn’t.

01:53:14.504 --> 01:53:18.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And here I am now
on my seventh decade of life,

01:53:18.975 --> 01:53:22.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“firmly believing
that I will see the end very soon.

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:26.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, what does that mean?

01:53:27.517 --> 01:53:31.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That I’m just another one
in a long line of delusional people?

01:53:33.823 --> 01:53:37.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t think so for two reasons.

01:53:37.627 --> 01:53:42.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One, the evidence that the end is near
keeps growing.

01:53:42.165 --> 01:53:46.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve seen signs of the end
that even my mother never saw,

01:53:46.436 --> 01:53:48.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“such as the recent pandemic.

01:53:48.972 --> 01:53:52.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sometimes I compare myself
to a man living in Judea

01:53:52.709 --> 01:53:55.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“around the year 608 B.C.E.

01:53:55.979 --> 01:54:00.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Such a man might have come
from a long line of faithful people

01:54:00.350 --> 01:54:05.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who had listened to the prophets
and thought that the end was near.

01:54:05.054 --> 01:54:08.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Over a century earlier,

01:54:08.658 --> 01:54:10.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
“hearing these things

01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:14.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(and maybe his great-grandparents
might have heard Isaiah speak)

01:54:14.230 --> 01:54:17.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“led them to conclude
that Jerusalem’s end was near.

01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:24.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Should that man decide
that his family had been deluded

01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:28.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just because they hadn’t seen
the destruction of Jerusalem?

01:54:28.444 --> 01:54:30.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No.

01:54:30.446 --> 01:54:34.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jerusalem was destroyed in 607 B.C.E.”

01:54:34.183 --> 01:54:38.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, see, he’s living in 608 B.C.E.
having these concerns.

01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:43.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Months later, it happens.

01:54:43.359 --> 01:54:46.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But more importantly, that man would know

01:54:46.429 --> 01:54:50.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that his faithful family were good people
who lived good lives.

01:54:50.934 --> 01:54:55.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They loved Jehovah,
and they saw the truth of Isaiah’s words.

01:54:56.906 --> 01:54:59.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God teaches us to benefit ourselves.

01:55:01.144 --> 01:55:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And that’s the second reason
why I don’t feel that I’ve been deluded

01:55:06.082 --> 01:55:09.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or that my faithful family members
have been.

01:55:09.152 --> 01:55:14.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Each one who served Jehovah
led a good, productive, useful life.

01:55:14.023 --> 01:55:17.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They were not just sitting around
waiting for the end.

01:55:17.594 --> 01:55:21.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They always had projects
that kept them busy in Jehovah’s service

01:55:21.364 --> 01:55:25.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—goals and personal study
and preaching and helping others.

01:55:25.435 --> 01:55:28.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So they were full of purpose and joy.

01:55:28.938 --> 01:55:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I want the same kind of life.

01:55:31.674 --> 01:55:36.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, I can hardly wait to tell my mother
[this is touching]

01:55:36.446 --> 01:55:39.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just how close the end was

01:55:39.148 --> 01:55:42.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when she finally closed her eyes.

01:55:42.185 --> 01:55:47.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know she will want to hear all about it.”

01:55:47.790 --> 01:55:49.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, very touching.

01:55:49.792 --> 01:55:52.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now the second brother relates

01:55:52.128 --> 01:55:56.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
how keeping on the watch has benefited him.

01:55:56.065 --> 01:55:59.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My mom raised
my brother and me in the truth.

01:55:59.535 --> 01:56:02.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She often expressed to us her confidence

01:56:02.405 --> 01:56:05.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that the end is just around the corner.

01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:09.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She didn’t just say it, but she lived it.

01:56:09.746 --> 01:56:12.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She devoted herself to the ministry

01:56:12.181 --> 01:56:15.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that she could help others
to serve Jehovah

01:56:15.151 --> 01:56:17.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“while there is still time.

01:56:17.854 --> 01:56:20.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“She kept in expectation of the end,

01:56:20.523 --> 01:56:23.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“doing so year after year

01:56:23.459 --> 01:56:25.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“until she died.

01:56:25.662 --> 01:56:30.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I’m approaching
the age of my mother when she died.

01:56:30.099 --> 01:56:33.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve been keeping on the watch
for over 50 years now.

01:56:33.770 --> 01:56:36.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Am I bitter because the end
has not yet come?

01:56:36.973 --> 01:56:40.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No, not at all.

01:56:40.109 --> 01:56:42.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How could I be?

01:56:42.111 --> 01:56:44.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’ve lived a full and satisfying life

01:56:44.514 --> 01:56:47.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by living according to Jehovah’s standards.

01:56:47.483 --> 01:56:51.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why would I want to live any other way?

01:56:51.654 --> 01:56:56.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What has helped me to keep positive
while waiting for the end to come?

01:56:56.192 --> 01:57:00.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From time to time, I reflect
on these few things [and here they are]:

01:57:00.229 --> 01:57:05.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My dedication is unconditional and unending.

01:57:05.268 --> 01:57:08.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I did not dedicate myself to Jehovah

01:57:08.004 --> 01:57:12.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the condition that he brings the end
within my lifetime

01:57:12.442 --> 01:57:15.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or even on the condition
that he gives me a reward.

01:57:15.778 --> 01:57:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I dedicated myself to him forever.

01:57:20.416 --> 01:57:24.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And next, I must keep
the big picture in mind.

01:57:24.620 --> 01:57:27.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t want to make the mistake of focusing

01:57:27.523 --> 01:57:31.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“only on what the end will mean for me

01:57:31.394 --> 01:57:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the prospect of surviving
into the new world.

01:57:35.998 --> 01:57:39.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Rather, I must focus
on something far more important

01:57:39.769 --> 01:57:42.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—what the end will mean for Jehovah

01:57:42.972 --> 01:57:45.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the sanctification of his name.

01:57:45.675 --> 01:57:48.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Knowing how important that is to him,

01:57:48.678 --> 01:57:52.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can be sure that it will happen

01:57:52.648 --> 01:57:54.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his due time.”

01:57:54.650 --> 01:57:56.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then finally:

01:57:56.652 --> 01:58:00.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Meanwhile, I must endure to the end.

01:58:00.156 --> 01:58:04.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That means to the end of this system
or to the end of my life,

01:58:04.727 --> 01:58:06.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whichever comes first.

01:58:06.763 --> 01:58:11.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Either way, the older I get,
the closer I am to the end.

01:58:12.101 --> 01:58:15.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What if, like my mom,
I don’t live to see it?

01:58:15.705 --> 01:58:17.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No worries.

01:58:19.275 --> 01:58:23.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The moment I close my eyes in death,

01:58:23.179 --> 01:58:25.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
“my next conscious thought will be

01:58:25.982 --> 01:58:29.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
“opening my eyes in the new world.

01:58:29.619 --> 01:58:32.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then it really won’t matter

01:58:32.789 --> 01:58:36.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether I live to see the end or not.”

01:58:36.793 --> 01:58:39.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful expressions

01:58:39.061 --> 01:58:42.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
of two beautiful spiritual men.

01:58:42.965 --> 01:58:46.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question to conclude is,

01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:50.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will this be the last annual meeting

01:58:52.175 --> 01:58:54.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the great tribulation?

01:58:56.279 --> 01:58:58.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobody raised their hand.

01:58:59.448 --> 01:59:01.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know.

01:59:01.884 --> 01:59:04.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what we do know

01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:07.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that Jehovah and Jesus want us

01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:12.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep on the watch.

01:59:12.361 --> 01:59:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s for our own good to do so.

01:59:23.906 --> 01:59:26.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Morris,

01:59:26.242 --> 01:59:29.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
for that very stirring,
very encouraging talk.

01:59:29.812 --> 01:59:32.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, would you agree, brothers and sisters,

01:59:32.014 --> 01:59:34.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have not been disappointed

01:59:34.183 --> 01:59:36.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our banquet of spiritual food today?

01:59:36.252 --> 01:59:38.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you feel?

01:59:45.428 --> 01:59:49.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
We began our program
by being reminded that Jehovah,

01:59:49.465 --> 01:59:51.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means
of “the faithful and discreet slave,”

01:59:51.801 --> 01:59:56.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
is providing what we need
exactly at the right time.

01:59:56.672 --> 02:00:01.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what an abundance
of spiritual food we have!

02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:04.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think of the variety that we discussed

02:00:04.814 --> 02:00:06.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our annual meeting today

02:00:06.949 --> 02:00:10.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our new publication <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>,

02:00:10.519 --> 02:00:14.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
a brand new Caleb and Sophia epic video,

02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:16.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wonderful Scriptural talks,

02:00:16.792 --> 02:00:20.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
the direction that we received
regarding the COVID-19 pandemic,

02:00:20.796 --> 02:00:24.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Good News According to Jesus</i>
video project,

02:00:24.300 --> 02:00:28.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as the wonderful,
upbuilding spiritual songs.

02:00:28.504 --> 02:00:31.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s just a fraction

02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:34.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the spiritual food
that we’re receiving at this time.

02:00:34.410 --> 02:00:36.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, Jehovah,

02:00:36.412 --> 02:00:39.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means
of “the faithful and discreet slave,”

02:00:39.148 --> 02:00:44.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
keeps giving
all these forms of spiritual food

02:00:44.153 --> 02:00:46.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
just at the right time.

02:00:46.956 --> 02:00:50.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the events of the past two years

02:00:50.526 --> 02:00:52.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been historic,

02:00:52.929 --> 02:00:57.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they truly have been unprecedented.

02:00:57.600 --> 02:01:00.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
They indicate that we are close

02:01:00.803 --> 02:01:03.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the outbreak of the great tribulation.

02:01:03.839 --> 02:01:06.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
How vital it is, brothers,

02:01:06.042 --> 02:01:08.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we continue to recognize

02:01:08.611 --> 02:01:12.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s channel
for receiving spiritual food!

02:01:13.215 --> 02:01:18.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
The November 15, 2013,
issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>

02:01:19.121 --> 02:01:23.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned key points
for elders in particular to keep in mind

02:01:23.726 --> 02:01:26.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we prepare to face the attack

02:01:26.929 --> 02:01:29.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
of that coalition of nations

02:01:29.465 --> 02:01:33.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible calls Gog of Magog.

02:01:33.703 --> 02:01:36.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I’m going to quote the article;
this is what it stated.

02:01:36.205 --> 02:01:39.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the quote: “At that time,

02:01:39.809 --> 02:01:44.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“life-saving direction
that we receive from Jehovah’s organization

02:01:44.547 --> 02:01:48.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“may not appear practical
from a human standpoint.

02:01:50.086 --> 02:01:53.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All of us must be ready to obey

02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:55.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
“any instructions we may receive,

02:01:55.891 --> 02:01:57.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether these appear sound

02:01:57.893 --> 02:02:02.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from a strategic or human standpoint
or not. . . .

02:02:03.733 --> 02:02:05.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now is the time

02:02:05.735 --> 02:02:10.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for any who may be putting
their trust in secular education,

02:02:10.539 --> 02:02:12.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“material things,

02:02:12.708 --> 02:02:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or human institutions

02:02:15.411 --> 02:02:18.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
to adjust their thinking.”

02:02:19.281 --> 02:02:21.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very sober words

02:02:21.617 --> 02:02:25.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
that apply so well at this particular moment.

02:02:26.422 --> 02:02:30.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear brothers and sisters,
do you know what time it is?

02:02:30.559 --> 02:02:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
There has never been
a more important time

02:02:33.429 --> 02:02:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay alert spiritually

02:02:36.432 --> 02:02:39.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to respond quickly

02:02:39.335 --> 02:02:41.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s direction.

02:02:41.437 --> 02:02:45.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has led us safely to this moment.

02:02:45.174 --> 02:02:48.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has given us everything that we need,

02:02:48.677 --> 02:02:51.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we know he’s going to continue to do so

02:02:51.480 --> 02:02:54.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just as our 2022 yeartext

02:02:54.450 --> 02:02:57.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Psalm 34:10 states:

02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:02.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those seeking Jehovah
will lack nothing good.”

02:03:03.626 --> 02:03:05.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear brothers and sisters,

02:03:05.694 --> 02:03:07.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
be determined

02:03:07.763 --> 02:03:12.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue to follow
our Leader, Jesus Christ,

02:03:12.134 --> 02:03:15.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the channel that he is using today

02:03:15.004 --> 02:03:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if we do,

02:03:17.273 --> 02:03:20.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will have everything that we need

02:03:20.543 --> 02:03:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and right on time.

02:03:29.919 --> 02:03:33.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with that we conclude
another spiritual feast

02:03:33.122 --> 02:03:35.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
in conjunction with the annual meeting

02:03:35.124 --> 02:03:38.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Watch Tower Bible
and Tract Society of Pennsylvania.

02:03:39.261 --> 02:03:42.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that a powerful program?

02:03:42.531 --> 02:03:46.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how reassuring
to review the many ways

02:03:46.102 --> 02:03:49.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has strengthened us,
energized us,

02:03:49.805 --> 02:03:52.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and comforted us over the last year!

02:03:52.908 --> 02:03:56.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
This annual meeting
left us with no doubt

02:03:56.312 --> 02:03:58.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
that despite the challenges

02:03:58.314 --> 02:04:00.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters have had to endure

02:04:00.583 --> 02:04:02.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the face of persecution,

02:04:02.685 --> 02:04:04.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
natural disasters,

02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:08.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ongoing effects of the pandemic,

02:04:08.023 --> 02:04:12.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah continues to bless his people.

02:04:12.027 --> 02:04:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
His organization is on the move
as never before.

02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:21.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s conclude our program
with a video postcard

02:04:21.137 --> 02:04:26.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
that takes us
to the beautiful island nation of Jamaica.

02:04:26.142 --> 02:04:30.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jamaica is the third-largest island
in the Caribbean Sea,

02:04:30.813 --> 02:04:33.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
located about 100 miles,

02:04:33.349 --> 02:04:35.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 160 kilometers,

02:04:35.417 --> 02:04:37.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
west of Haiti.

02:04:37.419 --> 02:04:39.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
The golden beaches

02:04:39.021 --> 02:04:42.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beautiful coral reefs
that ring the island

02:04:42.291 --> 02:04:46.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
draw more than four million visitors
each year.

02:04:46.262 --> 02:04:49.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
The country’s main crops include bananas,

02:04:49.965 --> 02:04:51.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
sugarcane,

02:04:51.567 --> 02:04:55.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
and world-famous
Jamaican blue mountain coffee,

02:04:55.404 --> 02:04:59.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is grown high
on the steep slopes of the Blue Mountains.

02:04:59.875 --> 02:05:03.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jamaica is also known for its jerk cuisine,

02:05:03.579 --> 02:05:07.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
which features meats
such as chicken, pork, or goat

02:05:07.983 --> 02:05:11.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
rubbed with spices and cooked over a fire

02:05:11.687 --> 02:05:15.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give the meat a distinctive smoky flavor.

02:05:15.558 --> 02:05:20.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news first reached Jamaica in 1897.

02:05:20.563 --> 02:05:22.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Russell even gave a talk

02:05:22.998 --> 02:05:27.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the capital city of Kingston back in 1913.

02:05:28.170 --> 02:05:33.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, there are
more than 11,360 publishers

02:05:33.175 --> 02:05:37.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaching in more than 165 congregations

02:05:37.646 --> 02:05:39.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and groups.

02:05:39.515 --> 02:05:42.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
The national language of Jamaica is English,

02:05:43.552 --> 02:05:45.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
but two remote translation offices

02:05:45.821 --> 02:05:48.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
help support the preaching in Jamaican Creole

02:05:48.791 --> 02:05:51.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jamaican Sign Language.

02:05:51.527 --> 02:05:53.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic

02:05:53.529 --> 02:05:55.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it became necessary
to hold meetings

02:05:55.998 --> 02:05:58.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
by videoconference,

02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:02.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
our Jamaican brothers
had to deal with a special challenge

02:06:02.238 --> 02:06:06.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the high price of Internet access.

02:06:06.408 --> 02:06:09.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cost of data
to connect to just one meeting

02:06:09.878 --> 02:06:14.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
was twice the price
of taking a taxi to the Kingdom Hall.

02:06:14.049 --> 02:06:18.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was far more expensive
to attend a meeting virtually

02:06:18.487 --> 02:06:20.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
than it was to attend in person.

02:06:20.489 --> 02:06:22.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Jamaican brothers and sisters

02:06:22.925 --> 02:06:26.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
generously have been sharing
their electronic devices

02:06:26.295 --> 02:06:29.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helping one another
with the cost of data

02:06:29.798 --> 02:06:33.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that everyone can access the meetings

02:06:33.302 --> 02:06:35.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy good association.

02:06:35.971 --> 02:06:38.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some who benefited from these provisions

02:06:38.574 --> 02:06:42.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in the Central Sign Language Congregation
in Mandeville.

02:06:43.212 --> 02:06:47.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation has been able
to meet together by videoconferencing

02:06:47.216 --> 02:06:50.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
with two other
Jamaican Sign Language groups,

02:06:50.619 --> 02:06:52.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
providing deaf publishers on the island

02:06:52.621 --> 02:06:55.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
with more opportunities for association

02:06:55.724 --> 02:06:57.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the pandemic.

02:06:58.894 --> 02:07:00.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hardworking publishers

02:07:00.229 --> 02:07:02.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Central Sign Language Congregation

02:07:02.698 --> 02:07:05.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you their love and greetings.

02:07:06.235 --> 02:07:09.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please remember,
dear brothers and sisters,

02:07:09.471 --> 02:07:12.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we love you all very much.

02:07:12.608 --> 02:07:15.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

02:07:15.844 --> 02:07:18.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
