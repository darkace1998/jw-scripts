Welcome!

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:05.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month we’ll focus on how

00:00:05.855 --> 00:00:09.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can “serve Jehovah with rejoicing.”

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:12.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As parents know, a child is a source

00:00:12.662 --> 00:00:16.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of great joy as well as challenges.

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how the good example

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:21.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set by these parents
influenced their children.

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:25.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you think of God’s promised new world,

00:00:25.475 --> 00:00:28.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do images like these come to mind?

00:00:28.011 --> 00:00:31.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do they make you feel?

00:00:31.014 --> 00:00:33.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re sure you’ll enjoy a glimpse

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:36.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the future in our new music video.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ll learn how our joy is enhanced

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we express appreciation for our family,

00:00:44.828 --> 00:00:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for our congregation, and for Jehovah.

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the February 2020 edition

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting®.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.559 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To set the stage, we’d like to begin

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:18.661 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with a few thoughts about the subject

00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:21.698 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing.”

00:01:21.698 --> 00:01:25.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what we are told at Psalm 100:2.

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:30.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you serve Jehovah
with rejoicing all the time?

00:01:30.273 --> 00:01:32.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I guess we all will agree

00:01:32.275 --> 00:01:36.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that at times it
can be difficult to be happy.

00:01:36.146 --> 00:01:39.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, is it really important

00:01:39.315 --> 00:01:41.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve Jehovah with rejoicing?

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:44.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what does it really mean?

00:01:44.087 --> 00:01:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, what is this joyful attitude

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah expects from us?

00:01:49.926 --> 00:01:53.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what can we do to serve Jehovah

00:01:53.196 --> 00:01:56.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with rejoicing and maintain a joyful spirit?

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:03.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we prove that it is important
to serve Jehovah with rejoicing?

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:08.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might think of our goal,
which is to reflect his personality.

00:02:08.978 --> 00:02:13.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Timothy 1:11,
he’s called “the happy God.”

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:17.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So isn’t it logical that Jehovah expects us

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be happy in his service?

00:02:20.657 --> 00:02:23.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Deuteronomy chapter 28,

00:02:23.293 --> 00:02:27.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find a report
of God’s dealings with the Israelites.

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here Jehovah warned them
of what would take place

00:02:31.167 --> 00:02:33.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they became disobedient

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:37.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lost their joy in serving him.

00:02:38.141 --> 00:02:42.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read at Deuteronomy chapter 28,
beginning in verse 45:

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All these curses
will certainly come upon you

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . because you did not listen
to the voice of Jehovah your God

00:02:51.521 --> 00:02:54.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by keeping his commandments and . . .

00:02:54.324 --> 00:02:58.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you did not serve Jehovah your God

00:02:58.027 --> 00:03:00.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with rejoicing and joy of heart

00:03:00.964 --> 00:03:04.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you had
such an abundance of everything.”

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:08.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah took such good care
of the Israelites,

00:03:08.671 --> 00:03:11.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet they were not happy.

00:03:11.674 --> 00:03:15.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This attitude was something
he did not like at all.

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:19.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we see that serving Jehovah joyfully

00:03:19.983 --> 00:03:22.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is very important.

00:03:22.852 --> 00:03:25.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was emphasized by what Jesus taught.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in the Sermon on the Mount,

00:03:28.524 --> 00:03:31.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he helped his audience to understand

00:03:31.127 --> 00:03:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to be happy.

00:03:33.997 --> 00:03:36.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, this part in Matthew chapter 5

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is referred to as the nine happinesses.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:45.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, the apostle Paul
wrote about “the fruitage of the spirit.”

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:50.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Joy is counted among the aspects
of the fruitage of the spirit.

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being joyful is important,

00:03:54.717 --> 00:03:57.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and by means of his spirit,

00:03:57.287 --> 00:04:00.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helps us to rejoice in his service.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:05.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is it realistic to expect

00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:08.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will smile all the time

00:04:08.097 --> 00:04:11.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cheerfully sing songs the whole day?

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, this is not what Jehovah expects.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:20.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all have different personalities
and express our happiness differently.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, there are moments in life

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:27.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are sad and disappointed.

00:04:27.183 --> 00:04:32.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is fully aware
that some of us are not healthy.

00:04:32.188 --> 00:04:34.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others might fight depression

00:04:34.891 --> 00:04:39.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are therefore at times
just not able to express joy in this way.

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet he loves all of us

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and appreciates us very much.

00:04:47.603 --> 00:04:52.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what is the joy
that Jehovah expects from us?

00:04:52.608 --> 00:04:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What exactly is
this joyful spirit, or attitude?

00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here in Deuteronomy,
the term “rejoicing” means

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:07.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the inner feeling
and the outward manifestation of joy.”

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also read about the “joy of heart.”

00:05:11.894 --> 00:05:15.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The heart stands for
what we are on the inside.

00:05:15.598 --> 00:05:18.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the interior man and is displayed

00:05:18.434 --> 00:05:21.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all his various activities,

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:23.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
desires, affections, emotions, 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
passions, thoughts, and so on.

00:05:28.144 --> 00:05:32.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we see that joy comes from within us.

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:37.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, does the joy we are talking about

00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:40.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depend on circumstances?

00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:46.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s illustrate: I think it’s safe to say
that we all like sunshine.

00:05:46.596 --> 00:05:49.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, how does the farmer feel

00:05:49.632 --> 00:05:52.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he urgently needs it to rain

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he’s waiting and waiting?

00:05:56.672 --> 00:06:01.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He probably would be happier if he had rain.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:05.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In these last days, we rarely, if ever,

00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:08.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have perfect circumstances with no problems.

00:06:08.651 --> 00:06:12.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I think we can all agree
that our joy in Jehovah’s service

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:16.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not based on circumstances.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:20.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’ve had here
on this program and in our publications

00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many examples of ones
who have maintained their joy

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:27.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s service
despite challenging circumstances,

00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like poor health or opposition.

00:06:32.642 --> 00:06:37.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what is it
that makes us a happy person?

00:06:39.015 --> 00:06:42.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To help us to open up
the scope of the answer,

00:06:42.085 --> 00:06:44.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you be willing to join me
for a little experiment?

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:49.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please close your eyes for a moment.

00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:52.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you have your eyes closed?

00:06:52.128 --> 00:06:56.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now think about an apple.

00:06:56.732 --> 00:07:00.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you can open your eyes again.

00:07:00.036 --> 00:07:02.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me ask you a question:

00:07:02.805 --> 00:07:06.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you think about a red apple,

00:07:06.943 --> 00:07:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a green apple,

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:12.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a yellow apple?

00:07:12.482 --> 00:07:14.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you able to answer this question?

00:07:14.484 --> 00:07:18.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I asked you to do
was to think about an apple.

00:07:19.856 --> 00:07:23.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer is, we think in pictures.

00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we think
of countless pictures every day.

00:07:28.264 --> 00:07:30.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after we think about it,

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:34.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like we put
all of the pictures in a stack.

00:07:34.937 --> 00:07:37.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then when we think
the same thought a second time,

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s like we pull the picture out from below

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:43.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put it on top of the stack.

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The longer that we do not think the thought,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the deeper the picture gets in the stack

00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:53.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it becomes more difficult to remember.

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this stack of pictures
representing our thoughts

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:01.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our subconscious.

00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:04.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This stack of pictures makes up

00:08:04.433 --> 00:08:07.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our emotional state, or state of mind.

00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:12.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It determines whether we are sad or happy,

00:08:12.842 --> 00:08:16.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether we are bored
or excited, and so forth.

00:08:19.148 --> 00:08:23.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah our Creator
is aware of this powerful connection

00:08:23.819 --> 00:08:27.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between our thoughts  and pictures.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:30.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s please turn to 2 Kings chapter 6

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find one example
of how Jehovah made use of this.

00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:40.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we find the report
about the king of Syria

00:08:40.036 --> 00:08:43.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wanted to capture Elisha.

00:08:43.639 --> 00:08:47.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did his attendant feel?

00:08:47.043 --> 00:08:51.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see at 2 Kings chapter 6,
beginning with verse 15:

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the attendant of the man

00:08:55.218 --> 00:08:59.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of the true God rose early and went outside,

00:08:59.188 --> 00:09:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw that an army with horses
and war chariots was surrounding the city.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“At once the attendant said to him:

00:09:06.896 --> 00:09:08.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Alas, my master!

00:09:08.497 --> 00:09:10.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are we to do?’”

00:09:10.499 --> 00:09:13.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The attendant was in fear.

00:09:13.035 --> 00:09:16.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He probably thought
about their defenseless position

00:09:16.205 --> 00:09:20.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and saw himself
already captured by the Syrian army.

00:09:20.409 --> 00:09:24.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would Elisha be able to help his attendant?

00:09:24.213 --> 00:09:26.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 16:

00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:31.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But he [Elisha] said: ‘Do not be afraid!

00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:35.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For there are more who are with us
than those who are with them.’”

00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:40.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, Elisha said:
‘Think of something else.

00:09:40.496 --> 00:09:43.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the many that are with us.’

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did this work?

00:09:45.868 --> 00:09:50.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seems that the attendant was not able
to focus on these reassuring thoughts.

00:09:50.873 --> 00:09:55.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could not envision Jehovah rescuing them.

00:09:55.311 --> 00:09:58.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did Jehovah help the attendant?

00:09:58.814 --> 00:10:02.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Kings 6:17, we read:

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:07.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Elisha began to pray and say:

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:12.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘O Jehovah, open his eyes,
please, that he may see.’

00:10:12.595 --> 00:10:16.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Immediately Jehovah
opened the attendant’s eyes and he saw,

00:10:16.899 --> 00:10:19.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and look! the mountainous region

00:10:19.435 --> 00:10:22.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“was full of horses and war chariots of fire

00:10:22.772 --> 00:10:25.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all around Elisha.”

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:29.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped the attendant with pictures.

00:10:29.478 --> 00:10:32.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The horses and chariots
captured his attention.

00:10:32.715 --> 00:10:34.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His thoughts now focused on the fact

00:10:34.817 --> 00:10:39.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah
was with them and in full control.

00:10:39.455 --> 00:10:43.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in his mind,
he already saw Jehovah’s victory,

00:10:43.693 --> 00:10:47.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was not concerned anymore.

00:10:47.163 --> 00:10:49.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was happy.

00:10:49.665 --> 00:10:53.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he saw influenced his thoughts

00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:55.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and changed his state of mind.

00:10:55.938 --> 00:10:59.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thoughts are so powerful!

00:10:59.442 --> 00:11:01.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how considerate Jehovah is!

00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, in the end,
Jehovah did not need

00:11:04.714 --> 00:11:06.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any of these horses and chariots.

00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:09.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He saved Elisha and his attendant

00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:12.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by striking the Syrian army with blindness.

00:11:14.857 --> 00:11:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we compare the emotions of Elisha

00:11:18.194 --> 00:11:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his attendant, what made the difference?

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The circumstances were exactly the same.

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:28.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their thoughts made the difference.

00:11:28.637 --> 00:11:33.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what
does this have to do with our subject

00:11:33.008 --> 00:11:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Serve Jehovah With Rejoicing”?

00:11:36.412 --> 00:11:41.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So far, we have established
that Jehovah expects us to be happy, right?

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have seen that our thoughts

00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:46.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be pictures that influence

00:11:46.021 --> 00:11:49.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who we are and how we feel.

00:11:49.258 --> 00:11:52.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pictures and thoughts are closely connected.

00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:56.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why the apostle Paul at Romans 12:2

00:11:56.198 --> 00:11:59.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
highlights the importance
of our thoughts when he says:

00:11:59.435 --> 00:12:03.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be transformed by making your mind over,”

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:08.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or at Ephesians 4:23,
he emphasizes this by saying:

00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:10.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you should continue to be made new

00:12:10.746 --> 00:12:15.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your dominant mental attitude.”

00:12:15.084 --> 00:12:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both scriptures highlight that our thoughts

00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:22.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are critical and have a bearing
on our whole being.

00:12:22.425 --> 00:12:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additionally, the apostle Paul knew
that we can change our thinking.

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn with me
to 2 Corinthians chapter 10,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:35.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see what he recommends that we do.

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:39.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here at 2 Corinthians 10:5, he says:

00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:43.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are bringing every thought into captivity

00:12:43.112 --> 00:12:46.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it obedient to the Christ.”

00:12:46.582 --> 00:12:49.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t this exactly what we should do?

00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:52.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We control what we think.

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:56.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We avoid occupying our mind
with thoughts that weaken our faith

00:12:56.659 --> 00:13:01.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or thoughts that undermine
our determination to serve Jehovah.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, we said that thoughts

00:13:03.966 --> 00:13:07.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are like pictures that stay within us.

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:12.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot delete them,
and they will have an effect on how we feel.

00:13:14.276 --> 00:13:16.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is there something else we can do?

00:13:16.946 --> 00:13:20.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you ready for a second experiment?

00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please close your eyes again,

00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and do not think of an apple.

00:13:26.956 --> 00:13:29.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can open your eyes again.

00:13:29.925 --> 00:13:33.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were you successful
in not thinking of an apple?

00:13:33.996 --> 00:13:39.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, you probably had to force yourself
to think of something else.

00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:42.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are made to think.

00:13:42.204 --> 00:13:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the key to serving Jehovah with rejoicing

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:49.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lies not just in avoiding negative thoughts

00:13:49.512 --> 00:13:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also in thinking healthy thoughts.

00:13:53.115 --> 00:13:57.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians chapter 4 lists a few of them.

00:13:57.319 --> 00:14:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read in verse 8:

00:14:00.623 --> 00:14:04.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, brothers, whatever things are true,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are of serious concern,

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:09.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are righteous,

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are chaste,
whatever things are lovable,

00:14:14.303 --> 00:14:18.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are well-spoken-of,
whatever things are virtuous,

00:14:18.807 --> 00:14:21.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and whatever things are praiseworthy,

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:23.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“continue considering

00:14:23.379 --> 00:14:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[or “thinking about;
meditating on”] these things.”

00:14:29.752 --> 00:14:33.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By considering and meditating on
these healthy subjects,

00:14:33.622 --> 00:14:36.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we create pictures in our mind
that make it easier for us

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:40.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to display our joy in Jehovah’s service.

00:14:40.229 --> 00:14:44.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Serving Jehovah with rejoicing
really depends on us.

00:14:44.967 --> 00:14:48.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happiness does not depend
on our circumstances;

00:14:48.404 --> 00:14:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happiness comes
from doing things Jehovah’s way.

00:14:52.408 --> 00:14:55.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we actively control our thoughts,

00:14:55.277 --> 00:14:57.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we add more pleasant pictures.

00:14:57.813 --> 00:14:59.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even if in the past

00:14:59.915 --> 00:15:01.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve experienced things
that make it difficult

00:15:01.884 --> 00:15:03.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to express happiness,

00:15:03.586 --> 00:15:06.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in time,

00:15:06.021 --> 00:15:09.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these unpleasant pictures
will be buried under thoughts

00:15:09.024 --> 00:15:11.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like those listed in Philippians chapter 4.

00:15:11.961 --> 00:15:13.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And gradually

00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:17.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our inner peace, contentment,

00:15:17.099 --> 00:15:21.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and happiness grows
and can be seen by others.

00:15:21.437 --> 00:15:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, our happy God,

00:15:23.539 --> 00:15:26.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appreciates every little step
in this direction

00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:31.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it’s important to him
that we serve him with rejoicing.

00:15:33.315 --> 00:15:35.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our first video,

00:15:35.317 --> 00:15:39.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll learn another way
to serve Jehovah with rejoicing.

00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:41.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll recall that Jesus said:

00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There is more happiness in giving
than there is in receiving.”

00:15:46.729 --> 00:15:50.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And isn’t it true
that when we give commendation, praise,

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and words of appreciation to others,

00:15:53.002 --> 00:15:55.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we experience joy?

00:15:55.671 --> 00:15:59.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following interviews,
notice why some hesitate

00:15:59.341 --> 00:16:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to express appreciation.

00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:04.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see how they were helped by applying

00:16:04.613 --> 00:16:07.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lessons they learned from <i>The Watchtower</i>.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I work as a pioneer
and also as a commuter at Bethel.

00:16:26.368 --> 00:16:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I find this service to be very enjoyable.

00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:32.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, because of my busy schedule,

00:16:32.074 --> 00:16:35.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at times I almost forget
to express my appreciation

00:16:35.044 --> 00:16:37.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the brothers and sisters.

00:16:39.148 --> 00:16:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted to express
my appreciation to my wife,

00:16:42.818 --> 00:16:46.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I found myself
feeling bashful in doing so.

00:16:46.021 --> 00:16:49.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew something wasn’t quite natural.

00:16:50.926 --> 00:16:54.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Generally, expressing appreciation
is considered to be a virtue.

00:16:56.398 --> 00:17:01.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I realized that I needed
some sort of stronger motivation.

00:17:04.707 --> 00:17:08.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although all ten lepers
must have been grateful,

00:17:08.043 --> 00:17:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only one person returned to give thanks.

00:17:12.881 --> 00:17:17.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suddenly realized
that even if I feel appreciative,

00:17:17.419 --> 00:17:19.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might fail to express it.

00:17:21.623 --> 00:17:24.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Esau was an impatient man.

00:17:24.526 --> 00:17:27.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In contrast, David thought deeply

00:17:27.596 --> 00:17:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how wonderful pure worship is.

00:17:32.334 --> 00:17:36.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to realize
that it is important to think deeply.

00:17:38.507 --> 00:17:43.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One sister was visiting
a very sick sister almost every day

00:17:43.512 --> 00:17:47.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help her with shopping
and was looking after her very tenderly.

00:17:50.219 --> 00:17:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I thought carefully

00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:56.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about why she was doing so much
and how she felt,

00:17:56.158 --> 00:17:59.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt deep appreciation well up in me.

00:18:03.265 --> 00:18:06.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah richly rewards us.

00:18:06.301 --> 00:18:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah desires
to express his appreciation,

00:18:10.873 --> 00:18:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what kind of person am I
if I don’t show it from the heart?

00:18:18.147 --> 00:18:22.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps I might be thinking to myself

00:18:22.451 --> 00:18:26.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I deserve to be appreciated,

00:18:26.155 --> 00:18:30.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since I am the one providing
for my family, aren’t I?

00:18:32.795 --> 00:18:37.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started thinking
about how Jehovah wants to reward my wife.

00:18:39.268 --> 00:18:41.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That made me want to interact with her

00:18:41.904 --> 00:18:44.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with kinder words.

00:18:44.373 --> 00:18:46.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel that the way I look at her

00:18:46.408 --> 00:18:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my facial expressions
are changing as well.

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:56.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gets easier
to resolve disagreements quickly.

00:18:57.085 --> 00:19:02.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also feel that we are growing
closer and closer as a couple.

00:19:03.325 --> 00:19:07.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By expressing appreciation,
I feel very happy.

00:19:07.729 --> 00:19:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with brothers and sisters

00:19:10.299 --> 00:19:12.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within the congregation has gotten better,

00:19:12.634 --> 00:19:15.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the bonds of friendship
between us are stronger.

00:19:16.738 --> 00:19:19.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that the reason why
Jehovah encourages us

00:19:19.842 --> 00:19:24.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to express our appreciation
to others is for our happiness.

00:19:25.113 --> 00:19:28.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That drew me even closer to Jehovah.

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:47.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Expressing appreciation
may not come easy for some.

00:19:47.903 --> 00:19:52.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we saw,
we may be busy with our spiritual routine.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we are shy.

00:19:54.142 --> 00:19:58.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may need to make a special effort
to get to know our brothers better.

00:19:58.714 --> 00:20:01.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what’s the result if we do?

00:20:01.783 --> 00:20:04.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We draw closer to them and to Jehovah

00:20:04.953 --> 00:20:08.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—and that makes us happy.

00:20:08.056 --> 00:20:12.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being part of a loving family
can bring us great joy.

00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:16.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also comes
with responsibilities as parents,

00:20:16.131 --> 00:20:18.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as children, and as siblings.

00:20:18.901 --> 00:20:20.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:20:20.936 --> 00:20:23.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll see how three siblings decide

00:20:23.805 --> 00:20:26.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to honor their elderly mother.

00:20:26.608 --> 00:20:31.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please note how vital
good communication in the family is.

00:20:51.133 --> 00:20:53.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This wasn’t the first health scare with Mum.

00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my brother and sister

00:21:00.242 --> 00:21:02.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were always quick to help out.

00:21:22.564 --> 00:21:25.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this time was different.

00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:36.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’d be here for at least another week
and then more long-term care.

00:21:41.416 --> 00:21:44.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just weren’t prepared for that.

00:21:54.496 --> 00:21:56.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I should have accepted
more help when the friends offered.

00:21:56.865 --> 00:21:59.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I just didn’t want to be a burden.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:04.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Janice understood,

00:22:04.172 --> 00:22:07.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was wondering
how this might affect her Bethel service.

00:22:09.544 --> 00:22:12.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Terrance wished he lived closer
so he could do more.

00:22:14.516 --> 00:22:18.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We decided to pray, sleep on it,

00:22:18.387 --> 00:22:20.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and regroup after doing some research.

00:22:51.486 --> 00:22:55.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I shared the example of Joseph in Genesis 45,

00:23:00.162 --> 00:23:02.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where he told his father:

00:23:04.032 --> 00:23:08.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must dwell in the land of Goshen,
where you will be near me . . .

00:23:08.804 --> 00:23:11.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will supply you with food.”

00:23:13.842 --> 00:23:18.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t let a long distance
get in his way of caring for Jacob.

00:23:22.984 --> 00:23:24.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He took practical steps

00:23:26.521 --> 00:23:28.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and made his care a priority.

00:23:36.798 --> 00:23:39.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Janice and Terrance too found great articles

00:23:39.634 --> 00:23:42.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offering solutions

00:23:42.204 --> 00:23:45.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as asking for periodic help,

00:23:53.048 --> 00:23:57.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making more time to communicate with Mum,

00:24:07.295 --> 00:24:09.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even getting a part-time nurse.

00:24:19.241 --> 00:24:23.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t prepared
for her situation to change so suddenly,

00:24:26.414 --> 00:24:29.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah is guiding us
through each new challenge.

00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:40.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with his help, we’re honoring Mum,

00:24:42.197 --> 00:24:45.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making her care our continual priority.

00:24:55.343 --> 00:24:57.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization, we saw one way

00:24:57.879 --> 00:25:01.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a family decided
to care for an aging parent.

00:25:01.283 --> 00:25:05.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, situations will differ
from one family to the next.

00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:10.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each must make a prayerful decision
based on their circumstances.

00:25:10.258 --> 00:25:12.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you and your family are seeking

00:25:12.494 --> 00:25:15.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the right way to honor your elderly parents,

00:25:15.230 --> 00:25:17.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what can help?

00:25:17.232 --> 00:25:19.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible principles

00:25:19.301 --> 00:25:23.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as we saw in the video,
open and candid communication.

00:25:23.071 --> 00:25:25.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This, coupled with respect and love,

00:25:25.941 --> 00:25:29.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help you make a good decision.

00:25:29.144 --> 00:25:32.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’ll look at the joy and challenges

00:25:32.013 --> 00:25:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that come with raising children.

00:25:34.216 --> 00:25:37.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll travel to Alaska,
in the United States,

00:25:37.152 --> 00:25:39.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to visit the Bode family.

00:25:39.554 --> 00:25:41.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see what we can learn

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:45.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the example
set by the parents, Dale and Nadja.

00:25:48.997 --> 00:25:52.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were serving in a small town in Alberta,

00:25:52.901 --> 00:25:55.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then we began having children.

00:25:55.403 --> 00:25:59.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we moved to Craig we had four children.

00:25:59.007 --> 00:26:03.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after living here,
we now have nine children.

00:26:03.411 --> 00:26:08.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You were given this trust,
and so as a parent,

00:26:08.383 --> 00:26:10.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to put the Kingdom first;

00:26:10.685 --> 00:26:14.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to set a good example;
you need to be at the meetings;

00:26:14.055 --> 00:26:16.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you need to be regular in field service.

00:26:16.891 --> 00:26:21.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really believed
that we needed to love Jehovah first

00:26:21.463 --> 00:26:24.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to be
a good example for our children.

00:26:25.967 --> 00:26:29.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They helped us see that what would make
us happy were spiritual things.

00:26:29.237 --> 00:26:32.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents, more in action than in words,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught us to seek first the Kingdom.

00:26:35.076 --> 00:26:37.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With nine kids,
it’s always going to be hectic.

00:26:37.979 --> 00:26:41.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have extra children;
you have more excuses, perhaps.

00:26:41.816 --> 00:26:46.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having nine children
is a challenge in a million ways.

00:26:52.827 --> 00:26:55.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, she had moments where she’d sit

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in her rocking chair
and just look <i>so</i><i> </i><i> </i>exhausted.

00:26:59.668 --> 00:27:03.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember one time
when it was time to go to the meeting,

00:27:03.938 --> 00:27:06.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was so exhausted.

00:27:06.007 --> 00:27:10.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought of Isaiah 40,
where Jehovah says

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:13.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “those hoping
in Jehovah will regain power.”

00:27:13.782 --> 00:27:16.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I figured that Jehovah wants me to do it.

00:27:16.351 --> 00:27:18.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s going to make me
strong enough to do this.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I prayed, and I got ready.

00:27:21.589 --> 00:27:22.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a scramble.

00:27:27.495 --> 00:27:31.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Hebrews, we see the encouragement

00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:34.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to never forsake “our meeting together.”

00:27:34.035 --> 00:27:35.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My dad always spoke of that.

00:27:35.637 --> 00:27:40.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a time
that we had to travel in the wintertime,

00:27:40.742 --> 00:27:43.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
maybe up to two hours to get to the meeting.

00:27:43.645 --> 00:27:47.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’d come back to your home late at night,

00:27:47.282 --> 00:27:51.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know, with all these kids
that are worn out—and yourself too.

00:27:51.586 --> 00:27:55.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing the importance
that they placed on the meetings,

00:27:55.957 --> 00:27:59.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was able to see
that you never take meetings for granted.

00:28:00.795 --> 00:28:04.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents always instilled in us consistency

00:28:04.632 --> 00:28:08.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in field service just like the meetings.

00:28:08.603 --> 00:28:11.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just what we did.

00:28:12.474 --> 00:28:13.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That wasn’t questioned.

00:28:13.675 --> 00:28:15.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got up on Saturday morning,

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:18.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we got ourselves
out the door and in service.

00:28:18.179 --> 00:28:22.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t simply
just be a backseat ornament.

00:28:22.517 --> 00:28:27.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that we were there to give a witness.

00:28:27.155 --> 00:28:31.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From an early age,
we were really following the example

00:28:31.659 --> 00:28:34.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our parents in showing interest in people.

00:28:34.763 --> 00:28:38.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So because of that,
we enjoyed being in the ministry.

00:28:38.032 --> 00:28:40.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It gave me a sense of purpose.

00:28:40.335 --> 00:28:42.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had people to go visit in service.

00:28:42.437 --> 00:28:46.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to know what I was going to talk
to them about and have a plan.

00:28:46.775 --> 00:28:51.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In field service, we would often take breaks

00:28:51.012 --> 00:28:53.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the sake of the children and ourselves.

00:28:53.948 --> 00:28:57.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was important to have our children

00:28:57.552 --> 00:29:00.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoy field service—not push them hard

00:29:00.955 --> 00:29:04.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be too rigid, and so forth.

00:29:04.626 --> 00:29:08.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think about Proverbs 22:6
in the Byington translation

00:29:08.963 --> 00:29:14.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says to “give a boy
the start his course requires.”

00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:18.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did that by putting the spiritual things

00:29:18.573 --> 00:29:20.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the material things.

00:29:20.809 --> 00:29:24.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped us
to be the best parents we could be.

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We failed at times, but I always knew
that Jehovah was the best Parent.

00:29:29.984 --> 00:29:34.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if we could teach them to love Him,
then he would take over.

00:29:35.957 --> 00:29:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we as a family were successful

00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we did have Jehovah in our lives.

00:29:40.762 --> 00:29:42.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All our children

00:29:42.764 --> 00:29:45.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing very well in the truth.

00:29:45.099 --> 00:29:47.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we’re very happy about that,

00:29:47.168 --> 00:29:50.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure it makes Jehovah happy.

00:29:51.306 --> 00:29:56.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may not have nine children
—or seven or five or two—

00:29:56.044 --> 00:30:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but can’t all parents learn
a valuable lesson from the Bodes?

00:30:00.849 --> 00:30:04.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A very important lesson
was mentioned by one of the daughters.

00:30:04.319 --> 00:30:08.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said,
“[Our] parents, more in action than in words,

00:30:08.823 --> 00:30:12.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taught us to seek first the Kingdom.”

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:16.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, despite the many demands
of a busy household,

00:30:16.331 --> 00:30:20.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dale and Nadja put
the spiritual needs of their family first.

00:30:20.368 --> 00:30:23.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was their example
that had a wonderful influence

00:30:23.571 --> 00:30:25.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on all of their children.

00:30:26.508 --> 00:30:30.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Next, we’ll hear from Brother Stephen Lett
of the Governing Body.

00:30:30.545 --> 00:30:34.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He spoke to the Bethel family
about an enemy of joy

00:30:34.649 --> 00:30:38.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where to find the antidote to it.

00:30:38.152 --> 00:30:40.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, my theme is

00:30:40.154 --> 00:30:44.659 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Guard Against Every Sort of Greed.”

00:30:44.659 --> 00:30:47.695 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah lovingly gave counsel

00:30:47.695 --> 00:30:50.698 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to Jeremiah’s secretary, Baruch,

00:30:50.698 --> 00:30:54.702 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to stop “seeking great things” for himself.

00:30:54.702 --> 00:30:56.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what were those great things?

00:30:56.704 --> 00:30:58.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we don’t know for sure,

00:30:58.706 --> 00:31:03.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps prominence
or material things or both.

00:31:03.444 --> 00:31:07.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what bad quality was developing

00:31:07.448 --> 00:31:10.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Baruch’s heart that Jehovah saw?

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:12.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greed.

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Insight book defines greed

00:31:15.089 --> 00:31:20.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as “inordinate or rapacious desire.”

00:31:20.028 --> 00:31:23.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The dictionary says it’s “a selfish, . . .

00:31:23.097 --> 00:31:25.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“excessive desire for more of something

00:31:25.867 --> 00:31:28.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(such as money) than is needed.”

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:31.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, in effect, Jehovah was telling Baruch,

00:31:31.105 --> 00:31:33.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Stop being greedy.’

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:35.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in an extended application,

00:31:35.543 --> 00:31:38.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah tells us the same thing.

00:31:38.046 --> 00:31:41.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, echoing Jehovah’s counsel to Baruch

00:31:41.916 --> 00:31:44.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is what Jesus tells us.

00:31:44.652 --> 00:31:47.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ll open up to Luke chapter 12,

00:31:47.455 --> 00:31:49.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s read our theme scripture here.

00:31:49.624 --> 00:31:51.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 12:15

00:31:51.993 --> 00:31:54.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—similar counsel from Jesus—

00:31:54.829 --> 00:31:57.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Luke 12:15:

00:31:57.265 --> 00:32:01.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he [that is Jesus] said to them:

00:32:01.102 --> 00:32:05.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Keep your eyes open and guard [now notice]

00:32:05.473 --> 00:32:08.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘against every sort of greed,

00:32:08.977 --> 00:32:12.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because even
when a person has an abundance,

00:32:12.246 --> 00:32:14.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘his life does not result

00:32:14.716 --> 00:32:17.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the things he possesses.’”

00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:20.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what makes it a challenge, though,

00:32:20.888 --> 00:32:24.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to “guard against
every sort of greed,” as Jesus counseled?

00:32:24.759 --> 00:32:26.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, our three great enemies.

00:32:26.928 --> 00:32:29.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let’s discuss each of these

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how it makes it a challenge.

00:32:31.132 --> 00:32:33.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, first, our imperfect flesh.

00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:36.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Genesis 8:21, Jehovah said:

00:32:36.104 --> 00:32:38.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The inclination of the heart of man

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:41.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is bad from his youth up.”

00:32:41.609 --> 00:32:44.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one form of badness is greed.

00:32:44.812 --> 00:32:49.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This tendency toward greed
becomes manifest very early.

00:32:49.217 --> 00:32:51.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, we see little toddlers

00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:55.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grab things and hold them tightly.

00:32:55.089 --> 00:32:59.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mine, mine, mine.”

00:32:59.427 --> 00:33:02.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That greed is starting to manifest, isn’t it?

00:33:02.263 --> 00:33:04.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people look at a little toddler,

00:33:04.599 --> 00:33:07.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they may say,
“What a cute little boy,”

00:33:07.835 --> 00:33:12.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “He has his mother’s eyes
and his father’s nose.”

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they never invariably say:

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:18.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look at that little toddler.

00:33:18.012 --> 00:33:21.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an unselfish little toddler!”

00:33:21.215 --> 00:33:23.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, it takes a lot of effort
—doesn’t it?—

00:33:23.551 --> 00:33:27.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to teach that little one
to be unselfish like Jehovah.

00:33:27.622 --> 00:33:30.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what about our
second great enemy, Satan?

00:33:30.758 --> 00:33:32.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was Satan’s downfall?

00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was greed.

00:33:34.962 --> 00:33:37.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He allowed a greedy desire for something 

00:33:37.398 --> 00:33:41.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that belonged
to Jehovah alone to develop in his heart.

00:33:41.402 --> 00:33:43.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what was that greed for?

00:33:43.438 --> 00:33:45.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Worship.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:49.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wants his downfall to be our downfall.

00:33:49.844 --> 00:33:52.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants to ensnare us in greed.

00:33:52.513 --> 00:33:55.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he tries to magnify, intensify,

00:33:55.316 --> 00:33:58.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our wrong tendency to be greedy.

00:33:58.152 --> 00:34:01.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you think about it, how was Satan

00:34:01.355 --> 00:34:04.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
able to entrap the perfect woman, Eve?

00:34:04.659 --> 00:34:07.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He entrapped her in greed.

00:34:07.128 --> 00:34:10.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He got her to crave, desire,

00:34:10.031 --> 00:34:13.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what belonged to God alone.

00:34:13.434 --> 00:34:15.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, he said to her:

00:34:15.536 --> 00:34:20.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Eating of all the trees
of the garden minus one tree

00:34:20.541 --> 00:34:22.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘is not good enough.

00:34:22.610 --> 00:34:24.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You should crave that one tree

00:34:24.979 --> 00:34:27.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has not been given to you.’

00:34:27.181 --> 00:34:29.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, let me, please, illustrate

00:34:29.617 --> 00:34:34.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how greedy Satan made Adam and Eve

00:34:34.388 --> 00:34:36.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how greedy they were.

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:39.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like for you to imagine
that you have guests staying in your home,

00:34:39.894 --> 00:34:41.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you say, “Now, I really want you

00:34:41.896 --> 00:34:44.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make yourselves
at home while you’re here.”

00:34:44.165 --> 00:34:46.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You take them into the kitchen;

00:34:46.567 --> 00:34:48.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you open the refrigerator and say:

00:34:48.569 --> 00:34:50.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There are all kinds of food here

00:34:50.571 --> 00:34:52.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the cabinets
—the pantry—

00:34:52.607 --> 00:34:55.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“everything you could imagine
that you would want to eat.

00:34:55.843 --> 00:34:57.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s yours.
Help yourself.

00:34:57.845 --> 00:34:59.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t even ask.”

00:34:59.614 --> 00:35:03.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then you pull out
one little drawer, and you say:

00:35:03.851 --> 00:35:07.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now, I’ve set aside
some items for a later occasion.

00:35:07.922 --> 00:35:09.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please, this is very important.

00:35:09.924 --> 00:35:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not eat from this one drawer.

00:35:11.926 --> 00:35:13.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But you’ll find other items just like

00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:16.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in this drawer
in the pantry and the cabinets.

00:35:16.063 --> 00:35:18.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll have everything you need.”

00:35:18.065 --> 00:35:20.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, would that be overly restrictive?

00:35:20.835 --> 00:35:23.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would that be
an unloving arrangement with your guests?

00:35:23.871 --> 00:35:26.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’d be very generous, wouldn’t it?

00:35:26.007 --> 00:35:29.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in effect, that’s the arrangement
Jehovah made with Adam and Eve.

00:35:29.644 --> 00:35:32.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, back to the illustration:
If you came into the kitchen

00:35:32.914 --> 00:35:35.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you found your guests eating

00:35:35.716 --> 00:35:39.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of that one drawer
that you had not given them,

00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d be very upset, wouldn’t you?

00:35:41.689 --> 00:35:44.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’d probably view it as stealing,

00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:47.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you likely would put
the thieves out of your house.

00:35:47.662 --> 00:35:52.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that illustrates
how Jehovah felt and how Jehovah reacted.

00:35:52.033 --> 00:35:54.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what a protection being content

00:35:54.902 --> 00:35:59.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what was rightfully hers
would have been to Eve!

00:35:59.073 --> 00:36:03.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, what about
our third great enemy—the world?

00:36:03.411 --> 00:36:07.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are relentlessly surrounded

00:36:07.815 --> 00:36:12.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Satan’s world and his spirit,
called “the spirit of the world.”

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:16.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could say
that Jehovah breathes holy spirit

00:36:16.257 --> 00:36:20.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to influence his people
to act like him and to be unselfish.

00:36:20.361 --> 00:36:24.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Satan, in effect, exhales

00:36:24.131 --> 00:36:27.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stinky spirit of the world

00:36:27.702 --> 00:36:32.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that makes people
act like him in being greedy.

00:36:32.173 --> 00:36:36.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one way Satan’s world
promotes greed for material things

00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:40.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is by relentless advertising.

00:36:40.781 --> 00:36:44.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People are constantly bombarded
with advertisements.

00:36:44.752 --> 00:36:46.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, here’s just an example:

00:36:46.787 --> 00:36:50.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They may bring out a shiny, new car;

00:36:50.858 --> 00:36:53.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it has about 12 coats of wax on it.

00:36:53.694 --> 00:36:56.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have all these spotlights shining on it.

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:59.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They bring in a camera
from all different angles

00:36:59.567 --> 00:37:02.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, about this time,
a scantily clothed woman

00:37:02.803 --> 00:37:05.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comes strolling out to that automobile.

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:07.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you don’t even notice it, but there’s

00:37:07.041 --> 00:37:09.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soft music playing in the background.

00:37:09.577 --> 00:37:12.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As she opens the door and gets in,

00:37:12.113 --> 00:37:16.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a crescendo is reached
in the background music.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:18.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re made to feel like,

00:37:18.686 --> 00:37:22.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You poor, poor loser

00:37:22.056 --> 00:37:25.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you don’t have that car.’

00:37:25.159 --> 00:37:27.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t talk about the heavy payments
you’re going to have to make

00:37:27.728 --> 00:37:30.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or how many meetings you’re going to have
to miss to make those payments.

00:37:30.631 --> 00:37:34.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You poor loser if you don’t have that car.’

00:37:34.602 --> 00:37:39.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And similar advertising methods
are used very often

00:37:39.607 --> 00:37:43.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in promoting
many other gadgets and material things.

00:37:43.945 --> 00:37:47.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, obviously, we have to fight hard
against the spirit of the world

00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:49.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we don’t allow it

00:37:49.450 --> 00:37:53.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to nurture greed in our hearts.

00:37:53.254 --> 00:37:56.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, if we’re not careful,
our love for Jehovah

00:37:56.624 --> 00:37:58.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be squeezed out

00:37:58.626 --> 00:38:01.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by love for money
and love for material things.

00:38:01.429 --> 00:38:03.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if this happens,

00:38:03.431 --> 00:38:06.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than
conquering the world as Jesus did,

00:38:06.701 --> 00:38:10.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the world will have conquered us.

00:38:10.471 --> 00:38:14.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, it admittedly is a great challenge

00:38:14.308 --> 00:38:17.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fight these three great enemies and avoid,

00:38:17.712 --> 00:38:20.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus counseled, “every sort of greed.”

00:38:20.915 --> 00:38:24.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, think of that—Jesus indicated

00:38:24.185 --> 00:38:27.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s not just one sort
of greed, one kind of greed.

00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:31.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Greed can take on
various faces, or manifestations,

00:38:31.025 --> 00:38:33.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we’re to guard against all of them.

00:38:33.027 --> 00:38:35.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you say is the antidote

00:38:35.763 --> 00:38:40.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can immunize us
against the poison of greed?

00:38:40.101 --> 00:38:43.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, is it not contentment?

00:38:43.304 --> 00:38:47.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
one sort of greed we talked about,

00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:49.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greed for material things

00:38:49.210 --> 00:38:52.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—well, contentment will immunize us

00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:55.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against this terrible form of greed.

00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:00.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re familiar with 1 Timothy 6:8:

00:39:00.955 --> 00:39:03.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, having food and clothing,

00:39:03.958 --> 00:39:06.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and the footnote adds “shelter.”]

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:10.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will be content with these things.”

00:39:10.398 --> 00:39:12.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So contentment really protects us.

00:39:12.533 --> 00:39:15.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, in effect,
that’s what Jehovah was telling Baruch;

00:39:15.036 --> 00:39:18.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was telling him:
‘You have what you need.

00:39:18.039 --> 00:39:21.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Stop storing up great things,
or seeking great things.

00:39:21.909 --> 00:39:25.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be content with what you have
and do more important things.’

00:39:25.846 --> 00:39:29.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then he gave a powerful reason
why Baruch should do this.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:32.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told him at Jeremiah 45:5:

00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For I am about to bring
a calamity on all flesh,”

00:39:37.091 --> 00:39:39.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so if “you get the mastery over” this,

00:39:39.660 --> 00:39:44.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will grant you your life as a spoil.”

00:39:44.031 --> 00:39:47.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the same applies to us, doesn’t it?

00:39:47.435 --> 00:39:51.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is soon going to bring
a calamity on all flesh,

00:39:51.472 --> 00:39:54.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so we need to be content
with what we really need

00:39:54.041 --> 00:39:56.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and ‘seek first the Kingdom.’

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just ‘temporary residents,’ aren’t we?

00:39:58.879 --> 00:40:01.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what 1 Peter 1:17 says.

00:40:01.449 --> 00:40:05.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here’s an illustration
about a temporary resident.

00:40:05.119 --> 00:40:07.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like you to imagine

00:40:07.121 --> 00:40:10.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we rent a venue
for our regional convention.

00:40:10.691 --> 00:40:12.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you may do a few things

00:40:12.693 --> 00:40:16.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make the stay
more comfortable in that venue.

00:40:16.597 --> 00:40:19.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, you may do thorough cleaning;

00:40:19.667 --> 00:40:22.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might do some touch-up painting;

00:40:22.103 --> 00:40:25.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might repair
some broken toilets or light fixtures.

00:40:25.773 --> 00:40:30.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you would never paint and plaster
the entire stadium inside and out.

00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:34.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wouldn’t rip up the seats
and put all new seating in.

00:40:34.582 --> 00:40:38.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You wouldn’t tear out
the parking lot and put in a new parking lot

00:40:38.652 --> 00:40:41.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you know
you’re just a temporary resident.

00:40:41.355 --> 00:40:44.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re going to vacate
that place after the weekend.

00:40:44.024 --> 00:40:48.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, unlike the illustration, we don’t know
exactly when we’re going to vacate,

00:40:48.429 --> 00:40:49.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we know it’s soon.

00:40:49.964 --> 00:40:51.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we keep it simple.

00:40:51.465 --> 00:40:53.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re just temporary residents.

00:40:53.834 --> 00:40:56.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sort of greed
is greed for prominence.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But being content

00:40:58.772 --> 00:41:02.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with how generous Jehovah
has been in giving us so many privileges

00:41:02.443 --> 00:41:04.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will protect us from this greed.

00:41:04.445 --> 00:41:07.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would’ve protected Korah in Moses’ time.

00:41:07.948 --> 00:41:11.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another sort of greed
is greedy sexual desire.

00:41:11.519 --> 00:41:13.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re single or married,

00:41:13.521 --> 00:41:18.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being content
with what rightfully belongs to us

00:41:18.325 --> 00:41:20.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will really be a protection.

00:41:20.628 --> 00:41:25.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would have protected David
from his sin with Bath-sheba.

00:41:25.633 --> 00:41:30.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or there are other sorts of greed,
such as gluttony and drunkenness.

00:41:30.638 --> 00:41:35.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the antidote
for all of these is contentment

00:41:35.576 --> 00:41:38.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—contentment with what is rightfully ours

00:41:38.546 --> 00:41:40.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has given to us.

00:41:40.681 --> 00:41:44.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we are successful
in guarding against every sort of greed,

00:41:44.985 --> 00:41:49.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we’ll be on hand
to enjoy the marvelous time

00:41:49.523 --> 00:41:52.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah will open his hand

00:41:52.326 --> 00:41:57.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and satisfy every proper
“desire of every living thing.”

00:41:58.432 --> 00:42:02.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Full-time service
is a special way to serve Jehovah

00:42:02.136 --> 00:42:04.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a joyful heart.

00:42:04.138 --> 00:42:09.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what happens to your joy
when you suddenly face a serious trial?

00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:12.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jay and Elaine Humer,
you have been through this.

00:42:12.479 --> 00:42:14.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for being here today

00:42:14.481 --> 00:42:18.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to share your personal experience with us.

00:42:18.185 --> 00:42:21.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve enjoyed
full-time service for over 40 years,

00:42:21.922 --> 00:42:24.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many of those years in the traveling work.

00:42:24.625 --> 00:42:27.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we’ve had
the wonderful privilege of both pioneering

00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:30.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serving
in the traveling work for 30 years now.

00:42:30.764 --> 00:42:35.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we really feel that Jehovah has been
very kind to allow us to serve him this way.

00:42:35.703 --> 00:42:39.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember
when I first filled out my application

00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:41.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for regular pioneering back in 1972,

00:42:41.475 --> 00:42:45.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I thought this was my gift
to Jehovah—my sacrifice.

00:42:45.145 --> 00:42:47.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after the many years

00:42:47.147 --> 00:42:49.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the blessings and the privileges

00:42:49.617 --> 00:42:53.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah helped us
through some very difficult times,

00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:57.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what I thought was my gift to Jehovah
turned out to be his gift to me.

00:42:58.158 --> 00:42:59.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is very encouraging.
Thank you.

00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:02.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you mentioned “difficult times.”

00:43:02.429 --> 00:43:04.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there anything
in particular you can think of?

00:43:05.332 --> 00:43:08.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the hardest things
that we faced was about 20 years ago

00:43:08.435 --> 00:43:12.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we experienced
seven deaths in just a six-month period.

00:43:12.573 --> 00:43:17.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really was difficult because five
of those seven were family members.

00:43:17.244 --> 00:43:19.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jay’s father died,

00:43:19.246 --> 00:43:23.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my aunt Alma (who brought me
into the truth) died, and my father died.

00:43:23.117 --> 00:43:27.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it just seemed
like one layer on top of another.

00:43:27.388 --> 00:43:30.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can hardly imagine how you must have felt.

00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:33.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after such a Job-like experience,

00:43:33.427 --> 00:43:36.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what did you do in order
to regain your joy and happiness?

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:38.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it didn’t occur automatically.

00:43:38.966 --> 00:43:43.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We kept focused, of course,
on serving the friends

00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:45.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and working with them,
and that kept our thoughts

00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:47.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from constantly circling around our losses.

00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:49.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also thought about the resurrection.

00:43:49.476 --> 00:43:51.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We focused on the resurrection hope

00:43:51.679 --> 00:43:54.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, as we did,
it became like “the helmet of salvation,”

00:43:54.548 --> 00:43:59.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protecting our hearts and our thoughts
from the grief that we were going through.

00:43:59.286 --> 00:44:01.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, of course,
we shared our hope with others,

00:44:01.555 --> 00:44:05.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helped us to have it more
deeply engraved on our own hearts as well.

00:44:06.193 --> 00:44:06.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:11.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now, may we learn
from you what you did in practical terms?

00:44:11.598 --> 00:44:16.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The most difficult of all
was about four years after that

00:44:16.070 --> 00:44:18.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when our beloved nephew Christopher

00:44:18.105 --> 00:44:21.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was killed
in an auto accident at the age of 17.

00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:25.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and his parents
had lived with us in the same house

00:44:25.312 --> 00:44:27.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a number of years
before we went on the road.

00:44:27.348 --> 00:44:29.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we always looked
at Christopher like the son

00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:31.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we would never
have on this side of Armageddon.

00:44:31.985 --> 00:44:35.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So his death was particularly tragic.

00:44:35.522 --> 00:44:40.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was excruciating for all of our
family members, especially his parents.

00:44:40.027 --> 00:44:42.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christopher was on his way
to the Kingdom Hall

00:44:42.996 --> 00:44:46.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet his papa
and his grandmother for field service,

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his car hit a patch of ice
and slid into an oncoming car.

00:44:51.271 --> 00:44:53.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He died instantly.

00:44:53.273 --> 00:44:55.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was so difficult for us.

00:44:55.542 --> 00:44:59.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hearts were broken,
and our spirits were nearly crushed.

00:44:59.646 --> 00:45:01.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It actually rendered me speechless,

00:45:01.882 --> 00:45:06.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even to beg for the “groanings
unuttered” became very difficult.

00:45:06.019 --> 00:45:09.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t speak to Jehovah for three days,

00:45:09.323 --> 00:45:11.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was listening.

00:45:11.992 --> 00:45:14.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you mean by “listening”?

00:45:14.027 --> 00:45:17.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember when we were
all together as a family,

00:45:17.064 --> 00:45:21.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my sister just happened to say
that Christopher had been cremated.

00:45:21.668 --> 00:45:24.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were there
making arrangements for the funeral,

00:45:24.571 --> 00:45:27.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it just hit me so hard.

00:45:27.474 --> 00:45:30.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just—it just hit hard enough

00:45:30.544 --> 00:45:33.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I fell down, and I just cried.

00:45:33.847 --> 00:45:36.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I laid there on the floor, and I thought,

00:45:36.683 --> 00:45:39.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps, maybe Mary
felt this way when she said:

00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:44.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Lord, if you’d only been here
this wouldn’t have happened.’

00:45:44.358 --> 00:45:47.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as I laid there,
I could hear my sister say:

00:45:47.127 --> 00:45:48.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go get her Bible.

00:45:48.629 --> 00:45:50.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read her her favorite scripture.”

00:45:50.631 --> 00:45:51.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so Jay did.

00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:56.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He turned to Psalm 91,
a psalm that I had already memorized,

00:45:56.503 --> 00:45:59.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now I began to hear Jehovah’s voice.

00:45:59.873 --> 00:46:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So was this listening
to Jehovah a onetime occurrence?

00:46:04.878 --> 00:46:06.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, by no means.

00:46:06.580 --> 00:46:08.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really had to now do my research.

00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:12.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I searched
for every article on the resurrection,

00:46:12.085 --> 00:46:14.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I searched for every scripture on comfort,

00:46:14.488 --> 00:46:19.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I meditated on the artwork
—the pictures in the publications.

00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:23.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember one particular scripture
that really touched my heart.

00:46:23.397 --> 00:46:26.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was from Psalm 56:8.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:30.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there it said:
“You keep track of my wandering.

00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:33.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do collect my tears in your skin bottle.

00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:36.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they not recorded in your book?”

00:46:36.443 --> 00:46:40.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought about Jehovah
taking such notice of us

00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:44.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—keeping track, watching over,
even collecting every tear

00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:46.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and recording each of them.

00:46:46.453 --> 00:46:49.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That truly made me draw close to Jehovah.

00:46:50.924 --> 00:46:54.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you continued to listen to Jehovah

00:46:54.061 --> 00:46:56.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by looking at comforting material
from the publications.

00:46:56.797 --> 00:47:00.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was there any
specific article you thought of?

00:47:00.601 --> 00:47:02.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was an article.

00:47:02.269 --> 00:47:04.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was about a delicate flower

00:47:04.438 --> 00:47:07.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that had been bent over after a rainstorm

00:47:07.774 --> 00:47:12.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the kind of cloudburst that would
send humans and animals running for shelter,

00:47:12.179 --> 00:47:14.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but not this flower.

00:47:14.181 --> 00:47:16.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it was intact,

00:47:16.316 --> 00:47:19.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bent over but unbroken and still rooted.

00:47:19.887 --> 00:47:22.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought about us in that same way.

00:47:22.422 --> 00:47:27.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article said that we can no more
avoid losing a loved one

00:47:27.094 --> 00:47:30.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than this flower could
uproot itself and run for cover.

00:47:30.864 --> 00:47:32.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had to endure.

00:47:32.866 --> 00:47:36.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the article spoke
a great deal about hope and about faith.

00:47:36.436 --> 00:47:41.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is our anchor, and hope
is our preserver of our spirituality.

00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:46.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And faith
—James 1:3 stated there that faith—

00:47:46.346 --> 00:47:50.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it succeeds, we’re able to endure.

00:47:50.250 --> 00:47:52.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that’s exactly what happened.

00:47:52.519 --> 00:47:54.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It softened the grief.

00:47:54.054 --> 00:47:58.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so like this flower,
we too would stand up and smile one day.

00:47:58.292 --> 00:47:59.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we did.

00:47:59.326 --> 00:48:03.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember the first time I smiled inside,
and I thought,

00:48:03.163 --> 00:48:06.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Oh, Jehovah,
you truly are a healer of hearts.’

00:48:07.701 --> 00:48:09.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So did you do something else?

00:48:09.836 --> 00:48:14.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I started looking
for some of the artwork in the publications.

00:48:14.374 --> 00:48:18.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one particular picture
I found was of a shepherd

00:48:18.779 --> 00:48:22.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had gone into
a bramble bush and rescued a lamb.

00:48:22.015 --> 00:48:23.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was lost.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:27.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He pulled him out, threw him
over his shoulders, and held onto him.

00:48:27.254 --> 00:48:31.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought, ‘What a safe place to be
—such security!’

00:48:31.825 --> 00:48:33.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to take the picture

00:48:33.894 --> 00:48:37.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to print it out
and just enlarge it a little bit.

00:48:37.397 --> 00:48:41.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what I didn’t see
on the publication page,

00:48:41.301 --> 00:48:46.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw when I enlarged it, and there
were scratches on the shepherd’s face.

00:48:46.306 --> 00:48:48.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I thought about what
that shepherd had gone through

00:48:48.809 --> 00:48:51.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go in the bramble bush and pull him out.

00:48:51.378 --> 00:48:54.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, I thought about Jehovah
as our Great Shepherd

00:48:54.881 --> 00:48:58.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the lengths that he
went through to rescue us,

00:48:58.952 --> 00:49:01.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even at the cost of pain for himself.

00:49:01.588 --> 00:49:05.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I was listening and drawing close,
back to Jehovah.

00:49:05.592 --> 00:49:10.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, then, what did you do
with these articles and the pictures?

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:12.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now I decided to print them all out

00:49:12.733 --> 00:49:17.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the articles, the pictures,
and the scriptures—

00:49:17.237 --> 00:49:20.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I displayed them
on my desk for quite some time.

00:49:20.173 --> 00:49:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then I put them
in a big envelope (or like a file),

00:49:23.210 --> 00:49:27.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I thought that was
Jehovah’s sympathy card to me.

00:49:28.048 --> 00:49:32.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that we had to do something
so as not to be swept away by our grief.

00:49:32.386 --> 00:49:36.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been said that grief is an arduous
journey, but one that we cannot avoid.

00:49:36.823 --> 00:49:40.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a place where we live
but a passage, as it were.

00:49:40.394 --> 00:49:44.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that even though grief
never goes away, it does change over time.

00:49:44.498 --> 00:49:47.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s because Jehovah
made our hearts to heal.

00:49:47.434 --> 00:49:49.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, in time, that’s what we did.

00:49:49.436 --> 00:49:50.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we sure did.

00:49:50.837 --> 00:49:54.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not about the lack of faith;
it’s simply the price of love.

00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:57.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved Christopher, and we miss him.

00:49:57.644 --> 00:49:59.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t like we were leaving him behind.

00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:02.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes that’s how you feel
when you lose a loved one.

00:50:02.816 --> 00:50:06.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in reality, we know
that Christopher is in Jehovah’s memory.

00:50:06.219 --> 00:50:09.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as the righteous God,
Jehovah never forgets his loyal ones.

00:50:09.556 --> 00:50:11.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christopher was one of them.

00:50:11.558 --> 00:50:14.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’re confident
that we’re going to see him again.

00:50:14.895 --> 00:50:17.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that’s what
helps us not to be, as it were,

00:50:17.097 --> 00:50:19.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always looking in the rearview mirror

00:50:19.132 --> 00:50:23.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but looking ahead to the time
when we will be with him in Paradise.

00:50:24.337 --> 00:50:29.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, Jehovah truly kept his promises,
and he carried us through that storm.

00:50:29.342 --> 00:50:33.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gathered up the pieces
of our broken hearts and sealed them.

00:50:33.246 --> 00:50:36.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though this happened 17 years ago,

00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:39.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sure, we still have cracks in our hearts.

00:50:39.352 --> 00:50:43.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we know for a certainty
that those one day will disappear as well

00:50:43.323 --> 00:50:46.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Paradise
when we welcome him back home.

00:50:46.259 --> 00:50:50.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, Jehovah
truly proved to be my stronghold,

00:50:50.964 --> 00:50:54.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my Father, and my Friend in a profound way.

00:50:54.768 --> 00:50:59.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned that Jehovah truly does
love us, cares for us, and protects us.

00:50:59.773 --> 00:51:02.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because he is such a good Father,

00:51:02.609 --> 00:51:06.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our joy has come back
and we have had such a rich life.

00:51:06.947 --> 00:51:10.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in all the years that we’ve had
the privilege of serving our God,

00:51:10.050 --> 00:51:12.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve always found
that no matter what we give Jehovah,

00:51:12.385 --> 00:51:16.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter what sacrifices
we make for him, he always gives us more.

00:51:16.590 --> 00:51:20.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You cannot out generous
the most generous Person in the universe.

00:51:20.627 --> 00:51:23.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so, just as he has
blessed us all these many years,

00:51:23.663 --> 00:51:26.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are confident
that he will continue to bless us

00:51:26.266 --> 00:51:28.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we transition to our next assignment.

00:51:29.402 --> 00:51:33.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much for sharing
your personal experiences with us.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:36.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may Jehovah
continue to be with the two of you

00:51:36.676 --> 00:51:41.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you now continue
your full-time service as special pioneers.

00:51:41.348 --> 00:51:45.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And may you be able to apply
the principles that you have just mentioned

00:51:45.719 --> 00:51:50.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that Jehovah
can continue to “guard your hearts.”

00:51:50.123 --> 00:51:51.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:51:51.658 --> 00:51:53.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we discussed earlier,

00:51:53.860 --> 00:51:56.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
happiness does not depend
on our circumstances

00:51:56.997 --> 00:52:00.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but on our thoughts and our outlook.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:04.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can influence our thoughts
by what we picture in our mind’s eye.

00:52:04.838 --> 00:52:07.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that beautifully brought to life

00:52:07.674 --> 00:52:10.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our new music video entitled

00:52:10.377 --> 00:52:12.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The New World to Come.</i>

00:52:12.979 --> 00:52:21.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a moment now and picture the scene.
Up ahead on the path are what seem to be

00:52:21.521 --> 00:52:30.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children laughing at play
In a world free of the fears we once faced.

00:52:30.964 --> 00:52:39.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And taking care of this beautiful earth
Are a people that live by our Father’s words:

00:52:39.973 --> 00:52:50.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Until the moon is no more”—
There is the peace we have been waiting for.

00:52:50.183 --> 00:52:59.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We will feel His love
Under the rule of His Son

00:52:59.025 --> 00:53:05.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the new world to come.

00:53:10.036 --> 00:53:14.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is a fire in our hearts.

00:53:14.574 --> 00:53:18.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is an anchor that holds us firm.

00:53:18.612 --> 00:53:22.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is a light that shines like the sun

00:53:22.749 --> 00:53:27.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we see ourselves there

00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:33.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the new world to come.

00:53:38.031 --> 00:53:42.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a moment now and think of a place

00:53:42.035 --> 00:53:47.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the mountains and rivers or wide open plains.

00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a place to call home.

00:53:51.444 --> 00:53:56.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now walking in through your front door,

00:53:56.783 --> 00:54:01.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is someone that you know

00:54:01.388 --> 00:54:05.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Holding out his open arms in hopes

00:54:05.825 --> 00:54:09.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of a tearful embrace—

00:54:09.262 --> 00:54:14.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Feels like forever since you’ve been face-to-face.

00:54:15.969 --> 00:54:20.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even death won’t stop

00:54:20.507 --> 00:54:24.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our God’s outstretched love

00:54:24.511 --> 00:54:29.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the new world to come.

00:54:35.355 --> 00:54:40.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is a fire in our hearts.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:44.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is an anchor that holds us firm.

00:54:44.331 --> 00:54:48.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is a light that shines like the sun

00:54:48.468 --> 00:54:52.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we see ourselves there

00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:58.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the new world to come.

00:55:03.850 --> 00:55:08.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And ev’ry word from His mouth

00:55:08.288 --> 00:55:12.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will do all for which He sent it out.

00:55:12.826 --> 00:55:17.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s will for this earth is

00:55:17.364 --> 00:55:23.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fulfilling ev’ry living things’ last wish.

00:55:50.563 --> 00:55:59.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is a fire in our hearts.
Hope is an anchor that holds us firm.

00:55:59.172 --> 00:56:07.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hope is a light that shines like the sun
As we see ourselves there

00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:16.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the new world to come,
In the new world to come,

00:56:16.723 --> 00:56:27.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the new world to come,
In the new world to come.

00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:40.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll probably want to listen
to that song again and again.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:43.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you might even want to sing it yourself.

00:56:43.850 --> 00:56:48.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our hope is one of the things
we want to focus on.

00:56:48.521 --> 00:56:51.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this will have an effect on us;

00:56:51.491 --> 00:56:54.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will contribute to our being joyful.

00:56:55.662 --> 00:56:58.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s conclude
this month’s program with a visit

00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:01.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a truly beautiful part of the earth:

00:57:01.101 --> 00:57:03.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Martinique.

00:57:03.136 --> 00:57:05.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This island in the eastern Caribbean

00:57:05.638 --> 00:57:09.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
measures just 50 miles
(or about 80 kilometers)

00:57:09.676 --> 00:57:13.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by 22 miles (or 35 kilometers).

00:57:13.046 --> 00:57:16.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Martinique,
nicknamed the Island of Flowers,

00:57:16.816 --> 00:57:20.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has stunning geographic diversity,
with beaches,

00:57:20.854 --> 00:57:23.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forests, rivers,

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:28.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sugarcane plantations,
and rugged mountains.

00:57:28.161 --> 00:57:30.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The highest point is Mount Pelée,

00:57:30.497 --> 00:57:33.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
infamous for causing
the deadliest volcanic eruption

00:57:33.633 --> 00:57:36.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the 20th century.

00:57:36.035 --> 00:57:39.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Pelée erupted in 1902,

00:57:39.172 --> 00:57:44.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nearly 30,000 people died
because they ignored the warnings.

00:57:44.043 --> 00:57:47.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This tragedy is often discussed
by our brothers in the ministry.

00:57:47.981 --> 00:57:50.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, more than 4,700 publishers

00:57:50.884 --> 00:57:53.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 62 congregations

00:57:53.386 --> 00:57:55.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
share the good news in eight languages,

00:57:55.855 --> 00:57:59.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including French, English,
French Sign Language,

00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:03.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arabic, and Creole of Martinique.

00:58:03.029 --> 00:58:06.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They conduct more than 4,500 Bible studies

00:58:06.533 --> 00:58:08.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—nearly one per publisher.

00:58:08.968 --> 00:58:13.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over one million tourists
visit this beautiful island every year

00:58:13.206 --> 00:58:15.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many by cruise ship.

00:58:15.208 --> 00:58:17.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This presents a unique preaching opportunity.

00:58:18.711 --> 00:58:23.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The city of Le Marin
hosts 55,000 boaters annually.

00:58:23.416 --> 00:58:25.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here our brothers preach

00:58:25.618 --> 00:58:28.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sailboat to sailboat.”

00:58:28.154 --> 00:58:30.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the city of La Trinité.

00:58:30.957 --> 00:58:33.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Creole of Martinique congregation

00:58:33.226 --> 00:58:35.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was formed here two years ago.

00:58:35.461 --> 00:58:39.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the congregation has 91 publishers

00:58:39.766 --> 00:58:41.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 10 regular pioneers.

00:58:41.768 --> 00:58:45.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They preach
in the countryside, the foothills,

00:58:45.371 --> 00:58:48.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherever people can be found.

00:58:48.408 --> 00:58:51.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in La Trinité, Martinique,

00:58:51.844 --> 00:58:55.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send you
their warm Christian love and greetings.

00:58:55.682 --> 00:58:58.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
