Welcome to JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:08.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month we will discuss
how to meet the challenge

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:10.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
of bearing “thorough witness.”

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:13.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is your territory difficult to reach?

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do language and cultural differences
make you apprehensive?

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:20.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what these publishers faced

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:23.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they moved
to where the need is greater.

00:00:23.323 --> 00:00:26.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how they
stepped up to the challenge.

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:31.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
This sister embraced the truth
during a time of violent division

00:00:31.564 --> 00:00:33.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Northern Ireland.

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:38.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did she muster up the courage
to preach to everyone in her community?

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see how Jehovah helped her.

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:45.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
All this and more on JW Broadcasting.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the astonished look
on the faces of the apostles.

00:01:08.668 --> 00:01:11.171 line:10% position:50% align:center
The resurrected Jesus stands before them

00:01:11.171 --> 00:01:13.173 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the Mount of Olives.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:16.376 line:10% position:50% align:center
Just before he disappears into the clouds,

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:19.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus makes this profound declaration,

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Acts 1:8:

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:28.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will receive power
when the holy spirit comes upon you,

00:01:28.054 --> 00:01:31.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will be
witnesses of me in Jerusalem,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in all Judea and Samaria,

00:01:33.626 --> 00:01:38.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:01:38.498 --> 00:01:40.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an assignment!

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:43.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were to preach
the good news of God’s Kingdom

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:45.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the earth.

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:48.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those disciples must have felt overwhelmed

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:52.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wondered how
such a small band of preachers

00:01:52.178 --> 00:01:55.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
could ever get this work done.

00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:59.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ten days later, they received
the promised holy spirit,

00:01:59.486 --> 00:02:01.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they got to work.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:04.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, they faced many challenges.

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:07.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that did not stop them.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three years passed,
and the preaching work

00:02:10.263 --> 00:02:13.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
was expanded to include Gentiles.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:17.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can read the moving account
in Acts chapter 10.

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:20.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, an angel of God appears

00:02:20.707 --> 00:02:24.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the God-fearing army officer Cornelius.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, Peter responds
to the leadings of God’s spirit

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:29.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go to the officer’s home.

00:02:29.883 --> 00:02:33.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
There, Peter gives
a thorough witness about Jesus

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to Cornelius

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to his family and friends.

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:41.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he concludes his discourse,

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:46.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter explains the commission
he received to be an evangelizer.

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:50.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s open to Acts 10:42,

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note the two main aspects

00:02:52.438 --> 00:02:55.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the preaching work started by Jesus:

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:59.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, he ordered us to preach to the people

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:02.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to give a thorough witness

00:03:02.448 --> 00:03:04.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that this is the one decreed by God

00:03:04.817 --> 00:03:08.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be judge of the living and the dead.”

00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:11.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Jesus commanded his disciples

00:03:11.558 --> 00:03:13.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to preach to the people.”

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, they were
“to give a thorough witness.”

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:22.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
The disciples were to search out
honesthearted, deserving ones.

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:26.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would require a thorough coverage
of their territory.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:29.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
In spite of vicious persecution,

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians in the first century
obeyed Jesus’ command

00:03:32.946 --> 00:03:36.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach and to bear thorough witness.

00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:38.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by about 60 of our Common Era,

00:03:38.918 --> 00:03:43.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
less than 30 years after the Christians
had received their commission,

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:46.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul could write
to the congregation in Colossae

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:51.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the good news had been
“preached in all creation under heaven.”

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:57.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a testimony to the power
of God’s holy spirit

00:03:57.236 --> 00:03:59.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the faith, zeal,

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:02.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and determination of those early disciples!

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the late 1800’s,
a small group of Bible students

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:12.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
rose to the challenge
of bearing thorough witness.

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:16.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
An article in the April 1881 issue
of <i>Zion’s Watch Tower</i>

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:18.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the thrilling title

00:04:18.658 --> 00:04:21.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Wanted 1,000 Preachers.”

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses
are bearing witness

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:29.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 240 lands.

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:32.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
But doing so has its challenges.

00:04:32.005 --> 00:04:36.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some of those challenges,
and what can we do to meet them?

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of our brothers face
the challenge of long distances,

00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:43.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
climate extremes, rough terrain,

00:04:43.716 --> 00:04:47.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and poor travel conditions.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some areas, just getting
to meet people

00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:52.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a challenge.

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:56.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
To add to the challenge,
Revelation 14:6 reminds us

00:04:56.496 --> 00:04:58.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the good news would be declared

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:02.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people.”

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:06.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
This can require learning a new language

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:09.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
and understanding
different religious, ethnic,

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:12.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cultural backgrounds.

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:15.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can mean coping
with unresponsive territories,

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:19.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
apathy, and poor living conditions.

00:05:19.285 --> 00:05:21.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus warned that opposers would try

00:05:21.788 --> 00:05:25.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hinder or stop the preaching work.

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:28.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you are facing
some form of challenge

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your local territory.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:33.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
We cannot begin to give possible solutions

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:36.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all the obstacles we face today.

00:05:36.436 --> 00:05:41.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is helpful to learn how others
are coping with their challenges,

00:05:41.307 --> 00:05:44.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this can stimulate our thinking

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:48.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
to identify ways to meet our challenges.

00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:52.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s focus on three Bible principles
that will help us

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:55.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry out our ministry successfully:

00:05:56.956 --> 00:06:00.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Trust in Jehovah,

00:06:00.293 --> 00:06:03.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) be flexible,

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) stay focused.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can trusting in Jehovah help us?

00:06:10.403 --> 00:06:12.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider an example.

00:06:12.972 --> 00:06:17.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the 1990’s,
Jehovah’s Witnesses in France

00:06:17.443 --> 00:06:21.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
endured an avalanche
of negative media reports.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of these vicious attacks,

00:06:23.616 --> 00:06:25.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
some brothers lost their jobs,

00:06:25.918 --> 00:06:29.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Witness children were taunted at school,

00:06:29.288 --> 00:06:33.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaching became extremely difficult
in some areas.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:35.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they cope?

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:39.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
The turning point came in January 1999.

00:06:39.332 --> 00:06:42.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body approved
a special campaign

00:06:42.435 --> 00:06:44.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
to distribute a magazine-size tract

00:06:44.904 --> 00:06:48.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
that exposed all of the accusations as false.

00:06:49.142 --> 00:06:53.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beginning early one Friday morning,
Witnesses throughout France

00:06:53.513 --> 00:06:56.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
distributed 12 million copies of the tract

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:58.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
in just three days.

00:06:58.951 --> 00:07:01.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
This campaign gave them renewed strength

00:07:01.387 --> 00:07:04.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
and boldness to preach.

00:07:04.123 --> 00:07:06.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 19 years that followed,

00:07:06.392 --> 00:07:09.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was a continuous increase
in the number of publishers

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:12.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ranks of regular pioneers

00:07:12.165 --> 00:07:15.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
swelled to over 15,000.

00:07:16.435 --> 00:07:20.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you constantly face a barrage
of negative media reports,

00:07:20.873 --> 00:07:25.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
does this mean that you need
a special campaign to meet the challenge?

00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:27.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not necessarily.

00:07:27.547 --> 00:07:30.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the campaign was a stimulus,

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:32.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers and sisters in France said

00:07:32.785 --> 00:07:36.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what really gave them
strength and boldness

00:07:36.522 --> 00:07:40.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
were the words of 2 Chronicles 32:8.

00:07:40.026 --> 00:07:42.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it.

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:46.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
The setting is in the time
of King Hezekiah of Judah.

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:48.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people were beaten down

00:07:48.901 --> 00:07:52.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the repeated threats
and taunts of the Assyrians.

00:07:53.339 --> 00:07:55.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
What strengthened them?

00:07:55.775 --> 00:07:59.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking about the king of Assyria,
King Hezekiah declared:

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:04.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With him is an arm of flesh,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but with us is Jehovah our God to help us

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:10.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to fight our battles.”

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result?

00:08:13.192 --> 00:08:18.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The people were strengthened
by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.”

00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:22.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just hearing this reminder
that Jehovah would help them

00:08:22.602 --> 00:08:25.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
was enough to strengthen the Jews.

00:08:25.571 --> 00:08:28.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah took action and sent an angel

00:08:28.708 --> 00:08:31.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
to destroy the enemy army.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Jehovah use his angels to help us today?

00:08:35.448 --> 00:08:39.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what we read at Revelation 14:6:

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:43.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I saw another angel flying in midheaven,

00:08:43.756 --> 00:08:47.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he had everlasting good news to declare

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:49.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those who dwell on the earth,

00:08:49.195 --> 00:08:51.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to every nation and tribe

00:08:51.898 --> 00:08:54.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tongue and people.”

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:57.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be sensitive to angelic direction

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the leadings of God’s holy spirit.

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:04.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you feel moved to make that one last call

00:09:04.644 --> 00:09:08.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to speak to the person
next to you on the bus, do it!

00:09:08.748 --> 00:09:10.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speak up.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:13.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may well be
that an angel is directing you

00:09:13.286 --> 00:09:17.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
to one who is “rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:09:18.658 --> 00:09:21.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s consider the second Bible principle

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us to bear thorough witness:

00:09:24.497 --> 00:09:26.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be flexible.

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:30.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes just getting to talk to people
can be a challenge.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:35.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
To overcome this obstacle,
we need to be flexible.

00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:39.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Takanori and Yumi Takahashi
have served in territories

00:09:39.612 --> 00:09:42.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are as different as night and day.

00:09:42.748 --> 00:09:45.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, they visited our studio.

00:09:45.818 --> 00:09:48.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen as they tell us how they have learned

00:09:48.354 --> 00:09:52.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet the challenges
of bearing thorough witness.

00:09:54.327 --> 00:09:55.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Takanori and Yumi,

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:57.964 line:10% position:50% align:center
welcome to our studio!

00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.632 line:10% position:50% align:center
Thank you for inviting us.

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re very happy to have you here.

00:10:02.201 --> 00:10:04.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Takanori, you and I go back a long way.

00:10:05.805 --> 00:10:10.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still remember when you came
into Japan Bethel back in 1977,

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:14.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we served in the same congregation
for a number of years.

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:18.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then in 1990, you had
a big change in your life.

00:10:18.617 --> 00:10:20.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to tell us what happened?

00:10:20.619 --> 00:10:23.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, my twin brother,

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:26.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nobuaki, was also serving at Bethel.

00:10:26.892 --> 00:10:30.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
To our surprise, we were assigned

00:10:30.229 --> 00:10:32.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:34.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a big change!

00:10:34.433 --> 00:10:38.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here you are working
in the rural territory of Papua New Guinea.

00:10:38.871 --> 00:10:41.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
During your 25 years in Papua New Guinea,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
I understand that you served
in the missionary field,

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:47.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.

00:10:47.413 --> 00:10:50.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, Yumi, when did you come into the picture?

00:10:50.116 --> 00:10:54.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Takanori and I were married
in September 1993,

00:10:54.353 --> 00:10:57.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I joined him in the missionary work.

00:10:57.456 --> 00:11:02.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adapting to remote territories such as this
was a challenge.

00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:05.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in order to bear thorough witness,

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:08.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
what kind of challenges
did you have to overcome?

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people of Papua New Guinea
are very friendly.

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:15.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have a deep respect for the Bible.

00:11:15.374 --> 00:11:17.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was easy to relax,

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:19.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
speak to them face-to-face,

00:11:19.945 --> 00:11:24.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read the Scriptures together,
and reason with them.

00:11:24.383 --> 00:11:26.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those don’t sound like challenges.

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you face any obstacles?

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:31.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we preached in the villages,

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:34.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
the response of the local people

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
often depended on the response
of the village chief.

00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:42.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he listened,
almost the whole village listened.

00:11:42.835 --> 00:11:45.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if his response was negative,

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:49.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people would walk away
and hide in the bush.

00:11:49.642 --> 00:11:53.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we would always show respect

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
and approach the village chief first.

00:11:57.049 --> 00:12:01.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
This often moved him
to view our visit with favor.

00:12:01.353 --> 00:12:05.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
The challenge in the cities
was mainly security.

00:12:05.524 --> 00:12:09.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t safe for us to go
into some areas alone

00:12:09.695 --> 00:12:11.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to visit homes regularly.

00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:16.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we would ask our Bible students
to come to the Kingdom Hall

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:19.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
for their study before the meeting.

00:12:19.905 --> 00:12:24.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a good way to encourage them
to attend meetings.

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s obvious that you enjoyed
your service in Papua New Guinea.

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now you’re serving as special pioneers
in the Maihama Congregation

00:12:32.685 --> 00:12:35.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.

00:12:36.322 --> 00:12:40.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you went from a territory
where people have deep respect for the Bible

00:12:40.292 --> 00:12:44.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a land where less than 1 percent
of the people claim to be Christian.

00:12:44.864 --> 00:12:48.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what other kind of differences
did you find

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:52.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
between your territory in Japan now
and your missionary territory?

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:55.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, it’s very different.

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:58.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory,

00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:01.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 70 percent of the homes

00:13:01.013 --> 00:13:04.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in high-security apartment buildings.

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:08.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to stand in the lobby
in front of the doorman,

00:13:08.587 --> 00:13:11.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
push a button, and speak to a camera.

00:13:12.658 --> 00:13:14.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Coming from Papua New Guinea,

00:13:14.994 --> 00:13:17.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
we found it challenging
to work this territory.

00:13:18.497 --> 00:13:22.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were used to friendly discussions
face-to-face.

00:13:22.601 --> 00:13:25.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we see only the lens of a camera.

00:13:25.804 --> 00:13:30.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have learned
to view the camera as our friend.

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:32.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
As your friend?

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:35.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think most of us find it challenging
to speak to a camera.

00:13:35.781 --> 00:13:38.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do you overcome this challenge?

00:13:38.551 --> 00:13:42.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that as soon as we push the button,

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:45.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
our face shows up on a screen
inside of the apartment.

00:13:45.724 --> 00:13:49.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
We stand an arm’s length from the camera

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:52.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that our face is framed nicely.

00:13:52.464 --> 00:13:55.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we adjust our volume accordingly,

00:13:55.334 --> 00:14:00.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
taking into consideration the doorman
and others who may be listening.

00:14:00.973 --> 00:14:03.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
We say our greeting

00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:06.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
about two seconds after we push the button,

00:14:06.679 --> 00:14:10.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
just when we know
that they are looking at the monitor.

00:14:10.449 --> 00:14:13.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our friendly greeting and warm smile

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:17.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes them feel like we
can actually see their face.

00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:22.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prepare a specific appealing introduction

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:27.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and show them respect and consideration.

00:14:27.333 --> 00:14:32.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people in our territory
like to be viewed as successful,

00:14:32.338 --> 00:14:34.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
not as people who have problems.

00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we try to focus on positive subjects.

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prepare a variety of subjects

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they don’t hear
the same message over and over.

00:14:46.285 --> 00:14:51.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like many people, Japanese do not like
to be put on the spot.

00:14:51.090 --> 00:14:56.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
So instead of asking a question
and waiting for them to answer,

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:59.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
we use the teaching method of our tracts

00:14:59.898 --> 00:15:03.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give three possible answers
for them to choose from.

00:15:03.035 --> 00:15:07.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, have you had positive results
from this intercom preaching?

00:15:07.906 --> 00:15:10.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since we started to use this method,

00:15:10.976 --> 00:15:14.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of not-at-homes has decreased.

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:17.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also, when we meet people on the street,

00:15:17.483 --> 00:15:20.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes they say they know us

00:15:20.819 --> 00:15:24.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they saw us on their intercom.

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was excellent!

00:15:25.658 --> 00:15:29.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thank you, Takanori and Yumi,
for sharing with us

00:15:29.628 --> 00:15:32.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
how you have met the challenge
of bearing thorough witness

00:15:32.631 --> 00:15:35.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a variety of territories.

00:15:36.368 --> 00:15:40.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 9:22, 23

00:15:40.706 --> 00:15:42.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
—let’s read it.

00:15:42.941 --> 00:15:45.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have become all things

00:15:45.411 --> 00:15:47.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to people of all sorts,

00:15:47.579 --> 00:15:51.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that I might by all possible means save some.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:53.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I do all things

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:55.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the sake of the good news,

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:58.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to share it with others.”

00:15:59.158 --> 00:16:01.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Become all things.”

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do all things.”

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:05.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, be flexible.

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:09.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apply the suggestions
in the meeting workbook.

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:13.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get well-acquainted with each tool
in the Teaching Toolbox.

00:16:13.405 --> 00:16:16.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Observe how experienced publishers

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:18.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and pioneers use those tools.

00:16:18.811 --> 00:16:21.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understand the feelings and circumstances

00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
of people in the territory.

00:16:23.916 --> 00:16:28.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in the same territory,
we may need to use a variety of approaches.

00:16:28.921 --> 00:16:31.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, about 40 percent

00:16:31.623 --> 00:16:34.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the apartment buildings
in the Takahashi’s territory

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not allow the Witnesses
to enter the lobby,

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:42.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they do public and informal witnessing
to reach those people.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:45.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s consider the third Bible principle:

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay focused.

00:16:48.073 --> 00:16:50.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 6:22, Jesus said:

00:16:51.744 --> 00:16:54.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The lamp of the body is the eye.

00:16:54.747 --> 00:16:57.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If, then, your eye is focused,

00:16:57.416 --> 00:17:00.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
your whole body will be bright.”

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:06.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keeping our eye focused means
keeping our life simple

00:17:06.191 --> 00:17:09.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to concentrate on spiritual matters.

00:17:09.895 --> 00:17:13.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Distractions take our attention
and energy away

00:17:13.632 --> 00:17:16.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our responsibility
to bear thorough witness.

00:17:16.735 --> 00:17:21.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we can teach those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life,”

00:17:21.173 --> 00:17:23.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to find them.

00:17:23.442 --> 00:17:27.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
We leave no stone unturned
as we search for them at their homes,

00:17:27.846 --> 00:17:30.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the streets, in parks,

00:17:30.282 --> 00:17:33.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
in stores, and at the workplace.

00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:38.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no on/off switch
for our preaching work.

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:42.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our “preaching switch” must be on

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:44.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
at all times.

00:17:44.696 --> 00:17:48.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only do we look
for opportunities to preach

00:17:48.133 --> 00:17:51.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we also make opportunities.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:54.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if our efforts to find interested ones

00:17:54.206 --> 00:17:56.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not fruitful?

00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:58.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not say that every human

00:17:58.677 --> 00:18:01.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
must become a disciple before the end comes.

00:18:01.713 --> 00:18:05.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, he said that the end will come

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:09.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the good news has been preached
in all the inhabited earth

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:13.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a witness has been given
to all the nations.

00:18:13.225 --> 00:18:16.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul stayed
focused on his ministry.

00:18:16.929 --> 00:18:20.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we imitate his positive attitude

00:18:20.466 --> 00:18:24.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressed at Acts 20:24:

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life

00:18:29.041 --> 00:18:31.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of any importance to me,

00:18:31.109 --> 00:18:34.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if only I may finish my course

00:18:34.112 --> 00:18:37.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the ministry that I received
from the Lord Jesus,

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:41.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to bear thorough witness to the good news

00:18:41.119 --> 00:18:45.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the undeserved kindness of God.”

00:18:45.657 --> 00:18:49.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
The opportunity to bear thorough witness
will soon be over.

00:18:49.995 --> 00:18:53.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we use the remaining time effectively

00:18:53.432 --> 00:18:55.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
to search for deserving ones

00:18:55.801 --> 00:18:59.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to teach them the truth.

00:18:59.271 --> 00:19:02.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imitate the faith of Hezekiah,

00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:04.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trust in Jehovah;

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
learn from the apostle Paul,

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:09.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be flexible;

00:19:09.381 --> 00:19:12.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
obey Jesus’ direction,

00:19:12.117 --> 00:19:14.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stay focused.

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you too can meet the challenge

00:19:17.723 --> 00:19:20.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
of bearing “thorough witness.”

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another challenge of bearing thorough witness

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:28.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
is preaching in the midst of civil unrest.

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:30.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in the 1960’s,

00:19:30.602 --> 00:19:32.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers in Northern Ireland

00:19:32.804 --> 00:19:35.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
endured 30 violent years

00:19:35.674 --> 00:19:38.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
known as the “Troubles.”

00:19:38.043 --> 00:19:42.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kay Harrigan learned the truth
during those difficult times.

00:19:42.281 --> 00:19:46.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen as Kay describes
how she was drawn to the truth

00:19:46.685 --> 00:19:49.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it changed her life.

00:24:56.862 --> 00:25:01.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting in Jehovah
helped Kay overcome her fears.

00:25:01.266 --> 00:25:04.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
What blessings did she receive?

00:25:04.135 --> 00:25:09.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kay said that she has the happiness
of bringing good news to everyone.

00:25:10.909 --> 00:25:15.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since 2013,
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:20.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
has prepared brothers and sisters
to serve where there is a greater need.

00:25:20.185 --> 00:25:22.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even with this training, however,

00:25:22.754 --> 00:25:26.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
graduates sometimes find
their assignments challenging.

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:30.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see that
in our next segment from Tanzania.

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.165 line:10% position:50% align:center
I wanted to help the deaf

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:36.568 line:10% position:50% align:center
so that they too can know Jehovah.

00:25:37.302 --> 00:25:40.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided to move
to a sign-language territory:

00:25:40.505 --> 00:25:43.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sign-language group in Dar es Salaam.

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:48.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to travel by bus,
and sometimes we traveled far

00:25:48.647 --> 00:25:51.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
(stuck in a traffic jam
for two to three hours),

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was expensive.

00:25:56.187 --> 00:25:58.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still remember my early days in service

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:00.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the sign-language group.

00:26:00.759 --> 00:26:02.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was very inexperienced with the language,

00:26:02.994 --> 00:26:07.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one day, my service partner
asked me to conduct her Bible study.

00:26:08.533 --> 00:26:12.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time I tried to talk
to the student, argh, she didn’t understand.

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:18.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I kept trying, she became
more and more frustrated with me,

00:26:18.743 --> 00:26:21.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I started to feel discouraged.

00:26:21.212 --> 00:26:24.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to help, but I was powerless.

00:26:26.451 --> 00:26:28.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt bad.

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:31.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told myself: ‘I still don’t know the deaf.

00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:33.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I still don’t know sign language.

00:26:33.625 --> 00:26:36.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why has Jehovah brought me into this field

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:39.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which I am not able to help the deaf?’

00:26:41.967 --> 00:26:45.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was invited
to the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:48.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 2014, from September to November.

00:26:49.107 --> 00:26:53.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
After graduating, I received
an assignment in sign language again.

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:57.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah truly helped me so much.

00:26:57.148 --> 00:27:01.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was exactly
the encouragement I needed to persevere

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:04.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
in learning the language
and becoming more effective in my assignment.

00:27:04.489 --> 00:27:07.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to conduct my own Bible studies,

00:27:07.792 --> 00:27:10.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they could really understand me now.

00:27:10.595 --> 00:27:14.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we started,
there were two baptized deaf publishers,

00:27:14.899 --> 00:27:16.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now there are over ten.

00:27:16.901 --> 00:27:21.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve had the opportunity to help
three deaf people to make progress,

00:27:21.172 --> 00:27:24.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dedicate themselves to Jehovah,
and to get baptized.

00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:28.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
The training I received at the school
is still helping me now

00:27:28.646 --> 00:27:32.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
in my new assignment
at the translation office,

00:27:32.017 --> 00:27:34.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
where I serve together with my husband.

00:27:34.786 --> 00:27:37.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are joyful because we know
that through this work,

00:27:37.455 --> 00:27:40.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
many deaf people
will receive publications in their language

00:27:40.759 --> 00:27:44.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this will bring about
an increase in this territory.

00:27:47.532 --> 00:27:49.601 line:10% position:50% align:center
I graduated from the School

00:27:49.601 --> 00:27:52.437 line:10% position:50% align:center
for Kingdom Evangelizers in 2015.

00:27:53.171 --> 00:27:56.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was a privilege
to receive the assignment

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:59.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go help the Maasai
to know Jehovah in their mother tongue.

00:28:03.014 --> 00:28:05.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Traveling is difficult.

00:28:05.483 --> 00:28:08.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I travel by vehicle,

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:11.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
but sometimes there are areas
in which there are no vehicles,

00:28:11.656 --> 00:28:15.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I’m forced to walk.

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:17.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I can travel by motorcycle

00:28:17.962 --> 00:28:21.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach many more people.

00:28:21.499 --> 00:28:24.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
But still, transportation
is a difficult part of it:

00:28:24.803 --> 00:28:27.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are valleys, there are mountains,

00:28:27.472 --> 00:28:30.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are uphills, there are downhills.

00:28:30.475 --> 00:28:33.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
So transportation is difficult.

00:28:33.344 --> 00:28:36.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I finally reached the territory,

00:28:36.815 --> 00:28:39.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to find the Maasai.

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:42.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was apprehensive about their reaction

00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I know their culture;

00:28:44.689 --> 00:28:47.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
they don’t know Jehovah.

00:28:47.025 --> 00:28:51.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I wondered what would happen
when I reached their territory.

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:53.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
During that stressful time,

00:28:53.231 --> 00:28:56.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed to Jehovah;

00:28:56.167 --> 00:28:58.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
I read his Word, the Bible;

00:28:59.737 --> 00:29:03.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
I meditated on accounts of our brothers
and sisters mentioned in the Bible;

00:29:03.608 --> 00:29:07.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
and after prayer, Jehovah gave me strength.

00:29:07.712 --> 00:29:10.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to return to them,

00:29:10.014 --> 00:29:13.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
make return visits, and start Bible studies.

00:29:13.051 --> 00:29:15.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the results have been good.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am happy

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:20.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
that after starting studies,

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:23.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
some started taking steps
and attending meetings.

00:29:23.695 --> 00:29:26.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
They later made good progress,

00:29:26.064 --> 00:29:28.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now some of them
are our brothers and sisters.

00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:33.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
They dedicated themselves and were baptized.

00:29:33.404 --> 00:29:36.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel so much joy.

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:39.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has given me
the strength and the ability

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be used to further the preaching
of the good news

00:29:42.113 --> 00:29:45.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to help the Maasai spiritually.

00:29:48.786 --> 00:29:51.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sabina said that she was discouraged.

00:29:51.689 --> 00:29:53.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saitoti was stressed.

00:29:53.992 --> 00:29:57.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever felt that way
about your ministry?

00:29:57.495 --> 00:29:59.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped them?

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:02.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sabina persevered.

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
She became proficient in sign language

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:09.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had the joy of helping
several deaf ones learn the truth.

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saitoti relied on prayer and meditation.

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:17.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave him the strength
to bear witness to the Maasai.

00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:20.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we saw the encouraging results.

00:30:21.219 --> 00:30:23.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Showing love and concern for people

00:30:23.421 --> 00:30:26.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a vital element
in bearing thorough witness.

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:30.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the subject
of a recent Morning Worship program

00:30:30.361 --> 00:30:32.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
conducted by Brother William Turner,

00:30:32.764 --> 00:30:35.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re happy to share it with you.

00:30:35.466 --> 00:30:39.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
His theme is “Make Known ‘the Good News.’”

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:43.675 line:10% position:50% align:center
“How does it make you feel,

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:46.611 line:10% position:50% align:center
“knowing God’s support is real,

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:48.379 line:10% position:50% align:center
“and that he’s entrusted [us]

00:30:48.379 --> 00:30:50.615 line:10% position:50% align:center
to do the work we do?”

00:30:50.615 --> 00:30:52.717 line:10% position:50% align:center
We know that song.

00:30:52.717 --> 00:30:55.253 line:10% position:50% align:center
We love that song.

00:30:55.253 --> 00:30:59.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you ever stopped
to meditate on the lyrics?

00:30:59.023 --> 00:31:01.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we feel?

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:04.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because, really,
it’s a tremendous, amazing privilege

00:31:04.996 --> 00:31:07.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has entrusted to his people

00:31:07.832 --> 00:31:11.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the work of Kingdom preaching
and disciple-making.

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:15.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while the work at Bethel
contributes to the preaching work

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a very precious and unique way,

00:31:18.209 --> 00:31:21.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
we still recognize it’s quite special

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:24.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be able to assist someone in the ministry

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:28.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
and watch them progress
to the point of making a dedication

00:31:28.086 --> 00:31:31.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
and symbolizing that by water baptism.

00:31:31.456 --> 00:31:33.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our text comments mention the qualities

00:31:33.558 --> 00:31:37.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
of gratitude and undeserved kindness.

00:31:37.128 --> 00:31:39.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
And these are good qualities

00:31:39.130 --> 00:31:41.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they’re qualities that motivate us,

00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:43.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
that move us to action,

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:46.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
that touch our emotions.

00:31:46.371 --> 00:31:48.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is this emotional investment

00:31:48.973 --> 00:31:53.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
so important when it comes to our ministry?

00:31:53.511 --> 00:31:55.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, think, for example,

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:59.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our greatest Teacher and Preacher

00:31:59.183 --> 00:32:02.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
who ever walked the earth,
and that is Jesus Christ.

00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:05.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me in your Bibles, please,
to Luke chapter 19,

00:32:07.358 --> 00:32:10.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll just take a look at one instance

00:32:10.828 --> 00:32:14.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how Jesus demonstrated
this love and concern.

00:32:14.799 --> 00:32:18.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 19:41

00:32:21.406 --> 00:32:25.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
says: “And when he
[that is, Jesus] got nearby,

00:32:25.977 --> 00:32:30.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he viewed the city [Jerusalem]

00:32:30.248 --> 00:32:32.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wept over it.”

00:32:34.419 --> 00:32:35.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
How interesting!

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:40.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ heart was filled with so much emotion

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:44.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his eyes brimmed over with tears
when he contemplated the people,

00:32:44.996 --> 00:32:47.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
their rejection of the message,

00:32:47.665 --> 00:32:49.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
the siege that was to follow.

00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t that show his love for people?

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:54.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
And obviously,
that love was made evident

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:57.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire time
that he was here on the earth.

00:32:57.842 --> 00:32:59.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we may not give way to tears

00:32:59.978 --> 00:33:04.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
every time we go into our territory
and engage in the ministry,

00:33:04.282 --> 00:33:07.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
but certainly we want
to imitate Jesus’ example,

00:33:07.585 --> 00:33:12.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it’s so vital that we have
and demonstrate love for people.

00:33:13.291 --> 00:33:17.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminds me of a conversation I had
with a missionary sister some time ago,

00:33:17.028 --> 00:33:19.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at the time,
she was revealing her personal circumstances.

00:33:19.564 --> 00:33:21.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she felt that at that time

00:33:21.566 --> 00:33:24.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
she could comfortably handle
ten Bible studies.

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:26.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I asked her how things were going.

00:33:26.437 --> 00:33:28.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “Well, actually I have 20.”

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:30.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “I was able to get rid of six.”

00:33:30.208 --> 00:33:34.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said,
“But I just can’t turn over these last four.”

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:37.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “They’re such a part of my life;

00:33:37.548 --> 00:33:40.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just can’t let them go.”

00:33:40.218 --> 00:33:43.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it sounds like a good problem to have.

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:45.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
But doesn’t it highlight her love for people?

00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:49.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was emotionally invested.

00:33:49.827 --> 00:33:52.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we also have to admit

00:33:52.363 --> 00:33:55.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
that while preaching is a wonderful work,

00:33:55.867 --> 00:34:00.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually carrying it out
is not always easy to do.

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:04.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps at times we may feel
like the prophet Jeremiah.

00:34:04.575 --> 00:34:06.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
You recall when he
was commissioned as a prophet,

00:34:06.944 --> 00:34:10.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gave Jehovah a number of reasons
why he shouldn’t be selected.

00:34:10.782 --> 00:34:15.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was too shy, too young,
wasn’t able to speak well.

00:34:15.686 --> 00:34:17.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then once he got into his assignment

00:34:17.722 --> 00:34:20.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the opposition and the ridicule started

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:22.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
—well, let’s take note of his feelings.

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to Jeremiah chapter 20,

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:32.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah chapter 20.

00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:34.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll begin with the <i>B</i>  part of verse 8:

00:34:36.908 --> 00:34:39.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For me the word of Jehovah

00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:43.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been the cause of insults
and jeering all day long.

00:34:43.481 --> 00:34:47.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So I said:
‘I am not going to make mention of him,

00:34:47.852 --> 00:34:51.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will speak no more in his name.’”

00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:57.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever had times
when you felt like Jeremiah,

00:34:57.628 --> 00:35:00.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you just didn’t have the desire

00:35:00.731 --> 00:35:04.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
or feel like speaking
to others about Jehovah?

00:35:04.435 --> 00:35:07.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe it was for similar reasons:

00:35:07.138 --> 00:35:10.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re shy; we feel nervous;

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:13.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
people in the territory are indifferent.

00:35:14.679 --> 00:35:17.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or could it just be that we’re just tired?

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:22.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
The energy that we feel we need,
we just don’t have it.

00:35:23.888 --> 00:35:26.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it normal to feel this way at times?

00:35:26.891 --> 00:35:28.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s take note
of what Jeremiah says next.

00:35:32.196 --> 00:35:34.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s finish verse 9.

00:35:34.365 --> 00:35:36.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says:
“But in my heart

00:35:36.734 --> 00:35:41.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it became like a burning fire
shut up in my bones,

00:35:41.005 --> 00:35:43.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I was tired of holding it in;

00:35:43.608 --> 00:35:46.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could no longer endure it.”

00:35:46.644 --> 00:35:49.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice,
it was Jeremiah’s love for Jehovah,

00:35:49.614 --> 00:35:52.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
his zeal for the truth,
his strong spirituality

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:57.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of these were things
that were able to help him remain invested

00:35:57.755 --> 00:36:02.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be able to overcome
any temporary discouragement

00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he might have been feeling at that time.

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can help us to stay invested

00:36:08.366 --> 00:36:11.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to maintain our love for people?

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:14.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are many ways,
but we’ll discuss two.

00:36:14.138 --> 00:36:17.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Jeremiah’s example shows us

00:36:17.642 --> 00:36:20.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is never a substitute

00:36:20.378 --> 00:36:23.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the study of God’s Word.

00:36:23.014 --> 00:36:24.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice,

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:28.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was that ‘burning fire
shut up in his bones’?

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 tells us
it was “the word of Jehovah.”

00:36:33.558 --> 00:36:36.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was Jeremiah’s appreciation

00:36:36.427 --> 00:36:39.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the importance of his message

00:36:39.096 --> 00:36:41.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
that made him responsive

00:36:41.132 --> 00:36:46.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the encouragement
he received when he read God’s Word.

00:36:46.103 --> 00:36:49.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it works the same for us as well.

00:36:49.006 --> 00:36:54.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Study of God’s Word
helps to reinforce our love for Jehovah.

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:56.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a constant reminder
that we’re living in the last days,

00:36:56.714 --> 00:36:58.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’re deep in the time of the end,

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:01.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we need to do
all that we can to find

00:37:01.018 --> 00:37:04.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

00:37:05.089 --> 00:37:08.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it is natural
that we are going to experience

00:37:08.926 --> 00:37:11.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
discouragement from time to time,

00:37:11.329 --> 00:37:13.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
but when we pray to Jehovah for help,

00:37:13.731 --> 00:37:17.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see, if his Word is in our hearts,

00:37:17.535 --> 00:37:21.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Jehovah can freely impart
his holy spirit to us.

00:37:21.072 --> 00:37:23.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can give us what we need

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:26.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be bold preachers of the good news

00:37:26.477 --> 00:37:29.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be productive in our ministry.

00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second thing that can help us

00:37:32.583 --> 00:37:36.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
is applying the suggestions
that are given to us

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:40.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the slave to help us improve our ministry.

00:37:40.424 --> 00:37:44.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, perhaps in the past, 
preaching may have been difficult,

00:37:44.428 --> 00:37:47.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe just because of pressure
we put upon ourselves.

00:37:47.231 --> 00:37:51.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we may have felt that we
had to have the perfect presentation

00:37:51.602 --> 00:37:55.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we had to place
a certain amount of literature.

00:37:55.072 --> 00:37:57.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how loving it is that we see

00:37:57.074 --> 00:38:00.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
that with the various adjustments
that have been made in our ministry,

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:03.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, hopefully some
of that anxiety has been lifted

00:38:03.281 --> 00:38:07.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
because now we know
our focus is on starting conversations!

00:38:07.818 --> 00:38:10.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the help of prayer and God’s spirit,

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:15.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see how that
just naturally progresses into a witness.

00:38:15.059 --> 00:38:17.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we just think back for a moment
to the example of Jesus,

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:21.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can only imagine
how many preaching opportunities

00:38:21.232 --> 00:38:26.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus must have had
just from starting conversations.

00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:29.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the one
we’re most familiar with is in John chapter 4

00:38:29.307 --> 00:38:31.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Samaritan woman at the well.

00:38:31.409 --> 00:38:34.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only was that a great witness

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:39.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just think about all of those
who became believers afterward.

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:44.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of that started simply
from Jesus starting a conversation

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
—asking for water.

00:38:47.992 --> 00:38:51.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may not always have
as many opportunities at Bethel

00:38:51.529 --> 00:38:53.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
to engage in the house-to-house work
as we would like,

00:38:53.998 --> 00:38:57.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
but certainly as we travel,
as we move about,

00:38:57.301 --> 00:39:00.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
this can present greater opportunities

00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
to start conversations.

00:39:02.673 --> 00:39:06.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
In last month’s meeting workbook,
there was an article

00:39:06.077 --> 00:39:09.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Starting Conversations
That Can Lead to a Witness,”

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:14.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that article just provided
many excellent, practical suggestions

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:16.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can implement.

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:18.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we follow these suggestions,

00:39:18.589 --> 00:39:23.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, this is a nice way that we can show
and demonstrate our gratitude.

00:39:23.594 --> 00:39:27.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re making the best use
of our time to start a witness.

00:39:27.531 --> 00:39:28.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, as we mentioned,

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:30.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are many ways
that we can show our gratitude.

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:32.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
But certainly these two:

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:36.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our study of God’s Word and applying
the suggestions to improve our ministry

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:39.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
are two ways that we can certainly implement.

00:39:39.744 --> 00:39:44.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in imitation of Jesus, Jeremiah,

00:39:44.048 --> 00:39:46.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
many other faithful Witnesses of Jehovah,

00:39:46.417 --> 00:39:50.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
may we do what we can
to show that we are invested,

00:39:50.521 --> 00:39:54.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we show our love for God
and our love for people

00:39:54.258 --> 00:39:57.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we appreciatively carry out our commission

00:39:57.647 --> 00:39:59.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach the good news.

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:03.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love Never Fails”!

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the theme of last year’s conventions.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:11.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty-four international conventions
were held in different parts of the earth.

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:13.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ll see in the following report,

00:40:13.944 --> 00:40:15.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
our international conventions

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:19.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
showcased the love and unity
of Jehovah’s people,

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:23.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they provided a tremendous witness.

00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:30.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that the identifying mark

00:40:30.194 --> 00:40:32.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
of true Christians would be

00:40:32.196 --> 00:40:34.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
their love for one another.

00:40:34.198 --> 00:40:36.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was especially evident

00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:40.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
at our 2019 “Love Never Fails”!
International Conventions.

00:40:49.313 --> 00:40:52.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never expected
the welcome that we received.

00:40:52.349 --> 00:40:56.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were over 200 brothers in the airport.

00:40:57.021 --> 00:41:01.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me, it’s like I’m in Paradise already
because of the love I feel here.

00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wherever I turn, there’s love.

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:07.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I walked around the corner,

00:41:07.832 --> 00:41:11.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
the reception of the friends,
the way they embraced me,

00:41:11.469 --> 00:41:13.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
was something
that I could not have expected.

00:41:13.437 --> 00:41:15.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one could’ve even described it to me.

00:41:27.084 --> 00:41:29.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mexico has a lot of different cultures.

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:31.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here in this stadium,

00:41:31.522 --> 00:41:33.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are one people united by love,

00:41:33.891 --> 00:41:35.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving Jehovah.

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:38.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s unique, it’s wonderful,

00:41:38.662 --> 00:41:40.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’s all thanks to love.

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:45.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t matter where we come from
or what language we speak.

00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:47.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
The language here is love.

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:57.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our love of neighbor motivated us
to share in a global preaching campaign.

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Foreign delegates
worked shoulder to shoulder

00:42:00.618 --> 00:42:02.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
with hosts from the local city

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:06.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
to invite millions of people
from around the world

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:10.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
to one of the 24 international conventions.

00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:15.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
This gave our brothers and sisters
from different parts of the globe

00:42:15.399 --> 00:42:18.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
an opportunity to get to know each other,

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:23.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
united by the common goal of spreading
the good news to everyone they met.

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worked in field service with a sister

00:42:26.443 --> 00:42:29.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
who used to study the Bible
with a Brazilian woman.

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:34.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sister had prayed to send
a Brazilian sister to accompany her.

00:42:34.051 --> 00:42:36.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we visited the woman together,

00:42:36.554 --> 00:42:39.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
she could see the love we have between us

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:41.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the efforts we made to come so far

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:44.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend the convention here in Denmark.

00:42:44.562 --> 00:42:47.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over a million people attended

00:42:47.364 --> 00:42:49.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
the international conventions
in many different languages.

00:42:50.834 --> 00:42:55.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both foreign and local delegates
as well as newly interested ones

00:42:55.506 --> 00:43:00.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to learn firsthand
how love never fails.

00:43:00.511 --> 00:43:03.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Clothe yourselves with love,

00:43:03.914 --> 00:43:07.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
for it is a perfect bond of union.”

00:43:07.318 --> 00:43:10.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, love identifies us.

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:16.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility
—that’s love in action.

00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:18.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loyal love is a beautiful aspect

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:21.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s personality.

00:43:21.065 --> 00:43:24.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus made it simple, didn’t he?

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:27.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: ‘Look for the love.

00:43:27.771 --> 00:43:31.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look for the love,
and you’ll find the right religion.’

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:35.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christian love has power.

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:37.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can reach hearts in ways

00:43:37.715 --> 00:43:40.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the spoken word cannot.

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:44.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, really,
what other group of persons on earth

00:43:44.722 --> 00:43:49.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
are interested in discussing
love that doesn’t fail?

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:51.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
When someone sees us,

00:43:51.128 --> 00:43:53.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
they should see a loving individual.

00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:56.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they see any one of us

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are servants of Jehovah,

00:43:59.737 --> 00:44:03.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
then they should see love.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:10.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to spending time in the ministry,
activities were planned

00:44:10.314 --> 00:44:12.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that delegates could get to know

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:16.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
their brothers better.

00:44:19.890 --> 00:44:23.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
This gave delegates the opportunity
to learn about the culture

00:44:23.827 --> 00:44:28.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our spiritual heritage
in the host country.

00:44:29.733 --> 00:44:34.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cities,
they visited exhibits and locations

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:37.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
where previously our faith
and love had been tested.

00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:42.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, delegates in Berlin
had the opportunity to visit

00:44:42.579 --> 00:44:44.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sachsenhausen concentration camp

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:47.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
where many of our brothers were imprisoned

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:49.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
during World War II.

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:51.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it was especially amazing,

00:44:51.955 --> 00:44:55.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite the circumstances
those brothers and sisters faced,

00:44:55.426 --> 00:44:57.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even their persecutors

00:44:57.461 --> 00:45:00.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
had to recognize
the true identifying mark of Christianity

00:45:00.564 --> 00:45:02.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
—of love.

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:07.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
This visit showed the faithful endurance
our brothers and sisters

00:45:07.671 --> 00:45:10.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
demonstrated under vicious persecution

00:45:10.641 --> 00:45:13.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the love they had for Jehovah

00:45:13.610 --> 00:45:17.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
–a fitting example of love that never fails.

00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:23.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Adolf Hitler wanted to exterminate
Jehovah’s Witnesses;

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
he called them a brood.

00:45:25.956 --> 00:45:30.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
But instead,
Jehovah’s Witnesses are still here,

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:33.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
proving that Christian love never fails.

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:42.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example of faith and endurance
was seen in Seoul, Korea.

00:45:45.175 --> 00:45:50.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since 1953,
young Korean brothers had been imprisoned

00:45:50.013 --> 00:45:52.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
for refusing military service.

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:55.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Altogether,

00:45:55.319 --> 00:45:59.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 19,000 brothers
who refused to compromise their faith

00:45:59.857 --> 00:46:04.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
spent nearly 37,000 years in prison.

00:46:04.495 --> 00:46:09.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Delegates were able to visit
a neutrality exhibition to learn more

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:11.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the strong faith and unwavering courage

00:46:11.802 --> 00:46:15.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
these young brothers displayed.

00:46:15.005 --> 00:46:18.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
On February 28, 2019,

00:46:19.143 --> 00:46:22.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
the last of our imprisoned brothers
was released.

00:46:24.615 --> 00:46:29.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because I received
a not-guilty verdict just two weeks ago,

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:32.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to attend
this international convention.

00:46:32.489 --> 00:46:35.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am so grateful to Jehovah.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:41.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
My son receiving this acquittal
enabled him to attend this convention.

00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:43.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never imagined this would be possible.

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:47.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a joy it was
for these brothers to attend

00:46:47.404 --> 00:46:51.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
this historic international convention
alongside their families

00:46:51.809 --> 00:46:54.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thousands of foreign delegates!

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:58.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just being able to sit
next to my son for the convention

00:46:58.482 --> 00:47:00.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely fills my heart.

00:47:11.428 --> 00:47:14.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite an ongoing economic crisis,

00:47:14.765 --> 00:47:17.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
many delegates from Venezuela

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
were able to attend
the international convention

00:47:19.770 --> 00:47:22.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Coming from Venezuela,

00:47:25.075 --> 00:47:28.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s difficult to earn
a living or save money.

00:47:28.278 --> 00:47:32.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to sell our electronic devices
and work long hours to be here.

00:47:32.783 --> 00:47:34.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these sacrifices 

00:47:34.785 --> 00:47:36.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
will always be worth it.

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:44.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
The love we show to our brothers is possible

00:47:44.294 --> 00:47:47.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the love Jehovah shows us.

00:47:47.764 --> 00:47:52.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
An expression of his love to us
comes in the form of his Word, the Bible.

00:47:53.403 --> 00:47:55.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Copenhagen, Denmark,

00:47:55.405 --> 00:47:59.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
delegates from Iceland
were delighted to receive a special gift.

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:03.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy to announce the release

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:08.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Icelandic <i>New World Translation </i>
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures.</i>

00:48:14.524 --> 00:48:19.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally,
at several 2019 international conventions,

00:48:19.529 --> 00:48:23.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers received
the revised <i>New World Translation </i>

00:48:23.867 --> 00:48:26.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the language of their heart.

00:48:59.636 --> 00:49:02.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can really feel the love from Jehovah.

00:49:02.272 --> 00:49:04.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s given us this wonderful gift

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:07.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he wants us to know
that the words in this book

00:49:07.911 --> 00:49:09.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
are from him.

00:49:11.048 --> 00:49:14.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
The conventions also gave
thousands the opportunity

00:49:14.117 --> 00:49:16.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
to express their love for Jehovah

00:49:16.186 --> 00:49:19.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
by symbolizing their dedication to him

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:20.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
through baptism.

00:49:24.795 --> 00:49:29.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
The love among our brothers
was evident to onlookers as well.

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:31.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
The police directing traffic

00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:34.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
had less work than they normally do.

00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:38.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
The atmosphere was so contagious
that they started greeting

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:40.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
foreign and local delegates.

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:42.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were so happy.

00:49:42.813 --> 00:49:46.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
They said:
“This country does not need more police.

00:49:46.883 --> 00:49:49.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
What it needs is more Jehovah’s Witnesses!”

00:49:51.188 --> 00:49:55.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our 2019 international conventions
have given us

00:49:55.959 --> 00:49:58.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
an opportunity to demonstrate
how Jehovah’s love

00:49:58.962 --> 00:50:01.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
motivates us to love.

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:06.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as we approach
the end of this system of things,

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:10.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to need love
more than ever before.

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:12.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
we need loyalty;

00:50:12.776 --> 00:50:14.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
 of course,
we need endurance;

00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:19.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course,
we’re going to sing that song of courage.

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:21.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember what else we want

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:24.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s loyal love!

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:29.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we be determined
to imitate Him in letting

00:50:29.359 --> 00:50:34.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love never ever fail,

00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:38.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
all to Jehovah’s glory.

00:50:45.108 --> 00:50:47.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our program has focused

00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:50.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
on meeting the challenge
of bearing thorough witness.

00:50:51.248 --> 00:50:54.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we close,
here’s the video postcard

00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:58.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our Aymara-speaking brothers
and sisters in Bolivia.

00:50:59.156 --> 00:51:03.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
This South American country
is home to about 28,500 publishers

00:51:03.393 --> 00:51:07.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nearly 7,000 pioneers.

00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:11.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bolivia officially recognizes Spanish

00:51:11.068 --> 00:51:15.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 36 indigenous languages,
including Aymara.

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:17.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of the country’s 11 million people,

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:21.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 1.6 million speak Aymara.

00:51:21.411 --> 00:51:26.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the remote translation office
in the city of El Alto.

00:51:26.316 --> 00:51:28.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty translators are helping

00:51:28.385 --> 00:51:32.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide Bible-based literature
in the Aymara language.

00:51:32.989 --> 00:51:34.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2017,

00:51:34.991 --> 00:51:38.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>New World Translation </i>
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures </i>

00:51:38.228 --> 00:51:40.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
was released in Aymara.

00:51:40.564 --> 00:51:43.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of the Aymara-speaking territory

00:51:43.266 --> 00:51:45.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
surrounds beautiful Lake Titicaca

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:49.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and includes parts of Bolivia and Peru.

00:51:49.005 --> 00:51:52.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reaching those in isolated villages involves

00:51:52.275 --> 00:51:55.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
hours of traveling and walking.

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:57.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
The response is encouraging.

00:51:58.081 --> 00:52:01.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Aymara people respect God’s Word

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:04.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
and highly appreciate spiritual discussions.

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:08.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, there are 31 Aymara congregations

00:52:08.158 --> 00:52:11.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 14 Aymara-language groups in Bolivia.

00:52:12.629 --> 00:52:16.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Copacabana Aymara Congregation is located

00:52:16.433 --> 00:52:19.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
at an altitude of 3,800 meters,

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:23.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
or nearly 12,500 feet.

00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation includes this isolated group

00:52:26.109 --> 00:52:31.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
located about an hour and a half
from Copacabana.

00:52:31.014 --> 00:52:34.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Copacabana is a very popular tourist spot.

00:52:35.619 --> 00:52:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
People come from around the world
to see Andean culture

00:52:38.788 --> 00:52:40.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beautiful Lake Titicaca.

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
The congregation engages

00:52:42.759 --> 00:52:45.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
in many forms of public witnessing.

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:49.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their territory even includes
an island in the middle of the lake.

00:52:51.201 --> 00:52:53.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters

00:52:53.203 --> 00:52:56.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Copacabana Aymara Congregation

00:52:56.072 --> 00:52:59.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you
their warm Christian love and greetings.

00:53:00.443 --> 00:53:04.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:07.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
