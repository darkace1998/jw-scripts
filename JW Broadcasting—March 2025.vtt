Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:07.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so happy you could join us.

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the next hour,
we’ll learn why putting Jehovah’s will

00:00:10.781 --> 00:00:14.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of our own interests improves our life

00:00:14.034 --> 00:00:16.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and protects us from harm.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:19.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all appreciate being recognized by others.

00:00:19.373 --> 00:00:22.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
In an interview,
we’ll see why recognition

00:00:22.251 --> 00:00:25.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah brings the most joy.

00:00:26.463 --> 00:00:29.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a young person
looking to start a career?

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you’ll appreciate learning
how two young Witnesses

00:00:33.137 --> 00:00:36.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
found work to support themselves
in their ministry.

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:41.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll see how husbands and wives
can work as a team

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
to increase the love and peace in marriage.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the March 2025 edition
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:11.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our theme this month is

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:15.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep Seeking Great Things for Jehovah.”

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:18.265 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s based on some powerful advice

00:01:18.265 --> 00:01:21.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah gave to a man named Baruch.

00:01:21.393 --> 00:01:23.020 line:10% position:50% align:center
Who was Baruch?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can his example teach us?

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can the divine counsel
he received help us today?

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:31.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out.

00:01:32.112 --> 00:01:35.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch was a faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
He appears in the Bible book of Jeremiah

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the year 625 B.C.E.

00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:43.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start our journey

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
by reading Jeremiah 45:1:

00:01:48.963 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
“spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah

00:01:54.468 --> 00:01:58.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when he wrote in a book
these words dictated by Jeremiah

00:01:58.931 --> 00:02:02.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the fourth year
of Jehoiakim son of Josiah,

00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:04.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
the king of Judah.”

00:02:05.354 --> 00:02:09.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch served
as Jeremiah’s personal secretary.

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:13.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two worked closely together
for some 18 years,

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:18.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
including after the destruction
of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.

00:02:18.617 --> 00:02:22.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was certainly
a special privilege of service

00:02:22.037 --> 00:02:24.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
during a very challenging time.

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why did Jeremiah need an assistant?

00:02:29.003 --> 00:02:30.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some 23 years,

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah had been conveying a message
of judgment and hope

00:02:34.258 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
to God’s people in Judah.

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:39.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the year 625 B.C.E.,

00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:43.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seems that Jeremiah
had been barred from the temple area

00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:45.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah’s message was to be read.

00:02:45.936 --> 00:02:48.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, Jehovah asked Jeremiah

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
to write His warnings in a scroll.

00:02:52.317 --> 00:02:55.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where Baruch,
a scribe (or, secretary),

00:02:55.654 --> 00:02:57.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes into the picture.

00:02:57.364 --> 00:03:01.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote in a scroll
all the words that Jehovah had spoken

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
through Jeremiah up until that time

00:03:04.038 --> 00:03:06.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
—23 years’ worth!

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:10.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following year, when the time came
for the contents of that scroll

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be read aloud in the temple courtyard,

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah asked Baruch to deliver the message.

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, Baruch did just so.

00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:22.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened next?

00:03:22.347 --> 00:03:26.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the princes of Judah
heard what Baruch had done,

00:03:26.018 --> 00:03:28.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
they wanted to hear the message firsthand.

00:03:28.937 --> 00:03:31.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Baruch read it out loud again.

00:03:32.191 --> 00:03:35.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As soon as they heard [it],”
the account says

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they looked at one another in dread.”

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:43.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told Baruch: “We must certainly tell
the king all these words.”

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:46.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before doing so, they warned Baruch:

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:49.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go and hide yourselves, you and Jeremiah,

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:52.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not let anyone know where you are.”

00:03:53.337 --> 00:03:58.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wicked King Jehoiakim was hot with anger!

00:03:58.884 --> 00:04:00.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
He burned the scroll

00:04:00.594 --> 00:04:04.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ordered that Jeremiah
and Baruch be arrested.

00:04:05.724 --> 00:04:08.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s pause and think.

00:04:08.936 --> 00:04:13.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
From what we’ve considered so far,
what can we learn from Baruch?

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:17.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he was humble.

00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:22.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many scholars believe that he belonged
to a prominent scribal family.

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:25.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, when the invitation came
to help Jeremiah,

00:04:25.077 --> 00:04:27.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch “proceeded to do according to all

00:04:27.579 --> 00:04:30.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him.”

00:04:30.833 --> 00:04:33.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like you, brothers and sisters,

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:37.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch was happy to support Jehovah’s work

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to do whatever was asked of him.

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:45.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not let his family status
or personal goals distract him.

00:04:45.597 --> 00:04:47.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he was humble,

00:04:47.975 --> 00:04:51.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
he put Jehovah’s will first in his life.

00:04:52.354 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch also demonstrated endurance.

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:59.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think putting 23 years’ worth

00:04:59.611 --> 00:05:02.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
of divine messages in writing took some time?

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:04.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:09.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch didn’t have a modern tool,
such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer.

00:05:09.037 --> 00:05:12.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a lot of manual work.

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:16.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
And imagine Baruch’s shock

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:19.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the king burned up the first scroll.

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:22.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was Jehovah’s message.

00:05:22.426 --> 00:05:26.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the scroll that Baruch
had written by hand

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hours of work up in smoke!

00:05:31.226 --> 00:05:35.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 36:32 says:

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:41.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jeremiah then took another scroll
and gave it to Baruch . . . ,

00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:43.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and at Jeremiah’s dictation

00:05:43.405 --> 00:05:46.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he wrote on it all the words of the scroll

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:49.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that King Jehoiakim of Judah
had burned in the fire.

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many more words like those were added.”

00:05:54.958 --> 00:05:58.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Baruch, we too need endurance

00:05:58.337 --> 00:06:02.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stick to our sacred work
when there are challenges.

00:06:02.966 --> 00:06:06.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider, too, Baruch’s courage.

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:10.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
He must have known how dangerous
it would be to work with Jeremiah.

00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:14.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier, the same king
that burned up the scroll

00:06:14.102 --> 00:06:16.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
killed another prophet of Jehovah,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:18.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Urijah, by the sword.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Baruch fearlessly used his
professional skills and contacts

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support Jehovah’s prophet.

00:06:27.282 --> 00:06:31.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s so much we can learn
from this God-fearing man

00:06:31.203 --> 00:06:33.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
who demonstrated humility,

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:36.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
endurance, and courage.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:39.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved Baruch, and so do we.

00:06:41.296 --> 00:06:44.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Baruch, like us,

00:06:44.132 --> 00:06:47.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
confronted negative thoughts and feelings.

00:06:47.135 --> 00:06:50.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was one challenge
that could have cost him dearly.

00:06:50.847 --> 00:06:52.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it?

00:06:52.307 --> 00:06:54.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s continue the reading

00:06:54.309 --> 00:06:57.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Jeremiah 45:2, 3.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:02.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please note
Jehovah’s personal interest in Baruch.

00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:05.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 45:2, 3 says:

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:09.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says

00:07:09.783 --> 00:07:12.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“concerning you, Baruch,

00:07:12.369 --> 00:07:15.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You have said: “Woe to me,

00:07:15.664 --> 00:07:18.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“for Jehovah has added grief to my pain!

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“I am weary from my groaning,

00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:24.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have found no resting-place.”’”

00:07:26.133 --> 00:07:29.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was Baruch feeling like that?

00:07:29.428 --> 00:07:32.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he getting tired of his assignment

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps the circumstances
in which he had to perform it?

00:07:35.809 --> 00:07:38.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep reading verses 4 and 5:

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:41.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You should say to him,

00:07:41.898 --> 00:07:44.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This is what Jehovah says:

00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:48.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Look! What I have built up

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:50.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“I am tearing down,

00:07:50.365 --> 00:07:53.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“and what I have planted I am uprooting

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:55.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“—the entire land.

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:59.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“But you are seeking
great things for yourself.

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:02.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Stop seeking such things.

00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:05.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For I am about to bring
a calamity on all flesh,”

00:08:05.756 --> 00:08:09.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘declares Jehovah, “and wherever you may go,

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:12.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will grant you your life as a spoil.”’”

00:08:15.057 --> 00:08:19.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
What reason did Jehovah give
for Baruch’s feelings?

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:24.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not the assignment itself
or even his circumstances.

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:29.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 5, Jehovah said:
“You are seeking great things for yourself.”

00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:32.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about that.

00:08:32.366 --> 00:08:34.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was Baruch’s own view

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what seemed great or most important.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:43.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a time, he was focused
on “seeking great things” for himself.

00:08:44.211 --> 00:08:47.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think
those “great things” could have been?

00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:51.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it a desire for fame or prestige?

00:08:51.343 --> 00:08:54.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he sensing
that his support for God’s prophet

00:08:54.471 --> 00:08:58.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
was putting at risk his position and career?

00:08:58.058 --> 00:09:01.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or did the “great things”
have to do with getting more money,

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:03.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
property, or some material possessions?

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know,
but Baruch knew what they were.

00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:12.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah’s counsel was clear:
“Stop seeking such things.”

00:09:13.407 --> 00:09:17.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems Baruch
took Jehovah’s counsel to heart.

00:09:18.328 --> 00:09:22.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
I imagine him reasoning something like this:

00:09:22.999 --> 00:09:27.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah knows my thoughts and feelings.

00:09:28.255 --> 00:09:31.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Have I really been seeking
great things for myself?

00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:34.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s true.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:36.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah is always right.

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:38.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My desires got the better of me,

00:09:38.932 --> 00:09:41.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and I was so distressed!

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:46.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘But Jehovah is kindly telling me:
“Baruch, be realistic.

00:09:46.356 --> 00:09:48.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“A divine judgment is coming.

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:52.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Everything that seems so stable
will be uprooted.”

00:09:53.613 --> 00:09:58.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Material things, property,
money, or a prominent career

00:09:58.076 --> 00:09:59.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘—it’s all temporary.

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:02.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Seeking those things is dangerous.

00:10:03.331 --> 00:10:06.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah wants me and others

00:10:06.543 --> 00:10:09.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to survive the coming calamity.

00:10:09.504 --> 00:10:12.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And that’s what I want.

00:10:12.299 --> 00:10:17.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need to get back to seeking
great things for Jehovah!’

00:10:18.388 --> 00:10:23.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s just a possibility
of how Baruch might have been thinking.

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did he accept and follow the counsel?

00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:28.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:10:28.607 --> 00:10:33.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem,
about 17 years later,

00:10:33.612 --> 00:10:36.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch appears again in the inspired record,

00:10:36.615 --> 00:10:38.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
supporting Jeremiah.

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:40.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
And though many others died

00:10:40.577 --> 00:10:43.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the catastrophic
destruction of Jerusalem,

00:10:43.538 --> 00:10:46.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch and Jeremiah survived.

00:10:46.791 --> 00:10:50.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch’s humble response
to Jehovah’s counsel

00:10:50.253 --> 00:10:52.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
saved his life.

00:10:53.507 --> 00:10:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
And such a response to divine counsel

00:10:57.093 --> 00:10:59.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
can do the same for us.

00:11:00.347 --> 00:11:02.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure, as you think more about Baruch,

00:11:02.807 --> 00:11:06.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see other ways
we can benefit from his example.

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:10.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s briefly discuss
one particular challenge that some of us

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:15.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be facing right now
and how Baruch’s experience can help.

00:11:15.654 --> 00:11:17.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
The challenge:

00:11:17.489 --> 00:11:20.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
being balanced while providing materially

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:22.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ourselves and our families.

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
In today’s world,

00:11:25.247 --> 00:11:29.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people
are “seeking great things” for themselves

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:33.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they pursue
secular education and secular work.

00:11:33.630 --> 00:11:36.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many believe that the key to success

00:11:36.883 --> 00:11:39.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the key
to their and their family’s happiness

00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:43.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves money
and getting more material things,

00:11:43.223 --> 00:11:47.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a “resting-place,”
in this system of things.

00:11:47.686 --> 00:11:50.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such thinking could influence us.

00:11:51.815 --> 00:11:55.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re a family head, consider Chibisa.

00:11:55.902 --> 00:11:57.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a brother in Malawi

00:11:57.946 --> 00:12:02.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
who, along with his wife and seven children,
was doing well spiritually.

00:12:02.576 --> 00:12:07.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, at one point,
they faced financial problems.

00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:11.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, there was not enough money
to buy food for each day.

00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:13.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
How stressful!

00:12:13.795 --> 00:12:18.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like many others, Chibisa decided
to go to South Africa to find work.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a personal decision.

00:12:21.428 --> 00:12:23.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was it wise?

00:12:23.805 --> 00:12:27.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back, Chibisa said this:

00:12:27.267 --> 00:12:30.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This affected me spiritually

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because I did not know the language,

00:12:32.397 --> 00:12:36.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was unable to preach,
and I did not benefit from the meetings.

00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:38.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Being so far from my family

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:42.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“caused me to neglect
my responsibility as a family head.

00:12:42.616 --> 00:12:47.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a result,
my family grew weak spiritually

00:12:47.287 --> 00:12:50.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we all missed each other very much.

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:54.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I realized that I had made
a wrong decision going abroad.

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:57.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.”

00:12:59.758 --> 00:13:02.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
You parents must also make personal decisions

00:13:02.886 --> 00:13:06.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
about secular education for your children.

00:13:06.473 --> 00:13:09.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Naturally, you want them
to get a good education.

00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:14.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you have to think carefully
about potential dangers.

00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in some countries,

00:13:16.232 --> 00:13:20.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
parents send their young children
away to boarding schools.

00:13:20.362 --> 00:13:23.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
The March 15, 1997, issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:26.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
discussed the Scriptural principles involved

00:13:26.826 --> 00:13:30.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and related a number of experiences
highlighting the dangers.

00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:35.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother named Clement said
that before going away to boarding school,

00:13:35.168 --> 00:13:39.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
he loved the truth
and enjoyed participating in the ministry,

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
in family worship, and at meetings.

00:13:42.258 --> 00:13:44.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However,” he said,

00:13:44.052 --> 00:13:47.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“once I went into boarding school
at the age of 14,

00:13:47.639 --> 00:13:50.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I left the truth completely.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Throughout the five years
I spent in boarding school,

00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:55.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I never attended meetings.

00:13:55.146 --> 00:13:58.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a result of bad company,
I got involved with drugs,

00:13:58.441 --> 00:14:00.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
smoking, and heavy drinking.”

00:14:02.278 --> 00:14:04.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider one more situation.

00:14:04.864 --> 00:14:07.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
You younger Christians approaching adulthood

00:14:07.701 --> 00:14:10.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
must make decisions involving

00:14:10.036 --> 00:14:12.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
education and employment.

00:14:12.747 --> 00:14:14.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
There may be many choices.

00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:19.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
But which ones will help you
live up to your dedication to Jehovah?

00:14:19.295 --> 00:14:21.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister said this:

00:14:21.381 --> 00:14:24.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a baptized Witness,
I had read and heard

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about the dangers
of pursuing university education,

00:14:27.887 --> 00:14:30.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I dismissed such warnings.

00:14:30.181 --> 00:14:34.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought the counsel did not apply to me.”

00:14:35.186 --> 00:14:38.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our sister
made her personal choice in the matter.

00:14:38.356 --> 00:14:40.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was it a wise one?

00:14:40.316 --> 00:14:42.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
She continues:

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:46.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Studying for my courses
took so much time and effort

00:14:46.614 --> 00:14:48.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I was too busy

00:14:48.825 --> 00:14:51.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to linger in prayer to Jehovah
the way I used to,

00:14:51.786 --> 00:14:55.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“too exhausted to enjoy
Bible discussions with others,

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:58.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and too tired
to prepare well for the meetings.

00:14:58.918 --> 00:15:02.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thankfully, once I realized
that being immersed in higher education

00:15:02.797 --> 00:15:05.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was damaging my relationship with Jehovah,

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:07.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I knew I had to stop.

00:15:07.844 --> 00:15:09.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I did.”

00:15:11.014 --> 00:15:15.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of what do these
real-life examples remind us?

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:19.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Satan’s system of things,
we will face challenges

00:15:19.272 --> 00:15:21.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
that test our determination

00:15:21.816 --> 00:15:24.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put Jehovah’s will first in our lives.

00:15:24.861 --> 00:15:29.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Baruch,
personal desires could distract us.

00:15:29.282 --> 00:15:31.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that ever happens,

00:15:31.034 --> 00:15:35.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to take quick action
to correct our viewpoint, as did Baruch.

00:15:36.623 --> 00:15:38.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Happily, through the Bible

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:41.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual instruction
from the faithful slave,

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:45.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah helps us make
better choices in personal areas of life,

00:15:45.632 --> 00:15:50.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as those involving
secular education and secular work.

00:15:50.303 --> 00:15:53.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 32:8, he promises:

00:15:55.141 --> 00:16:00.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will give you insight
and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:16:00.188 --> 00:16:04.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.”

00:16:06.027 --> 00:16:11.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are wise to seek out
such advice by doing research,

00:16:11.074 --> 00:16:15.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
by talking to mature Christians,
and then applying such counsel.

00:16:15.912 --> 00:16:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chibisa did that.

00:16:17.997 --> 00:16:22.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
After moving to South Africa,
his conscience started bothering him

00:16:22.168 --> 00:16:25.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he remembered the example of Baruch.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chibisa said this:

00:16:27.382 --> 00:16:32.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Baruch may have wanted
to pursue material riches as I had.

00:16:32.387 --> 00:16:35.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he was helped, he returned.

00:16:35.473 --> 00:16:39.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I decided then to put Jehovah in first place

00:16:39.352 --> 00:16:41.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“instead of searching for material things.

00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:46.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So I started to make changes to go home
and help my family spiritually.

00:16:46.317 --> 00:16:50.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I left South Africa
and reached the border of Malawi . . . ,

00:16:50.154 --> 00:16:52.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I felt great happiness in my heart,

00:16:52.782 --> 00:16:55.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I am still happy . . .

00:16:55.034 --> 00:16:57.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Studying the Bible has helped me.

00:16:57.412 --> 00:17:00.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We still encounter financial problems,

00:17:00.206 --> 00:17:02.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I remember that in Satan’s world,

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:06.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there is nowhere we can go
and have no problems. . . .

00:17:06.462 --> 00:17:09.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My family is progressing spiritually.

00:17:09.674 --> 00:17:13.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this makes me very happy,

00:17:13.303 --> 00:17:17.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my relationship
with Jehovah is strong.”

00:17:18.808 --> 00:17:20.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Baruch,

00:17:20.351 --> 00:17:24.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chibisa was humble and courageous.

00:17:24.814 --> 00:17:27.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know those same qualities

00:17:27.358 --> 00:17:30.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
characterize you, brothers and sisters!

00:17:30.695 --> 00:17:33.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when Jehovah, our loving Father,

00:17:33.323 --> 00:17:37.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us timely advice,
as he did to his close friend Baruch,

00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:39.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s take it to heart.

00:17:39.913 --> 00:17:43.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s do whatever it takes
to make sure we and our families

00:17:43.917 --> 00:17:48.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue “seeking first the Kingdom
and [God’s] righteousness.”

00:17:48.087 --> 00:17:49.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
And never forget,

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:53.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we continue to seek
great things for Jehovah,

00:17:53.676 --> 00:17:57.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll continue to do great things
for us and our families!

00:17:57.764 --> 00:18:02.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it’s his blessing
that makes us truly rich,

00:18:02.352 --> 00:18:05.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he adds no pain with it.”

00:18:07.857 --> 00:18:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever felt unseen
in a theocratic assignment

00:18:12.528 --> 00:18:16.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
or forgotten about when
you’re no longer in it?

00:18:16.115 --> 00:18:20.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you’ll appreciate
how a brother named Avinash

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:24.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the Cotterell family
adjusted their thinking.

00:18:24.123 --> 00:18:26.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note how they found joy

00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:28.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
in seeking recognition from Jehovah

00:18:28.670 --> 00:18:31.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than from others.

00:18:43.393 --> 00:18:45.103 line:10% position:50% align:center
I worked in an office

00:18:45.103 --> 00:18:46.604 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the financial district.

00:18:46.604 --> 00:18:48.731 line:10% position:50% align:center
I enjoyed everything about working there

00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:51.734 line:10% position:50% align:center
—passing these tall skyscrapers,

00:18:51.734 --> 00:18:53.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
institutions with big names.

00:18:55.238 --> 00:18:58.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
In terms of what I wanted from life,

00:18:58.491 --> 00:19:00.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
at that time, it was great.

00:19:00.076 --> 00:19:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spiritually, it was not the best at all.

00:19:04.038 --> 00:19:05.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to make yourself stand out.

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:09.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really, you know,
affected my personality.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t even realize it at the time.

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:18.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was pioneering, and I decided
to apply for Bethel and was accepted.

00:19:18.594 --> 00:19:20.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
My assignment was to do cleaning.

00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:23.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from my background, that kind of work 

00:19:23.808 --> 00:19:26.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
was something that was looked down on.

00:19:26.436 --> 00:19:27.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not something you would choose to do.

00:19:27.937 --> 00:19:31.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was used to an environment 
where if you did well,

00:19:31.357 --> 00:19:35.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could move to the next step
and you’d be recognized for it.

00:19:35.028 --> 00:19:38.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this was the case for me
—that I derived so much value

00:19:38.865 --> 00:19:41.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
from these external things, these privileges,

00:19:41.784 --> 00:19:43.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being set apart from others.

00:19:43.828 --> 00:19:47.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thrived on that commendation, both at work

00:19:47.874 --> 00:19:49.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the congregation.

00:19:49.625 --> 00:19:50.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you don’t get it,

00:19:50.835 --> 00:19:53.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you feel lost a little bit.

00:19:53.254 --> 00:19:56.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other brothers were getting more recognition,

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that just played in my head a little bit.

00:20:00.678 --> 00:20:05.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
The spiritual environment in Bethel
has taught me and is teaching me

00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:10.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our value has nothing to do
with the privileges that we enjoy.

00:20:12.148 --> 00:20:14.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we feed off the recognition from men,

00:20:14.859 --> 00:20:18.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s almost like we’re chasing the next,

00:20:18.696 --> 00:20:21.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know, the next compliment
or the next praise.

00:20:21.407 --> 00:20:24.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can always feel like
you’re chasing happiness.

00:20:24.619 --> 00:20:29.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know, switching my thinking
to thinking about Jehovah’s recognition

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives you more peace; it’s more sustainable.

00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:36.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it really helped me to see

00:20:36.047 --> 00:20:38.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no matter what circumstances I’m in,

00:20:38.549 --> 00:20:40.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can be happy; I can be joyful.

00:20:40.718 --> 00:20:44.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been good molding, yeah.

00:20:53.523 --> 00:20:55.775 line:10% position:50% align:center
Sandy and I got married in 2003.

00:20:55.775 --> 00:20:57.902 line:10% position:50% align:center
Sandy was pioneering back then,

00:20:57.902 --> 00:20:59.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
and I was happy to support her.

00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:03.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we found out
that we were expecting a baby.

00:21:03.324 --> 00:21:05.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were really excited.

00:21:05.034 --> 00:21:06.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still was hoping that after 

00:21:06.828 --> 00:21:09.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had the baby,

00:21:09.455 --> 00:21:12.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be able to continue pioneering.

00:21:12.625 --> 00:21:14.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the plan anyway.

00:21:14.418 --> 00:21:17.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just thought to ourselves:
‘We can grow them up.

00:21:17.213 --> 00:21:19.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can serve Jehovah and go to Bethel.’

00:21:19.465 --> 00:21:21.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s all the stuff
that you’d want your child to do.

00:21:23.845 --> 00:21:28.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day very late on in the pregnancy,
I received a phone call from Sandy.

00:21:28.432 --> 00:21:31.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was rushed into hospital
for an emergency cesarean

00:21:31.686 --> 00:21:33.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
and everything changed.

00:21:36.232 --> 00:21:38.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so glad that he made it through,

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:42.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thankfully, he survived.

00:21:42.113 --> 00:21:45.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later on, we found out that he had

00:21:45.533 --> 00:21:48.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
severe brain damage.

00:21:50.204 --> 00:21:53.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to learn
how to operate medical machinery;

00:21:53.666 --> 00:21:55.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to learn what a syringe was;

00:21:55.042 --> 00:21:57.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
we had to learn so much stuff

00:21:57.712 --> 00:22:00.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we never even had to think about before.

00:22:01.382 --> 00:22:03.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I used to feel like,

00:22:03.551 --> 00:22:07.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why is our path to get to the new world

00:22:07.847 --> 00:22:10.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
harder than other brothers and sisters?’

00:22:10.975 --> 00:22:14.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt isolated and lonely

00:22:14.145 --> 00:22:16.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I felt that no one understood

00:22:16.898 --> 00:22:20.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
what I was going through
and what it felt like.

00:22:20.234 --> 00:22:23.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one around me was in my situation.

00:22:23.654 --> 00:22:26.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really enjoyed the assemblies.

00:22:26.407 --> 00:22:28.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like, we would sit near the front, didn’t we?

00:22:28.743 --> 00:22:29.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we could concentrate.

00:22:29.785 --> 00:22:32.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that we could focus on what was going on.

00:22:32.121 --> 00:22:34.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then all of a sudden, Eden is born.

00:22:34.165 --> 00:22:37.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re at the back—right at the back!

00:22:37.919 --> 00:22:39.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:22:39.503 --> 00:22:42.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very, very hard to accept

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
that although I wanted to be somewhere

00:22:45.218 --> 00:22:47.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a certain time spiritually, that it was—

00:22:47.887 --> 00:22:51.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
It just wasn’t going to happen because I was
in a completely different situation.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eden now has a little sister, 

00:22:57.939 --> 00:23:01.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Angel, who is also a blessing from Jehovah.

00:23:01.734 --> 00:23:05.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although our goals in life changed

00:23:05.529 --> 00:23:08.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we might not be able to do
as much as we used to do,

00:23:08.074 --> 00:23:09.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that Jehovah

00:23:09.242 --> 00:23:13.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
is really appreciative of everything
that we do.

00:23:13.162 --> 00:23:14.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a family,

00:23:14.747 --> 00:23:17.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have set a goal
of being out in the ministry together

00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:19.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
at least once a month.

00:23:19.126 --> 00:23:23.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes a lot to get Eden ready
—a lot of preparation

00:23:23.047 --> 00:23:24.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a lot of medication.

00:23:24.882 --> 00:23:29.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are a lot of hidden things
that the congregation doesn’t see.

00:23:29.262 --> 00:23:32.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah has seen us

00:23:32.390 --> 00:23:35.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
struggling in the evenings;

00:23:35.184 --> 00:23:37.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s looking at the sleepless nights.

00:23:37.853 --> 00:23:39.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
He can help you

00:23:39.397 --> 00:23:43.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cope, to be happy with small blessings.

00:23:43.025 --> 00:23:47.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t do it every day, but I try
to write down what I’m grateful for,

00:23:47.488 --> 00:23:50.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah has given me.

00:23:50.032 --> 00:23:53.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this really helps me
not only to be focused

00:23:53.703 --> 00:23:55.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to have more appreciative prayers

00:23:55.705 --> 00:23:58.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah about what he’s doing for me now.

00:23:58.457 --> 00:24:02.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that Jehovah values our family.

00:24:04.297 --> 00:24:06.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it comforting to know

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:10.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah recognizes our whole-souled service,

00:24:10.303 --> 00:24:12.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when it feels like others don’t?

00:24:13.597 --> 00:24:16.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us need to work to support ourselves,

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
but finding the type of work
that allows us to serve Jehovah

00:24:20.187 --> 00:24:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
whole-souled may be challenging.

00:24:22.398 --> 00:24:24.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how Bible principles influenced

00:24:24.775 --> 00:24:28.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
the career decisions of two young publishers.

00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:40.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was it difficult to choose a career?

00:24:42.126 --> 00:24:44.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most in my family have a university degree.

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:48.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some are lawyers, engineers,
accountants, and so on.

00:24:48.549 --> 00:24:51.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they expected me
to go to university as well.

00:24:51.677 --> 00:24:55.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told me:
“We don’t have a doctor in the family yet.

00:24:55.056 --> 00:24:57.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
We think you should study medicine.”

00:24:58.559 --> 00:25:01.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was 16,
I was about to leave high school.

00:25:01.062 --> 00:25:04.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of my schoolmates
were planning to study at university

00:25:04.357 --> 00:25:07.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would say things like:
“I want to go to this school.

00:25:07.151 --> 00:25:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which one are you going to?”

00:25:08.778 --> 00:25:11.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt a lot of pressure
to get a higher education.

00:25:11.906 --> 00:25:15.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
My teachers told me
that I needed to continue my studies

00:25:15.284 --> 00:25:17.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
if I really wanted to make money.

00:25:17.828 --> 00:25:19.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to be a teacher,

00:25:19.997 --> 00:25:22.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there was so much pressure from my family

00:25:22.124 --> 00:25:26.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study something that would
allow me to have a higher salary.

00:25:26.128 --> 00:25:30.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were times when I felt
overwhelmed because of the pressure.

00:25:30.633 --> 00:25:34.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even after I graduated from high school,
a teacher contacted me

00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:38.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that I was planning
to go to university and, in his words,

00:25:38.808 --> 00:25:42.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
“actually become someone in this world.”

00:25:42.061 --> 00:25:46.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started
a six-year psychology degree at university.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:51.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at the same time, I was studying
for a teacher’s certificate on the weekends.

00:25:52.071 --> 00:25:56.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on top of all of that,
I was working part-time.

00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:58.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was trying to do everything.

00:26:02.289 --> 00:26:04.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped you make a good decision?

00:26:06.001 --> 00:26:09.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
I spoke with my mom about what I should do.

00:26:09.213 --> 00:26:11.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
She helped me
to think about some of the dangers

00:26:11.715 --> 00:26:14.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be exposed to at university,

00:26:14.135 --> 00:26:17.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
things that could endanger me
in a spiritual sense.

00:26:19.098 --> 00:26:21.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
After about two years, it became clear

00:26:21.308 --> 00:26:23.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I couldn’t continue
with such a busy routine.

00:26:23.519 --> 00:26:25.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed to make a change.

00:26:27.273 --> 00:26:29.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remembered some advice I got from a friend.

00:26:29.275 --> 00:26:31.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had studied to become an accountant
when he was young,

00:26:31.944 --> 00:26:33.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now he sells chilies.

00:26:33.988 --> 00:26:37.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
He jokingly said,
“So now I’m counting chilies,

00:26:37.158 --> 00:26:39.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I guess you could say
that it is what I studied.”

00:26:41.328 --> 00:26:43.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
He explained that many people end up in jobs

00:26:43.747 --> 00:26:47.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have nothing to do
with their university degree.

00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:49.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians 1:10 helped me.

00:26:49.712 --> 00:26:53.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says that we should
“make sure of the more important things.”

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:56.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that finding a job was important,

00:26:56.427 --> 00:27:00.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was more important
that I had time for Jehovah.

00:27:00.931 --> 00:27:05.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve always loved Jehovah’s promise
at Matthew 6:33,

00:27:05.352 --> 00:27:09.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he says that he will
make sure we have what we need

00:27:09.398 --> 00:27:12.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we keep “seeking first the Kingdom
and his righteousness.”

00:27:12.526 --> 00:27:16.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had already seen this promise
come true in my life,

00:27:16.322 --> 00:27:20.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I trusted that Jehovah
would continue to provide for me.

00:27:20.576 --> 00:27:23.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that if I studied at university,

00:27:23.329 --> 00:27:26.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be losing valuable time
during my youth

00:27:26.707 --> 00:27:30.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
—time that I could be using for Jehovah.

00:27:30.294 --> 00:27:33.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we have many
different options in front of us,

00:27:33.672 --> 00:27:36.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we know that we need to adjust our course.

00:27:36.717 --> 00:27:40.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when looking to Bible principles
can help us to choose the right path.

00:27:42.598 --> 00:27:44.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father has a barbershop,

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:46.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he offered to teach me
how to be a barber.

00:27:46.477 --> 00:27:51.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents told me,
“People will always need a haircut.”

00:27:51.023 --> 00:27:55.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
So even though I knew
I wouldn’t be making millions as a barber,

00:27:55.402 --> 00:27:58.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was work that would always be in demand.

00:27:58.572 --> 00:28:02.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided to leave university
halfway through my degree

00:28:02.409 --> 00:28:04.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look for part-time teaching work.

00:28:05.871 --> 00:28:08.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
During that time, I prayed so much,

00:28:08.290 --> 00:28:10.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking Jehovah to bless my decision.

00:28:13.921 --> 00:28:16.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
What benefits have come from your decisions?

00:28:18.008 --> 00:28:18.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m my own boss.

00:28:18.926 --> 00:28:20.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
I work in a barbershop

00:28:20.511 --> 00:28:23.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also travel to people’s homes
and give them haircuts.

00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:26.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have the freedom to decide
the days and hours that I work.

00:28:28.018 --> 00:28:29.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah answered my prayers.

00:28:29.895 --> 00:28:33.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to find part-time work
teaching at a school,

00:28:33.274 --> 00:28:35.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
which allows me
to be in the full-time service

00:28:35.276 --> 00:28:37.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with my husband.

00:28:38.612 --> 00:28:41.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the flexibility
I have with my work,

00:28:41.031 --> 00:28:43.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
I enjoy opportunities to participate

00:28:43.284 --> 00:28:46.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
in construction projects
for the organization.

00:28:46.829 --> 00:28:50.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve seen clearly that by focusing
on what’s most important,

00:28:50.416 --> 00:28:52.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has blessed me.

00:28:53.210 --> 00:28:56.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
I continue to see the fulfillment
of Matthew 6:33 in my life.

00:28:56.964 --> 00:29:00.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has always provided what I needed.

00:29:13.355 --> 00:29:17.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re having trouble
choosing the right type of work,

00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:20.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider talking to others
about how they chose jobs

00:29:20.362 --> 00:29:23.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
that allow them to actively serve Jehovah.

00:29:23.157 --> 00:29:25.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most important, pray.

00:29:25.367 --> 00:29:27.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Share your feelings with Jehovah.

00:29:27.953 --> 00:29:32.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell him about your needs,
goals, and preferences.

00:29:32.082 --> 00:29:35.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, no one
is more interested in providing

00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:39.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you materially
and spiritually than Jehovah.

00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:42.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among those who benefit

00:29:42.301 --> 00:29:46.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
from turning to Jehovah
for direction are missionaries.

00:29:46.305 --> 00:29:49.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
This episode of <i>Our History in Motion</i>

00:29:49.350 --> 00:29:53.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows how Jehovah
has used self-sacrificing missionaries

00:29:53.187 --> 00:29:55.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
to spearhead the global preaching work

00:29:55.606 --> 00:29:58.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:30:00.402 --> 00:30:03.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will be witnesses of me . . .
to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:30:04.782 --> 00:30:06.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nearly 2,000 years ago,

00:30:06.825 --> 00:30:10.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus laid the groundwork
for true missionary service.

00:30:11.246 --> 00:30:16.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since then, how have others
answered the call to serve as a missionary?

00:30:16.627 --> 00:30:18.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the subject of this episode

00:30:18.629 --> 00:30:21.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:30:24.343 --> 00:30:28.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first-century,
Paul, Barnabas, Mark, and others

00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:31.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveled extensively
to bring the good news to people

00:30:31.642 --> 00:30:34.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rejoiced as they saw them respond.

00:30:34.687 --> 00:30:37.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people
have continued this mission today

00:30:37.773 --> 00:30:41.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the same zeal,
tireless dedication, and joy.

00:30:41.944 --> 00:30:46.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
C. T. Russell and J. F. Rutherford
were missionaries themselves.

00:30:46.115 --> 00:30:50.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both traveled to distant lands,
such as the Philippines, France,

00:30:50.661 --> 00:30:54.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greece, Egypt, Israel, and India.

00:30:55.582 --> 00:30:58.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their goal was to reach as many as possible

00:30:58.585 --> 00:31:00.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the wonderful Kingdom message.

00:31:01.588 --> 00:31:05.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their fine example
led others to reach out and do the same.

00:31:06.218 --> 00:31:09.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1922, William R. Brown,

00:31:09.263 --> 00:31:11.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had been preaching
throughout the Caribbean,

00:31:11.598 --> 00:31:14.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
wrote to Brother Rutherford:
“I have given the witness

00:31:14.768 --> 00:31:17.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“throughout the majority
of the Caribbean Islands . . . 

00:31:17.479 --> 00:31:19.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should I go over them again?”

00:31:20.065 --> 00:31:24.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rutherford’s reply:
“Proceed to Sierra Leone, West Africa.”

00:31:26.363 --> 00:31:28.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s just what he did.

00:31:28.574 --> 00:31:32.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Brown and his family
served 27 years in West Africa,

00:31:32.578 --> 00:31:35.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
always emphasizing
the importance of the Bible,

00:31:35.414 --> 00:31:38.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
which aptly earned him
the name “Bible” Brown.

00:31:40.586 --> 00:31:44.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
When looking back
over many decades of faithful service,

00:31:44.465 --> 00:31:47.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
how did Brother Brown feel?

00:31:47.092 --> 00:31:51.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “What a joy it is
to see men and women

00:31:51.013 --> 00:31:54.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
“becoming obedient
to the good news of God’s Kingdom! . . .

00:31:54.808 --> 00:31:57.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is one of the highest privileges

00:31:57.186 --> 00:31:59.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that can be offered to a human creature,

00:31:59.563 --> 00:32:01.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be an ambassador of Jehovah!”

00:32:05.235 --> 00:32:07.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
In July of 1926,

00:32:07.362 --> 00:32:09.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
George Wright and Edwin Skinner

00:32:09.573 --> 00:32:13.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
left London on a boat
headed to Bombay, India,

00:32:13.535 --> 00:32:15.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
now known as Mumbai.

00:32:15.996 --> 00:32:19.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
There these brothers
set up a small branch office

00:32:19.082 --> 00:32:21.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
to oversee the preaching work.

00:32:21.335 --> 00:32:24.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
To spread the Kingdom message,
the two brothers would split up.

00:32:24.922 --> 00:32:27.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
One traveled deep into the land

00:32:27.049 --> 00:32:30.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
while the other stayed back
to care for the branch office matters.

00:32:31.512 --> 00:32:36.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1938, a great witness
had been given all throughout the land.

00:32:36.058 --> 00:32:38.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty-four congregations were established,

00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:41.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
literature was translated
and then distributed,

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:43.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
public meetings were arranged,

00:32:43.732 --> 00:32:46.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the good news
was even delivered by radio.

00:32:48.612 --> 00:32:50.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then came World War II.

00:32:50.906 --> 00:32:52.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in over 50 nations,

00:32:52.908 --> 00:32:55.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses
was restricted.

00:32:55.994 --> 00:32:57.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
The door appeared to be closing

00:32:57.996 --> 00:33:00.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
for accepting missionaries
in many parts of the earth.

00:33:00.749 --> 00:33:02.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
From a human standpoint,

00:33:02.876 --> 00:33:06.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
it could have seemed wise
to pause the missionary work.

00:33:07.089 --> 00:33:09.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah knew better!

00:33:09.967 --> 00:33:14.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
In September 1942,
Nathan Knorr, full of faith,

00:33:14.263 --> 00:33:18.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
proposed the establishment
of a school to train missionaries.

00:33:18.433 --> 00:33:21.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first class
of the Watchtower Bible College of Gilead

00:33:21.645 --> 00:33:26.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
began on a winter day
in upstate New York in 1943.

00:33:26.275 --> 00:33:29.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the timing turned out to be just right.

00:33:29.611 --> 00:33:31.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
As World War II ended,

00:33:31.238 --> 00:33:34.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
the door began opening back up

00:33:34.074 --> 00:33:37.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a global opportunity
awaited future missionaries.

00:33:38.537 --> 00:33:43.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back, Gilead has had
a huge impact on our worldwide growth.

00:33:44.209 --> 00:33:46.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in 1949,

00:33:46.795 --> 00:33:50.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Japan reported
less than ten local publishers.

00:33:50.424 --> 00:33:54.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly thereafter, in 1950, five sisters,

00:33:54.678 --> 00:33:58.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
graduates of the 11th class of Gilead,
arrived in Japan.

00:33:58.599 --> 00:34:02.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among them was Lois Dyer
—another missionary.

00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:07.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the next 30 years,
Lois would travel all throughout Japan,

00:34:07.274 --> 00:34:10.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
bringing the good news to people
that were hungry for it.

00:34:10.903 --> 00:34:14.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1980, Lois watched
the publishers in Japan

00:34:14.615 --> 00:34:18.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
grow from 12 to over 52,000.

00:34:18.243 --> 00:34:20.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
How rewarding!

00:34:20.954 --> 00:34:25.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2024, some 214,000 publishers

00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:27.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
preach the good news in Japan.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:32.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gilead has trained
over 9,500 zealous Kingdom proclaimers

00:34:32.674 --> 00:34:35.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
assigned to over 200 lands and island groups.

00:34:36.845 --> 00:34:38.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I often think about Gilead,

00:34:38.847 --> 00:34:41.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the effect that it has now

00:34:41.266 --> 00:34:43.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not only on the field

00:34:43.143 --> 00:34:44.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and on those that are going off

00:34:44.561 --> 00:34:46.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the missionary field

00:34:46.021 --> 00:34:48.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but also the brothers as a whole.

00:34:48.565 --> 00:34:51.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They have gone into these countries,

00:34:51.193 --> 00:34:53.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they have acclimated themselves;

00:34:53.362 --> 00:34:55.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they are a part of that country.

00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They’re just as much at home there

00:34:57.199 --> 00:34:59.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(those who have been there for a while)
as the natives.

00:34:59.618 --> 00:35:01.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And everyone that has had a part in it,

00:35:01.662 --> 00:35:06.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“either as a missionary
or those parents who have sent them off,

00:35:06.208 --> 00:35:08.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they’re never going to forget that.

00:35:08.377 --> 00:35:11.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think that is a legacy
that will continue forever.”

00:35:13.006 --> 00:35:16.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
The opportunities for missionary work
remain greater than ever.

00:35:17.427 --> 00:35:21.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, many graduates
from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers

00:35:21.598 --> 00:35:23.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
are assigned as field missionaries.

00:35:24.476 --> 00:35:27.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is still holding the door wide open.

00:35:27.729 --> 00:35:31.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hundreds of classes
are held each year all around the world.

00:35:32.401 --> 00:35:34.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you considered applying?

00:35:35.404 --> 00:35:39.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
The exciting adventure
of missionary service continues today

00:35:39.574 --> 00:35:41.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
as thousands make themselves available

00:35:41.827 --> 00:35:45.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
in imitation
of the greatest Missionary, Jesus Christ.

00:35:47.874 --> 00:35:51.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
See you next time on <i>Our History in Motion.</i>

00:35:53.338 --> 00:35:57.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to imitate
the examples of missionaries?

00:35:57.968 --> 00:36:00.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, talk to an elder in your congregation

00:36:00.595 --> 00:36:03.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
about your desire, start pioneering,

00:36:03.598 --> 00:36:08.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
and later apply to the School 
for Kingdom Evangelizers if you qualify.

00:36:09.604 --> 00:36:14.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Worship extends
beyond the ministry into our personal lives,

00:36:14.317 --> 00:36:16.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
particularly within the home.

00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:20.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re married,
note how you and your mate

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:23.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
can continue working together as a team

00:36:23.076 --> 00:36:26.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain a happy marriage.

00:36:45.807 --> 00:36:48.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
With so much that needs
to get done in a day,

00:37:04.409 --> 00:37:06.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
every day,

00:37:24.137 --> 00:37:26.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
married couples
can struggle to work together.

00:37:38.318 --> 00:37:41.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
This often leads to separate game plans.

00:37:55.127 --> 00:37:59.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
To truly be “one flesh,”
a couple needs to work together as a team.

00:38:00.632 --> 00:38:02.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
And every team needs to have a goal.

00:38:07.722 --> 00:38:10.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your goal should be
to have a loving relationship,

00:38:10.934 --> 00:38:12.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just a lasting one.

00:38:19.276 --> 00:38:21.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
When marriage mates aren’t teammates,

00:38:25.532 --> 00:38:28.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
disagreements can turn
into fierce competition.

00:38:37.711 --> 00:38:39.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate this point,

00:38:40.672 --> 00:38:44.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
imagine arguments are like a couple
playing tennis against each other.

00:38:48.638 --> 00:38:50.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only one person can win.

00:38:52.559 --> 00:38:54.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if you change your mindset

00:38:54.603 --> 00:38:56.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
from thinking ‘What do I want?’

00:38:56.855 --> 00:38:58.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘What do we want?,’

00:38:58.982 --> 00:39:00.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you’re thinking as a team

00:39:01.776 --> 00:39:05.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re able to overcome
the problem and win together.

00:39:06.573 --> 00:39:08.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once you have the team mindset,

00:39:08.617 --> 00:39:11.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you work together
as a team practically?

00:39:16.791 --> 00:39:19.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask Jehovah God for his guidance

00:39:19.878 --> 00:39:23.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to bless your efforts
to work together on the issue at hand.

00:39:25.217 --> 00:39:27.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you pray,

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:31.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk to Jehovah about your shared desire
to have a happier marriage.

00:39:37.562 --> 00:39:39.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk to each other.

00:39:40.649 --> 00:39:44.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Discuss your strong points
and where you’re not so strong.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:47.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
And see where you can
better support your partner.

00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:02.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Create a plan together
that you can both work toward.

00:40:28.405 --> 00:40:30.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think ‘What do we want?’

00:40:30.532 --> 00:40:32.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of ‘What do I want?’

00:40:42.877 --> 00:40:47.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you pray, discuss your roles,
and make a plan,

00:40:47.674 --> 00:40:50.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can have a happy marriage as a team.

00:40:59.477 --> 00:41:02.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take a moment, pause the video,

00:41:02.731 --> 00:41:05.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask each other these three questions.

00:41:06.526 --> 00:41:09.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, share your honest feelings

00:41:09.738 --> 00:41:12.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
and openly express how you both feel.

00:41:17.495 --> 00:41:21.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be confident
that when we do things Jehovah’s way,

00:41:21.583 --> 00:41:24.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll experience the best results possible.

00:41:26.046 --> 00:41:29.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we always aim
to support Jehovah’s will,

00:41:29.632 --> 00:41:32.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
could we impede it?

00:41:32.135 --> 00:41:33.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following morning worship,

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:37.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
hear Brother Splane
comment on how this could happen.

00:41:38.475 --> 00:41:40.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this morning I’m going to focus

00:41:40.518 --> 00:41:43.563 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the first words of our text.

00:41:44.272 --> 00:41:49.110 line:10% position:50% align:center
It says: “The word of God is alive

00:41:49.110 --> 00:41:51.237 line:10% position:50% align:center
and exerts power.”

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:56.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
“The word of God is alive.”

00:41:56.284 --> 00:41:58.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s no question that this text

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:03.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
does apply to God’s written Word, the Bible.

00:42:04.501 --> 00:42:09.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah had a Word.

00:42:09.881 --> 00:42:12.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Word existed

00:42:12.258 --> 00:42:16.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
even before the art of writing
was invented.

00:42:16.262 --> 00:42:18.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how long before?
We don’t know.

00:42:19.182 --> 00:42:23.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
At least as long as Jesus has been alive.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before Jesus was alive, of course,

00:42:25.939 --> 00:42:29.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had no one to speak to.

00:42:29.067 --> 00:42:31.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, with the creation of Jesus,

00:42:31.486 --> 00:42:35.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
he and his Son could communicate.

00:42:35.156 --> 00:42:36.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is God’s word?

00:42:36.783 --> 00:42:40.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve said that it’s
the “expression of [his] purpose.”

00:42:40.537 --> 00:42:44.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that means that when Jehovah says
he’s going to do something,

00:42:44.165 --> 00:42:46.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s as good as done

00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:50.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing and no one
can stand in the way.

00:42:51.464 --> 00:42:54.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
But sometimes with the best of intentions,

00:42:54.384 --> 00:42:57.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could actually get in the way
of a decision

00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:01.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a project that Jehovah approves of.

00:43:02.183 --> 00:43:04.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we have an example of this

00:43:04.185 --> 00:43:08.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an event that happened
in the lives of Esau and Jacob.

00:43:09.149 --> 00:43:12.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, who was getting
in the way in that story?

00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:15.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
The faithful man, Isaac.

00:43:17.031 --> 00:43:19.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
After 20 years of marriage,

00:43:19.075 --> 00:43:22.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac and Rebekah finally had two sons,
Esau and Jacob.

00:43:22.662 --> 00:43:25.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that Esau was the firstborn.

00:43:25.457 --> 00:43:28.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as <i>The Watchtower </i> pointed out this week,

00:43:28.376 --> 00:43:31.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
in patriarchal times
at the death of the father,

00:43:31.504 --> 00:43:34.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
why, the firstborn
took the lead in the family.

00:43:34.424 --> 00:43:37.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was the one who conducted family worship.

00:43:37.302 --> 00:43:40.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he served as a sort of priest.

00:43:40.013 --> 00:43:42.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s why the Bible speaks of priests

00:43:42.724 --> 00:43:45.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
being present at Mount Sinai

00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:48.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the Levitical priesthood was set up.

00:43:50.023 --> 00:43:52.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah had told Rebekah

00:43:52.317 --> 00:43:55.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jacob was going to have
the firstborn’s position.

00:43:55.653 --> 00:43:59.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know if he told Isaac,
but he did tell Rebekah

00:43:59.991 --> 00:44:03.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jacob was going to have
the firstborn’s position.

00:44:03.828 --> 00:44:06.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
So “the word” had gone out;

00:44:06.164 --> 00:44:09.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
the “expression of God’s purpose”
had gone out.

00:44:09.876 --> 00:44:14.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob would take precedence over Esau.

00:44:14.088 --> 00:44:16.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could anyone challenge that?

00:44:16.716 --> 00:44:18.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you consider what God’s purpose was,

00:44:18.801 --> 00:44:21.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob was the right choice, wasn’t it?

00:44:21.262 --> 00:44:23.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because what was God’s purpose?

00:44:23.264 --> 00:44:26.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was to set up a nation of worshippers,

00:44:26.851 --> 00:44:28.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who were going to worship Jehovah.

00:44:28.853 --> 00:44:30.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, between Esau and Jacob,

00:44:30.522 --> 00:44:34.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was most likely to conduct family worship

00:44:34.275 --> 00:44:36.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his children, his offspring?

00:44:36.277 --> 00:44:38.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly Jacob.

00:44:38.863 --> 00:44:41.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for the first 15 years of their lives,

00:44:41.366 --> 00:44:45.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Esau and Jacob
could probably have heard Abraham

00:44:45.078 --> 00:44:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
talk about the promise
that God had given him,

00:44:47.664 --> 00:44:49.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of the families of the earth

00:44:49.707 --> 00:44:53.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
were going to be blessed
by means of his offspring.

00:44:53.127 --> 00:44:56.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt Jacob realized
what a beautiful privilege it would be

00:44:56.923 --> 00:45:00.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share in the fulfillment of that purpose.

00:45:01.344 --> 00:45:06.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Rebekah loved the one
Jehovah loved most, Jacob.

00:45:06.849 --> 00:45:09.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac loved Esau,

00:45:09.435 --> 00:45:13.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
even after Esau
had married out of the truth twice.

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:16.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, some in full-time service

00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:19.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
have a brother or sister
who isn’t doing very well in the truth,

00:45:19.529 --> 00:45:23.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet he or she is the favorite.

00:45:23.575 --> 00:45:25.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go figure.

00:45:25.577 --> 00:45:27.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even parents in the truth

00:45:27.579 --> 00:45:32.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t always love the one Jehovah loves most.

00:45:32.709 --> 00:45:36.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one day, Isaac had a conversation
with Esau, and it’s interesting.

00:45:36.879 --> 00:45:40.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at Genesis chapter 27.

00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:42.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to read verses 1-4,

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there are a couple of lessons here
that we’re going to consider.

00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:48.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis chapter 27

00:45:48.224 --> 00:45:50.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
—we’re going to read verses 1-4.

00:45:52.478 --> 00:45:55.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Now when Isaac was old

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:58.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and his eyes were too weak to see,

00:45:58.151 --> 00:46:02.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he called Esau his older son to him
and said: ‘My son!’

00:46:02.947 --> 00:46:05.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He replied: ‘Here I am!’

00:46:05.658 --> 00:46:09.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And he went on to say:
‘I have now grown old.

00:46:09.621 --> 00:46:12.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I do not know the day of my death.

00:46:12.248 --> 00:46:16.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘So at this time take, please, your weapons,
your quiver and your bow,

00:46:16.252 --> 00:46:20.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and go out to the field
and hunt some wild game for me.

00:46:20.548 --> 00:46:25.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Then make the kind of tasty dish
that I am fond of and bring it to me.

00:46:25.428 --> 00:46:29.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Then I will eat it
so that I may bless you

00:46:29.599 --> 00:46:31.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
before I die.’”

00:46:32.894 --> 00:46:35.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before I die.”

00:46:36.064 --> 00:46:39.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Isaac was on his deathbed, right?

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wrong.

00:46:42.111 --> 00:46:43.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you do the math,

00:46:43.655 --> 00:46:46.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see that Isaac lived for 43 years

00:46:46.991 --> 00:46:49.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
after he had that last meal.

00:46:49.619 --> 00:46:52.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can understand
why he felt that he was on his last legs

00:46:52.789 --> 00:46:54.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
—because he was blind.

00:46:54.791 --> 00:46:56.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
He couldn’t do what he used to do,

00:46:56.959 --> 00:46:59.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so he probably thought
that his life was over.

00:46:59.629 --> 00:47:01.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that could happen to any one of us.

00:47:01.631 --> 00:47:04.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, if we’re in constant pain
or we’re crippled,

00:47:04.467 --> 00:47:07.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, we might think we’re finished.

00:47:07.470 --> 00:47:09.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the lesson:

00:47:09.472 --> 00:47:13.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what your limitations are,
don’t give up on life.

00:47:13.643 --> 00:47:17.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Find out what you can do,
and then do what you can.

00:47:17.105 --> 00:47:21.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The dead can’t praise Jehovah,’
but you can as long as you’re alive.

00:47:21.609 --> 00:47:25.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even if you get to the point
where all you can do is keep your integrity

00:47:25.863 --> 00:47:28.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and praise Jehovah, do that.

00:47:28.658 --> 00:47:31.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t give up.

00:47:31.327 --> 00:47:33.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s get back
to the point we started with,

00:47:33.496 --> 00:47:36.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is, with the best of intentions,

00:47:36.457 --> 00:47:39.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could get in the way of Jehovah’s purpose.

00:47:39.335 --> 00:47:42.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Isaac was determined to bless Esau

00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:45.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make Jacob his servant.

00:47:45.717 --> 00:47:48.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaac was getting in the way.

00:47:48.219 --> 00:47:51.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was getting in the way
of Jehovah’s purpose.

00:47:52.473 --> 00:47:55.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems that later
Isaac realized his mistake

00:47:55.226 --> 00:47:58.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
because when Jacob
was leaving to find a wife,

00:47:58.813 --> 00:48:01.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob was told:

00:48:01.315 --> 00:48:06.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God Almighty . . .
will give to you the blessing of Abraham.”

00:48:06.821 --> 00:48:08.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:48:08.406 --> 00:48:13.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God Almighty . . . will give to you
the blessing of Abraham”

00:48:13.369 --> 00:48:16.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
tells you what kind of a man Isaac was.

00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a spiritual man.

00:48:18.082 --> 00:48:20.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he loved Esau more than Jacob.

00:48:20.835 --> 00:48:24.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yes, he wanted Esau
to have the blessing.

00:48:24.130 --> 00:48:28.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Jehovah’s will became clear,
Isaac submitted.

00:48:30.011 --> 00:48:31.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul wrote:

00:48:31.429 --> 00:48:36.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘By faith Isaac blessed Esau and Jacob.’

00:48:37.018 --> 00:48:39.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now the application:

00:48:39.020 --> 00:48:42.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would it be possible for us to get in the way

00:48:42.106 --> 00:48:44.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah decides to do something

00:48:44.484 --> 00:48:49.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when he approves a project
that maybe we don’t agree with?

00:48:49.197 --> 00:48:51.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could happen.

00:48:51.199 --> 00:48:54.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
The organization suggests a new way
to carry out the preaching work.

00:48:54.994 --> 00:48:58.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tell our service group:
“That’ll never work here.

00:48:58.164 --> 00:49:00.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maybe it’ll work somewhere else
but not here.

00:49:00.166 --> 00:49:02.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re different.”

00:49:02.251 --> 00:49:04.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about our building projects?

00:49:04.253 --> 00:49:07.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ramapo?
Why do we need Ramapo?

00:49:07.131 --> 00:49:09.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Armageddon is coming.”

00:49:10.343 --> 00:49:12.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the late 1940’s,
when the decision was made

00:49:12.845 --> 00:49:16.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
to expand world headquarters
at 124 Columbia Heights,

00:49:16.641 --> 00:49:19.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few of the brothers took a dim view.

00:49:19.101 --> 00:49:23.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why spend the time and the money
so close to the end?

00:49:23.481 --> 00:49:25.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, in 1953,

00:49:25.483 --> 00:49:30.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the business meeting
of the Watchtower Society,

00:49:30.029 --> 00:49:32.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr read a letter from a sister.

00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just for context, this is 1953.

00:49:35.451 --> 00:49:38.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in those days, as I well recall,

00:49:38.287 --> 00:49:40.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
some thought that Armageddon

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:44.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
was going to come 40 years from 1914.

00:49:44.168 --> 00:49:46.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were doing a lot of counting back then.

00:49:46.212 --> 00:49:48.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this sister writes
to Brother Knorr and says,

00:49:48.422 --> 00:49:51.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are you spending
all this money on building projects

00:49:51.592 --> 00:49:54.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Armageddon could come in 1954?”

00:49:55.471 --> 00:49:58.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we’d listened to her
and others like her,

00:49:58.641 --> 00:50:00.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
where would we be today?

00:50:00.643 --> 00:50:04.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still back at 124 Columbia Heights.

00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:06.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking about our building programs,

00:50:06.941 --> 00:50:09.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Knorr once made
a very profound statement.

00:50:09.902 --> 00:50:11.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s simple, but it’s profound.

00:50:11.904 --> 00:50:14.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “We’re going to keep building.

00:50:14.448 --> 00:50:18.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let Jehovah stop it
if he doesn’t agree with it.”

00:50:18.744 --> 00:50:21.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think he could do that, couldn’t he?

00:50:21.289 --> 00:50:23.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, sometimes a body of elders

00:50:23.332 --> 00:50:27.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a lively discussion
about some project or initiative.

00:50:27.253 --> 00:50:29.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it’s the need for a new Kingdom Hall.

00:50:29.797 --> 00:50:33.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we may have our concerns.
We may have reservations.

00:50:33.301 --> 00:50:35.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
We express those.

00:50:35.303 --> 00:50:38.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if a number of spirit-directed men

00:50:38.306 --> 00:50:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
are enthusiastically in favor of a project,

00:50:41.851 --> 00:50:45.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s very possible
that Jehovah agrees with it too.

00:50:45.897 --> 00:50:48.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wouldn’t want to get in the way,

00:50:48.357 --> 00:50:51.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we wouldn’t want to be a naysayer.

00:50:51.193 --> 00:50:54.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, sometimes what happens
when we’re in a building project

00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:56.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
is we have trouble with permitting;

00:50:56.782 --> 00:50:59.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can’t get the permits
we need right away.

00:50:59.201 --> 00:51:03.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe a building inspector comes,
and he causes a lot of trouble.

00:51:03.122 --> 00:51:05.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we wouldn’t want to be
the type of person who says,

00:51:05.791 --> 00:51:08.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, this project
mustn’t have Jehovah’s blessing

00:51:08.711 --> 00:51:13.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
because if it had Jehovah’s blessing,
everything would go smoothly.”

00:51:13.132 --> 00:51:16.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tell that to Nehemiah
and the Jews in his day.

00:51:16.135 --> 00:51:18.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had no end of trouble.

00:51:18.137 --> 00:51:22.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, what they were doing
had Jehovah’s approval.

00:51:22.850 --> 00:51:26.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The word of God
is alive and exerts power.”

00:51:26.312 --> 00:51:28.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah has a purpose,

00:51:28.397 --> 00:51:31.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see what we can do
to advance that purpose.

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if there’s nothing we can do,
we pray for it

00:51:34.028 --> 00:51:36.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we get out of the way.

00:51:38.491 --> 00:51:42.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is truly faith-strengthening
to know that nothing can stop

00:51:42.453 --> 00:51:44.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
the advancement of Jehovah’s purpose

00:51:44.538 --> 00:51:47.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the many good gifts
he has in store for us.

00:51:48.209 --> 00:51:50.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video

00:51:50.795 --> 00:51:53.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us something else to look forward to:

00:51:53.297 --> 00:51:56.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
life on a paradise earth.

00:51:56.050 --> 00:51:59.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called <i>It Won’t Be Long.</i>

00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:10.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time keeps on ticking;
the years seem to fly.

00:52:10.064 --> 00:52:14.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not getting younger;
from pain, I can’t hide.

00:52:14.402 --> 00:52:22.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know
it won’t be long.

00:52:25.037 --> 00:52:29.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have lost loved ones
at times in my life,

00:52:29.709 --> 00:52:34.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
And living without them
has been a hard fight.

00:52:34.505 --> 00:52:41.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know
it won’t be long.

00:52:43.973 --> 00:52:49.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will wake up tomorrow,
and life will be new.

00:52:49.645 --> 00:52:58.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom has come,
and forever its rule over us will bring peace.

00:52:58.070 --> 00:53:01.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
It won’t be long.

00:53:04.452 --> 00:53:09.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friends and loved ones
we’re welcoming back.

00:53:09.623 --> 00:53:14.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pain and sorrow
is all in the past.

00:53:14.045 --> 00:53:18.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I know
Jehovah’s will

00:53:18.090 --> 00:53:22.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be done
in all the earth.

00:53:22.928 --> 00:53:26.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
It won’t be long.

00:53:29.101 --> 00:53:34.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I look at this world
and the days we’re in,

00:53:34.356 --> 00:53:38.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
The time is reduced.
It is clear, my friend.

00:53:38.819 --> 00:53:46.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I know
it won’t be long.

00:53:49.246 --> 00:53:54.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I try my best
to do what is right,

00:53:54.168 --> 00:53:58.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
To make Jehovah
the purpose in my life,

00:53:58.631 --> 00:54:05.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
’Cause I know
it won’t be long.

00:54:08.224 --> 00:54:13.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will wake up tomorrow,
and life will be new.

00:54:13.437 --> 00:54:22.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom has come,
and forever its rule over us will bring peace.

00:54:22.363 --> 00:54:26.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
It won’t be long.

00:54:28.536 --> 00:54:33.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friends and loved ones
we’re welcoming back.

00:54:33.499 --> 00:54:38.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pain and sorrow
is all in the past.

00:54:38.129 --> 00:54:42.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I know
Jehovah’s will

00:54:42.133 --> 00:54:46.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be done
in all the earth.

00:54:46.971 --> 00:54:51.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
It won’t be long.

00:54:53.602 --> 00:55:04.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if I don’t get to see
this old world pass away,

00:55:04.029 --> 00:55:15.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Safe I know I will be
in Jehovah’s memory.

00:55:16.709 --> 00:55:22.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I will wake up tomorrow,
and life will be new.

00:55:22.131 --> 00:55:31.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom has come,
and forever its rule over us will bring peace.

00:55:31.015 --> 00:55:34.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
It won’t be long.

00:55:36.979 --> 00:55:42.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friends and loved ones
will welcome me back.

00:55:42.151 --> 00:55:46.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pain and sorrow
is all in the past.

00:55:46.614 --> 00:55:50.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I know
Jehovah’s will

00:55:50.826 --> 00:55:55.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be done
in all the earth.

00:55:55.915 --> 00:56:00.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll see Paradise.

00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:05.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
It won’t be long.

00:56:13.265 --> 00:56:18.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,
we learned from Baruch’s example

00:56:18.103 --> 00:56:20.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
that putting Jehovah’s will
ahead of our own interests

00:56:20.689 --> 00:56:24.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
improves our lives and protects us from harm.

00:56:24.985 --> 00:56:28.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also learned that joy
comes from seeking Jehovah’s recognition,

00:56:28.864 --> 00:56:33.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
how young people can make
good decisions when choosing a career,

00:56:33.452 --> 00:56:36.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how married couples
can experience greater peace

00:56:36.497 --> 00:56:39.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
by working together as a team.

00:56:40.918 --> 00:56:44.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s postcard comes from Liberia.

00:56:44.713 --> 00:56:47.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nestled on the coast of western Africa,

00:56:47.716 --> 00:56:51.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Liberia’s terrain
includes stunning landscapes,

00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:56.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
sandy beaches,
rolling hills, and lush rainforests.

00:56:58.435 --> 00:57:00.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
English is the official language,

00:57:00.437 --> 00:57:04.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
spoken alongside
over 20 indigenous languages.

00:57:04.233 --> 00:57:07.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Liberia, which means “The Land of the Free,”

00:57:07.403 --> 00:57:11.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
was established in 1821 as a safe haven

00:57:11.073 --> 00:57:14.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
for freed slaves from the United States.

00:57:14.493 --> 00:57:17.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 60 years later,
the truth began to spread,

00:57:17.913 --> 00:57:20.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with the help from missionaries,

00:57:20.499 --> 00:57:24.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first congregation was formed in 1948.

00:57:24.795 --> 00:57:27.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
From 1989 to 2003,

00:57:27.756 --> 00:57:32.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Liberia endured devastating civil wars
that affected thousands,

00:57:32.594 --> 00:57:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
including our brothers and sisters.

00:57:36.348 --> 00:57:39.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the hardship,
they stayed positive.

00:57:39.935 --> 00:57:44.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother who had to flee
his home three times said:

00:57:44.732 --> 00:57:47.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These are the conditions we preach about;

00:57:47.609 --> 00:57:50.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are living in the last days.”

00:57:50.779 --> 00:57:53.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Liberia

00:57:53.782 --> 00:57:56.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue to see excellent results.

00:57:56.452 --> 00:57:59.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the East Ganta Congregation,

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:01.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
with only 103 publishers,

00:58:01.999 --> 00:58:04.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
had an impressive Memorial attendance

00:58:04.209 --> 00:58:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 964 in 2024.

00:58:09.298 --> 00:58:12.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers
had to meet in five different locations

00:58:12.509 --> 00:58:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accommodate everyone.

00:58:14.428 --> 00:58:16.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Robertsport,

00:58:16.096 --> 00:58:18.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
local families highly respect the Bible

00:58:18.932 --> 00:58:22.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and often gather to hear the good news.

00:58:22.102 --> 00:58:26.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Robertsport Congregation
sends their love and greetings

00:58:26.023 --> 00:58:28.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:58:29.443 --> 00:58:32.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:58:32.946 --> 00:58:36.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
