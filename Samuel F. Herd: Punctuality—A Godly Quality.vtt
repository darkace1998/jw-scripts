00:01.617 --> 00:04.554
The theme selected 
for my comments this month 


00:04.553 --> 00:07.790
is “Punctuality—A Godly Quality.” 


00:07.790 --> 00:10.593
You might remember the opening paragraph 


00:10.593 --> 00:15.531
in a 1990 Watchtower article 
on the subject of punctuality. 


00:15.532 --> 00:18.535
It said that an elder’s closest friends 


00:18.535 --> 00:21.270
jokingly called him Armageddon. 


00:21.270 --> 00:22.572
Why? 


00:22.572 --> 00:27.577
They replied: “We know he’s coming, 
but only God knows when!” 


00:27.577 --> 00:30.580
The elder had a problem with punctuality.


00:30.580 --> 00:35.185
Punctuality has nothing 
in common with procrastination. 


00:35.185 --> 00:37.187
To procrastinate means 


00:37.187 --> 00:40.990
“to intentionally put off 
the doing of something 


00:40.990 --> 00:43.025
that should be done.” 


00:43.025 --> 00:47.063
The saying, 
“Tomorrow is the busiest day of the year” 


00:47.063 --> 00:51.500
reflects the human tendency 
to procrastinate.


00:51.500 --> 00:54.303
How appropriate then 
is the inspired encouragement 


00:54.303 --> 00:57.140
concerning the present
—today. 


00:57.140 --> 00:59.408
Galatians 6:10 says: 


00:59.408 --> 01:02.745
“As long as we have the opportunity, 


01:02.745 --> 01:05.882
let us work what is good toward all.” 


01:05.882 --> 01:08.050
“As long as we have the opportunity” 


01:08.050 --> 01:11.453
does not sound like procrastination to me. 


01:11.453 --> 01:16.391
No, the Bible encourages just the opposite
—punctuality. 


01:16.392 --> 01:19.129
Punctuality refers to the characteristic 


01:19.128 --> 01:21.965
of being prompt in keeping appointments. 


01:21.965 --> 01:24.667
Punctuality is a godly quality. 


01:24.667 --> 01:28.572
In fact, Matthew 6:33 


01:28.572 --> 01:32.209
prioritizes our pursuit of Kingdom interests. 


01:32.208 --> 01:33.576
It says: 


01:33.577 --> 01:37.847
“Keep on, then, seeking first 
the Kingdom and his righteousness, 


01:37.847 --> 01:41.450
and all these other things 
will be added to you.” 


01:41.450 --> 01:45.288
It said to ‘seek the Kingdom first,’ 


01:45.288 --> 01:50.293
not second, not third or fourth
—first. 


01:50.293 --> 01:53.630
When we put the Kingdom first in our life, 


01:53.630 --> 01:55.965
we do not put it off 


01:55.965 --> 01:58.000
in favor of some trivial pursuit.


01:59.968 --> 02:02.538
If it is time for a Christian meeting, 


02:02.538 --> 02:05.975
we are there well before it starts. 


02:05.975 --> 02:09.078
Perhaps you have heard some say: 


02:09.078 --> 02:11.881
“At least I made it to the meeting. 


02:11.882 --> 02:14.284
Better late than never!” 


02:14.283 --> 02:18.688
But the godly way is: 
“Better never late!” 


02:18.688 --> 02:20.756
Jehovah is a punctual God. 


02:20.757 --> 02:23.059
He sets the example for us. 


02:23.058 --> 02:28.063
When Jehovah decided to destroy 
the ungodly world in a deluge, 


02:28.063 --> 02:32.235
he said to Noah at Genesis 6:14: 


02:32.235 --> 02:35.372
“Make for yourself an ark.” 


02:35.372 --> 02:37.374
Then, at Genesis 7:4, 


02:37.373 --> 02:41.945
Jehovah told Noah 
to enter into the ark and informed him: 


02:41.945 --> 02:44.713
“For in just seven days, 


02:44.713 --> 02:49.218
I will make it rain on the earth 
for 40 days and 40 nights.” 


02:49.218 --> 02:51.220
What happened? 


02:51.220 --> 02:53.422
A “better late than never” attitude? 


02:53.422 --> 02:57.227
No, that is not acceptable to Jehovah. 


02:57.227 --> 03:00.630
Instead, Genesis 7:10 says: 


03:00.630 --> 03:03.533
“And seven days later 


03:03.533 --> 03:06.401
the floodwaters came upon the earth.” 


03:06.402 --> 03:08.404
Right on time. 


03:08.403 --> 03:11.673
Punctuality is a godly quality.


03:11.673 --> 03:15.345
By means of a prophecy in Daniel chapter 9, 


03:15.345 --> 03:18.513
Jehovah indicated 
hundreds of years in advance 


03:18.513 --> 03:22.885
when Jesus would fulfill 
his role as Messiah and Savior. 


03:22.885 --> 03:26.188
When did Jesus present 
himself for that role? 


03:26.188 --> 03:28.256
“Better late than never?” 


03:28.257 --> 03:33.229
No, precisely on time in 29 C.E., 


03:33.228 --> 03:36.098
Jesus was anointed as Christ. 


03:36.098 --> 03:39.601
In fact, Romans 5:6 says: 


03:39.602 --> 03:42.439
“Christ died for ungodly men 


03:42.438 --> 03:45.173
at the appointed time.” 


03:45.173 --> 03:47.943
Jehovah is punctual.


03:47.943 --> 03:49.945
What about in our time? 


03:49.945 --> 03:52.448
The Bible tells us to keep in expectation 


03:52.448 --> 03:55.216
of Jehovah’s future day of judgment. 


03:55.217 --> 03:57.220
When will it happen? 


03:57.220 --> 04:02.125
Well, to us it may seem that it has delayed. 


04:02.125 --> 04:04.827
But what do we know about Jehovah? 


04:04.827 --> 04:06.829
He is punctual. 


04:06.828 --> 04:12.701
And so it is that Habakkuk 2:3 tells us: 


04:12.702 --> 04:17.207
“For the vision 
is yet for its appointed time, 


04:17.207 --> 04:20.242
“and it is rushing toward its end, 


04:20.242 --> 04:22.479
“and it will not lie. 


04:22.478 --> 04:26.815
“Even if it should delay, 
keep in expectation of it! 


04:26.815 --> 04:29.918
“For it will without fail come true. 


04:29.918 --> 04:32.688
It will not be late!” 


04:32.688 --> 04:35.725
Punctuality is Jehovah’s way. 


04:35.725 --> 04:38.628
Unlike the elder cited earlier, 


04:38.628 --> 04:42.098
this Armageddon will be on time.


04:42.098 --> 04:45.668
The apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 


04:45.668 --> 04:48.705
was specifically discussing what happens 


04:48.705 --> 04:50.773
at Christian gatherings. 


04:50.773 --> 04:52.841
In verse 26, he said: 


04:52.842 --> 04:54.844
“When you come together, . . . 


04:54.843 --> 04:58.446
Let all things take place for building up.” 


04:58.447 --> 05:02.052
Then, at 1 Corinthians 14:40, 


05:02.052 --> 05:04.187
he concludes by saying: 


05:04.187 --> 05:08.057
“But let all things take place decently 


05:08.057 --> 05:10.427
and by arrangement.” 


05:10.427 --> 05:11.894
Look at the words again. 


05:11.893 --> 05:13.930
When speaking about Christian meetings, 


05:13.930 --> 05:17.633
he said: 
‘Let things take place decently.’ 


05:17.633 --> 05:20.903
In Greek, 
it literally means “well-behavedly.” 


05:20.903 --> 05:26.041
Paul also used a Greek word 
translated here “by arrangement.” 


05:26.042 --> 05:30.980
The literal meaning of the Greek word 
is “according to order.” 


05:30.980 --> 05:35.985
If we are to be well-behaved, 
according to order at our meetings, 


05:35.985 --> 05:39.222
what would be one aspect of that? 


05:39.222 --> 05:41.457
Being punctual
—on time—


05:41.457 --> 05:43.459
for the start of the meeting.


05:43.458 --> 05:47.096
While the lack of punctuality 
affects all cultures 


05:47.097 --> 05:49.165
to one degree or another, 


05:49.165 --> 05:51.233
it is true that some cultures 


05:51.233 --> 05:54.836
are more punctual 
than others as a whole. 


05:54.837 --> 05:59.242
A missionary reported 
that in one town where he served, 


05:59.242 --> 06:02.945
his wife would be 
the only person in the audience 


06:02.945 --> 06:07.450
when he announced the opening song 
at the beginning of the meeting. 


06:07.450 --> 06:10.420
But when he announced the closing song, 


06:10.420 --> 06:13.522
70 people would be there. 


06:13.522 --> 06:17.327
On the other hand, 
in a Western European country, 


06:17.327 --> 06:19.862
about a thousand people were asked: 


06:19.862 --> 06:24.367
“If you were invited 
to dinner at 7:00 p.m., 


06:24.367 --> 06:28.370
“should you arrive 
five or ten minutes early, 


06:28.370 --> 06:32.475
or five or ten minutes late, 
or exactly on time?” 


06:32.475 --> 06:34.477
The majority responded 


06:34.477 --> 06:38.614
that “courtesy requires 
scrupulous respect for the host 


06:38.613 --> 06:42.451
and arriving at the exact minute.” 


06:42.452 --> 06:47.324
Each culture would likely think 
that the other is extreme. 


06:47.323 --> 06:52.428
However, being punctual is more 
than a matter of regional preference. 


06:52.428 --> 06:54.496
It is a godly quality 


06:54.497 --> 06:57.634
that true Christians of every culture 


06:57.633 --> 06:59.635
want to cultivate. 


06:59.635 --> 07:03.705
Punctuality must become a habit
—a way of life. 


07:03.705 --> 07:06.708
It is similar to some countries 


07:06.708 --> 07:11.213
that do not have 
a habit of good hygiene, or cleanliness. 


07:11.213 --> 07:15.585
That may be true, 
but it is expected that Jehovah’s people 


07:15.585 --> 07:20.557
in those lands will excel 
in good hygiene and clean habits. 


07:20.557 --> 07:24.327
In the same way, 
no matter what our background, 


07:24.327 --> 07:26.529
culture, or upbringing, 


07:26.528 --> 07:30.398
it is expected 
that we as imitators of our God 


07:30.398 --> 07:35.403
will develop 
the godly habit of being punctual.


07:35.403 --> 07:38.106
What helps us to be punctual? 


07:38.107 --> 07:41.077
The Bible encourages advance planning. 


07:41.077 --> 07:43.612
Proverbs 21:5 says: 


07:43.612 --> 07:47.617
“The plans of the diligent 
surely lead to success, 


07:47.617 --> 07:52.455
but all who are hasty 
surely head for poverty.” 


07:52.455 --> 07:55.057
So being punctual is not just a matter 


07:55.057 --> 07:59.962
of hastily fulfilling 
an obligation or an appointment. 


07:59.962 --> 08:04.967
It involves thinking in advance 
about our responsibilities. 


08:04.967 --> 08:07.604
Yes, planning to be prepared for them 


08:07.603 --> 08:11.340
and to be prompt in carrying them out.


08:11.340 --> 08:13.843
Well, what are some activities 


08:13.843 --> 08:18.280
that we would want 
to be punctual in fulfilling? 


08:18.280 --> 08:21.650
It can be the everyday things in life, 


08:21.650 --> 08:26.555
such as arriving at work 
or at school on time; 


08:26.555 --> 08:32.762
being punctual for appointments, 
such as a visit to the doctor or dentist; 


08:32.762 --> 08:38.500
arriving at the designated time 
when invited to another’s home for a meal. 


08:38.500 --> 08:43.907
What is our habit like 
when it comes to these areas of life?


08:43.907 --> 08:46.075
Even more important is punctuality 


08:46.075 --> 08:49.578
when attending 
our Christian meetings and assemblies. 


08:49.578 --> 08:51.580
This means being present 


08:51.580 --> 08:55.183
before the opening song and prayer. 


08:55.183 --> 08:58.720
The apostle Paul quoted from Psalm 22 


08:58.720 --> 09:01.757
when he wrote Hebrews 2:12. 


09:01.757 --> 09:04.294
Of Jesus he said: 


09:04.293 --> 09:07.128
“I will declare your name to my brothers; 


09:07.128 --> 09:11.900
in the midst of the congregation 
I will praise you with song.” 


09:11.900 --> 09:14.703
If that was true of Jesus, 


09:14.703 --> 09:18.908
it is a great incentive 
for us to participate 


09:18.908 --> 09:23.111
in singing the first song 
with our congregation. 


09:23.112 --> 09:26.782
And the opening prayer 
is important for us. 


09:26.782 --> 09:30.385
In ancient times, 
Jehovah called the temple 


09:30.385 --> 09:32.722
his “house of prayer.” 


09:32.722 --> 09:34.957
It’s true that the opening prayer 


09:34.957 --> 09:39.429
requests Jehovah’s guidance 
and holy spirit on the program, 


09:39.428 --> 09:42.096
however, it also prepares 


09:42.097 --> 09:44.800
our minds and hearts 


09:44.800 --> 09:48.537
to receive the information to be considered. 


09:48.537 --> 09:51.774
Of course, there may be times when one 


09:51.773 --> 09:54.410
is unavoidably late in arriving at a meeting. 


09:54.410 --> 09:56.978
Public transportation may be delayed 


09:56.978 --> 10:00.115
or our car may break down. 


10:00.115 --> 10:03.818
That’s understandable on occasion. 


10:03.818 --> 10:06.000
But what is our habit? 


10:07.255 --> 10:10.627
In the past, 
it was suggested that we consider 


10:10.627 --> 10:14.664
arriving 15 or 20 minutes 
before a meeting started. 


10:14.663 --> 10:17.198
One brother with six siblings 


10:17.198 --> 10:21.136
said his father made a goal 
of being at the Kingdom Hall 


10:21.137 --> 10:24.840
20 minutes before the program began. 


10:24.840 --> 10:27.743
That certainly took advance planning. 


10:27.743 --> 10:32.548
His father’s byline 
for meeting attendance was: 


10:32.548 --> 10:35.583
“If you’re 5 minutes early, 


10:35.583 --> 10:38.753
then your 15 minutes late.” 


10:38.753 --> 10:41.823
In most cases, the whole family arrived 


10:41.823 --> 10:45.928
20 minutes before the meeting 


10:45.928 --> 10:48.830
for wholesome association.


10:48.830 --> 10:51.000
Another opportunity for punctuality 


10:51.000 --> 10:54.437
is arriving on time 
for a meeting for service. 


10:54.437 --> 10:56.772
This is challenging for some. 


10:56.772 --> 10:59.775
However, with a little advanced planning, 


10:59.775 --> 11:01.810
we can be successful. 


11:01.810 --> 11:04.447
Punctuality is particularly important 


11:04.447 --> 11:09.385
since the actual meeting 
is only about ten minutes long. 


11:09.385 --> 11:13.222
If we’re late, 
not only is it disruptive 


11:13.222 --> 11:16.192
but it could force 
the one taking the lead 


11:16.192 --> 11:20.000
to redo the arrangements 
made for the group. 


11:21.163 --> 11:23.331
And speaking of our ministry, 


11:23.332 --> 11:27.404
what is an opportunity 
to be punctual every month? 


11:27.403 --> 11:29.438
Yes, you guessed it, 


11:29.438 --> 11:33.741
turning in our field service report 
at the end of the month. 


11:33.742 --> 11:37.000
Do you have a way 
of reminding yourself of this?


11:38.247 --> 11:41.684
In some lands, 
it is almost as if it is a custom 


11:41.683 --> 11:45.120
for the start 
of a wedding talk to be delayed. 


11:45.120 --> 11:50.158
Often this is because 
of mistakenly gauging how much time 


11:50.158 --> 11:53.928
the bride needs 
to get dressed and made up 


11:53.928 --> 11:56.765
for her grand appearance. 


11:56.765 --> 12:00.102
However, 
being considerate of those invited 


12:00.102 --> 12:04.707
should move those involved 
to allow extra time 


12:04.707 --> 12:07.910
to complete the task of preparation. 


12:07.910 --> 12:12.213
A 1990 Watchtower 
commented on being punctual 


12:12.213 --> 12:14.883
in starting a wedding. 


12:14.883 --> 12:17.886
The very next sentence stated: 


12:17.887 --> 12:21.990
“You may like to have your egg boiled 


12:21.990 --> 12:24.327
for just so many minutes.” 


12:24.327 --> 12:28.497
I am not sure exactly how 
that applies to a wedding, 


12:28.497 --> 12:32.635
but I think we get the point, 
don’t we? 


12:32.635 --> 12:37.573
We should have calculated 
the timing in advance 


12:37.573 --> 12:42.478
so that the ceremony begins on time.


12:42.478 --> 12:46.081
Do we have yet another example 
of being punctual, 


12:46.082 --> 12:48.950
not procrastinating? 


12:48.950 --> 12:51.620
How about when there is a difference 


12:51.620 --> 12:54.390
between you and a fellow believer 


12:54.390 --> 12:56.792
or a family member? 


12:56.792 --> 13:01.230
Of course, if it is simply a minor issue 


13:01.230 --> 13:03.232
because of imperfection, 


13:03.232 --> 13:08.837
often the best thing to do 
is forgive and forget. 


13:08.837 --> 13:11.640
But if it was more serious 


13:11.640 --> 13:15.077
or we cannot simply let it go, 


13:15.077 --> 13:17.179
what should we do? 


13:17.178 --> 13:21.216
We need to settle the matter 
and restore the peace. 


13:21.217 --> 13:23.819
When should we take this step? 


13:23.818 --> 13:26.121
Do not procrastinate. 


13:26.122 --> 13:31.860
If we do, 
the problem may fester and get worse. 


13:31.860 --> 13:34.997
What kind of a priority 
did Jesus establish 


13:34.997 --> 13:38.234
for restoring peace 
between fellow believers? 


13:38.233 --> 13:42.436
At Matthew 5:23, 24, 


13:42.437 --> 13:46.242
note his clear indication of punctuality: 


13:46.242 --> 13:50.179
“If, then, you are bringing 
your gift to the altar 


13:50.178 --> 13:54.015
“and there you remember
that your brother has something against you,


13:54.015 --> 13:58.187
“leave your gift there in front 
of the altar, and go away. 


13:58.187 --> 14:01.290
“First make your peace with your brother, 


14:01.290 --> 14:03.825
and then come back and offer your gift.” 


14:03.825 --> 14:06.695
Did you pick up on the timing 


14:06.695 --> 14:10.900
that Jesus recommended for reconciliation? 


14:10.900 --> 14:12.902
He said: 


14:12.902 --> 14:17.674
“[First] First make your peace 
with your brother.” 


14:17.673 --> 14:22.143
It is a high priority 
and should be treated as such. 


14:22.143 --> 14:25.580
But remember 
the scripture we shared earlier, 


14:25.580 --> 14:27.817
Proverbs 21:5? 


14:27.817 --> 14:31.120
This principle should be implemented. 


14:31.120 --> 14:34.022
The last part of the verse 


14:34.022 --> 14:37.125
warns us not to be “hasty.” 


14:37.125 --> 14:41.997
Hasty is not synonymous with punctuality. 


14:41.997 --> 14:45.400
Instead, 
the first part of the verse indicates 


14:45.400 --> 14:50.305
we should prepare or plan the visit first. 


14:50.305 --> 14:53.942
Then follow through without procrastinating. 


14:53.942 --> 14:58.000
It said this approach will “lead to success.” 


14:59.648 --> 15:03.118
What is the success we are seeking? 


15:03.118 --> 15:07.690
Jesus did not say to justify our position 


15:07.690 --> 15:10.292
or to point out the flaw 


15:10.292 --> 15:13.695
in the other person’s words or actions. 


15:13.695 --> 15:16.965
No, he said you would be successful 


15:16.965 --> 15:20.000
if you 
“make your peace with your brother.”


15:21.303 --> 15:24.138
Punctuality is a godly quality 


15:24.138 --> 15:27.508
that we should strive to cultivate. 


15:27.508 --> 15:30.645
Another aspect of punctuality 


15:30.645 --> 15:33.515
is ending an assignment on time. 


15:33.515 --> 15:35.717
In the interest of punctuality, 


15:35.717 --> 15:45.479
let’s move on 
to the next segment of our program.
