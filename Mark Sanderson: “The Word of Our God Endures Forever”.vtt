00:01.985 --> 00:06.488
As Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
we truly love the Bible. 


00:06.488 --> 00:08.491
Why? 


00:08.492 --> 00:11.394
Because we know it is God’s Word. 


00:11.393 --> 00:15.198
That’s why we love reading it, 
we love studying it, 


00:15.198 --> 00:18.166
and we love learning about its history. 


00:18.167 --> 00:21.470
When we pause 
for a moment and reflect on 


00:21.470 --> 00:24.840
the many efforts that have been made 
through the centuries 


00:24.840 --> 00:29.245
to hinder and even stop 
the distribution of the Bible, 


00:29.245 --> 00:33.917
it becomes obvious 
that its Author, Jehovah, 


00:33.917 --> 00:37.287
has been personally involved 
in preserving 


00:37.287 --> 00:40.324
and making known 
his precious Word. 


00:40.323 --> 00:43.325
This is very much 
in harmony with the thought 


00:43.325 --> 00:46.797
in Isaiah 40:8: 


00:46.797 --> 00:49.865
“The green grass dries up, 


00:49.865 --> 00:52.402
“the blossom withers, 


00:52.402 --> 00:57.640
but the word
of our God endures forever.”


00:57.640 --> 00:59.408
With that in mind, 


00:59.408 --> 01:01.745
I’m happy to speak 
with you this month 


01:01.745 --> 01:05.315
on a theme 
that’s very close to my heart:


01:05.315 --> 01:09.318
“The Word of Our God Endures Forever.” 


01:09.318 --> 01:13.890
The more we come to appreciate 
the value of God’s Word, 


01:13.890 --> 01:16.525
the more we’ll be moved to read it


01:16.525 --> 01:21.965
and, even more important, 
to apply it in our lives.


01:21.965 --> 01:26.102
Jehovah gave us an outstanding gift 
when he inspired 


01:26.102 --> 01:30.107
faithful men 
to record his precious Word. 


01:30.107 --> 01:33.075
It’s through the pages of God’s Word 


01:33.075 --> 01:37.480
that we learn 
just how much God loves us. 


01:37.480 --> 01:41.183
Thus, his Word contains 
guidance on how to live. 


01:41.183 --> 01:45.086
It outlines his purpose 
in creating us. 


01:45.087 --> 01:49.459
It gives us his precious promises 
for life everlasting 


01:49.458 --> 01:51.895
in peace and happiness. 


01:51.895 --> 01:55.632
No wonder the apostle Paul 
was inspired to write 


01:55.632 --> 02:00.000
at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17: 


02:01.270 --> 02:05.040
“All Scripture is inspired of God 


02:05.040 --> 02:08.945
“and beneficial for teaching, 
for reproving, 


02:08.945 --> 02:13.883
“for setting things straight, 
for disciplining in righteousness, 


02:13.883 --> 02:17.686
“so that the man of God 
may be fully competent, 


02:17.687 --> 02:22.000
completely equipped for every good work.”


02:23.125 --> 02:27.363
Of course, Satan the Devil 
does not want people to have access 


02:27.363 --> 02:31.533
to these precious truths 
from our heavenly Father, Jehovah. 


02:31.533 --> 02:35.305
It’s no surprise 
that there have been many obstacles 


02:35.305 --> 02:37.607
to making the Bible available. 


02:37.607 --> 02:41.477
While Satan may not have been 
directly behind all of these, 


02:41.477 --> 02:45.047
he certainly 
has made use of them. 


02:45.047 --> 02:47.550
What are some 
of these obstacles, 


02:47.550 --> 02:50.253
and how have they been overcome?


02:50.253 --> 02:53.188
Let’s consider the first obstacle: 


02:53.188 --> 02:55.891
language barriers.


02:55.892 --> 02:58.529
The first 39 books of the Bible, 


02:58.528 --> 03:01.296
which are often called the Old Testament, 


03:01.297 --> 03:05.000
were written primarily 
in the Hebrew language. 


03:05.000 --> 03:07.303
These books were known 


03:07.303 --> 03:10.640
by Hebrew-speaking servants of Jehovah. 


03:10.640 --> 03:13.442
However, as time went on,


03:13.442 --> 03:16.712
particularly after 
the destruction of Babylon, 


03:16.712 --> 03:21.117
many Jews established communities 
in other nations of the earth. 


03:21.117 --> 03:23.987
Many of these Jews spoke Greek. 


03:23.987 --> 03:26.522
They no longer used Hebrew. 


03:26.522 --> 03:30.394
That meant that many Jews 
no longer had access 


03:30.393 --> 03:34.096
to the Scriptures in a language 
they could understand.


03:34.097 --> 03:36.565
Consider what had happened. 


03:36.565 --> 03:38.802
As Alexander the Great conquered 


03:38.802 --> 03:41.237
more and more 
of the then-known world, 


03:41.237 --> 03:43.339
Greek gradually became 


03:43.338 --> 03:46.408
the common language 
of commerce and government 


03:46.408 --> 03:48.578
throughout his empire. 


03:48.578 --> 03:51.213
If the Bible 
was to be understood 


03:51.213 --> 03:54.283
by the Jews and by Jewish proselytes 


03:54.283 --> 03:58.520
who were scattered throughout 
this vast Greek-speaking territory, 


03:58.520 --> 04:02.658
it needed to be translated into Greek. 


04:02.658 --> 04:06.795
Beginning in about the year 250 B.C.E., 


04:06.795 --> 04:11.033
the Hebrew Scriptures began 
to be translated into Greek. 


04:11.033 --> 04:15.203
In time, that Greek translation 
came to be known 


04:15.203 --> 04:17.340
as the Septuagint. 


04:17.340 --> 04:21.043
It was widely and frequently used 
by the Christians 


04:21.043 --> 04:23.846
in the first century who spoke Greek. 


04:23.847 --> 04:28.117
In fact, the writers 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures,


04:28.117 --> 04:30.787
which is often called 
the New Testament, 


04:30.787 --> 04:35.759
frequently quoted directly 
from that translation.


04:35.758 --> 04:38.761
So that obstacle had been overcome. 


04:38.762 --> 04:42.932
But there were many more 
language obstacles ahead. 


04:42.932 --> 04:46.502
As the Roman Empire 
began to flourish, 


04:46.502 --> 04:49.905
Latin replaced Greek 
as a common language. 


04:49.905 --> 04:54.377
Now it was necessary 
to translate the Bible into Latin. 


04:54.377 --> 04:59.882
Some Latin translations 
of the Bible books began to appear. 


04:59.882 --> 05:04.820
But it was in the year 405 C.E. 
that Jerome completed 


05:04.820 --> 05:08.457
the definitive Latin translation 
of the Bible. 


05:08.457 --> 05:10.660
It came to be known 


05:10.660 --> 05:12.662
as the Latin Vulgate. 


05:12.662 --> 05:15.732
Jerome’s translation 
would become 


05:15.732 --> 05:18.769
the standard Bible 
used by Christendom 


05:18.768 --> 05:23.538
for the next nearly 1,000 years. 


05:23.538 --> 05:28.443
However, Latin soon became 
the language of the learned and the elite, 


05:28.443 --> 05:32.181
so the common people 
could no longer understand 


05:32.182 --> 05:34.350
the Bible’s message.


05:34.350 --> 05:39.222
During that long period, 
there were sincere men 


05:39.222 --> 05:43.459
that translated portions of the Bible 
into some additional languages, 


05:43.458 --> 05:48.000
but these translations were, 
of course, all made by hand. 


05:49.065 --> 05:54.037
Such handwritten copies of the Bible 
were rare and expensive. 


05:54.037 --> 05:57.507
Therefore, 
access to the Bible in vernacular, 


05:57.507 --> 06:01.177
or common languages, 
 was very limited.


06:01.177 --> 06:04.280
But language was not 
the only obstacle 


06:04.280 --> 06:07.783
that threatened to prevent 
the distribution of God’s Word. 


06:07.783 --> 06:10.786
Consider a second factor: 


06:10.787 --> 06:15.425
direct opposition 
to Bible translation and distribution 


06:15.425 --> 06:17.960
from religious leaders.


06:17.960 --> 06:22.932
That opposition 
started to increase in 1229 


06:22.932 --> 06:27.404
when the local church 
Council of Toulouse decreed:


06:27.403 --> 06:31.773
“We prohibit also 
that the laity should be permitted 


06:31.773 --> 06:35.000
to have the books 
of the Old or the New Testament.”


06:36.778 --> 06:41.483
In 1234, 
the Council of Tarragona decreed: 


06:41.483 --> 06:46.221
“No one should possess the books 
of the Old or the New Testament 


06:46.222 --> 06:48.424
“in the vernacular [language], 


06:48.423 --> 06:50.560
“and if anyone possesses them, 


06:50.560 --> 06:54.163
“let him deliver them, within eight days 


06:54.163 --> 06:56.931
“from the promulgation of this decree, 


06:56.932 --> 07:01.470
to the local bishop, 
so that they may be burned.”


07:01.470 --> 07:06.042
Thus, during 
a very long period in history, 


07:06.042 --> 07:08.945
there was limited access to the Bible 


07:08.945 --> 07:12.182
in the languages 
spoken by common people. 


07:12.182 --> 07:15.184
But did that mean 
that the Word of God 


07:15.183 --> 07:17.753
would not continue to endure?


07:17.753 --> 07:20.121
Neither language barriers 


07:20.122 --> 07:22.725
nor opposition from religious leaders 


07:22.725 --> 07:26.762
could stop God’s Word 
from being made known. 


07:26.762 --> 07:29.332
Even in those dark times, 


07:29.332 --> 07:32.469
there were individuals 
who loved God’s Word 


07:32.468 --> 07:35.203
and who worked hard 
to translate it 


07:35.203 --> 07:38.240
and to make it available to others. 


07:38.240 --> 07:40.242
Consider John Wycliffe 


07:40.242 --> 07:43.512
and his followers 
who were called the Lollards.


07:43.512 --> 07:46.115
John Wycliffe and his associates 


07:46.115 --> 07:48.250
completed the translation 
of the Bible 


07:48.250 --> 07:52.455
into English 
about the year 1382. 


07:52.455 --> 07:55.958
They eagerly 
hand copied the translation 


07:55.958 --> 07:58.426
and then traveled 
from village to village 


07:58.427 --> 08:01.830
reading the Bible 
to the common people. 


08:01.830 --> 08:05.367
Despite tremendous opposition 
from the church, 


08:05.367 --> 08:09.272
Wycliffe and his followers 
made the Bible available 


08:09.272 --> 08:13.877
to many honesthearted people 
in the English language.


08:13.877 --> 08:18.247
After Wycliffe died in 1384, 


08:18.247 --> 08:21.484
great opposition 
came to his followers. 


08:21.483 --> 08:24.853
Many had land 
and property confiscated. 


08:24.853 --> 08:27.000
Others were burned 
at the stake.


08:29.158 --> 08:32.795
In response to the work 
of Wycliffe and the Lollards, 


08:32.795 --> 08:34.963
in 1408, 


08:34.963 --> 08:39.000
Thomas Arundel, 
Archbishop of Canterbury, declared: 


08:41.203 --> 08:44.273
“We therefore decree and ordain 


08:44.273 --> 08:49.211
“that no man shall, hereafter, 
by his own authority, 


08:49.212 --> 08:52.282
“translate any text of the Scripture 


08:52.282 --> 08:55.384
“into English, 
or any other tongue, 


08:55.383 --> 09:00.355
. . . upon pain 
of greater excommunication.”


09:00.355 --> 09:03.392
Did such opposition 
wipe out efforts 


09:03.392 --> 09:06.629
to translate and make 
the Bible available? 


09:06.628 --> 09:09.065
Absolutely not! 


09:09.065 --> 09:12.000
The work of Wycliffe 
and his associates 


09:12.000 --> 09:15.403
stimulated interest in the Bible 
throughout England 


09:15.403 --> 09:19.008
and even as far as central Europe. 


09:19.008 --> 09:24.013
Religious leaders were not able 
to silence the Word of God.


09:24.013 --> 09:28.951
In fact, within just a few decades 
after Wycliffe’s death, 


09:28.952 --> 09:32.689
two factors 
led to a tremendous increase 


09:32.688 --> 09:35.625
in the availability 
of the Bible. 


09:35.625 --> 09:39.262
The first, 
about the year 1454, 


09:39.262 --> 09:43.499
was the development 
of printing with movable type. 


09:43.498 --> 09:47.670
This invention would 
in time allow for the printing 


09:47.670 --> 09:52.475
of large quantities 
of Bibles in many languages.


09:52.475 --> 09:57.413
The second factor was 
the compiling and printing 


09:57.413 --> 10:01.316
of the Hebrew and Greek 
original language text 


10:01.317 --> 10:03.319
of the Holy Scriptures. 


10:03.318 --> 10:05.755
This allowed many translators 


10:05.755 --> 10:09.292
to have access 
to the original language texts 


10:09.292 --> 10:11.427
so that they then could produce 


10:11.427 --> 10:15.632
high-quality translations 
in their own languages.


10:15.632 --> 10:17.767
What was the result? 


10:17.767 --> 10:21.437
In the 1500’s across Europe, 


10:21.437 --> 10:24.907
fresh translations 
were made and printed 


10:24.907 --> 10:27.444
in vernacular, 
or common languages, 


10:27.443 --> 10:31.646
including German, English, Italian, French, 


10:31.647 --> 10:35.450
Dutch, Czech, Danish, Swedish, 


10:35.450 --> 10:39.322
Spanish, Slovenian, and many others.


10:39.322 --> 10:43.192
However, opposition continued. 


10:43.192 --> 10:47.897
Bible translators were frequently hounded 
by the Inquisition, 


10:47.897 --> 10:52.602
and some translators like 
William Tyndale and John Rogers 


10:52.602 --> 10:55.739
were even put to death 
for their work. 


10:55.738 --> 11:00.075
Nonetheless, the Word of God 
continued to endure 


11:00.075 --> 11:04.713
and be made available 
to more and more language groups.


11:04.713 --> 11:07.450
By the early 1800’s, 


11:07.450 --> 11:10.585
Bible translation 
began to speed up. 


11:10.585 --> 11:14.157
Bible societies 
and intrepid translators 


11:14.157 --> 11:17.225
began to work 
in many parts of the earth 


11:17.225 --> 11:20.395
so that the Bible began 
to appear in languages 


11:20.395 --> 11:24.200
of Asia, Africa, 
the Pacific islands, 


11:24.200 --> 11:28.337
as well as in indigenous languages 
of the Americas. 


11:28.337 --> 11:32.207
From 1800 to 1899, 


11:32.207 --> 11:35.110
some portions of the Bible 
were translated 


11:35.110 --> 11:38.080
into some 400 languages, 


11:38.080 --> 11:40.917
and from 1900 to 1950, 


11:40.917 --> 11:44.000
more than 500 languages 
were added.


11:45.420 --> 11:50.258
Consider what has been accomplished 
with the New World Translation. 


11:50.258 --> 11:53.795
As of this month, 
the New World Translation 


11:53.795 --> 11:56.965
has been produced 
in whole or in part 


11:56.965 --> 12:00.168
in 149 languages, 


12:00.168 --> 12:04.206
with an additional 
37 languages approved.


12:04.207 --> 12:08.210
It’s obvious 
that neither language barriers 


12:08.210 --> 12:11.113
nor opposition 
from religious leaders 


12:11.113 --> 12:14.916
was able to stop 
the distribution of God’s Word. 


12:14.917 --> 12:19.422
Jehovah has protected it 
through the ages. 


12:19.422 --> 12:24.760
It’s just as Psalm 12:6, 7 says: 


12:24.760 --> 12:28.530
“The sayings of Jehovah are pure; 


12:28.530 --> 12:32.400
“they are like silver refined 
in an earthen furnace, 


12:32.400 --> 12:35.303
“purified seven times. 


12:35.303 --> 12:38.173
“You will guard them, O Jehovah; 


12:38.173 --> 12:40.641
“you will protect each one of them 


12:40.642 --> 12:44.000
from this generation forever.”


12:45.047 --> 12:49.152
Yes, Jehovah 
has protected each one 


12:49.152 --> 12:52.755
of his precious sayings 
down through the ages.


12:52.755 --> 12:56.258
But consider a third obstacle. 


12:56.258 --> 13:00.428
Although the Bible is now available 
in whole or in part 


13:00.428 --> 13:03.565
in almost 3,000 languages, 


13:03.565 --> 13:07.135
many people are no longer interested 
in reading it. 


13:07.135 --> 13:10.638
In our modern age, 
people have become


13:10.638 --> 13:13.675
increasingly skeptical and irreligious. 


13:13.675 --> 13:16.978
Scientists have extolled 
the theory of evolution 


13:16.978 --> 13:19.348
and have made it appear intelligent 


13:19.348 --> 13:21.950
to doubt the existence of God. 


13:21.950 --> 13:23.952
At the same time, 


13:23.952 --> 13:26.622
secular philosophy has encouraged people 


13:26.622 --> 13:30.960
to make life decisions 
according to what feels right to them. 


13:30.960 --> 13:32.995
What is the result? 


13:32.995 --> 13:35.965
A world where people 
are often guided 


13:35.965 --> 13:39.802
by their own selfish, fleshly desires. 


13:39.802 --> 13:42.037
Instead of leading to happiness, 


13:42.037 --> 13:46.509
many people are left 
feeling empty and dissatisfied.


13:46.508 --> 13:50.778
How is this third obstacle overcome? 


13:50.778 --> 13:52.681
Around the world, 


13:52.682 --> 13:56.152
people are opening 
God’s Word, the Bible, 


13:56.152 --> 13:58.387
and reading it 
for themselves. 


13:58.387 --> 14:01.490
They’re recognizing 
that its thoughts 


14:01.490 --> 14:03.792
are not simply human wisdom. 


14:03.792 --> 14:07.530
As they apply 
its principles in their lives, 


14:07.530 --> 14:10.165
they find 
contentment and joy. 


14:10.165 --> 14:14.002
They develop 
self-respect and dignity 


14:14.002 --> 14:17.540
from living according to 
the upright moral standards 


14:17.540 --> 14:19.808
outlined by our Creator. 


14:19.808 --> 14:25.000
As Psalm 119:97-100 states: 


14:26.315 --> 14:28.917
“How I do love your law! 


14:28.917 --> 14:32.520
“I ponder over it all day long. 


14:32.520 --> 14:36.425
“Your commandment 
makes me wiser than my enemies, 


14:36.425 --> 14:39.027
“because it is with me forever. 


14:39.027 --> 14:42.530
“I have more insight 
than all my teachers, 


14:42.530 --> 14:45.767
“because I ponder over your reminders. 


14:45.767 --> 14:49.639
“I act with more understanding 
than older men, 


14:49.638 --> 14:53.000
because I observe your orders.”


14:54.208 --> 14:56.411
What a powerful proof 


14:56.412 --> 15:00.082
that the Word of God endures forever. 


15:00.082 --> 15:04.454
While the advice of human philosophers 
is frequently flawed, 


15:04.453 --> 15:07.923
the Bible’s counsel works. 


15:07.923 --> 15:09.925
If we apply it, 


15:09.925 --> 15:13.562
it can help us either 
to overcome or to cope 


15:13.562 --> 15:17.499
with any problem 
or situation that we may face. 


15:17.498 --> 15:19.501
What is more, 


15:19.502 --> 15:23.105
by explaining 
God’s purpose for the future, 


15:23.105 --> 15:25.173
it gives us a solid hope 


15:25.173 --> 15:29.210
this earth will be restored 
to the Paradise 


15:29.210 --> 15:31.813
that it was 
when it was first created. 


15:31.813 --> 15:36.118
It will be filled 
with peace and righteousness. 


15:36.118 --> 15:38.586
What a wonderful gift 


15:38.587 --> 15:41.757
Jehovah gave us through the Bible! 


15:41.757 --> 15:46.329
Yes, languages barriers, 
opposition from religious leaders,


15:46.328 --> 15:49.865
and even 
an increasingly irreligious world 


15:49.865 --> 15:52.635
cannot stop God’s Word.


15:52.635 --> 15:55.837
How can you be part 
of the evidence 


15:55.837 --> 15:58.907
that the Word of God 
endures forever? 


15:58.907 --> 16:02.912
Read it every day, 
study it, 


16:02.912 --> 16:06.715
meditate on the deep thoughts 
that it contains, 


16:06.715 --> 16:11.620
and then apply 
those priceless teachings in your life.


16:11.620 --> 16:16.092
In this way, 
not just on the printed page, 


16:16.092 --> 16:19.194
not just on the library shelf, 


16:19.193 --> 16:22.998
but in our minds, 
in our own hearts, 


16:22.998 --> 16:25.033
in our own lives 


16:25.033 --> 16:36.495
the Word of God 
will truly endure forever.
