00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:03.691 line:10% position:50% align:center
Old Faithful is the name of a geyser

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:05.317 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Yellowstone National Park

00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:07.111 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the United States.

00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:09.071 line:10% position:50% align:center
The geyser was given this name

00:00:09.071 --> 00:00:12.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the relative
regularity of its eruptions.

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:17.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, it erupts thousands of liters
or gallons of boiling water

00:00:17.621 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
about every 90 minutes on average.

00:00:21.292 --> 00:00:25.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Old Faithful erupts,
the timing of its next eruption

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:27.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be predicted about 90 percent of the time

00:00:27.882 --> 00:00:30.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
within a ten-minute variation.

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:33.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s not even the most
regular geyser in the park!

00:00:33.971 --> 00:00:35.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

00:00:37.057 --> 00:00:39.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
It shouldn’t surprise us
that the word “faithful”

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:41.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
is applied to inanimate things,

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:45.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
since we see faithfulness
and dependability in creation.

00:00:46.567 --> 00:00:50.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Psalm 89:37 describes the moon

00:00:50.487 --> 00:00:55.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as a faithful witness in the skies”
because of its reliability.

00:00:55.451 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its appearance in the sky
follows a fixed pattern,

00:00:59.038 --> 00:01:02.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it faithfully completes its orbit
around the earth

00:01:02.041 --> 00:01:04.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
every 27.3 days.

00:01:06.253 --> 00:01:09.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we admire faithfulness in creation,

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:11.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
we especially appreciate people who make

00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:14.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithfulness their way of life.

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:18.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such individuals are reliable,
dependable, and trustworthy.

00:01:20.225 --> 00:01:24.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read about this quality of faithfulness
at 1 Corinthians 4:2:

00:01:24.688 --> 00:01:27.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In this regard, what is expected of stewards

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that they be found faithful.”

00:01:30.778 --> 00:01:33.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
The term “steward” can mean “house manager.”

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:37.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
His work could include
caring for his master’s business,

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
property, and other servants.

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:41.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a lot of responsibility!

00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:43.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
But think of this:

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:47.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
A steward might have
many fine qualities and abilities.

00:01:47.294 --> 00:01:50.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, none of them would matter
if he was irresponsible,

00:01:50.589 --> 00:01:53.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
disloyal, and unfaithful to his master.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithfulness is essential
to be an effective and successful steward.

00:01:59.598 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
As true Christians, we must prove ourselves
faithful and trustworthy.

00:02:05.562 --> 00:02:08.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah feel about faithfulness?

00:02:08.774 --> 00:02:10.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same way as King David did,

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
who wrote at Psalm 101:6:

00:02:13.362 --> 00:02:16.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will look
to the faithful ones of the earth,

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they may dwell with me.”

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:20.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using a similar expression,

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:25.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Jeremiah wrote the words
found at Jeremiah 5:3:

00:02:25.582 --> 00:02:29.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, do your eyes
not look for faithfulness?”

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:33.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Psalm 37:3 encourages us

00:02:33.632 --> 00:02:37.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “reside in the earth,
and act with faithfulness.”

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:41.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the theme of this month’s broadcast is

00:02:41.765 --> 00:02:44.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Make Faithfulness Your Way of Life.”

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:48.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll examine two examples of faithfulness,

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then we’ll consider some practical ways
that we can prove ourselves faithful.

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:58.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
We began our discussion
by talking about the example of a geyser.

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:03.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
A geyser might be a fitting symbol
of the faithfulness of humans

00:03:03.996 --> 00:03:06.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
because geysers continually erupt,

00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:09.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they do so unpredictably.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:12.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a geyser would be a poor representation

00:03:12.087 --> 00:03:15.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the unchanging faithfulness
of our “faithful Creator,”

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:18.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah is described at 1 Peter 4:19.

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:23.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ever-present sun and moon
are more appropriate symbols

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:26.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the unchangeableness of his faithfulness.

00:03:28.312 --> 00:03:30.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his words to the nation of Israel,

00:03:30.606 --> 00:03:34.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses stated, as found at Deuteronomy 32:4:

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Rock, perfect is his activity,
for all his ways are justice.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
A God of faithfulness who is never unjust.”

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:47.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Jehovah prove faithful to that nation?

00:03:47.414 --> 00:03:49.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course he did.

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:52.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Moses spoke those words
to the Israelites,

00:03:52.377 --> 00:03:54.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may have remembered
the time when Jehovah

00:03:54.421 --> 00:03:57.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
had faithfully brought their forefathers
out of Egypt

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:00.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rescued them at the Red Sea.

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had faithfully preserved
millions of people alive

00:04:02.971 --> 00:04:06.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the Israelites’ 40-year journey
in the wilderness.

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:09.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he had led them
to the border of the Promised Land.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:11.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses’ successor, Joshua,

00:04:11.396 --> 00:04:15.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
also could testify to Jehovah’s faithfulness.

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:17.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a child growing up in Egypt,

00:04:17.444 --> 00:04:20.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua must have
come to know of Jehovah’s promise

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give the Israelites a land of their own.

00:04:23.951 --> 00:04:26.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the time came to enter that land,

00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:30.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua was an eyewitness of how
Jehovah fought in behalf of His people.

00:04:30.707 --> 00:04:35.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua saw
the walls of Jericho fall down flat.

00:04:35.212 --> 00:04:39.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw the sun stand still
until the Amorites could be routed.

00:04:40.425 --> 00:04:43.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time,
one nation after another was defeated

00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:47.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the faithful God
was fighting for Israel.

00:04:49.017 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once they defeated their enemies,

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:55.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua could say to the nation
what is recorded at Joshua 23:14:

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:59.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You well know with all your heart
and with all your soul

00:04:59.736 --> 00:05:03.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that not one word
out of all the good promises

00:05:03.073 --> 00:05:06.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah your God has spoken
to you has failed.

00:05:06.618 --> 00:05:09.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They have all come true for you.

00:05:09.204 --> 00:05:11.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not one word of them has failed”

00:05:11.915 --> 00:05:14.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“not one word.”

00:05:14.877 --> 00:05:18.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joshua had seen that Jehovah
faithfully kept His promises.

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:25.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you can probably think of many other
examples of Jehovah’s faithfulness,

00:05:25.137 --> 00:05:28.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the fulfillment
of Messianic prophecies,

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:32.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fulfillment of the promise to feed
God’s people spiritually in our day

00:05:32.853 --> 00:05:36.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of “the faithful
and discreet slave,” and so on.

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:42.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sets the perfect example
for us in showing faithfulness.

00:05:44.323 --> 00:05:47.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
The thought of making faithfulness
our way of life

00:05:47.117 --> 00:05:49.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also be illustrated in the example

00:05:49.328 --> 00:05:52.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the three Hebrew companions of Daniel.

00:05:52.873 --> 00:05:57.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they were young,
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah

00:05:57.002 --> 00:05:59.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
set an excellent example of faithfulness

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what some people
may view as a small thing.

00:06:03.175 --> 00:06:06.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember how they were
pressured to eat unclean food?

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:11.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apparently, their faithful parents
must have instructed them

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:15.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
to adhere strictly to the dietary
restrictions found in the Mosaic Law.

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:21.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah considered these so important
that after listing such restrictions,

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
he stated the words
recorded at Leviticus 11:45:

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:30.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must be holy, because I am holy.”

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:34.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
The king of Babylon assigned
the three Hebrew youths and other young men

00:06:34.581 --> 00:06:37.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a daily ration from [his] delicacies,”

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:41.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
among which were foods forbidden by the Law.

00:06:41.755 --> 00:06:43.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
The three Hebrews could have reasoned

00:06:43.757 --> 00:06:46.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the dietary restrictions
of the Mosaic Law

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
were not so important,

00:06:48.095 --> 00:06:51.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
at least not when compared
to the Ten Commandments.

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:54.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no, those faithful youths were concerned

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:58.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
with living up to all features of God’s Law.

00:06:58.605 --> 00:07:01.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
They determined not to pollute
themselves with such food

00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:04.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
and requested to eat vegetables.

00:07:05.362 --> 00:07:07.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
The matter of which tasted better

00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:10.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
was of no concern to them
in this important decision.

00:07:12.786 --> 00:07:17.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel asked that they be permitted
to try out this diet for ten days.

00:07:17.124 --> 00:07:19.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result?

00:07:19.126 --> 00:07:21.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the ten days,

00:07:21.128 --> 00:07:24.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah blessed those young men
for their faithfulness.

00:07:24.548 --> 00:07:28.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
They looked ‘better and healthier
than any of the other youths’!

00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:32.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was the choice of food a small thing?

00:07:32.389 --> 00:07:34.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not to Jehovah!

00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:36.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was of serious concern to him,

00:07:36.935 --> 00:07:39.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the young Hebrews
had his view of the matter.

00:07:42.024 --> 00:07:45.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their faithfulness in what
may have seemed a small thing

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
prepared them
for a bigger trial in the future.

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:52.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah
had already established a pattern

00:07:52.951 --> 00:07:55.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
of making faithfulness their way of life

00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:57.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
when King Nebuchadnezzar ordered them

00:07:57.873 --> 00:08:01.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bow before an image of gold
on the plains of Dura.

00:08:02.544 --> 00:08:06.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
In faithfulness to Jehovah, they refused.

00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:09.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they made that decision despite knowing

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:12.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it would result in their being
thrown into a fiery furnace.

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:16.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read their words to the king,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Daniel 3:17, 18,

00:08:19.853 --> 00:08:22.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
see if you can sense their faithfulness:

00:08:23.565 --> 00:08:25.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If it must be,

00:08:25.567 --> 00:08:28.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“our God whom we serve is able to rescue us

00:08:28.653 --> 00:08:31.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the burning fiery furnace, O king,

00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:34.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to rescue us from your hand.

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:36.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But even if he does not,

00:08:36.286 --> 00:08:38.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“let it be known to you, O king,

00:08:38.747 --> 00:08:41.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we will not serve your gods

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:44.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
or worship the image of gold
that you have set up.”

00:08:45.921 --> 00:08:50.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
That courageous stand resulted
in their being thrown into the furnace.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we know, Jehovah rescued them.

00:08:53.095 --> 00:08:55.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an outstanding witness they provided

00:08:55.639 --> 00:08:58.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only to the king and his court

00:08:58.058 --> 00:09:00.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to all those
who through the centuries

00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
have read about that account
in the book of Daniel!

00:09:04.689 --> 00:09:07.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
The three Hebrews
looked to Jehovah as their Sovereign,

00:09:07.818 --> 00:09:10.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they proved themselves faithful

00:09:10.195 --> 00:09:12.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
in both large and small matters.

00:09:14.616 --> 00:09:17.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can we imitate Jehovah
and the three Hebrews

00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we too can make
faithfulness our way of life?

00:09:22.332 --> 00:09:25.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ statement recorded
at Luke 16:10 can help.

00:09:25.794 --> 00:09:27.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:30.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The person faithful in what is least

00:09:30.424 --> 00:09:32.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
is faithful also in much.”

00:09:32.926 --> 00:09:36.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those words uttered almost 2,000 years ago

00:09:36.555 --> 00:09:38.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
are still as true as ever.

00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:43.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it may be that you’ll never be asked
to take a stand that demonstrates

00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:46.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
what some might view
as outstanding faithfulness,

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:50.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
as was shown by the three Hebrews
when they didn’t bow down to the image.

00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:55.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
But your constancy in doing what is right

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:59.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your reliability and dependability
in small things

00:09:59.244 --> 00:10:03.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
give evidence of your deep appreciation
for what it means to be faithful.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 31:23 assures us

00:10:07.627 --> 00:10:10.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “Jehovah protects the faithful,”

00:10:10.547 --> 00:10:14.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is true even when
we’re faithful in seemingly small matters.

00:10:16.344 --> 00:10:18.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many areas of our lives
in which we need

00:10:18.638 --> 00:10:21.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
to display faithfulness to Jehovah

00:10:21.433 --> 00:10:25.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, having a regular share
in the ministry each month

00:10:25.687 --> 00:10:27.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reporting our participation.

00:10:27.898 --> 00:10:32.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithfulness to our marriage mate
is very important to Jehovah.

00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:36.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about showing our faithfulness
by staying neutral

00:10:36.406 --> 00:10:40.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to the political
and social conflicts of the world?

00:10:40.452 --> 00:10:42.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we make faithfulness our way of life

00:10:42.537 --> 00:10:45.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes
to our personal conduct each day?

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:50.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
During a personal study session
or family worship,

00:10:50.128 --> 00:10:54.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
why not consider how you can continue
to be faithful in these areas?

00:10:56.176 --> 00:10:58.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about you young ones?

00:10:58.386 --> 00:11:02.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so proud of you when you prove
your faithfulness to Jehovah.

00:11:02.516 --> 00:11:05.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that many of you
face tests of your faith

00:11:05.519 --> 00:11:08.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
that involve the pressure
to engage in immorality

00:11:08.313 --> 00:11:11.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in other forms of bad behavior.

00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:14.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s one thing to know what to do

00:11:14.027 --> 00:11:16.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what choice you should make

00:11:16.238 --> 00:11:19.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
but quite another to have the courage
to do what is right

00:11:19.616 --> 00:11:21.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you’re under pressure or temptation.

00:11:23.537 --> 00:11:25.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
The three Hebrews could have concluded

00:11:25.539 --> 00:11:29.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they could get away with eating
the food God’s Law prohibited,

00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:32.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
since they were far away
from their parents and friends.

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:36.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
They could also have reasoned
that it was the king’s order,

00:11:36.967 --> 00:11:39.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they had no choice
but to do what they were told.

00:11:40.512 --> 00:11:44.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Besides, other youths may have
readily accepted the food arrangements

00:11:44.808 --> 00:11:46.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and viewed it as a privilege.

00:11:48.019 --> 00:11:52.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Hebrew youths knew that,
as mentioned at Proverbs 15:3:

00:11:52.524 --> 00:11:55.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The eyes of Jehovah are everywhere.”

00:11:56.319 --> 00:11:59.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those youths
were determined to remain faithful.

00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:04.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones,
if you learn to deal successfully with trials

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:07.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some may view as small things,

00:12:07.497 --> 00:12:11.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you’ll be able to face
bigger tests of your faith.

00:12:11.501 --> 00:12:14.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never forget
that the benefits of faithfulness

00:12:14.546 --> 00:12:19.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
far outweigh any temporary relief
that comes from compromising.

00:12:21.219 --> 00:12:24.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider one more area
that involves faithfulness:

00:12:24.514 --> 00:12:27.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
our dress and grooming.

00:12:27.142 --> 00:12:31.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
How glad we were to learn
in the <i>2024 Governing Body Update #2</i>

00:12:31.938 --> 00:12:36.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the adjustments to our standard of dress
at theocratic events and in the ministry!

00:12:37.527 --> 00:12:39.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
We commend you brothers and sisters

00:12:39.863 --> 00:12:44.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
for wanting to dress and be groomed
in a dignified way on those occasions.

00:12:46.244 --> 00:12:49.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can we show our faithfulness
in our selection of clothing

00:12:49.372 --> 00:12:52.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
during our leisure time, when on vacation,

00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:55.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when at social gatherings
with our fellow Christians?

00:12:57.380 --> 00:13:01.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Timothy 2:9, 10
admonishes our Christian sisters

00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:05.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “adorn themselves in appropriate dress,

00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:08.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with modesty and soundness of mind, . . .

00:13:08.683 --> 00:13:12.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way that is proper
for women professing devotion to God.”

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the principle of modesty
applies to Christian brothers too.

00:13:18.318 --> 00:13:22.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4 states

00:13:22.197 --> 00:13:26.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “in no way are we giving
any cause for stumbling,

00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:29.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that no fault
may be found with our ministry;

00:13:29.996 --> 00:13:32.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in every way we recommend ourselves

00:13:32.749 --> 00:13:34.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
as God’s ministers.”

00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:39.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In every way” includes
our choice of dress and grooming.

00:13:41.633 --> 00:13:45.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
An article entitled
“Are You Faithful in All Things?”

00:13:45.303 --> 00:13:49.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the July 15, 2005,
issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>  states this:

00:13:51.101 --> 00:13:54.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our dress needs
to be practical and presentable.

00:13:54.896 --> 00:13:58.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This serves as a witness to others
who observe us. . . .

00:13:58.983 --> 00:14:02.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In fact, we should always
be appropriately attired.

00:14:03.863 --> 00:14:07.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To some,
faithfulness in the choice of clothing

00:14:07.826 --> 00:14:10.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“may seem to be a small matter,

00:14:10.495 --> 00:14:13.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in God’s eyes it is important.”

00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:19.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should remember this when it comes
to our choice of dress and grooming.

00:14:21.172 --> 00:14:23.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what will you remember
from this consideration?

00:14:25.135 --> 00:14:28.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most of us admire faithfulness in creation.

00:14:28.471 --> 00:14:31.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we especially appreciate people

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:34.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have made faithfulness their way of life.

00:14:34.394 --> 00:14:36.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have outstanding examples of faithfulness

00:14:36.688 --> 00:14:39.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded in the Bible that we can imitate,

00:14:39.107 --> 00:14:43.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Jehovah,
the three Hebrews, and many others.

00:14:44.362 --> 00:14:48.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
The principle found at Luke 16:10
can help us to be faithful

00:14:48.074 --> 00:14:50.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only in large matters

00:14:50.201 --> 00:14:53.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also in what some may regard
as small matters.

00:14:54.539 --> 00:14:57.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, we encourage you

00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:00.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue to prove
your faithfulness to Jehovah.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
As noted at Proverbs 28:20:

00:15:04.382 --> 00:15:08.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A faithful man will receive many blessings.”

00:15:09.095 --> 00:15:11.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
our main reason for being faithful is,

00:15:11.973 --> 00:15:14.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because of what we get out of it,

00:15:14.517 --> 00:15:17.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of our love for Jehovah.

00:15:17.729 --> 00:15:21.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can be sure that Jehovah
will continue to bless us richly

00:15:21.941 --> 00:15:25.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we make faithfulness our way of life.
