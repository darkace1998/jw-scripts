On February 24, 2021,

00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:06.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Abakan City Court convicted

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:09.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
70-year-old Valentina Baranovskaya
and her son, Roman.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both are Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:00:11.573 --> 00:00:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were cruelly and inhumanely sentenced

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:16.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to two and six years in prison, respectively.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:20.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no way that it can be said
that they committed any crime.

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:22.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were just practicing their religion.

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:23.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following the verdict,

00:00:23.918 --> 00:00:26.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were immediately taken
into custody from the courtroom.

00:00:26.588 --> 00:00:31.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sadly, three months later,
the appeal court upheld the unjust verdict.

00:00:35.179 --> 00:00:38.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, Valentina will be transferred
to prison for two years

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and her son, Roman, for six years.

00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:42.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the ruling was announced,

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:44.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone was crying quietly

00:00:44.271 --> 00:00:47.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was impossible to accept this
without tears.

00:00:49.276 --> 00:00:52.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It lies outside the realm of human reason

00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:54.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they could possibly be “extremists.”

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:58.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did they imprison
such an old and sick woman

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for that long?

00:01:01.913 --> 00:01:04.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her sentence is the first one
in modern-day Russia

00:01:04.708 --> 00:01:06.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where a court has convicted and imprisoned

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a female Witness for her faith
—and a 70-year-old at that.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is also the first Witness

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be imprisoned for participating in,

00:01:14.676 --> 00:01:17.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not organizing, a banned organization.

00:01:17.011 --> 00:01:19.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prior to this,
Jehovah’s Witnesses who were accused

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of violating this article
were fined or given

00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:24.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a suspended prison sentence.

00:01:24.935 --> 00:01:28.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The main grounds
for prosecuting Valentina and her son

00:01:28.564 --> 00:01:31.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are once again
the Supreme Court decision,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which I would call egregious,

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:37.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was handed down on April 20, 2017.

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:40.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On page 32 of the decision,

00:01:40.158 --> 00:01:42.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Supreme Court specifically noted

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:47.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the ruling did not interfere with
or violate the rights of citizens

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet together or worship freely.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nevertheless,
the courts of the Russian Federation

00:01:53.088 --> 00:01:55.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are using this decision

00:01:55.089 --> 00:01:58.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are totally ignoring
the language in that section.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The charges were based
on the evidence of one woman

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:08.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who, pretending to want to study the Bible,
recorded everything on camera

00:02:08.602 --> 00:02:12.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all their discussions—
and handed it over to the FSB.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The criminal case against Valentina and Roman

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:17.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was initiated in April 2019.

00:02:18.654 --> 00:02:20.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their home was subsequently searched.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then in July 2020,
because of being under constant stress,

00:02:24.576 --> 00:02:26.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Valentina suffered a stroke.

00:02:27.788 --> 00:02:30.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was hospitalized,
and then they discovered

00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:32.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she had heart problems as well.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite those circumstances,

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:36.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the court still decided that she needed

00:02:36.588 --> 00:02:39.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be imprisoned and isolated from society.

00:02:41.134 --> 00:02:44.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they had to call an ambulance
five or six times a week

00:02:44.971 --> 00:02:48.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because her blood pressure would skyrocket

00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:50.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she would have problems with her heart.

00:02:51.227 --> 00:02:53.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite Valentina’s health problems
and advanced age,

00:02:53.688 --> 00:02:57.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the detention authorities forced her
to wash the floor of her cell.

00:02:57.775 --> 00:03:00.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to their friends,
Valentina and Roman

00:03:00.402 --> 00:03:02.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are managing to stay positive

00:03:02.404 --> 00:03:04.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite being imprisoned and separated.

00:03:05.616 --> 00:03:07.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In letters,
Valentina relates that she eagerly awaits

00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:11.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the time when they
will be released and reunited.

00:03:11.246 --> 00:03:14.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roman is very worried about his mother.

00:03:14.332 --> 00:03:16.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that for now,

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:19.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while they are still
in the pretrial detention facility,

00:03:19.212 --> 00:03:21.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are allowed to write to each other.

00:03:22.424 --> 00:03:24.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Baranovskiys handled this persecution

00:03:24.968 --> 00:03:27.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a praiseworthy manner.

00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:29.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They never panicked.

00:03:29.013 --> 00:03:32.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They remained calm
and viewed it as something to be expected

00:03:32.934 --> 00:03:35.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what every Christian should be ready for.

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every time I met Valentina,

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never heard her express
any negative sentiments

00:03:41.358 --> 00:03:43.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to her persecutors.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She understands

00:03:45.404 --> 00:03:49.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what is happening and why it is happening.

00:03:49.116 --> 00:03:54.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But she will not renounce her faith
just to make life easier,

00:03:54.121 --> 00:03:56.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
although she was given
the opportunity to do so

00:03:56.832 --> 00:04:00.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the course of the investigation.

00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:04.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even this shameful and inhumane verdict
did not frighten

00:04:04.673 --> 00:04:06.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Valentina and Roman.

00:04:06.674 --> 00:04:09.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They remain loyal to their faith.

00:04:09.135 --> 00:04:12.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their friends hope
that justice will soon be restored

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that this elderly mother and her son

00:04:14.557 --> 00:04:16.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will once again enjoy freedom.
