What do you see
when you look at this picture?

00:00:04.525 --> 00:00:06.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see yourself in it?

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:08.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should.

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why?

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.616 line:10% position:50% align:center
This picture helps us to visualize

00:00:12.616 --> 00:00:15.077 line:10% position:50% align:center
the beautiful description of Jehovah

00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.329 line:10% position:50% align:center
found at Isaiah 40:11:

00:00:18.038 --> 00:00:21.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like a shepherd he will care for his flock.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With his arm
he will gather together the lambs,

00:00:25.462 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in his bosom he will carry them.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:31.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will gently lead
those nursing their young.”

00:00:32.511 --> 00:00:35.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah bears many titles in the Bible,

00:00:35.306 --> 00:00:37.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the designation “Shepherd”

00:00:37.683 --> 00:00:40.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
is among the most tender.

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:41.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a shepherd,

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:46.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says ‘he will carry
his lambs in his bosom,’

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
illustrating his tender love and care

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each one of his precious sheep.

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:54.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look again at the picture.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it hard for you to see yourself as a lamb

00:00:57.786 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
nestled in the bosom
of our Shepherd, Jehovah?

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:03.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that many
of you dear brothers and sisters

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
are coping with very difficult challenges

00:01:06.337 --> 00:01:10.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
day after day in this cruel, wicked world.

00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:15.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such challenges can make it difficult for you
to feel like a lamb,

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:19.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
safe and secure in the bosom of our Shepherd.

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please be assured

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:25.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is fully aware
of every challenge you face.

00:01:26.523 --> 00:01:28.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can you be so sure?

00:01:28.984 --> 00:01:33.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read what David,
the writer of Psalm 23:4, says:

00:01:33.864 --> 00:01:36.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow,

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I fear no harm, for you are with me;

00:01:41.205 --> 00:01:45.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
your rod and your staff reassure me.”

00:01:46.293 --> 00:01:48.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Much like a physical valley

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:51.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
located deep in the shadows
of nearby mountains,

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:54.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
a figurative valley
can be used to describe

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:56.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
a low point in one’s life

00:01:56.595 --> 00:02:01.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when we’re feeling down,
gloomy, or in a dark place.

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:04.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David wrote this psalm,

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was feeling down,
at a low point in his life.

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:12.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what “valley of deep shadow”
are you currently going through?

00:02:13.153 --> 00:02:17.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you feeling overwhelmed with
trying to provide for your family’s needs?

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:21.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with a serious health issue,
such as cancer?

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:28.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
exhausted because you are caring
for your mate or a parent with dementia?

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:31.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to cope with the death of a loved one?

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:34.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
battling feelings of loneliness,

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:37.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
worthlessness, or anxiety?

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:39.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
or facing persecution?

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:43.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so difficult to remain positive

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
when facing the darkest days of our life.

00:02:47.896 --> 00:02:49.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is a bright side.

00:02:49.648 --> 00:02:51.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:02:51.942 --> 00:02:54.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is aware
of the mountainlike obstacles

00:02:54.903 --> 00:02:57.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
that cause you to feel low,

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:59.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if you were in a “valley of deep shadow.”

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
He not only sees your pain,

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he’s ready to come to your rescue,

00:03:04.997 --> 00:03:07.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
lift you up with his strong arms,

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:11.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and embrace you
like that lamb in the picture.

00:03:12.296 --> 00:03:17.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 23 is one
of the most well-known passages in the Bible

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:20.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beautifully describes the loving way

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:24.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our Shepherd, Jehovah, leads, protects,

00:03:24.016 --> 00:03:26.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feeds his precious sheep.

00:03:27.102 --> 00:03:31.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we consider these three ways
that Jehovah cares for us,

00:03:31.023 --> 00:03:34.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for the answers
to the following questions:

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah do?

00:03:36.987 --> 00:03:38.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he do it?

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do you need to do?

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:45.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first way: Our Shepherd leads us.

00:03:46.747 --> 00:03:50.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 23:1, the theme of our discussion,

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:53.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
David expressed with full confidence:

00:03:53.754 --> 00:03:57.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is my Shepherd.
I will lack nothing.”

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:01.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a young man,
David proved to be a capable shepherd

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:06.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
who tenderly cared for
and protected his entire flock

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cared for the specific needs
of each sheep.

00:04:10.687 --> 00:04:14.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in Psalm 23, David portrays himself,

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:17.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
not as a shepherd, but as a humble sheep

00:04:17.653 --> 00:04:20.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the loving care of Jehovah,

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:24.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
affectionately calling him “my Shepherd.”

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:30.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his lifetime,
David experienced many highs and lows,

00:04:30.165 --> 00:04:34.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
peaks and valleys, joys and disappointments.

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:38.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever
“valley of deep shadow” he faced,

00:04:38.632 --> 00:04:43.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
David always relied on his Shepherd
to lead him to safety

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provide exactly
what he needed when he needed it.

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:52.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
With complete trust and confidence, he said:

00:04:52.104 --> 00:04:54.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will lack nothing.”

00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:56.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder Psalm 23

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:00.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been called
“a psalm of assurance or trust.”

00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:04.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does our Shepherd do?

00:05:04.491 --> 00:05:06.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 2 and 3 answer:

00:05:07.244 --> 00:05:10.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In grassy pastures he makes me lie down;

00:05:10.664 --> 00:05:14.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he leads me to well-watered resting-places.

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:16.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He refreshes me.

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:19.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He leads me in the paths of righteousness

00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:20.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the sake of his name.”

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:23.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once explained:

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:26.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“David here paints a scene of contentment,

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:29.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
refreshment, and security.”

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:34.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah leads us to “grassy pastures”
and “tranquil waters.”

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Hebrew word rendered ‘pastures’
can mean ‘pleasant place.’”

00:05:40.652 --> 00:05:43.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we humbly follow our Shepherd,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will lead us to a “pleasant place”

00:05:46.074 --> 00:05:49.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we can feel secure
and have peace of mind,

00:05:49.244 --> 00:05:52.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when we’re going through
a “valley of deep shadow.”

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah lead us?

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of his Word,
he teaches us how to make wise decisions

00:06:00.923 --> 00:06:04.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
that lead to “paths of righteousness,”

00:06:04.384 --> 00:06:08.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
a life course that is pleasing to him
and brings us happiness.

00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:13.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sets a course and a pace
that we’re able to follow,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
never expecting us
to do more than we’re able.

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:19.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also leads us

00:06:19.274 --> 00:06:22.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of undershepherds, the elders,

00:06:22.236 --> 00:06:25.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
who tenderly care for us spiritually,

00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:27.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotionally, and physically

00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:29.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we will “lack nothing.”

00:06:31.245 --> 00:06:33.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you need to do?

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re going
through a “valley of deep shadow,”

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
search our many publications

00:06:38.543 --> 00:06:41.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
for specific Bible principles

00:06:41.338 --> 00:06:45.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helpful advice that can shed light
on your present circumstances

00:06:45.133 --> 00:06:49.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provide practical ways
to overcome difficulties

00:06:49.263 --> 00:06:52.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
or give you the patience to endure.

00:06:53.642 --> 00:06:56.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many find encouragement and comfort

00:06:56.144 --> 00:06:58.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
watching JW Broadcasting®.

00:06:58.522 --> 00:07:00.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, one sister said:

00:07:00.983 --> 00:07:05.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“JW Broadcasting
has helped me to be more positive . . .

00:07:05.112 --> 00:07:07.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I get lonely or discouraged,

00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:09.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I find an encouraging talk

00:07:09.574 --> 00:07:11.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
or [a] Morning Worship program to watch.”

00:07:13.203 --> 00:07:16.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you benefiting
from the monthly broadcasts,

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:18.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
videos, and uplifting songs?

00:07:19.835 --> 00:07:23.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second way: Our Shepherd protects us.

00:07:24.298 --> 00:07:27.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the second half of verse 4:

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your rod and your staff reassure me.”

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:34.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
David used a shepherd’s rod and staff

00:07:34.933 --> 00:07:37.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
to illustrate Jehovah’s protective care.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:41.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ancient shepherds used a rod
to protect their sheep from predators

00:07:41.523 --> 00:07:45.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as lions, bears, wolves, and snakes.

00:07:46.278 --> 00:07:49.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also used a staff to guide their sheep,

00:07:49.197 --> 00:07:52.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
gently nudging them in the right direction.

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:55.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, some staffs had a hook

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of the long stick
that helped them as a shepherd

00:07:59.499 --> 00:08:04.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gently draw back a sheep straying
or nibbling into danger,

00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:07.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
guiding them back
to the protection of the flock.

00:08:08.383 --> 00:08:10.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sheep certainly did not fear

00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:13.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the shepherd would use his rod
or his staff to beat them.

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:17.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah do?

00:08:17.059 --> 00:08:21.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loving Shepherd stands
ready to use his figurative rod and staff

00:08:21.646 --> 00:08:26.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warn and protect us
from predators seeking to harm us,

00:08:26.276 --> 00:08:28.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially from Satan,

00:08:28.445 --> 00:08:33.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
who in the Bible is portrayed
as a vicious lion and a cunning serpent.

00:08:34.368 --> 00:08:37.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also has appointed
elders in the congregation

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:41.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warn and protect us
from harmful influences

00:08:41.458 --> 00:08:45.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from taking a dangerous path
in this wicked world.

00:08:46.254 --> 00:08:49.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you’re filled
with heartfelt appreciation

00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:54.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are comforted
knowing that Jehovah is always on the lookout

00:08:54.221 --> 00:08:56.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use his figurative rod and staff

00:08:56.807 --> 00:09:00.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warn and protect us, not to beat us.

00:09:01.812 --> 00:09:06.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve strayed or nibbled away
from the flock for whatever reason,

00:09:06.858 --> 00:09:09.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
please listen to Jehovah

00:09:09.528 --> 00:09:13.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he speaks to you
through his written Word, the Bible,

00:09:13.115 --> 00:09:15.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our brotherhood.

00:09:15.117 --> 00:09:17.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly follow the gentle nudging

00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:21.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead you back
to the safety of the congregation,

00:09:21.123 --> 00:09:24.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you’ll enjoy lush “grassy pastures”

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:28.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
and refreshing “well-watered resting-places.”

00:09:29.172 --> 00:09:32.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders, you are entrusted

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:35.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a privileged but heavy responsibility

00:09:35.637 --> 00:09:38.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect Jehovah’s precious sheep,

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:40.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom He’s placed under your care.

00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:45.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
We take this opportunity
to express our sincere appreciation

00:09:45.355 --> 00:09:48.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those of you
who use your figurative rod and staff

00:09:48.984 --> 00:09:53.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect the sheep,
never making them feel beaten down

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:56.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
but truly loved and appreciated.

00:09:58.076 --> 00:10:00.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah protect us?

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:04.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
He protects us as a group, or flock.

00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:08.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan will never succeed
in wiping Jehovah’s sheep from the earth.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:13.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also protects
each sheep individually.

00:10:13.884 --> 00:10:15.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:10:15.427 --> 00:10:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most important, he protects us spiritually.

00:10:19.556 --> 00:10:23.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Draw Close to Jehovah</i>  book explains:

00:10:23.143 --> 00:10:26.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our loving God
protects us from spiritual harm

00:10:26.229 --> 00:10:29.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by equipping us with what we need
in order to endure trials

00:10:29.941 --> 00:10:32.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to safeguard our relationship with him.

00:10:32.986 --> 00:10:35.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah thus works to preserve our life,

00:10:35.447 --> 00:10:40.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just for a few short years
but for eternity.”

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:44.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
How reassuring that Jehovah makes sure

00:10:44.414 --> 00:10:46.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have everything we need

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we will, in effect, “lack nothing”!

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:54.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you need to do?

00:10:54.049 --> 00:10:56.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take full advantage
of the many provisions

00:10:56.635 --> 00:11:00.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah makes available
to protect us spiritually

00:11:00.347 --> 00:11:03.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
—prayer, fellow worshippers,

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:05.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and timely spiritual food,

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:08.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we’ll discuss next.

00:11:08.021 --> 00:11:12.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third way: Our Shepherd feeds us.

00:11:12.317 --> 00:11:15.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 23:5, 6 reassures us:

00:11:16.071 --> 00:11:19.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You prepare a table for me
before my enemies.

00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:24.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You refresh my head with oil;
my cup is well-filled.

00:11:24.955 --> 00:11:29.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Surely goodness and loyal love
will pursue me all the days of my life,

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah
for all my days.”

00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:36.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah do?

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:38.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
David now describes our Shepherd

00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:43.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a generous host
who spreads before us, his invited guests,

00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:48.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
delicious and nutritious food and drink
in great abundance.

00:11:49.521 --> 00:11:51.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah feed us?

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:54.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:11:54.025 --> 00:11:56.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives us timely publications

00:11:56.611 --> 00:12:01.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as rich spiritual programs
at our meetings, assemblies,

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:06.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
conventions, JW Broadcasting,
Governing Body updates,

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with encouraging songs and videos,

00:12:09.291 --> 00:12:11.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so much more.

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:15.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, the slave is giving us
“food at the proper time”

00:12:15.213 --> 00:12:18.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what we need when we need it.

00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:21.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
We certainly “lack nothing” spiritually.

00:12:22.721 --> 00:12:24.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you need to do?

00:12:25.348 --> 00:12:29.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show your appreciation
for the food the slave provides

00:12:29.311 --> 00:12:32.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
by eating it and never being fussy, picky,

00:12:32.897 --> 00:12:35.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
or selective in your eating habits.

00:12:35.609 --> 00:12:39.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the Bible
and Bible-based publications

00:12:39.529 --> 00:12:43.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
are ways that Jehovah speaks to us,
in effect, saying:

00:12:43.074 --> 00:12:46.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the way.
Walk in it,” my precious sheep.

00:12:47.621 --> 00:12:48.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read the Bible

00:12:48.788 --> 00:12:52.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meditate on the verses
that touch our heart,

00:12:52.125 --> 00:12:55.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be better equipped
to correct any faulty thinking

00:12:55.545 --> 00:12:59.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could lead us
to dark feelings of anxiety,

00:12:59.341 --> 00:13:02.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
loneliness, worthlessness,

00:13:02.427 --> 00:13:04.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
anger, or resentment.

00:13:05.472 --> 00:13:09.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like David, be determined
to “dwell in the house of Jehovah

00:13:09.517 --> 00:13:11.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all [your] days.”

00:13:11.353 --> 00:13:14.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue attending our upbuilding meetings,

00:13:14.147 --> 00:13:16.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
assemblies, and conventions,

00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:20.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we receive
spiritual nourishment and protection.

00:13:21.613 --> 00:13:25.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister who has traversed
various “valley[s] of deep shadow”

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:30.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressed what helps her
to stay focused and to keep on enduring.

00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:35.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said: “Depressive thoughts
are not trustworthy.

00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:37.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are the product of a treacherous heart

00:13:37.587 --> 00:13:40.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that distorts our thinking abilities.

00:13:40.423 --> 00:13:44.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But because I trust Jehovah completely,

00:13:44.177 --> 00:13:48.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each Bible verse proves to be
like a solid stepping stone

00:13:48.682 --> 00:13:53.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
that enables me to gradually climb out
of my many valleys of deep shadow.”

00:13:55.063 --> 00:13:57.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister expressed so well

00:13:57.607 --> 00:14:00.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we feel about our loving Shepherd

00:14:00.443 --> 00:14:03.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
who promises to help us successfully navigate

00:14:03.822 --> 00:14:06.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
through any “valley of deep shadow.”

00:14:07.242 --> 00:14:09.285 line:10% position:50% align:center
Isn’t this a beautiful picture

00:14:09.285 --> 00:14:11.287 line:10% position:50% align:center
of a shepherd with his sheep?

00:14:11.287 --> 00:14:12.330 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s adorned

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.040 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body conference room

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:16.376 line:10% position:50% align:center
since the 1970’s.

00:14:16.376 --> 00:14:18.545 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s a visual reminder

00:14:18.545 --> 00:14:21.214 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the importance of their work as shepherds.

00:14:21.881 --> 00:14:25.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lösch, a member
of the Governing Body since 1994,

00:14:25.802 --> 00:14:27.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
recently explained

00:14:27.679 --> 00:14:32.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
what this inspiring painting
has meant to him throughout the decades.

00:14:32.183 --> 00:14:34.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy the following video segment.

00:14:35.103 --> 00:14:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
This painting
in the Governing Body conference room

00:14:38.648 --> 00:14:41.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows the shepherd and his sheep.

00:14:41.818 --> 00:14:44.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the shepherd is caring for the sheep,

00:14:44.529 --> 00:14:48.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they feel, obviously,
comfortable and protected.

00:14:48.491 --> 00:14:51.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they do that despite,

00:14:51.161 --> 00:14:54.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you can see in the background,
stormy weather.

00:14:54.748 --> 00:14:57.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the sheep feel just fine.

00:14:57.834 --> 00:15:01.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
In connection
with the application in the Bible,

00:15:01.004 --> 00:15:03.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible shows that Jehovah God

00:15:03.339 --> 00:15:07.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a shepherd who cares for us as his sheep,

00:15:07.302 --> 00:15:09.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
but so is Jesus Christ.

00:15:09.345 --> 00:15:11.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is called “the fine shepherd.”

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:14.559 line:10% position:50% align:center
And what are shepherds to do?

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:18.897 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, shepherds lead the sheep,

00:15:18.897 --> 00:15:21.357 line:10% position:50% align:center
feed the sheep,

00:15:21.357 --> 00:15:24.652 line:10% position:50% align:center
and shepherds protect the sheep.

00:15:24.652 --> 00:15:28.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then shepherds
also care for injured

00:15:28.448 --> 00:15:29.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ailing sheep.

00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:34.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact is
that all of God’s people are sheep.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we have the privilege

00:15:35.997 --> 00:15:39.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all follow the lead

00:15:39.584 --> 00:15:42.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah and Jesus and the elders

00:15:42.295 --> 00:15:44.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to work together in unity.

00:15:44.881 --> 00:15:47.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the Governing Body meeting,

00:15:47.175 --> 00:15:51.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
we sometimes look at the picture

00:15:51.429 --> 00:15:55.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we try to apply

00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:58.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is implied in the painting

00:15:58.394 --> 00:16:02.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our work with the congregations
and the worldwide flock.

Thank you, Brother Lösch, for sharing
those encouraging comments with us.

00:16:08.154 --> 00:16:10.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
How reassuring it is to know

00:16:10.657 --> 00:16:13.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our loving shepherds
on the Governing Body

00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:17.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
take their responsibility to lead, protect,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feed you, me,
and all of Jehovah’s precious sheep

00:16:21.376 --> 00:16:23.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
very seriously!

00:16:23.211 --> 00:16:27.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all continue
to humbly and obediently follow their lead

00:16:27.674 --> 00:16:32.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we follow closely the lead
of our Great Shepherd, Jehovah,

00:16:32.303 --> 00:16:36.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the footsteps
of our Fine Shepherd and King, Jesus.

00:16:37.517 --> 00:16:41.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never forget that Jehovah
is not just our Shepherd,

00:16:41.646 --> 00:16:45.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is your Shepherd; he is my Shepherd.

00:16:45.608 --> 00:16:50.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah, our Shepherd,
leading, protecting, and feeding us,

00:16:50.822 --> 00:16:53.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can face the future
with complete confidence

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:56.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
and echo the words that David used

00:16:56.327 --> 00:16:59.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
to introduce this beautiful
and reassuring psalm

00:16:59.622 --> 00:17:02.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the words contained at Psalm 23:1:

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is my Shepherd.

00:17:04.544 --> 00:17:06.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will lack nothing.”
