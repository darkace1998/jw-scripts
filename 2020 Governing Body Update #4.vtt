In the face of this pandemic,

00:00:03.453 --> 00:00:05.588 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we’ve made dramatic adjustments

00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:08.391 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to our activities all over the world,

00:00:08.391 --> 00:00:11.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including how we meet, how we preach,

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:15.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even how we associate with one another.

00:00:15.298 --> 00:00:19.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve even had to make adjustments
<i>to the adjustments</i>

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:21.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the changing conditions.

00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:26.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you know, some of these changes
have come very quickly,

00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want to commend you
for your obedience to theocratic direction.

00:00:31.347 --> 00:00:35.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love you all very much
and want to keep you safe

00:00:35.952 --> 00:00:40.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while helping you to maintain
a good spiritual routine.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we think about what happens next,

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s important to remember
that we’re not all experiencing

00:00:47.997 --> 00:00:51.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this global crisis the same way.

00:00:51.034 --> 00:00:53.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some parts of the world,

00:00:53.236 --> 00:00:57.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the coronavirus is just beginning
to spread more quickly.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other places, outbreaks appear
to be somewhat contained for now,

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:06.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and governments
are already easing restrictions.

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:11.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how will this affect
our theocratic activities?

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:16.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as things open up in various regions,

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:19.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to be guided by the principle

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:24.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Proverbs 14:16,

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:27.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 14:16,

00:01:28.238 --> 00:01:30.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wise one is cautious
and turns away from evil,

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:40.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the stupid one
is reckless and overconfident.”

00:01:40.784 --> 00:01:45.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this pandemic,
recklessness and overconfidence

00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:49.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have literally cost people their lives.

00:01:49.392 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as the proverb says:

00:01:51.928 --> 00:01:55.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The wise one is cautious.”

00:01:55.165 --> 00:01:58.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll continue to take
a cautious approach.

00:01:58.935 --> 00:02:01.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In general, we’ll allow more time

00:02:01.838 --> 00:02:04.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the government
loosens a particular restriction

00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:08.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before we resume a theocratic activity.

00:02:09.846 --> 00:02:13.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will allow the organization
to monitor the impact

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that any lifting of restrictions has

00:02:16.786 --> 00:02:20.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the spread of the virus.

00:02:20.023 --> 00:02:23.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Coordinators’ Committee
of the Governing Body

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:26.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recently shared some valuable principles

00:02:26.462 --> 00:02:29.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Branch Committees around the world

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:32.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help guide them
as governments ease restrictions

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:36.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
related to the spread of COVID-19.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:40.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d like to share
three of those points with you now.

00:02:41.444 --> 00:02:45.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are confident
that obediently holding to these principles

00:02:45.715 --> 00:02:48.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will not only save lives

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but glorify Jehovah.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, out of respect for our Creator,

00:02:55.158 --> 00:02:58.795 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we place a high value on life.

00:02:58.795 --> 00:03:00.797 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Some governments may choose

00:03:00.797 --> 00:03:04.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to lift restrictions
and reopen businesses,

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in part for economic reasons.

00:03:08.071 --> 00:03:10.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But simply put,

00:03:10.206 --> 00:03:14.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our decisions are motivated by love,

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:16.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not money.

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we’ll continue to make
the safety of our brothers a priority

00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over personal convenience or preference.

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:29.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 7:12 says this,

00:03:29.993 --> 00:03:31.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ecclesiastes 7:12:

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wisdom is a protection

00:03:35.164 --> 00:03:37.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as money is a protection,

00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:41.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the advantage of knowledge is this:

00:03:41.104 --> 00:03:45.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wisdom preserves the life of its owner.”

00:03:45.942 --> 00:03:48.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, in harmony with that,

00:03:48.111 --> 00:03:51.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our aim has been and will continue to be

00:03:51.347 --> 00:03:55.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make wise, balanced decisions
that protect lives.

00:03:56.552 --> 00:04:00.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example,
back in March we made the decision

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:05.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hold the Gilead graduation
with no invited guests present.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:07.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a big change.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that one decision protected
so many lives here at Bethel in New York

00:04:12.268 --> 00:04:15.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and among those
who would have been guests.

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:19.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Little did we know
that just a short time later,

00:04:19.142 --> 00:04:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
New York would become
an epicenter of the pandemic.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Jehovah for helping us

00:04:26.082 --> 00:04:29.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make that wise decision!

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:32.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the lesson?

00:04:32.522 --> 00:04:35.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because we place a high value on life,

00:04:35.725 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to follow direction

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if it seems overly cautious

00:04:40.797 --> 00:04:45.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or means significant changes
in our theocratic activities.

00:04:46.269 --> 00:04:51.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That obedience will help to keep
all of us as safe as possible.

00:04:52.008 --> 00:04:55.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video,
note how this has proved to be the case

00:04:55.845 --> 00:04:58.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the brothers in South America,

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:01.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the outbreak of COVID-19 cases

00:05:01.351 --> 00:05:04.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has surged in recent weeks.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll hear from Brother Anthony Carvalho,

00:05:06.856 --> 00:05:09.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves on the Brazil Branch Committee,

00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:11.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and from Brother Jaime Tamayo,

00:05:11.461 --> 00:05:14.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serves on the Ecuador Branch Committee.

00:05:14.831 --> 00:05:18.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their reports show the benefits of obedience

00:05:18.801 --> 00:05:23.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if at first we don’t understand
the reasons for the direction.

00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:27.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The outbreak of COVID-19

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:31.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has already taken
tens of thousands of lives in Brazil,

00:05:32.148 --> 00:05:33.149 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and so we’ve come to appreciate

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:34.484 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how the early direction

00:05:34.484 --> 00:05:36.252 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we received from the organization

00:05:36.252 --> 00:05:38.521 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was a real protection.

00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:41.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example is a sister
who is a medical doctor.

00:05:41.924 --> 00:05:43.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said that when the branch office

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:46.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave direction to suspend
meetings at the Kingdom Hall,

00:05:46.863 --> 00:05:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she honestly did not agree.

00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:53.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There weren’t any confirmed cases
of COVID-19 in the region,

00:05:53.336 --> 00:05:57.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the local government
had not ordered any restrictions.

00:05:57.306 --> 00:06:01.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she felt the brothers
might be exaggerating the threat a bit.

00:06:01.811 --> 00:06:06.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then she reasoned on how Jehovah
had sometimes given his people direction

00:06:06.682 --> 00:06:09.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that didn’t make sense
from a human standpoint,

00:06:09.652 --> 00:06:12.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so she decided to obey.

00:06:13.189 --> 00:06:16.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, shortly after congregation meetings
were suspended,

00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:20.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the government put restrictions in place.

00:06:20.096 --> 00:06:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
COVID-19 began to spread rapidly
in the region,

00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:27.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sadly many have died.

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our sister said that she now sees

00:06:29.338 --> 00:06:33.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the direction
from the organization was a real protection.

00:06:33.076 --> 00:06:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She related,

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:38.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seeing how Jehovah
is caring for us in a loving and tender way,

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:40.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even on an individual level,

00:06:40.917 --> 00:06:43.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has increased my confidence in him.”

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, this is just one example
of many here in Brazil,

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we have truly seen the benefits

00:06:50.226 --> 00:06:53.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of obediently following theocratic direction.

00:06:55.898 --> 00:06:58.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no question that the early direction

00:06:58.768 --> 00:07:01.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we received in Ecuador saved lives.

00:07:01.337 --> 00:07:04.273 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For instance, one publisher, Fabricio,

00:07:04.273 --> 00:07:07.276 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
started to have some flulike symptoms,

00:07:07.276 --> 00:07:08.978 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but his doctor told him

00:07:08.978 --> 00:07:10.680 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it was the common flu

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not COVID-19.

00:07:12.682 --> 00:07:16.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, Fabricio followed
the instructions from the organization

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to stay home if you have
any symptoms of illness.

00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:23.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later he said,
“All in our family agreed

00:07:23.893 --> 00:07:27.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that it was important
to follow these instructions

00:07:27.396 --> 00:07:30.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since they were given to protect us.”

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the following weeks,

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:36.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he and his family
didn’t allow anyone into the house.

00:07:36.272 --> 00:07:39.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when relatives came to visit them,

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:44.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they received them outside the house
to maintain a safe distance.

00:07:44.213 --> 00:07:49.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Around the same time,
meetings at the Kingdom Hall were suspended.

00:07:49.185 --> 00:07:51.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, several weeks later,

00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:54.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fabricio tested positive for COVID-19

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:58.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so did three family members.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:02.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fabricio’s family are so glad
that they followed the instructions

00:08:02.365 --> 00:08:04.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received from the organization.

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:07.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They maintained distancing protocols

00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even without a positive diagnosis
of COVID-19.

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:14.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This protected the lives of others,

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including their extended family
and the congregation.

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This really helped us appreciate

00:08:20.383 --> 00:08:24.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wisdom of suspending
congregation meetings when we did.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:29.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing so prevented
the spread of the disease to others.

00:08:31.661 --> 00:08:36.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a powerful example
of how our obedience to direction

00:08:36.499 --> 00:08:39.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a protection and a blessing!

00:08:41.304 --> 00:08:46.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our second principle
is based on Romans 13:1, 2:

00:08:46.175 --> 00:08:47.410 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We must listen

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.146 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the governmental “superior authorities,”

00:08:50.146 --> 00:08:52.348 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who are permitted by Jehovah

00:08:52.348 --> 00:08:54.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for certain functions.

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:57.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The importance of listening
to these authorities

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:02.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is emphasized in verse 2,
where it says:

00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:04.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whoever opposes the authority

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“(or, according to the footnote,
whoever ‘resists’ the authority)

00:09:08.631 --> 00:09:12.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has taken a stand
against the arrangement of God.”

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:18.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that these authorities
exist by God’s permission,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:22.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s his will
that Christians be subject to them,

00:09:22.111 --> 00:09:26.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as what they require
doesn’t conflict with his law.

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
News reports are filled with stories

00:09:30.052 --> 00:09:33.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of people ignoring
the direction from the authorities

00:09:33.055 --> 00:09:36.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even protesting against it.

00:09:36.092 --> 00:09:38.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But rebelling against secular authorities

00:09:38.961 --> 00:09:43.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
constitutes a rebellion against God.

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:45.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love Jehovah,

00:09:45.768 --> 00:09:50.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we respect the authorities.

00:09:50.206 --> 00:09:54.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also listen to the authorities
because we love our neighbors,

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:59.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re concerned
with how they feel about health and safety.

00:09:59.282 --> 00:10:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that many people

00:10:01.684 --> 00:10:04.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of concern for possible infection

00:10:04.587 --> 00:10:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are anxious about interacting with others.

00:10:08.324 --> 00:10:11.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following safety guidelines
from the authorities

00:10:11.127 --> 00:10:13.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and adjusting our activities

00:10:13.129 --> 00:10:17.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows that we really care
about our neighbors.

00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:21.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this can even contribute
to a good witness being given.

00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:24.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s an example of that:

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:26.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one European country,

00:10:26.375 --> 00:10:29.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
local officials visited our branch office

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:34.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to check on what we were doing
to slow the spread of the virus.

00:10:34.517 --> 00:10:37.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the officials learned
that we were holding

00:10:37.019 --> 00:10:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all our meetings by videoconference

00:10:39.722 --> 00:10:43.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and had already been in lockdown
for over two weeks,

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were amazed!

00:10:45.194 --> 00:10:47.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of them asked,

00:10:47.196 --> 00:10:50.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Did you know beforehand
that all of this would happen?”

00:10:52.134 --> 00:10:56.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers explained
that we’re a global organization

00:10:56.138 --> 00:10:59.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that puts a high value on human life,

00:10:59.608 --> 00:11:03.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we were following developments
on an international level.

00:11:04.814 --> 00:11:07.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That enabled the brothers
to take the steps needed

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep everyone as safe as possible,

00:11:10.853 --> 00:11:15.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even ahead of guidelines
from the national and local governments.

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The officials were impressed.

00:11:20.663 --> 00:11:23.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doesn’t that beautifully illustrate

00:11:23.332 --> 00:11:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how our obedience reflects favorably

00:11:26.469 --> 00:11:30.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on our organization and our God?

00:11:30.439 --> 00:11:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brings to mind
the thought at 1 Peter 2:12.

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:40.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When people become
‘eyewitnesses of our fine conduct,’

00:11:40.116 --> 00:11:43.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it brings glory to Jehovah.

00:11:45.221 --> 00:11:48.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third principle we want to share is this:

00:11:48.991 --> 00:11:53.396 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do not develop a casual attitude.

00:11:54.997 --> 00:11:59.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As this situation
stretches on month after month,

00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it can be hard to stay vigilant.

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:06.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might be inclined to relax,

00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:08.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
lower our guard,

00:12:08.043 --> 00:12:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially as certain restrictions
are removed.

00:12:12.114 --> 00:12:16.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However,
Proverbs 22:3 reminds us:

00:12:17.119 --> 00:12:19.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The shrewd one sees the danger

00:12:19.488 --> 00:12:21.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and conceals himself,

00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but the inexperienced keep right on going

00:12:25.528 --> 00:12:28.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suffer the consequences.”

00:12:28.531 --> 00:12:33.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to remain cautious
and be ready for additional outbreaks.

00:12:33.402 --> 00:12:36.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many experts say we may be dealing

00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:38.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the spread of this virus for some time

00:12:38.974 --> 00:12:42.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the successful treatments 
and vaccinations

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become widely available,

00:12:44.547 --> 00:12:48.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
possibly in 2021 or beyond.

00:12:49.518 --> 00:12:52.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that the adjusted arrangements

00:12:52.221 --> 00:12:55.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have in place for congregation meetings,

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:58.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assemblies, and the field ministry

00:12:58.194 --> 00:13:01.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may need to continue for some time.

00:13:03.365 --> 00:13:07.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we do begin returning
to our normal arrangements,

00:13:07.203 --> 00:13:09.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will be a gradual process,

00:13:09.939 --> 00:13:11.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in accord with what we read

00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:15.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Proverbs 14:15:

00:13:15.945 --> 00:13:19.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The naive person believes every word,

00:13:19.815 --> 00:13:24.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the shrewd one ponders each step.”

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:27.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be assured

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:30.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we will prayerfully ponder 
each step

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:35.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and adjust our meeting
and service arrangements gradually.

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:40.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course,
we’ll monitor the situation closely

00:13:40.669 --> 00:13:45.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reinstate certain restrictions
if additional outbreaks occur.

00:13:47.209 --> 00:13:51.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as you face the days ahead,

00:13:51.313 --> 00:13:54.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
keep in mind
the three principles we’ve talked about:

00:13:55.885 --> 00:14:00.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Place a high value on life,

00:14:01.223 --> 00:14:04.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) listen to the authorities,

00:14:05.594 --> 00:14:10.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) guard against developing
a casual attitude.

00:14:13.135 --> 00:14:18.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that this pandemic
has hit some of you very hard.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:21.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve lost jobs and income.

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:25.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You young ones have had
your schooling interrupted,

00:14:25.214 --> 00:14:28.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you haven’t been able
to be with your friends.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:32.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And tragically,
a number of you

00:14:32.054 --> 00:14:36.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have lost family members
and friends in death.

00:14:37.760 --> 00:14:40.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you may feel like Job,

00:14:40.529 --> 00:14:44.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who faced one tragedy after another.

00:14:45.734 --> 00:14:50.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It pains our hearts
to see what you’re going through,

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re praying for you every day.

00:14:56.478 --> 00:14:59.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a difficult time.

00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, in many ways,

00:15:01.684 --> 00:15:06.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of this has been training
for the great tribulation ahead.

00:15:07.456 --> 00:15:12.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we’re learning now
about how to adapt our spiritual routines,

00:15:12.227 --> 00:15:17.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to support one another,
and to be obedient to direction

00:15:17.232 --> 00:15:20.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is building us up and equipping us

00:15:20.469 --> 00:15:24.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for even bigger challenges in the future.

00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:31.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been very encouraging to hear
how our brothers around the world

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are helping one another
during this unique time

00:15:34.483 --> 00:15:36.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in human history.

00:15:36.619 --> 00:15:39.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your actions are bringing honor

00:15:39.755 --> 00:15:42.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and praise to Jehovah.

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters from Brazil and Ecuador

00:15:48.998 --> 00:15:51.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send you their warm greetings.

00:15:52.067 --> 00:15:54.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on behalf of the Governing Body,

00:15:54.403 --> 00:15:57.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we thank you for all you’re doing,

00:15:57.539 --> 00:16:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under these difficult circumstances.

00:16:01.443 --> 00:16:06.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please know that we love you very much.

00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:11.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.
