00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:02.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, everyone!

00:00:02.952 --> 00:00:04.621 line:10% position:50% align:center
In this program,

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:06.222 line:10% position:50% align:center
we are going to find out

00:00:06.222 --> 00:00:09.359 line:10% position:50% align:center
what the yeartext will be for 2023.

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stay tuned.

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:15.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, here are a few updates.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:20.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt we all enjoyed
the “Pursue Peace”! Convention.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wasn’t that an outstanding program?

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:25.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was so practical.

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:27.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how thrilling it was
to hear the announcement

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’re planning in-person
regional conventions for 2023!

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:34.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
After three years,

00:00:34.417 --> 00:00:38.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’ll be so good to meet together
with our brothers and sisters

00:00:38.188 --> 00:00:41.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
in person at a convention.

00:00:41.091 --> 00:00:44.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also exciting that we’ll return
to the house-to-house ministry

00:00:44.728 --> 00:00:46.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting September 1

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just in time for our worldwide campaign
to start Bible studies!

00:00:51.167 --> 00:00:53.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m sure the angels
are going to be excited too

00:00:53.737 --> 00:00:57.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it’ll give them opportunities
to help us with our ministry.

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:01.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray for Jehovah’s
rich blessing on our efforts

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:05.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer Bible studies
to as many people as possible.

00:01:06.516 --> 00:01:09.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been so refreshing
—hasn’t it?—

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:13.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
to resume more and more
of our theocratic activities in person.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re grateful
for the good direction Jehovah is providing.

00:01:17.827 --> 00:01:22.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
It strengthens our faith in him
and our confidence in his organization.

00:01:22.832 --> 00:01:25.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a contrast with the world!

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
People today are suffering
from a crisis of confidence.

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:33.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have doubts
about whether the people they look up to

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
—politicians, scientists, businessmen—

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:39.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
really have their best interests at heart.

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:42.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wonder, ‘Do they really care about me,

00:01:42.685 --> 00:01:45.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
or are they just out for themselves?’

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:48.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the clergy of Christendom?

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many have lost respect for them too.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:55.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s not surprising that they’re skeptical
about the book the clergy claim to represent

00:01:55.698 --> 00:01:57.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the Bible.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we help people to have the same
confidence in God’s Word that we have?

00:02:03.973 --> 00:02:07.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider three reasons
why we can trust the Bible:

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:10.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
the accuracy of the text,

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fulfillment of Bible prophecy,

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:16.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible’s power to change lives.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the accuracy of the text.

00:02:21.958 --> 00:02:26.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible writing was completed
almost 2,000 years ago.

00:02:26.262 --> 00:02:28.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as far as we know,

00:02:28.264 --> 00:02:31.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
not one of the original manuscripts
has survived to our day,

00:02:31.668 --> 00:02:35.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
so all we have are copies of copies.

00:02:35.438 --> 00:02:40.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Understandably, some wonder
if with all that copying and recopying,

00:02:40.443 --> 00:02:43.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible’s message has been changed.

00:02:43.112 --> 00:02:45.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the Babylonian exile,

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:48.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
a group of professionals intensified efforts

00:02:48.051 --> 00:02:50.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make copies of the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they took their work seriously.

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:56.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later copyists were <i>very </i> conscientious.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
They began to count not only the words

00:02:58.862 --> 00:03:00.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
but even the letters they copied

00:03:00.864 --> 00:03:03.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that no changes were made.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even so, because of human imperfection,

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:11.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
some small errors crept into the Bible text.

00:03:11.975 --> 00:03:15.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Modern scholars have a reliable way
of identifying those errors.

00:03:15.645 --> 00:03:17.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s illustrate.

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:24.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose 100 men are assigned
to copy a page of text

00:03:24.087 --> 00:03:28.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one of the men
makes a slight error in his copy.

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:30.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one way we could find that error

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by comparing his copy with the 99 others.

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, by comparing
a number of Bible manuscripts,

00:03:37.934 --> 00:03:40.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
scholars are able to identify errors

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:43.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
or omissions that one copyist made,

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and these can be corrected.

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:50.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we can have confidence
that our modern Bibles

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:54.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
accurately reflect God’s message to mankind.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:04:00.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just how diligent
were those men in copying Bible manuscripts?

00:04:00.256 --> 00:04:03.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
The oldest complete manuscript
of the Hebrew Scriptures

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:08.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
dates back to 1008 or 1009
of our Common Era.

00:04:08.031 --> 00:04:11.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s called the Leningrad Codex.

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent times,

00:04:13.202 --> 00:04:16.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
a number of Bible manuscripts
and fragments have been discovered

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are about 1,000 years older
than the Leningrad Codex.

00:04:21.144 --> 00:04:23.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might think that after those manuscripts

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:27.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
were copied and recopied
over a period of 1,000 years,

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:31.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’d be a big difference
between the text of the Leningrad Codex

00:04:31.321 --> 00:04:33.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the older manuscripts.

00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:35.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not the case.

00:04:35.358 --> 00:04:39.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Scholars have carefully compared
the earlier manuscripts with the later ones

00:04:39.963 --> 00:04:43.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have found
that God’s message to mankind

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been accurately preserved.

00:04:47.437 --> 00:04:51.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
The early Christians diligently made copies
of the Greek Scriptures,

00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:55.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
which they used
at congregation meetings and in the ministry.

00:04:55.745 --> 00:04:59.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Scholars who have compared
copies of those manuscripts

00:04:59.082 --> 00:05:02.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
have concluded
that our Bibles carry the message

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:05.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the original writers wrote down.

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:09.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt it was Jehovah

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:13.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made sure that his message to mankind
was accurately preserved.

00:05:13.696 --> 00:05:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re reminded
of the words found at Isaiah 40:8:

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The word of our God endures forever.”

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, some may argue

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:29.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
that just because the Bible
has been preserved

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t prove that it was inspired by God.

00:05:32.048 --> 00:05:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fair point.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s consider evidence
of the Bible’s inspiration.

00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible contains many prophecies
that have already been fulfilled.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:46.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel’s prophecy
regarding the Anglo-American World Power

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:48.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just one example.

00:05:48.164 --> 00:05:52.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the prophecy
as found at Daniel chapter 2, 

00:05:52.201 --> 00:05:55.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 41 to 43,

00:05:55.405 --> 00:05:58.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can follow the text
on-screen if you wish

00:05:58.307 --> 00:06:01.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Daniel 2:41-43. 

00:06:02.545 --> 00:06:04.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“</i>And just as you saw the feet

00:06:04.447 --> 00:06:08.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the toes to be partly of clay
of a potter and partly of iron,

00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:10.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the kingdom will be divided,

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:13.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but some of the hardness
of iron will be in it,

00:06:13.523 --> 00:06:16.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you saw
the iron mixed with soft clay.

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:20.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And as the toes of the feet
were partly of iron and partly of clay,

00:06:20.463 --> 00:06:23.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so the kingdom
will be partly strong

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:26.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and partly fragile.

00:06:26.302 --> 00:06:29.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as you saw iron mixed with soft clay,

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:31.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they will be mixed with the people;

00:06:31.707 --> 00:06:36.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they will not stick together,
one to the other,

00:06:36.345 --> 00:06:40.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as iron does not mix with clay.”

00:06:42.218 --> 00:06:44.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the prophecy,

00:06:44.253 --> 00:06:49.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Britain and America
would be partly strong and partly weak.

00:06:49.158 --> 00:06:51.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
They showed their strength
when they played a role

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
in winning World War I and World War II.

00:06:53.963 --> 00:06:55.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
But their power has been weakened,

00:06:55.965 --> 00:06:59.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
not so much by their enemies
as by their citizens!

00:06:59.769 --> 00:07:02.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
The citizens insist on their rights

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:04.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
through labor unions, civil rights campaigns,

00:07:04.974 --> 00:07:07.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
and independence movements.

00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:10.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
One expert in world politics
recently observed:

00:07:10.713 --> 00:07:15.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no advanced
industrial democracy in the world

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:20.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
“more politically divided,
or politically dysfunctional,

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
than the United States today.”

00:07:23.826 --> 00:07:27.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the other part
of the dual world power, Britain?

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s been especially divided over the ties
it should maintain with the European Union.

00:07:31.968 --> 00:07:34.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s been almost impossible

00:07:34.837 --> 00:07:38.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the Anglo-American World Power
to act decisively.

00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:44.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing this prophecy and so many others
being fulfilled strengthens our faith

00:07:44.614 --> 00:07:48.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will keep all of his promises.

00:07:48.317 --> 00:07:50.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does the song say?

00:07:50.586 --> 00:07:53.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What he foretells comes to be.”

00:07:54.857 --> 00:07:57.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a third reason
why we can trust the Bible,

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:00.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s see how following the Bible’s advice

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:02.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
affected a violent criminal we’ll call Jack.

00:08:02.932 --> 00:08:04.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jack was in prison

00:08:04.967 --> 00:08:08.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
waiting for the death sentence
to be carried out.

00:08:08.171 --> 00:08:13.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had the reputation of being one
of the most dangerous inmates on death row.

00:08:13.843 --> 00:08:17.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, Jack sat in on a Bible study,

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:19.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was impressed by the love

00:08:19.815 --> 00:08:23.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the kindness of the brothers
who were conducting the study,

00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:25.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he asked for his own study.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:27.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he applied what he was learning,

00:08:27.957 --> 00:08:31.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
his conduct and personality began to change.

00:08:31.827 --> 00:08:34.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, he got baptized.

00:08:34.997 --> 00:08:40.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his time in prison, he helped at least
four of the inmates to learn the truth.

00:08:41.204 --> 00:08:43.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the day of his execution arrived,

00:08:43.673 --> 00:08:45.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of his lawyers said:

00:08:45.675 --> 00:08:50.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jack is not the same person
I knew 20 years ago.

00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:54.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
The teachings of Jehovah’s Witnesses
have changed his life.”

00:08:54.817 --> 00:08:58.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know
that it’s the Bible that changes lives.

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:02.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jean is another person

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:06.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose life was radically changed
by Bible principles.

00:09:06.362 --> 00:09:08.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
He grew up in an African country.

00:09:08.731 --> 00:09:10.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
When civil war broke out,

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:13.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
he joined the army
but later fled to a neighboring country

00:09:13.736 --> 00:09:16.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he came in contact with the Witnesses.

00:09:16.739 --> 00:09:20.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “I learned
that followers of the true religion

00:09:20.376 --> 00:09:23.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“don’t get involved in politics
and are not divided.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:26.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, they love one another.”

00:09:26.649 --> 00:09:31.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jean says: “I had dedicated my life
to defending a country.

00:09:31.153 --> 00:09:33.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But when I learned Bible truth,

00:09:33.289 --> 00:09:37.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was moved to dedicate my life to Jehovah.”

00:09:37.493 --> 00:09:41.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jean changed completely.

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of fighting against people
of a different background,

00:09:44.267 --> 00:09:48.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
now he shares the Bible’s message
with everyone he meets.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact that the Bible’s advice
works so well

00:09:50.873 --> 00:09:53.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
for people
from so many different backgrounds

00:09:53.409 --> 00:09:58.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
is powerful proof
that we can trust God’s Word.

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:04.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’ve considered
three simple lines of evidence

00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:06.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can point to
in order to convince people

00:10:06.188 --> 00:10:08.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they can have confidence in God’s Word.

00:10:08.924 --> 00:10:11.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember what they were?

00:10:11.494 --> 00:10:15.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible’s message
has been accurately preserved,

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:19.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
ancient Bible prophecies
are being fulfilled today,

00:10:19.402 --> 00:10:22.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible changes lives.

00:10:24.273 --> 00:10:27.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this world goes from bad to worse,

00:10:27.176 --> 00:10:30.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
our confidence in the truth
will be put to the test.

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
People may try to sow doubts in our mind

00:10:33.249 --> 00:10:36.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
—doubts about the truthfulness of the Bible,
for example.

00:10:36.952 --> 00:10:40.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are convinced
that God’s Word is always true,

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be able to resist
such attacks on our faith.

00:10:45.795 --> 00:10:48.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible truth stabilizes us,

00:10:48.597 --> 00:10:52.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
it gives us a definite purpose
and clear direction in our lives,

00:10:52.635 --> 00:10:57.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it provides us
with a wonderful hope for the future.

00:10:59.342 --> 00:11:01.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
The writer of Psalm 119

00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:05.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
was absolutely convinced
that God’s Word is a reliable guide.

00:11:05.881 --> 00:11:08.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we don’t know who that writer was,

00:11:08.017 --> 00:11:10.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we do know
that he cherished God’s Word.

00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:15.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
To remind us
of how important Bible truth is to us,

00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:19.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body has chosen
as our yeartext for 2023

00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:23.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
words from the 119th Psalm.

00:11:23.366 --> 00:11:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:27.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here it is,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
the yeartext for 2023:

00:11:30.506 --> 00:11:35.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The very essence of your word is truth.”

00:11:35.511 --> 00:11:40.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The very essence of your word is truth.”

00:11:40.516 --> 00:11:44.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 119:160.

00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:47.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
With these thoughts in mind,

00:11:47.356 --> 00:11:51.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
how wonderful it will be
to share in our worldwide campaign

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:56.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help honesthearted people to study
the precious truths found in God’s Word!

00:11:56.165 --> 00:12:00.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah bless us all
as we share in the campaign!

00:12:01.437 --> 00:12:04.240 line:90% position:50% align:center

of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
