WEBVTT

00:01.183 --> 00:04.086
Welcome to the program!


00:04.087 --> 00:08.425
Our theme this month is 
“Organized to Do God’s Will.” 


00:08.425 --> 00:10.427
Among other things, 


00:10.427 --> 00:12.329
we will look at how our young brothers 


00:12.328 --> 00:14.396
can be encouraged to reach out 


00:14.397 --> 00:17.000
so as to take the lead in the congregation. 


00:18.133 --> 00:22.505
You will also enjoy this report 
on the blessings around the world 


00:22.505 --> 00:24.940
from using carts in our ministry, 


00:24.940 --> 00:27.977
and we’ll find out how 
the organization makes sure 


00:27.977 --> 00:32.315
our meeting places are properly utilized. 


00:32.315 --> 00:37.000
This is the July program 
of JW Broadcasting!


00:54.370 --> 00:56.538
There are people who believe 


00:56.538 --> 00:59.641
there is no need 
for a religious organization. 


00:59.642 --> 01:03.179
They feel they have 
their own personal relationship with God 


01:03.178 --> 01:05.315
and that is good enough. 


01:05.315 --> 01:10.320
They see no need to be associated 
with a specific organization. 


01:10.320 --> 01:14.557
However, what does 
God’s own inspired Word suggest? 


01:14.557 --> 01:18.094
That he would use an organization, 
or channel, 


01:18.093 --> 01:20.730
through which spiritual food 
would be dispensed 


01:20.730 --> 01:23.967
from his Word, the Bible. 


01:23.967 --> 01:27.704
For example, 
1 Peter 2:17 says 


01:27.703 --> 01:31.706
to “have love 
for the whole association of brothers.” 


01:31.707 --> 01:34.810
One dictionary definition for “association” 


01:34.810 --> 01:40.617
is “an organization of persons 
having a common interest.”


01:40.617 --> 01:43.720
We have a very interesting, insightful look 


01:43.720 --> 01:46.722
at the organization in the first century. 


01:46.722 --> 01:51.660
If we glance down through chapter 15 
of the book of Acts, 


01:51.660 --> 01:53.897
we can gain some insight. 


01:53.897 --> 01:58.067
Verse 1 indicates there was 
an issue that caused a disagreement 


01:58.067 --> 02:00.937
between some of the members 
of the congregation. 


02:00.937 --> 02:03.005
Then verse 2 says: 


02:03.005 --> 02:07.010
“But after quite a bit 
of dissension and disputing 


02:07.010 --> 02:09.445
“by Paul and Barnabas with them, 


02:09.445 --> 02:12.482
“it was arranged for Paul, 
Barnabas, and some of the others 


02:12.482 --> 02:16.652
“to go up to the apostles 
and elders in Jerusalem 


02:16.652 --> 02:19.289
regarding this issue.” 


02:19.288 --> 02:22.158
It sounds like an organization to me. 


02:22.158 --> 02:24.693
And after considerable discussion 


02:24.693 --> 02:27.830
and with the help of God’s holy spirit, 


02:27.830 --> 02:29.832
what transpired? 


02:29.832 --> 02:34.037
Verses 22 and 23 say: 


02:34.037 --> 02:38.675
“Then the apostles and the elders, 
together with the whole congregation, 


02:38.675 --> 02:41.878
“decided to send chosen men 
from among them to Antioch, 


02:41.878 --> 02:43.613
“along with Paul and Barnabas; 


02:43.613 --> 02:47.316
“they sent Judas 
who was called Barsabbas and Silas, 


02:47.317 --> 02:49.719
“who were leading men 
among the brothers. 


02:49.718 --> 02:52.888
They wrote this 
and sent it through them.” 


02:52.888 --> 02:56.158
Then in verses 23-29 


02:56.158 --> 02:59.161
is the letter of direction 
that was delivered to Antioch 


02:59.162 --> 03:01.464
and other congregations as well. 


03:01.463 --> 03:05.133
In fact, in verse 41, 
it says Paul and Silas 


03:05.133 --> 03:09.638
“went through Syria and Cilicia, 
strengthening the congregations.” 


03:09.638 --> 03:12.508
Chapter 16, verse 5 says: 


03:12.508 --> 03:16.645
“Then, indeed, the congregations 
continued to be made firm in the faith 


03:16.645 --> 03:20.417
and to increase in number day by day.” 


03:20.417 --> 03:25.087
So it was not a matter 
of isolated Christians sitting at home 


03:25.087 --> 03:28.357
claiming to have 
a personal relationship with God. 


03:28.357 --> 03:31.460
No, the work was organized, 


03:31.460 --> 03:36.065
and congregations 
kept being added “day by day.”


03:36.065 --> 03:40.403
That is very similar to what we see 
in Jehovah’s organization today. 


03:40.403 --> 03:44.273
In fact, the organization 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses is patterned 


03:44.273 --> 03:47.576
after the first-century 
Christian congregation 


03:47.577 --> 03:50.480
as set forth in the Scriptures. 


03:50.480 --> 03:53.348
I would like to remind 
all of Jehovah’s Witnesses


03:53.348 --> 03:56.920
—whether already baptized 
or working toward baptism—


03:56.920 --> 04:01.958
of this book, 
Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will. 


04:01.958 --> 04:04.193
It provides an overall view 


04:04.193 --> 04:06.828
of how the Christian congregation 
is organized 


04:06.828 --> 04:09.065
for getting God’s work done. 


04:09.065 --> 04:12.602
The book also offers counsel and direction 


04:12.602 --> 04:16.000
to help us maintain unity 
with our brothers worldwide. 


04:17.207 --> 04:19.209
New ones need to become familiar 


04:19.208 --> 04:21.310
with the operation 
of Jehovah’s organization 


04:21.310 --> 04:23.545
and learn how they can have a share 


04:23.545 --> 04:25.548
in the modern-day preaching work. 


04:25.548 --> 04:29.385
In fact, 
when a Bible student progresses 


04:29.385 --> 04:31.587
and desires to join us in the ministry 


04:31.587 --> 04:33.724
as an unbaptized publisher, 


04:33.723 --> 04:37.093
the elders direct him 
to make a study of this book, 


04:37.093 --> 04:41.130
including the “Questions for Those 
Desiring to Get Baptized” 


04:41.130 --> 04:43.232
in the appendix. 


04:43.232 --> 04:47.470
Even for those of us 
who have been baptized many years, 


04:47.470 --> 04:49.605
it may be good to schedule the reading 


04:49.605 --> 04:51.873
of one chapter of the book each week 


04:51.873 --> 04:55.845
during our personal study 
or family worship. 


04:55.845 --> 04:58.080
It contains general information 


04:58.080 --> 05:01.517
concerning the duties 
of elders and ministerial servants, 


05:01.517 --> 05:03.519
judicial procedures, 


05:03.518 --> 05:07.923
and various other features 
of congregation organization.


05:07.923 --> 05:12.328
I would like to take a few minutes 
and review some of the information 


05:12.328 --> 05:15.965
in chapter 1 of the publication. 


05:15.965 --> 05:18.267
Though there are thousands of national 


05:18.267 --> 05:20.770
and international organizations 
around the world, 


05:20.770 --> 05:22.772
they are organized 


05:22.772 --> 05:25.975
according to human viewpoints 
and philosophies. 


05:25.975 --> 05:28.978
But our organization is different; 


05:28.978 --> 05:31.746
it is theocratic. 


05:31.747 --> 05:36.619
That means it is ruled by Jehovah 
as Head over all. 


05:36.618 --> 05:41.356
Isaiah 33:22 says that he is our Judge, 


05:41.357 --> 05:44.394
Lawgiver, and King. 


05:44.393 --> 05:46.828
Many large organizations appoint 


05:46.828 --> 05:50.500
a chief executive officer, or CEO. 


05:50.500 --> 05:54.437
He is the executive 
with the chief decision-making authority 


05:54.437 --> 05:57.174
in a business or corporation. 


05:57.173 --> 06:01.243
In a similar way, 
Jehovah has appointed his Son, Jesus, 


06:01.243 --> 06:04.946
to be the one 
with chief decision-making authority 


06:04.947 --> 06:07.950
over the congregation of God. 


06:07.950 --> 06:11.953
Ephesians 1:22 


06:11.953 --> 06:15.725
is speaking of Jehovah’s actions 
in connection with Jesus. 


06:15.725 --> 06:17.727
It says: 


06:17.727 --> 06:21.330
“He also subjected all things under his feet 


06:21.330 --> 06:24.133
“and made him head over all things 


06:24.133 --> 06:27.803
with regard to the congregation.” 


06:27.803 --> 06:31.440
We see the structure 
of the organization taking shape. 


06:31.440 --> 06:35.010
Jehovah is the Universal Sovereign, 
the King, 


06:35.010 --> 06:37.413
directing the millions of angels 


06:37.413 --> 06:40.015
making up his heavenly organization. 


06:40.015 --> 06:42.017
But when it comes to directing 


06:42.017 --> 06:45.589
the visible earthly part 
of God’s organization, 


06:45.588 --> 06:48.825
he has delegated 
that responsibility to Jesus, 


06:48.825 --> 06:51.560
the head of the congregation of God. 


06:51.560 --> 06:54.497
Chapter 2 of the Organized book 


06:54.497 --> 06:58.500
explains this Scriptural position of Jesus.


06:58.500 --> 07:02.438
And how does Jesus direct 
the organization here on earth? 


07:02.438 --> 07:06.608
Matthew 24:45 says 
that Jesus has appointed 


07:06.608 --> 07:09.245
a “faithful and discreet slave” 


07:09.245 --> 07:13.048
to serve 
spiritual “food at the proper time.” 


07:13.048 --> 07:14.650
Today, 


07:14.650 --> 07:16.918
seven anointed men 
make up the faithful slave, 


07:16.918 --> 07:20.590
and collectively, 
they are known as the Governing Body. 


07:20.590 --> 07:24.027
And Jesus uses the holy spirit 
to direct these men 


07:24.027 --> 07:27.564
in harmony with the Scriptures. 


07:27.563 --> 07:29.898
The Scriptural basis 
for this layer of organization 


07:29.898 --> 07:33.568
is set forth in chapter 3 of the book. 


07:33.568 --> 07:35.605
Chapter 4 is entitled 


07:35.605 --> 07:39.108
“How the Congregation 
Is Organized and Governed.” 


07:39.108 --> 07:43.278
The organizational structure 
incorporates Branch Committees, 


07:43.278 --> 07:48.050
circuit overseers, elders, 
and ministerial servants. 


07:48.050 --> 07:50.452
The subject index in the back of the book 


07:50.452 --> 07:54.557
can be useful 
to quickly gain access to information 


07:54.557 --> 07:58.060
on various aspects of the organization.


07:58.060 --> 08:00.497
Suppose you’re a young person, 


08:00.497 --> 08:03.765
maybe even 
a relatively young married couple. 


08:03.765 --> 08:05.902
The circuit overseer is visiting, 


08:05.902 --> 08:08.770
and he asks you 
what spiritual goals you have. 


08:08.770 --> 08:10.773
How would you answer? 


08:10.773 --> 08:12.775
Would your mind start racing, 


08:12.775 --> 08:17.813
trying to think 
of various avenues of service available? 


08:17.813 --> 08:22.651
How about now, 
before you are asked such a question, 


08:22.652 --> 08:26.822
you look in the subject index 
under “Goals”? 


08:26.822 --> 08:31.827
There are 11 references 
to paragraphs in the book on that subject. 


08:31.827 --> 08:34.030
After reading about all 


08:34.030 --> 08:36.532
of the possibilities 
and different categories, 


08:36.532 --> 08:39.635
you would be 
in a better position to plan your life 


08:39.635 --> 08:41.637
for a great future 


08:41.637 --> 08:45.000
in the earthly part 
of Jehovah’s organization.


08:46.042 --> 08:48.044
At this time, 


08:48.043 --> 08:51.846
I would like to draw your attention 
to a very important factor 


08:51.847 --> 08:54.217
in a new one’s making progress 


08:54.217 --> 08:57.354
and attaining spiritual stability. 


08:57.353 --> 09:02.023
On page 213 of the Organized book, 


09:02.023 --> 09:06.561
it discusses a person 
interested in being baptized. 


09:06.562 --> 09:09.799
After the elders go over the questions 
in part 3 of the book, 


09:09.798 --> 09:11.800
it says this: 


09:11.800 --> 09:16.538
“If he has not completed his study 
of the Bible Teach and ‘God’s Love’ books, 


09:16.538 --> 09:21.000
the elders should make arrangements 
for someone to help him do so.” 


09:22.878 --> 09:27.616
The two books 
complement each other so well. 


09:27.617 --> 09:31.954
When someone becomes a dedicated 
and baptized servant of Jehovah, 


09:31.953 --> 09:36.058
we want them to stay 
closely attached to the organization. 


09:36.058 --> 09:38.060
Yet every year, 


09:38.060 --> 09:40.697
there are a number 
who stop attending meetings 


09:40.697 --> 09:42.699
and become inactive. 


09:42.698 --> 09:44.700
At times, 
it has been found 


09:44.700 --> 09:48.303
that they did not finish 
studying the two books.


09:48.303 --> 09:49.638
You see, 


09:49.638 --> 09:51.973
the Bible Teach book helps new ones 


09:51.973 --> 09:54.543
to have an accurate knowledge of the Bible, 


09:54.543 --> 09:57.813
and they often learn to love Jehovah. 


09:57.813 --> 09:59.848
The “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love” book 


09:59.848 --> 10:02.785
helps us to learn to apply the Bible 


10:02.785 --> 10:05.855
and live in harmony 
with Jehovah’s standards. 


10:05.855 --> 10:09.858
Notice what Jesus told his faithful apostles 


10:09.858 --> 10:15.931
at John 15:10: 


10:15.932 --> 10:19.802
“If you observe my commandments, 
you will remain in my love, 


10:19.802 --> 10:22.905
“just as I have observed 
the commandments of the Father 


10:22.905 --> 10:25.000
and remain in his love.” 


10:26.575 --> 10:29.612
Did you notice 
that Jesus remained in God’s love 


10:29.612 --> 10:32.682
by observing his Father’s commandments? 


10:32.682 --> 10:35.250
The same is true of us today. 


10:35.250 --> 10:37.620
To remain in God’s love, 


10:37.620 --> 10:41.190
we need to apply the truth 
in our everyday life. 


10:41.190 --> 10:45.393
And what is the result 
if we keep ourselves in God’s love? 


10:45.393 --> 10:48.063
It is so clearly stated 


10:48.063 --> 10:51.600
in Jude 21: 


10:51.600 --> 10:55.103
“In order to keep yourselves in God’s love, 


10:55.103 --> 10:58.373
“while you await the mercy 
of our Lord Jesus Christ 


10:58.373 --> 11:01.000
with everlasting life in view.” 


11:02.143 --> 11:07.148
Staying in God’s love 
results in everlasting life.


11:07.148 --> 11:10.451
It is so important 
to make sure our Bible students 


11:10.452 --> 11:13.855
complete a study of both books, 


11:13.855 --> 11:16.358
and that applies to our children too. 


11:16.358 --> 11:18.460
Sometimes as parents, 


11:18.460 --> 11:20.730
we can assume 
that our children are developing 


11:20.730 --> 11:23.365
a trusting relationship with Jehovah 


11:23.365 --> 11:27.202
because they have been going 
to meetings since they were very small. 


11:27.202 --> 11:32.207
A relationship with Jehovah 
does not happen by means of osmosis. 


11:32.207 --> 11:36.312
A child does not simply absorb 
and assimilate truth 


11:36.312 --> 11:38.314
and a love for God 


11:38.313 --> 11:40.548
just by being in the presence of others 


11:40.548 --> 11:44.320
who have a close relationship with Jehovah. 


11:44.320 --> 11:48.190
We very much appreciate 
all of the videos we have, 


11:48.190 --> 11:52.127
including Become Jehovah’s Friend 
and JW Broadcasting. 


11:52.127 --> 11:55.697
But new ones and young ones 


11:55.697 --> 12:00.069
need to be able to go 
through the process of deep study 


12:00.068 --> 12:02.170
to get to the Bible’s truth 


12:02.170 --> 12:04.173
and get it etched into their minds 


12:04.173 --> 12:06.941
and lodged deep in their hearts. 


12:06.942 --> 12:08.944
Therefore, 


12:08.943 --> 12:11.746
if you parents realize 
that you have not studied 


12:11.747 --> 12:14.117
both books with your young ones, 


12:14.117 --> 12:19.155
it would be good to see 
that a schedule is established to do so.


12:19.155 --> 12:22.157
The Governing Body gives all credit 


12:22.157 --> 12:25.494
for the success 
of this organization to Jehovah 


12:25.493 --> 12:29.498
and the appointed head 
of the congregation, Jesus Christ. 


12:29.498 --> 12:32.133
We are just imperfect men trying to follow 


12:32.133 --> 12:34.803
the lead of Christ and the holy spirit. 


12:34.803 --> 12:39.808
At 1 Corinthians 1:26, 


12:39.808 --> 12:41.943
Paul says:


12:41.943 --> 12:44.213
“For you see his calling of you, brothers,


12:44.213 --> 12:47.750
that there are not many wise 
in a fleshly way.”


12:47.750 --> 12:49.752
Verse 27 says: 


12:49.752 --> 12:52.822
“But God chose 
the foolish things of the world 


12:52.822 --> 12:54.957
to put the wise men to shame.” 


12:54.957 --> 12:58.294
Then verse 30 says that Christ Jesus 


12:58.293 --> 13:02.798
“has become to us wisdom from God.” 


13:02.798 --> 13:05.566
That is where the direction and wisdom 


13:05.567 --> 13:07.670
of the organization come from, 


13:07.670 --> 13:10.907
not from mere man. 


13:10.907 --> 13:14.844
The words of Jehovah 
to the prophet Zechariah fit today 


13:14.843 --> 13:18.646
when we see 
the amazing advances in the organization. 


13:18.647 --> 13:20.715
Zechariah 4:6 says: 


13:20.715 --> 13:23.785
“‘Not by a military force, nor by power, 


13:23.785 --> 13:28.000
but by my spirit,’ says Jehovah of armies.”


13:29.192 --> 13:32.194
While there are 
some well-educated and prominent men 


13:32.193 --> 13:36.198
who have accepted the truth 
and are now our fellow brothers, 


13:36.198 --> 13:40.635
the majority in the organization 
come from a more humble background. 


13:40.635 --> 13:42.638
For example, 


13:42.638 --> 13:45.073
among the first 
of Jehovah’s modern-day servants 


13:45.073 --> 13:48.110
to introduce the Kingdom message 
to people in Denmark 


13:48.110 --> 13:50.112
was a shoemaker. 


13:50.112 --> 13:53.349
In Switzerland and France, 
it was a gardener. 


13:53.348 --> 13:55.350
In many parts of Africa, 


13:55.350 --> 13:58.220
the message was carried 
by itinerant workers. 


13:58.220 --> 14:01.457
In Brazil, sailors had a share. 


14:01.457 --> 14:05.127
Quite a few of the Polish Witnesses 
in northern France 


14:05.127 --> 14:07.395
were coal miners. 


14:07.395 --> 14:10.365
Jehovah and Jesus use all of us 


14:10.365 --> 14:13.235
to get a remarkable work accomplished. 


14:13.235 --> 14:17.773
We are proud to be a part 
of this spirit-directed organization. 


14:17.773 --> 14:20.876
As one older circuit overseer 
was heard to say, 


14:20.877 --> 14:25.882
“This is the best imperfect organization 
on earth!” 


14:25.882 --> 14:29.619
There are no perfect organizations on earth. 


14:29.618 --> 14:33.488
However, this is the best of them all. 


14:33.488 --> 14:36.925
And we appreciate 
the contribution all of you make 


14:36.925 --> 14:41.000
to the success 
of the preaching work worldwide.


14:42.163 --> 14:44.633
With that contribution in mind, 


14:44.633 --> 14:48.403
consider for a moment 
the huge load elders carry 


14:48.403 --> 14:50.305
in caring for our congregations. 


14:50.305 --> 14:52.975
Some of them are now advanced in age. 


14:52.975 --> 14:55.577
So how can young brothers be trained 


14:55.577 --> 14:58.614
to qualify for increased responsibilities? 


14:58.613 --> 15:00.848
In this dramatization, 


15:00.848 --> 15:03.718
a congregation faces a change 
on its elder body 


15:03.718 --> 15:07.000
that brought that question to the fore.


15:16.765 --> 15:19.000
We’re very happy for Daniel. 


15:20.502 --> 15:24.000
He’s going to be a blessing 
in his new assignment. 


15:28.977 --> 15:31.980
But we are going to miss him 


15:31.980 --> 15:34.983
and everything he was doing 
for the congregation. 


15:34.983 --> 15:37.000
This will change things for us.


15:46.462 --> 15:48.864
We really want to be there 


15:48.863 --> 15:51.000
for our brothers and sisters.


16:20.195 --> 16:22.212
And it’s true: 


16:22.212 --> 16:26.102
Having plenty to do 
in the Lord’s work is good. 


16:26.102 --> 16:30.000
But where will we get more help?


16:36.045 --> 16:39.047
We do have good ministerial servants 


16:39.047 --> 16:42.000
like Richie. 


16:46.755 --> 16:51.527
But after Daniel left, 
our elder body is one fewer now. 


16:51.527 --> 16:54.262
That prompted a good question: 


16:54.262 --> 16:59.000
Are we doing all we can 
to train our brothers?


17:05.373 --> 17:07.710
Richie, do you have some time for me? 


17:07.710 --> 17:09.778
I have some calls you can help me with.


17:09.778 --> 17:12.000
Sure, I’d like that.


17:17.920 --> 17:20.155
I realized it had been 
a while since we talked 


17:20.155 --> 17:22.157
about him qualifying to do more. 


17:22.157 --> 17:24.994
He explained that he wanted to help 


17:24.993 --> 17:27.061
but didn’t want to appear presumptuous. 


17:27.062 --> 17:29.064
He’d been praying about it, 


17:29.063 --> 17:32.901
and he wanted to know what else 
he could do to keep reaching out.


17:32.902 --> 17:36.000
Talking to Richie 
made me think of Jesus’ example. 


17:38.007 --> 17:42.644
His disciples offered themselves willingly, 
and he trained them. 


17:42.643 --> 17:45.746
They were eager but needed his direction. 


17:45.747 --> 17:49.000
Jesus’ training gave them confidence 
to do the assignments he gave them. 


17:52.653 --> 17:54.990
They were happy, 


17:54.990 --> 17:56.992
not just to follow Jesus, 


17:56.992 --> 17:59.829
but to work alongside him. 


17:59.828 --> 18:03.465
And Jesus was happy to share his work.


18:03.465 --> 18:05.833
Up to his final evening with them, 


18:05.833 --> 18:07.936
he prepared them for the work ahead. 


18:07.937 --> 18:10.872
“Most truly I say to you, 


18:10.872 --> 18:15.377
“whoever exercises faith in me 
will also do the works that I do; 


18:15.377 --> 18:17.479
“and he will do works greater than these, 


18:17.478 --> 18:21.000
because I am going my way to the Father.”


18:23.385 --> 18:28.000
I now remember how much training 
I had received from the brothers.


18:35.497 --> 18:38.700
It was easy to forget 
that I didn’t always get 


18:38.700 --> 18:42.000
things right at first. 


18:48.710 --> 18:52.000
Soon, 
Richie was taking on more responsibility. 


18:53.482 --> 18:57.000
And he told me something 
that I too once felt. 


18:58.153 --> 19:01.390
He just didn’t realize how much work 


19:01.390 --> 19:04.000
went into caring for Jehovah’s sheep. 


19:05.727 --> 19:10.000
But once he knew, 
he was glad he offered himself willingly.


19:20.942 --> 19:25.147
We commend all our hard-working elders 
for their fine work 


19:25.147 --> 19:27.950
and also those of you who support them, 


19:27.950 --> 19:32.153
whether you are a ministerial servant 
or perhaps the wife of an elder. 


19:32.153 --> 19:34.221
Without your help and support, 


19:34.222 --> 19:37.025
it would be very difficult 
for our dear elders


19:37.025 --> 19:40.162
to carry out their weighty responsibilities.


19:40.162 --> 19:44.032
While there is a lot of work 
to be done on a local level, 


19:44.032 --> 19:47.269
there is an unprecedented global effort 


19:47.268 --> 19:50.538
to provide spiritual food 
to all of God’s people. 


19:50.538 --> 19:52.540
Under the direction 
of the Teaching Committee 


19:52.540 --> 19:54.543
of the Governing Body, 


19:54.543 --> 19:57.880
the Audio/Video Services Department, 
or AVS, 


19:57.880 --> 20:02.650
takes the lead in producing 
audio and video publications.


20:02.650 --> 20:05.053
It’s been said that if a picture 


20:05.053 --> 20:07.221
is worth a thousand words, 


20:07.222 --> 20:10.225
then a video is worth a million! 


20:10.225 --> 20:13.295
Videos stir our emotions, don’t they? 


20:13.295 --> 20:16.398
And they can be 
very powerful teaching tools. 


20:16.398 --> 20:19.100
Brother Russell recognized this fact. 


20:19.100 --> 20:22.703
Back in 1914, 
the small group of Bible Students 


20:22.703 --> 20:25.640
presented the “Photo-Drama of Creation” 


20:25.640 --> 20:29.645
to over nine million people worldwide, 


20:29.645 --> 20:32.047
and the response was overwhelming. 


20:32.047 --> 20:35.384
It was clear that Jehovah 
blessed their efforts 


20:35.383 --> 20:40.388
at spreading the Bible’s message 
in a visual way. 


20:40.388 --> 20:43.225
Well, over a hundred years later, 


20:43.225 --> 20:46.728
“the faithful and discreet slave” 
is producing videos.


20:46.728 --> 20:49.096
And for many years, basically, 


20:49.097 --> 20:52.700
one large public-release video 


20:52.700 --> 20:56.305
was being released, 
or produced, each year. 


20:56.305 --> 20:59.440
For example, back in 2011, 


20:59.440 --> 21:03.512
the video Faith in Action, Part 2 
was released. 


21:03.512 --> 21:07.984
And it required a tremendous effort 
to produce the video master, 


21:07.983 --> 21:10.718
the audio tracks, the graphics, 


21:10.718 --> 21:15.723
the music, the on-screen text 
for one video.


21:15.723 --> 21:19.026
However, just five years later, 


21:19.027 --> 21:21.330
the work has grown from producing 


21:21.330 --> 21:24.232
an average of one video per year 


21:24.232 --> 21:27.935
to one video per day. 


21:27.935 --> 21:32.940
This is because videos are now 
a regular part of our website, 


21:32.940 --> 21:36.678
the broadcasts, 
our ministry, the conventions, 


21:36.678 --> 21:39.346
meetings, and other special events. 


21:39.347 --> 21:41.450
In 2016, 


21:41.450 --> 21:45.387
more than 350 videos were produced. 


21:45.387 --> 21:48.090
Under the direction 
of the Teaching Committee, 


21:48.090 --> 21:51.893
Audio/Video Services (AVS) 
has been entrusted with this work.


21:51.893 --> 21:56.465
But with this rapid increase 
in the amount of videos produced, 


21:56.465 --> 21:59.300
how is all this accomplished? 


21:59.300 --> 22:01.470
Perhaps you’ve heard the expression 


22:01.470 --> 22:03.672
“it takes a village.” 


22:03.672 --> 22:07.375
In this case, 
it takes an entire globe. 


22:07.375 --> 22:10.812
Please enjoy the following video 
for a close-up look 


22:10.812 --> 22:14.000
at how audio and video work 
is accomplished worldwide.


22:24.492 --> 22:27.829
To assist with the growing workload 
in Audio/Video Services, 


22:27.828 --> 22:29.831
the Governing Body has approved 


22:29.832 --> 22:32.834
11 full-time Regional Video Teams (RVT) 


22:32.833 --> 22:34.936
in branches around the world.


22:34.937 --> 22:36.939
But it doesn’t stop there. 


22:36.938 --> 22:40.875
Bethelites, commuters, 
and remote workers in many other branches 


22:40.875 --> 22:43.978
also provide valuable assistance.


22:43.978 --> 22:46.280
How do we work with all these teams? 


22:46.280 --> 22:49.718
After receiving direction 
from the Governing Body committees 


22:49.718 --> 22:51.820
for upcoming videos, 


22:51.820 --> 22:56.000
AVS then assigns 
each video to a capable team.


22:57.992 --> 23:00.429
Once the team accepts the assignment, 


23:00.428 --> 23:03.265
we provide them 
with the necessary direction 


23:03.265 --> 23:07.035
as well as answer 
any questions they may have. 


23:07.035 --> 23:10.000
Then the team goes to work.


23:25.987 --> 23:28.157
Because of being a small group, 


23:28.157 --> 23:32.527
each team member may have to wear 
multiple hats to get the job done.


23:32.527 --> 23:36.330
From start to finish, 
they all work very hard 


23:36.330 --> 23:38.567
to deliver a completed, edited video 


23:38.567 --> 23:41.570
to us by the designated time. 


23:41.570 --> 23:45.540
Later, you may see these videos 
on JW Broadcasting, 


23:45.540 --> 23:49.000
jw.org, or other places. 


23:54.482 --> 23:58.000
Would you like to meet 
some of our RVT family?


24:02.390 --> 24:05.927
It’s a privilege. 


24:05.927 --> 24:09.000
We meet friends who have suffered 
some hardships and trials, 


24:10.932 --> 24:13.202
but because of their trust in Jehovah, 


24:13.202 --> 24:15.204
they were able to overcome them, 


24:15.203 --> 24:18.406
and we see the results of their loyalty. 


24:18.407 --> 24:21.577
I think it strengthens our determination 


24:21.577 --> 24:25.000
to also stay loyal.


24:26.482 --> 24:28.717
We are a joyful team 


24:28.717 --> 24:30.000
with a lot of humor, 


24:31.152 --> 24:32.754
and we work together very harmoniously. 


24:32.753 --> 24:35.523
You could say that we 
are like a little family. 


24:35.523 --> 24:38.926
We look forward to the next day 
when we go to work again. 


24:38.927 --> 24:41.229
It’s unbelievable how many dear brothers 


24:41.228 --> 24:44.731
and sisters we’ve gotten to know 
through these projects. 


24:44.732 --> 24:46.535
Close ties can develop, 


24:46.535 --> 24:49.670
and it is not uncommon 
that tears flow when the project is over 


24:49.670 --> 24:53.000
and it is time to say good-bye.


24:56.678 --> 24:59.113
Sometimes we would film 
on private or state property, 


24:59.113 --> 25:01.281
and I would have to approach the manager 


25:01.282 --> 25:03.485
and let them know 
what we were planning to shoot 


25:03.485 --> 25:05.487
at the location. 


25:05.487 --> 25:10.825
This wasn’t easy for me 
because I’m not very good with words. 


25:10.825 --> 25:14.795
And many people in Korea tend to have 
a biased view of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


25:14.795 --> 25:17.000
so this made it even harder for me. 


25:19.600 --> 25:21.770
So I prayed to Jehovah, 


25:21.770 --> 25:25.307
asking for his guidance and wisdom. 


25:25.307 --> 25:30.000
I was surprised to find that many 
were more than willing to help us. 


25:32.613 --> 25:35.950
These experiences help me to realize 


25:35.950 --> 25:40.000
that Jehovah always answers 
our prayers for strength and courage.


25:43.792 --> 25:46.127
You have to balance your time around work, 


25:46.127 --> 25:49.630
around being the head of a family, 


25:49.630 --> 25:51.733
being an elder, 


25:51.733 --> 25:55.003
or other responsibilities 
that you have in the congregation. 


25:55.003 --> 25:58.071
That’s when you really see Jehovah’s hand


25:58.072 --> 26:02.510
—when you see the mountain of challenge, 


26:02.510 --> 26:03.978
but you overcome it. 


26:03.978 --> 26:05.080
And you know it wasn’t you. 


26:05.080 --> 26:08.000
It was impossible for you to do it yourself. 


26:09.017 --> 26:12.920
When I put even half 
the amount of energy and effort 


26:12.920 --> 26:16.925
that I do into working for Jehovah 
into something secular, 


26:16.925 --> 26:19.393
I’m wiped out; I need a vacation. 


26:19.393 --> 26:22.863
But the more 
I put into working for Jehovah, 


26:22.863 --> 26:25.333
the more I want to work. 


26:25.333 --> 26:28.636
To know that you 
are offering your skills to Jehovah


26:28.637 --> 26:31.172
—that is a blessing. 


26:31.172 --> 26:34.342
But, really, the blessing is seeing 
your relationship with Jehovah 


26:34.342 --> 26:36.779
thrive and become stronger, 


26:36.778 --> 26:40.048
and you can see 
that he does keep his promises 


26:40.048 --> 26:45.420
and that he supports you 
more than you’re supporting him.


26:45.420 --> 26:49.190
Many of us aren’t able 
to be full-time Bethelites, 


26:49.190 --> 26:51.192
but commuting really helps us 


26:51.192 --> 26:53.595
get that small snippet of what it’s like 


26:53.595 --> 26:56.000
to be a Bethelite 
and realize what a privilege it is. 


26:57.165 --> 27:00.835
And if you’ve got a specific talent, use it. 


27:00.835 --> 27:03.572
One day in Paradise, 
someone is going to come to you 


27:03.572 --> 27:05.574
and say, 
“How did you use your talent?” 


27:05.573 --> 27:07.308
Maybe you’re a brilliant artist, 


27:07.308 --> 27:09.876
and you’re going 
to proudly turn around and say: 


27:09.877 --> 27:11.980
“You know what? 
I used it for Jehovah.” 


27:11.980 --> 27:15.583
Even if you’re young, 
you can learn skills 


27:15.583 --> 27:19.453
and you can really assist 
Jehovah’s organization 


27:19.453 --> 27:22.056
now and in the future. 


27:22.057 --> 27:26.127
And there is no better boss 
to work for than Jehovah. 


27:26.127 --> 27:29.430
My advice to young ones: Go for it!


27:29.430 --> 27:32.300
And during this past year, 


27:32.300 --> 27:36.237
we were excited to add 
a new team to our AVS family


27:36.237 --> 27:40.000
—located in Mira Loma, California. 


27:41.977 --> 27:44.779
All in this group 
have made themselves available 


27:44.778 --> 27:47.948
for video needs out there.


27:47.948 --> 27:50.251
You’re able to take a person— 


27:50.252 --> 27:52.854
You’re able to take an individual 
that has dedicated their life to Jehovah, 


27:52.853 --> 27:54.088
and maybe they 
didn’t know at the time 


27:54.088 --> 27:55.590
that they were going 
to inspire somebody else 


27:55.590 --> 27:56.590
and have somebody 


27:56.590 --> 27:58.927
somewhere across the planet say: 


27:58.927 --> 28:00.929
“Wow! That’s exactly my life too. 


28:00.928 --> 28:03.465
“I’m so glad that this person 


28:03.465 --> 28:05.967
“was selected to be on here 
because that’s my life. 


28:05.967 --> 28:09.000
And that has triggered me 
to want to do more for Jehovah.” 


28:12.307 --> 28:14.309
You know it’s Jehovah’s holy spirit; 
he’s putting together a team; 


28:14.308 --> 28:16.310
he’s the Great Producer. 


28:16.310 --> 28:18.947
And what he really wants 
is he wants people who have the talent, 


28:18.947 --> 28:20.949
but he wants people 
who have the holy spirit more 


28:20.948 --> 28:22.950
and are willing to work for it. 


28:22.950 --> 28:27.055
But he gives you the ability, 
like Oholiab and Bezalel, 


28:27.055 --> 28:30.558
to be able to put your talents 
that you’ve learned to work for him.


28:30.558 --> 28:32.560
As you can see, 


28:32.560 --> 28:36.898
we’re part of a beautiful, 
hardworking global team. 


28:36.898 --> 28:41.268
With so many hands helping the load 
in so many time zones, 


28:41.268 --> 28:46.000
we’re literally working on videos 24/7. 


28:48.175 --> 28:51.078
It’s a great privilege 
to work alongside our extended family. 


28:51.078 --> 28:53.046
We learn from each other. 


28:53.047 --> 28:55.984
Their willing spirit, humble attitude, 


28:55.983 --> 28:58.051
and contagious joy 


28:58.052 --> 29:01.000
inspire all of us here in AVS.


29:03.323 --> 29:08.195
Additionally, we receive 
incredible support right at home too. 


29:08.195 --> 29:10.665
Virtually every department at Bethel 


29:10.665 --> 29:13.502
supports the audio/video work in some way, 


29:13.502 --> 29:18.372
and we are very, very thankful. 


29:18.372 --> 29:22.944
With everyone’s help, 
the Bible’s message is being spread visually 


29:22.943 --> 29:27.000
throughout the earth 
at unprecedented levels.


29:30.185 --> 29:33.555
But how is any of this possible? 


29:33.555 --> 29:35.890
Brother Russell said it best: 


29:35.890 --> 29:38.000
‘This is not man’s work. It’s God’s.’ 


29:40.828 --> 29:43.998
Jehovah is certainly at the helm. 


29:43.998 --> 29:47.001
As he foretold at Haggai 2:7: 


29:47.002 --> 29:50.139
“I will shake all the nations, 


29:50.138 --> 29:53.406
“and the precious things 
of all the nations will come in; 


29:53.407 --> 29:57.479
and I will fill this house with glory.”


29:57.478 --> 29:59.480
There is certainly 


29:59.480 --> 30:01.748
a great shaking taking place 


30:01.748 --> 30:03.751
worldwide. 


30:03.752 --> 30:07.622
And many of these precious ones 
are offering themselves willingly 


30:07.622 --> 30:11.625
to help Audio/Video Services 
accomplish this great work, 


30:11.625 --> 30:13.728
thanks to Jehovah God, 


30:13.728 --> 30:18.000
our Grand and Visual Instructor.


30:19.833 --> 30:23.805
Our videos are a fantastic provision 
from Jehovah, 


30:23.805 --> 30:26.607
and what a teaching tool they have become. 


30:26.607 --> 30:28.977
We get many letters of appreciation 


30:28.977 --> 30:32.114
about the use of our videos 
in our midweek meetings. 


30:32.113 --> 30:34.115
And I agree; 


30:34.115 --> 30:37.418
the videos make the meetings 
so much more dynamic. 


30:37.418 --> 30:40.888
For example, the week of July 17, 


30:40.888 --> 30:44.725
we will be considering the part
 “Do You Forgive Yourself?” 


30:44.725 --> 30:47.495
which includes a video that we first saw 


30:47.495 --> 30:50.298
at the 2016 Regional Convention. 


30:50.298 --> 30:54.435
Make it a habit to prepare 
for these video considerations


30:54.435 --> 30:57.572
just as thoroughly 
as you would any other part. 


30:57.572 --> 31:02.000
Your well-prepared comments 
will benefit the whole congregation.


31:03.010 --> 31:05.947
And when we arrive 
at the Kingdom Hall for a meeting, 


31:05.947 --> 31:08.449
don’t you agree 
that we all feel refreshed 


31:08.448 --> 31:12.953
the moment we see the smiling faces 
of our brothers and sisters? 


31:12.953 --> 31:15.055
That’s how I feel. 


31:15.055 --> 31:19.727
Sometimes we can even take 
our beautiful meeting location for granted. 


31:19.727 --> 31:23.197
But did you know 
that a lot of work goes into making sure 


31:23.197 --> 31:26.567
that our Kingdom Halls are well utilized? 


31:26.567 --> 31:30.772
The Worldwide Design/Construction 
Department, or WDC, 


31:30.772 --> 31:33.742
is tasked with analyzing 
our worldwide needs 


31:33.742 --> 31:37.679
and providing direction 
to Local Design/Construction Departments 


31:37.678 --> 31:42.000
on how best to use 
our dedicated funds.


31:45.453 --> 31:48.421
As we approach the end 
of the present system of things, 


31:48.422 --> 31:51.259
Jehovah continues to speed up the work. 


31:51.258 --> 31:55.263
We now have 
more than 62,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide, 


31:55.263 --> 31:57.431
and the demand is still growing. 


31:57.432 --> 32:00.302
Jehovah’s blessing 
on the Kingdom work is undeniable, 


32:00.302 --> 32:03.000
as this could not 
have been accomplished otherwise.


32:04.005 --> 32:07.208
Many have been working for years 
in support of Kingdom Hall 


32:07.208 --> 32:10.210
and Assembly Hall construction projects, 


32:10.210 --> 32:13.213
most recently as part 
of the Local Design/Construction, 


32:13.213 --> 32:16.216
or LDC, program. 


32:16.217 --> 32:20.922
This program was implemented 
during the 2014 service year 


32:20.922 --> 32:25.660
and unifies the approach 
for construction of Kingdom Halls worldwide.


32:25.660 --> 32:28.328
What has been accomplished 
since the program started? 


32:28.328 --> 32:30.865
At the end of the 2000 service year, 


32:30.865 --> 32:34.668
half of the publishers worldwide 
met in suitable meeting places. 


32:34.668 --> 32:37.005
However, the other half


32:37.005 --> 32:39.407
—approximately three million publishers—


32:39.407 --> 32:41.509
met in places that were overcrowded 


32:41.508 --> 32:44.045
or otherwise unsuitable as Kingdom Halls.


32:44.045 --> 32:46.047
At that time, 


32:46.047 --> 32:49.250
27,000 Kingdom Halls were needed. 


32:49.250 --> 32:52.387
By 2014, 
the number of publishers meeting 


32:52.387 --> 32:55.657
in unsuitable facilities had been reduced. 


32:55.657 --> 32:58.259
But because of growth in the organization, 


32:58.258 --> 33:01.628
this still meant that 1.6 million publishers 


33:01.628 --> 33:04.231
did not have a suitable meeting place.


33:04.232 --> 33:06.167
Since 2014, 


33:06.167 --> 33:08.169
that figure has been reduced 


33:08.168 --> 33:10.538
by 25 percent. 


33:10.538 --> 33:13.640
What accounts for this significant reduction 
in the backlog, 


33:13.640 --> 33:16.000
allowing us to catch up faster 
than in the past? 


33:17.078 --> 33:19.080
Part of the answer 


33:19.080 --> 33:23.483
lies in making efficient use 
of the facilities we already have. 


33:23.483 --> 33:25.553
When providing food for thousands, 


33:25.553 --> 33:28.956
Jesus made it clear 
that nothing should be wasted. 


33:28.957 --> 33:31.859
The LDC program applies that principle 


33:31.858 --> 33:33.895
to the seats in our Kingdom Halls.


33:33.895 --> 33:35.897
As noted earlier, 


33:35.897 --> 33:39.100
we have 62,000 Kingdom Halls worldwide. 


33:39.100 --> 33:41.535
On average, 
only 60 percent of the seats 


33:41.535 --> 33:43.838
are filled for congregation meetings. 


33:43.838 --> 33:48.475
That means that approximately three 
to four million seats are empty 


33:48.475 --> 33:51.545
during congregation meetings each week. 


33:51.545 --> 33:55.650
There are a number of options 
to help make better use of these seats, 


33:55.650 --> 33:58.853
which will make the use 
of each Kingdom Hall more efficient.


33:58.853 --> 34:00.655
Consider, for example, 


34:00.655 --> 34:02.890
a Kingdom Hall in an urban area. 


34:02.890 --> 34:04.892
It has 200 seats 


34:04.892 --> 34:08.295
and is used 
by four congregations sharing the facility. 


34:08.295 --> 34:10.832
That means the Kingdom Hall will be in use 


34:10.832 --> 34:13.000
for four weeknight meetings 


34:13.000 --> 34:15.235
and four weekend meetings.


34:15.235 --> 34:17.705
It would definitely appear 
to be fully utilized 


34:17.705 --> 34:19.707
and suggests the need 


34:19.707 --> 34:22.177
for new construction for further growth. 


34:22.177 --> 34:25.447
However, 
how many seats were in the Kingdom Hall? 


34:25.447 --> 34:27.449
Two hundred. 


34:27.448 --> 34:30.518
Multiplied by meetings 
for the four congregations, 


34:30.518 --> 34:33.120
this facility has a total seating capacity 


34:33.120 --> 34:35.288
of 800 people. 


34:35.288 --> 34:38.025
Global records indicate that congregations 


34:38.025 --> 34:39.827
using this size Kingdom Hall 


34:39.827 --> 34:41.295
have an average attendance 


34:41.295 --> 34:43.998
of 120 at their meeting. 


34:43.998 --> 34:47.901
This could mean 
that only 480 seats are used 


34:47.902 --> 34:50.472
by the four congregations 
in this Kingdom Hall 


34:50.472 --> 34:53.607
and 320 seats remain empty


34:53.607 --> 34:55.844
—not very efficient.


34:55.843 --> 34:58.611
If the four congregations were redistributed 


34:58.612 --> 35:00.615
into three congregations, 


35:00.615 --> 35:03.350
average meeting attendance 
for each congregation 


35:03.350 --> 35:06.453
would increase 
to about 160 per meeting, 


35:06.453 --> 35:09.156
while still fitting comfortably 
in that Kingdom Hall. 


35:09.157 --> 35:12.760
And this would now allow 
for an open slot in the schedule, 


35:12.760 --> 35:15.530
which could be used 
to meet needs in the area 


35:15.530 --> 35:18.698
without requiring new construction.


35:18.698 --> 35:22.068
In the first three years of the LDC program, 


35:22.068 --> 35:24.938
fully utilizing our existing facilities 


35:24.938 --> 35:28.441
played a part in reducing 
the backlog of Kingdom Hall projects 


35:28.442 --> 35:32.045
from 14,000 to approximately 10,000. 


35:32.045 --> 35:34.615
This saved millions of dollars. 


35:34.615 --> 35:37.385
Of course, this does not meet every need, 


35:37.385 --> 35:39.487
and there is still a significant need 


35:39.487 --> 35:41.122
to construct new Kingdom Halls 


35:41.122 --> 35:44.759
to provide suitable places of worship.


35:44.758 --> 35:46.760
How does the branch office 
make these decisions, 


35:46.760 --> 35:50.130
and how are priorities set? 


35:50.130 --> 35:52.132
All options are examined 
as the Branch Committees 


35:52.132 --> 35:54.135
work with their Local Design/Construction 


35:54.135 --> 35:56.137
and Service departments. 


35:56.137 --> 35:58.974
Transportation needs
—such as distance, 


35:58.973 --> 36:01.008
opportunities for carpooling, 


36:01.008 --> 36:03.243
and availability 
of public transportation—


36:03.243 --> 36:06.746
are taken into account. 


36:06.747 --> 36:09.250
In many cases, 
congregations can be sized 


36:09.250 --> 36:11.318
to make better use of available seats 


36:11.318 --> 36:14.321
in Kingdom Halls 
that have already been built. 


36:14.322 --> 36:16.590
However, 
when they are needed, 


36:16.590 --> 36:20.528
new Kingdom Halls can be constructed 
using simple, standard designs 


36:20.528 --> 36:24.065
that make wise use of donated funds.


36:24.065 --> 36:28.335
Of course, all of this must be done 
with the big picture in mind. 


36:28.335 --> 36:30.872
It is the spiritual needs 
of the congregations 


36:30.872 --> 36:34.875
that are of the utmost priority. 


36:34.875 --> 36:37.878
The structures themselves are not 
the focus of these centers of pure worship, 


36:37.878 --> 36:42.000
but rather it is the people 
who use the facilities.


36:43.150 --> 36:45.820
On one occasion, 
as they passed the temple, 


36:45.820 --> 36:48.688
Mark 13:1 quotes one of Jesus’ disciples 


36:48.688 --> 36:50.991
admiring the structure when he said: 


36:50.992 --> 36:55.162
“Teacher, see! 
what wonderful stones and buildings!” 


36:55.162 --> 36:56.464
However, 


36:56.463 --> 36:58.731
Jesus’ reply simply indicated 


36:58.732 --> 37:02.069
that the building itself would not last. 


37:02.068 --> 37:06.040
It was people Jesus was concerned with.


37:06.040 --> 37:09.043
Likewise, 
the Kingdom Halls that we build today 


37:09.043 --> 37:12.045
will not last forever. 


37:12.045 --> 37:14.782
But these centers of pure worship 
bring people together 


37:14.782 --> 37:18.085
so that we can serve Jehovah 
as a united group


37:18.085 --> 37:22.523
—and that will last forever.


37:22.523 --> 37:24.158
Whether we assist in the construction 


37:24.158 --> 37:27.528
of the many Kingdom Halls 
that are still needed 


37:27.528 --> 37:30.030
or help to renovate and maintain 
existing Kingdom Halls, 


37:30.030 --> 37:32.767
it is our shared privilege 
to help provide 


37:32.767 --> 37:35.000
suitable meeting places 
for our brothers and sisters. 


37:36.537 --> 37:38.539
In this way, 


37:38.538 --> 37:40.941
we each support 
“the faithful and discreet slave” 


37:40.942 --> 37:44.545
as they provide what is needed 
so that each congregation 


37:44.545 --> 37:50.000
can praise Jehovah 
in a suitable place of worship.


37:52.920 --> 37:54.922
Brother Thomas Kalimeris, 


37:54.922 --> 37:56.990
who serves at the United States branch, 


37:56.990 --> 37:58.993
together with his wife, 


37:58.993 --> 38:02.763
has spent close to four decades 
supporting various aspects 


38:02.763 --> 38:05.866
of the organization’s construction projects. 


38:05.867 --> 38:08.369
What has that experience taught him? 


38:08.368 --> 38:13.000
That the work is not run by us.


38:16.143 --> 38:18.145
Throughout history, men have built 


38:18.145 --> 38:21.882
many beautiful and impressive buildings. 


38:21.882 --> 38:24.385
These structures 
have usually brought glory to men, 


38:24.385 --> 38:26.387
not to God. 


38:26.387 --> 38:28.389
But those men are long gone, 


38:28.388 --> 38:32.760
and even many of the structures 
no longer exist. 


38:32.760 --> 38:36.830
How true is the scripture at Psalm 127:1: 


38:36.830 --> 38:39.800
“Unless Jehovah builds the house, 


38:39.800 --> 38:44.000
it is in vain 
that its builders work hard on it.”


38:45.438 --> 38:49.110
In our time too, 
Jehovah is using his people to build. 


38:49.110 --> 38:52.913
We’re working hard 
to build spirituality in interested ones, 


38:52.913 --> 38:54.915
and also we build structures 


38:54.915 --> 38:58.185
in order to help individuals to learn 


38:58.185 --> 39:00.755
about Jehovah and serve him. 


39:00.755 --> 39:03.590
In this type of construction


39:03.590 --> 39:05.592
—both spiritual and physical construction—


39:05.592 --> 39:07.595
I’ve been involved for most of my life.


39:07.595 --> 39:10.063
I was born in Greece. 


39:10.063 --> 39:14.801
Our family came into contact 
with the truth in the early sixties. 


39:14.802 --> 39:17.772
I was baptized when I was in high school. 


39:17.772 --> 39:22.410
I left school to get 
some practical training in architecture, 


39:22.410 --> 39:25.112
but I made pioneering my career. 


39:25.112 --> 39:28.682
In 1973, 
I married my dear wife, Margaret, 


39:28.682 --> 39:31.319
and together 
we enjoyed many assignments. 


39:31.318 --> 39:33.586
We pioneered
—special pioneering. 


39:33.587 --> 39:36.757
We went to Gilead. 


39:36.757 --> 39:38.825
We were invited to Bethel 


39:38.825 --> 39:42.630
in 1979 to work 
in the Engineering Department. 


39:42.630 --> 39:46.333
We worked on designing new branches, 


39:46.333 --> 39:49.236
Assembly Halls, Kingdom Halls, 


39:49.237 --> 39:52.440
renovation of existing branches 


39:52.440 --> 39:56.910
and remote translation offices. 


39:56.910 --> 40:01.382
Before we came to Bethel, we had seen how 
Jehovah provided for us individually. 


40:01.382 --> 40:03.950
But now we had the opportunity 


40:03.950 --> 40:08.000
to see how Jehovah provided 
for the needs of his organization globally.


40:10.423 --> 40:14.561
By the year 2000, 
it became apparent that the present facility 


40:14.562 --> 40:19.334
of the Britain branch 
was not meeting their needs. 


40:19.333 --> 40:21.468
So a site was located 
50 miles (80 km) north of London 


40:21.468 --> 40:24.405
to relocate the branch there. 


40:24.405 --> 40:26.407
However, 


40:26.407 --> 40:29.477
the Governing Body 
decided to cancel the project. 


40:29.477 --> 40:31.479
So in 2008, 


40:31.478 --> 40:34.915
the Governing Body wrote 
that now is the time


40:34.915 --> 40:37.985
—Jehovah’s time—
to find property 


40:37.985 --> 40:39.987
closer to London. 


40:39.987 --> 40:42.122
So a project team was formed, 


40:42.122 --> 40:44.825
and a few years went by,
and a number of properties were searched,


40:44.825 --> 40:48.062
and one was located closer to London. 


40:48.062 --> 40:50.999
If something we plan falls through, 


40:50.998 --> 40:53.966
it could mean 
that Jehovah has something else


40:53.967 --> 40:57.000
—or better— in mind to meet 
the needs of his organization.


40:58.605 --> 41:02.743
While working in the Haiti branch, 
we learned a lesson: 


41:02.743 --> 41:06.546
not to compromise on safety. 


41:06.547 --> 41:10.717
The Brooklyn Engineering Department 
did the drawings for the branch, 


41:10.717 --> 41:13.854
and a local contractor was hired 


41:13.853 --> 41:15.856
to build the structural work. 


41:15.857 --> 41:17.725
Now, the contractor, 
when he reviewed the drawings, 


41:17.725 --> 41:21.228
told the Branch Committee: 
“Really, this is overdesigned. 


41:21.228 --> 41:25.598
You’re wasting a lot of money 
by putting all the steel in the building.” 


41:25.598 --> 41:30.103
So we wrote back and said: 
“No, the drawings are OK. 


41:30.103 --> 41:33.340
“The branch is designed 
according to the seismic zone that it’s in. 


41:33.340 --> 41:37.000
And the contractor is to go ahead 
with the plans as drawn.” 


41:38.045 --> 41:42.650
In 2010, 
when the earthquake came to Haiti, 


41:42.650 --> 41:46.220
hundreds of thousands of people died 


41:46.220 --> 41:50.257
because of inferior materials 
and methods of construction. 


41:50.257 --> 41:52.292
However, 


41:52.292 --> 41:54.862
the branch did not suffer any damage, 


41:54.862 --> 41:58.000
and many people went there to find refuge. 


41:59.733 --> 42:02.435
We’re so glad that Jehovah did not allow us 


42:02.435 --> 42:05.238
to be swayed in this case.


42:05.238 --> 42:09.676
Jehovah continues to direct 
a great physical building work 


42:09.677 --> 42:11.645
and a spiritual work. 


42:11.645 --> 42:14.415
Jehovah trains his people 
how to work together 


42:14.415 --> 42:16.450
for the work just ahead of us


42:16.450 --> 42:21.000
—the beautification of this earth 
to a paradise. 


42:22.188 --> 42:24.758
It is so important that we 
‘trust in Jehovah 


42:24.758 --> 42:28.528
and not to lean 
upon our own understanding.’ 


42:28.528 --> 42:30.763
A life of building with Jehovah


42:30.763 --> 42:34.133
has shown me the wisdom of Psalm 127:1.


42:34.133 --> 42:37.403
If we keep building our lives with Jehovah, 


42:37.403 --> 42:43.000
our building work will never be in vain.


42:45.078 --> 42:48.215
The more responsibility a brother 
is given in the organization, 


42:48.215 --> 42:50.985
the less he feels he is in control. 


42:50.985 --> 42:55.822
Instead, he will clearly see how Jehovah 
takes the lead in the organization. 


42:55.822 --> 42:59.394
And Brother Kalimeris’ experience 
confirms that. 


42:59.393 --> 43:01.861
The account about how the branch in Haiti 


43:01.862 --> 43:04.197
was protected from earthquake damage 


43:04.197 --> 43:06.867
sent chills down my spine. 


43:06.867 --> 43:10.237
While some buildings looked like this, 


43:10.237 --> 43:12.707
our branch looked like this. 


43:12.707 --> 43:16.810
And it wasn’t the ingenuity of the brothers 
 that protected the branch, 


43:16.810 --> 43:19.880
but wisdom that only Jehovah can provide. 


43:19.880 --> 43:23.950
But how can we apply 
that same wisdom in our lives? 


43:23.950 --> 43:27.000
Let’s consider three ways we can do so.


43:34.495 --> 43:36.597
Jehovah has warned us that we’re living 


43:36.597 --> 43:39.000
in “critical times hard to deal with.”


43:42.770 --> 43:45.973
And Jesus foretold that in the last days 


43:45.973 --> 43:49.041
there would be great “earthquakes 
in one place after another” 


43:49.042 --> 43:53.000
and other “fearful sights.”


43:54.982 --> 43:57.885
Many of us either have or will be affected 


43:57.885 --> 44:00.000
by some form of natural disaster.


44:04.023 --> 44:08.595
If this happens, how can we be prepared?


44:08.595 --> 44:10.030
First, 


44:10.030 --> 44:13.100
we can prepare spiritually by maintaining 


44:13.100 --> 44:15.968
a close relationship with Jehovah. 


44:15.968 --> 44:18.838
He is “the God of all comfort,” 


44:18.838 --> 44:22.041
and he can comfort us 
in times of tribulation. 


44:22.042 --> 44:24.512
How does he do this?


44:24.512 --> 44:27.715
We do not expect divine intervention. 


44:27.715 --> 44:30.950
But if we pray during times of distress, 


44:30.950 --> 44:34.287
his powerful holy spirit 
can bring Bible passages 


44:34.287 --> 44:38.292
back to mind to comfort us.


44:38.292 --> 44:40.294
Second, 


44:40.293 --> 44:43.230
we can take practical steps, 


44:43.230 --> 44:46.400
perhaps preparing an emergency kit. 


44:46.400 --> 44:51.238
Our kit could contain 
the following items if possible: 


44:51.238 --> 44:53.773
first-aid supplies, 


44:53.773 --> 44:55.841
bottled water, 


44:55.842 --> 44:58.000
and nonperishable food.


45:01.282 --> 45:04.519
Also, we shouldn’t forget 
to update the elders 


45:04.518 --> 45:08.055
with our latest contact information. 


45:08.055 --> 45:10.057
If we don’t do so, 


45:10.057 --> 45:14.000
valuable time could be lost in a disaster.


45:17.097 --> 45:20.867
Additionally, 
during a Family Worship evening, 


45:20.867 --> 45:24.739
our family could review 
the types of disasters that might happen 


45:24.738 --> 45:27.000
and what could be done in each situation


45:28.242 --> 45:31.412
—such as where we meet, 


45:31.412 --> 45:35.715
how we contact the elders, and so forth.


45:35.715 --> 45:37.717
And third, 


45:37.717 --> 45:40.787
we can help others 
when they’re experiencing a disaster, 


45:40.787 --> 45:44.057
knowing they’d do the same for us. 


45:44.057 --> 45:47.000
How can we do this? 


45:48.695 --> 45:52.732
By offering prayers in their behalf, 


45:52.732 --> 45:57.070
by volunteering to assist 
with disaster relief efforts, 


45:57.070 --> 46:02.910
and by contributing donations 
to the worldwide work.


46:02.910 --> 46:07.000
No, we can’t avoid all natural disasters. 


46:09.015 --> 46:11.452
But if we prepare spiritually, 


46:11.452 --> 46:13.454
practically, 


46:13.453 --> 46:15.588
and help others currently affected, 


46:15.588 --> 46:17.925
we can take comfort in knowing 


46:17.925 --> 46:19.993
that in Jehovah’s eyes 


46:19.993 --> 46:22.796
we are prepared.


46:22.797 --> 46:26.634
That was great, practical advice 
for all of us to take to heart. 


46:26.633 --> 46:30.503
But there are some things 
we can do to help our local congregation. 


46:30.503 --> 46:34.240
Let’s turn briefly 
to interview Brother Bram Siegel, 


46:34.240 --> 46:37.343
who’s with 
the Coordinators’ Committee Office.


46:37.343 --> 46:39.946
Bram, how can all of us cooperate 


46:39.947 --> 46:42.049
with the congregation arrangement 


46:42.048 --> 46:44.316
when a disaster hits?


46:44.317 --> 46:47.287
Immediately after a disaster occurs, 


46:47.287 --> 46:49.289
each field service group overseer 


46:49.288 --> 46:51.291
will contact everyone in his group 


46:51.292 --> 46:53.294
to make sure that all are accounted for 


46:53.293 --> 46:56.596
and to see if anyone needs assistance. 


46:56.597 --> 46:58.699
So each of us 
should make sure to give the elders 


46:58.698 --> 47:01.235
our up-to-date contact information. 


47:01.235 --> 47:04.270
That way they can reach us 
when something happens.


47:04.270 --> 47:08.408
That’s a very important reminder
—good point! 


47:08.408 --> 47:11.645
But what if my area 
was not hit by the disaster 


47:11.645 --> 47:14.080
but an adjacent town or city was? 


47:14.080 --> 47:16.148
Can I just travel there on my own to help, 


47:16.148 --> 47:18.751
or what should I do?


47:18.752 --> 47:22.622
We really appreciate 
the beautiful spirit the brotherhood shows 


47:22.622 --> 47:25.225
when it comes to providing disaster relief. 


47:25.225 --> 47:28.595
Really, the best time 
to make yourself available to help 


47:28.595 --> 47:30.263
is right now, 


47:30.263 --> 47:32.398
before a disaster occurs. 


47:32.398 --> 47:35.168
Just ask your local elders 
for an application. 


47:35.168 --> 47:38.005
Later, when there’s a need 
to provide disaster relief, 


47:38.005 --> 47:42.142
the branch office will know 
that you’re willing and ready to assist.


47:42.142 --> 47:45.979
Thank you very much, Bram, 
for those important reminders.


47:45.978 --> 47:48.000
Thank you.


47:50.083 --> 47:52.318
When large disasters occur, 


47:52.318 --> 47:55.021
our brothers and sisters 
may have to relocate


47:55.022 --> 47:56.990
—perhaps even to another country. 


47:56.990 --> 48:00.627
As refugees, they face unique challenges. 


48:00.627 --> 48:04.732
You will notice that the Watchtower study 
for the week of July 3 


48:04.732 --> 48:06.834
provides practical suggestions 


48:06.833 --> 48:10.270
on how we can support 
such brothers and sisters.


48:10.270 --> 48:12.338
And I’m sure you agree 


48:12.338 --> 48:15.541
that the guidance 
Jehovah’s organization provides, 


48:15.542 --> 48:19.814
the love and care that we experience 
every day as a people for his name, 


48:19.813 --> 48:22.615
the spiritual paradise that we dwell in


48:22.615 --> 48:26.653
—all of that makes us want 
to praise our heavenly Father. 


48:26.653 --> 48:31.391
This brings us to this month’s 
music video which is entitled 


48:31.392 --> 48:34.000
We Marvel at Your Work.


48:41.935 --> 48:50.010
The work of the Kingdom,
in my lifetime and before,


48:50.010 --> 48:58.718
Provides me with your written Word, 
the truth, and so much more.


48:58.718 --> 49:06.893
Your faithful slave, discreet and wise, 
provides increasing light


49:06.893 --> 49:17.336
And sends out men who shepherd me 
with loving oversight.


49:17.337 --> 49:25.145
I know expectations 
at conventions will be met.


49:25.145 --> 49:33.487
And afterward, I always say,
“Now that’s the best one yet!”


49:33.487 --> 49:41.895
At weekly meetings, 
I can feel your thoughtful, loving care


49:41.895 --> 49:52.572
And learn how best to preach and teach 
and have a fuller share.


49:52.572 --> 50:08.855
We marvel at your work
And what the Kingdom’s done so far.


50:08.855 --> 50:16.000
We cherish Kingdom rule.


50:17.097 --> 50:25.539
We grow in faith to realize 
the kind of God you are.


50:25.538 --> 50:37.000
We look ahead to blessings 
that your Kingdom soon will bring.


50:42.455 --> 50:50.130
You give us the honor 
to be workers on your side,


50:50.130 --> 50:58.472
Our ministry that lets us show 
the love we feel inside.


50:58.472 --> 51:06.647
The depth of understanding 
and the peace of mind you give,


51:06.647 --> 51:16.824
They teach us what is pure and true; 
they show the way to live.


51:16.823 --> 51:25.365
The songs that express 
what’s in my heart so very well


51:25.365 --> 51:33.440
And Fam’ly Worship ev’nings 
give your spirit room to dwell.


51:33.440 --> 51:42.315
Our unity, despite whatever language 
we might speak,


51:42.315 --> 51:51.000
Proves that our loving brotherhood 
in this world is unique.


51:52.392 --> 52:08.842
We marvel at your work
And what the Kingdom’s done so far.


52:08.842 --> 52:16.000
We cherish Kingdom rule.


52:17.217 --> 52:25.325
We grow in faith 
to realize the kind of God you are.


52:25.325 --> 52:37.000
We look ahead to blessings 
that your Kingdom soon will bring.


52:46.780 --> 52:48.615
That’s beautiful. 


52:48.615 --> 52:50.817
And how can we show our appreciation 


52:50.817 --> 52:54.120
for Jehovah’s provisions in a practical way? 


52:54.120 --> 52:58.258
By taking seriously 
our God-given assignment to preach. 


52:58.258 --> 53:00.260
And we have seen developments 


53:00.260 --> 53:02.828
in our preaching methods 
in the past few years.


53:02.828 --> 53:07.433
For example, in 2001, 
with the Governing Body’s approval, 


53:07.433 --> 53:10.836
our brothers in France 
started using a variety of methods


53:10.837 --> 53:15.175
to carry out our public witnessing, 
including the use of carts. 


53:15.175 --> 53:18.612
The trial resulted 
in many good experiences. 


53:18.612 --> 53:21.815
As a result, in 2011, 


53:21.815 --> 53:24.250
a pilot project with cart witnessing 


53:24.250 --> 53:28.722
in New York City, U.S.A., was approved.


53:28.722 --> 53:31.190
Since Manhattan, in New York City, 


53:31.190 --> 53:35.362
had a ratio of 1 Jehovah’s Witness
to 657 inhabitants, 


53:35.362 --> 53:37.497
this was a perfect choice. 


53:37.497 --> 53:41.000
That was the beginning 
of a pilot program in Manhattan. 


53:42.868 --> 53:46.071
The program lasted one year, 
using many graduates 


53:46.072 --> 53:49.509
from what was then 
the Bible School for Christian Couples.


53:49.508 --> 53:51.878
Although different tables 
were used at the time, 


53:51.878 --> 53:53.880
it was evident that a mobile cart 


53:53.880 --> 53:55.982
had many advantages. 


53:55.982 --> 53:58.819
As a result, today, 
Jehovah’s Witnesses are well-known 


53:58.818 --> 54:01.721
for their public witnessing using carts  


54:01.722 --> 54:03.490
designed to display their literature. 


54:03.490 --> 54:04.890
By means of this method, 


54:04.890 --> 54:08.127
good news from the Bible 
can be taken to many places 


54:08.127 --> 54:12.000
and easily becomes available 
to countless people.


54:13.433 --> 54:16.670
These carts include different posters that: 


54:16.670 --> 54:19.672
call attention 
to our well-known publications, 


54:19.672 --> 54:23.310
invite people to accept 
free home Bible studies, 


54:23.310 --> 54:27.347
and direct passersby to our official website. 


54:27.347 --> 54:32.000
Here are just a few examples of how 
this method has had many good results.


54:33.553 --> 54:35.555
My name is Mi Jung You. 


54:35.555 --> 54:38.123
The first time I met Jehovah’s Witnesses 


54:38.123 --> 54:39.758
was more than 20 years ago. 


54:39.758 --> 54:42.861
I started studying 
in the You Can Live Forever book, 


54:42.862 --> 54:44.930
but about a month later, 


54:44.930 --> 54:46.933
I had to stop studying. 


54:46.933 --> 54:50.170
After that, 
I would accept the magazines, 


54:50.170 --> 54:52.505
but I never ended up 
studying the Bible again.


54:52.505 --> 54:55.508
In June of 2014, though, 


54:55.508 --> 54:57.843
I saw the public witnessing stand. 


54:57.843 --> 55:01.080
I realized that it belonged 
to Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


55:01.080 --> 55:04.717
So many of the different publications 
they had caught my eye. 


55:04.717 --> 55:09.322
So I asked if it would be OK 
if I took a copy of each one. 


55:09.322 --> 55:11.457
We ended up exchanging numbers, 


55:11.457 --> 55:14.360
and a few weeks later 
the brother contacted me. 


55:14.360 --> 55:18.498
I began studying 
the Bible again with the couple 


55:18.498 --> 55:23.336
and one month later 
started attending meetings regularly.


55:23.337 --> 55:26.807
I was baptized in October of 2015 


55:26.807 --> 55:30.510
and started auxiliary pioneering 
right away for ten months. 


55:30.510 --> 55:32.745
Now I’m serving as a regular pioneer. 


55:32.745 --> 55:36.448
Public witnessing helped me find the truth, 


55:36.448 --> 55:40.620
and it’s a way for me to meet people 
that are interested like I was. 


55:40.620 --> 55:45.000
I have really come to cherish 
the public witnessing work.


55:46.092 --> 55:49.062
My name is Jacob Salomé. 


55:49.062 --> 55:51.397
I work as a driver and spent most of my life 


55:51.397 --> 55:53.534
traveling all over Peru. 


55:53.533 --> 55:57.936
Because of this, I had problems 
with the woman I was living with. 


55:57.937 --> 56:01.000
I never spent time at home 
and practically lived in the truck.


56:05.945 --> 56:08.347
I would see Jehovah’s Witnesses preaching 


56:08.347 --> 56:10.384
on the streets near the buses. 


56:10.383 --> 56:12.785
But since I was always driving, 


56:12.785 --> 56:15.000
I couldn’t park or even talk to them. 


56:16.522 --> 56:20.260
But once, I saw some Witnesses 
preaching in a public square. 


56:20.260 --> 56:22.328
So I went up to them to ask them 


56:22.328 --> 56:25.000
what the Bible says about family matters.


56:27.400 --> 56:30.000
This marked a change in my life. 


56:32.072 --> 56:35.000
My girlfriend and I 
began attending meetings, 


56:36.743 --> 56:40.780
and then we got married and got baptized. 


56:40.780 --> 56:43.000
Now we are Jehovah’s Witnesses.


56:45.585 --> 56:50.257
As Annies and I were standing by our cart, 
we met young Sudharshan. 


56:50.257 --> 56:54.260
Annies showed him our tract 
Can the Dead Really Live Again? 


56:54.260 --> 56:57.063
He was surprised and said, 
“How is it possible?” 


56:57.063 --> 56:59.998
When she explained to him Acts 24:15, 


56:59.998 --> 57:04.503
he exclaimed: “I am a Christian. 
I never knew this!” 


57:04.503 --> 57:06.873
I asked him, 
“Would you like to learn more 


57:06.873 --> 57:09.175
about such wonderful things 
from the Bible?” 


57:09.175 --> 57:12.578
He asked, 
“Can you tell me right now?” 


57:12.578 --> 57:15.915
There and then, I discussed the first chapter 
of the Bible Teach book. 


57:15.915 --> 57:18.083
That’s how it started.


57:18.083 --> 57:20.520
Sudharshan brought his friend, Sagar. 


57:20.520 --> 57:24.557
Sagar, in turn, 
brought Shiva and Srikanth along. 


57:24.557 --> 57:27.027
Three of them are attending 
our meetings regularly. 


57:27.027 --> 57:29.695
Sagar even turned down a job offer 


57:29.695 --> 57:32.865
that conflicted with Bible principles. 


57:32.865 --> 57:35.935
One tract resulted in many Bible studies. 


57:35.935 --> 57:38.103
We can really see Jehovah’s blessing 


57:38.103 --> 57:41.000
on this form of public witnessing.


57:55.488 --> 57:58.290
Without a doubt, 
cart witnessing is being used 


57:58.290 --> 58:00.660
to help preach 
the good news of God’s Kingdom 


58:00.660 --> 58:05.000
“in all the inhabited earth 
for a witness to all the nations.”


58:19.678 --> 58:22.581
The examples we’ve seen in this program 


58:22.582 --> 58:25.319
truly highlight how Jehovah and Jesus 


58:25.318 --> 58:29.588
use all of us to get 
an unprecedented work accomplished.


58:29.588 --> 58:32.491
We’ve seen how young brothers are trained 


58:32.492 --> 58:34.894
to take the lead in the congregations, 


58:34.893 --> 58:37.130
how videos are produced 
around the world 


58:37.130 --> 58:39.032
for our spiritual benefit, 


58:39.032 --> 58:43.302
the work that goes into better 
utilizing our Kingdom Halls, 


58:43.302 --> 58:46.572
how wisdom from Jehovah 
benefits our construction work, 


58:46.572 --> 58:51.544
and how appropriate it is to praise 
our heavenly Father for all his works. 


58:51.543 --> 58:53.378
And last, 


58:53.378 --> 58:56.983
we were encouraged to continue 
in our public witnessing efforts 


58:56.983 --> 59:00.018
as we clearly see Jehovah’s blessing. 


59:00.018 --> 59:04.456
Yes, we are proud 
to be Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


59:04.457 --> 59:08.360
This is the best organization on earth.


59:08.360 --> 59:10.095
To conclude, 


59:10.095 --> 59:14.033
we’d like to share 
this postcard from Iceland. 


59:14.033 --> 59:17.103
Almost 335,000 people live 


59:17.103 --> 59:19.671
on this North Atlantic island nation, 


59:19.672 --> 59:23.000
of which about 380 are Jehovah’s Witnesses.


59:24.510 --> 59:27.480
Iceland is known 
for being the land of ice and fire, 


59:27.480 --> 59:30.717
as it has both a lot of volcanic activity 


59:30.717 --> 59:33.285
and Europe’s largest glacier. 


59:33.285 --> 59:35.120
In their free time, 


59:35.120 --> 59:38.490
the Witnesses in Iceland 
enjoy hiking in the beautiful nature


59:38.490 --> 59:42.928
or riding on horseback 
on Icelandic horses.


59:42.928 --> 59:46.765
The preaching work  
in Iceland began in 1929. 


59:46.765 --> 59:51.637
Brother Lindal was the only publisher 
on the island for nearly 18 years. 


59:51.637 --> 59:54.540
Today, the 380 publishers conduct 


59:54.540 --> 59:58.010
approximately 270 Bible studies, 


59:58.010 --> 59:59.912
and almost 700 people


59:59.912 --> 1:00:04.617
attended the Memorial of Christ’s death 
last year.


1:00:04.617 --> 1:00:07.820
In the winter, 
the sun is up for only a few hours. 


1:00:07.820 --> 1:00:11.090
While the Witnesses 
use the limited sunlight wisely


1:00:11.090 --> 1:00:13.893
—going from door to door 
or business witnessing—


1:00:13.893 --> 1:00:16.000
they are not scared by the darkness. 


1:00:18.030 --> 1:00:21.833
Some congregations use tiny lights 
on their public witnessing carts 


1:00:21.833 --> 1:00:25.338
so that the passersby will see the carts.


1:00:25.338 --> 1:00:28.606
Also, the weather in Iceland 
can change quickly. 


1:00:28.607 --> 1:00:33.145
To prevent literature from being damaged 
by rain or other weather elements, 


1:00:33.145 --> 1:00:37.917
some congregations use plastic covers 
on the literature.


1:00:37.917 --> 1:00:40.654
In 2011, a Polish group was established 


1:00:40.653 --> 1:00:42.788
in the capital city of Reykjavik, 


1:00:42.788 --> 1:00:47.000
and in 2016, a congregation 
with over 40 publishers was formed. 


1:00:48.928 --> 1:00:51.000
Today, they conduct over 20 Bible studies.


1:00:53.465 --> 1:00:56.768
All the brothers and sisters in Iceland 
send their warm Christian love. 


1:00:56.768 --> 1:01:00.138
We pray that Jehovah will continue 


1:01:00.138 --> 1:01:03.676
to bless their efforts in praising his name. 


1:01:03.677 --> 1:01:05.712
This is JW Broadcasting 


1:01:05.712 --> 1:01:16.707
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
