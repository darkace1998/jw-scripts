00:01.752 --> 00:03.487
The theme of our broadcast 


00:03.487 --> 00:05.622
is a very comforting one: 


00:05.622 --> 00:07.824
“Being ‘Securely Wrapped 


00:07.823 --> 00:10.000
in the Bag of Life With Jehovah.’” 


00:11.293 --> 00:13.696
Perhaps the thought 
of being securely wrapped 


00:13.697 --> 00:16.565
makes us think of a safely swaddled baby 


00:16.565 --> 00:20.970
or of being enveloped 
in a warm blanket on a cold night. 


00:20.970 --> 00:24.607
In the Bible, these words 
were uttered by the woman Abigail 


00:24.607 --> 00:26.844
to Jehovah’s servant David. 


00:26.843 --> 00:29.078
To understand the meaning of the words 


00:29.078 --> 00:31.080
and their importance today, 


00:31.080 --> 00:35.352
let’s review the context 
of 1 Samuel chapter 25. 


00:35.352 --> 00:39.222
David and 600 of his men 
 were dwelling as fugitives. 


00:39.222 --> 00:41.224
They eventually encountered men 


00:41.223 --> 00:44.593
who worked as shepherds 
for Abigail’s husband, Nabal. 


00:44.593 --> 00:48.598
David and his men began 
to help guard Nabal’s flocks 


00:48.598 --> 00:52.235
and serve as “a protective wall” 
for Nabal’s flocks and servants 


00:52.235 --> 00:56.572
against thieves and invaders 
who roamed through the wilderness. 


00:56.572 --> 01:01.110
It was likely challenging 
to find enough food for 600 soldiers, 


01:01.110 --> 01:03.580
so David decided to send ten of his men 


01:03.580 --> 01:06.182
to kindly ask Nabal for food 


01:06.182 --> 01:10.420
in repayment for the services 
that they had performed. 


01:10.420 --> 01:15.825
But at 1 Samuel 25:10, 11, 


01:15.825 --> 01:18.828
note Nabal’s reply: 


01:18.828 --> 01:21.865
“Nabal answered David’s servants: 


01:21.865 --> 01:26.235
“‘Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? 


01:26.235 --> 01:30.640
“‘Nowadays many servants 
are breaking away from their masters. 


01:30.640 --> 01:34.377
“‘Do I have to take my bread and my water 


01:34.377 --> 01:37.014
“‘and the meat 
that I butchered for my shearers 


01:37.013 --> 01:40.950
and give it to men who come 
from who knows where?’” 


01:40.950 --> 01:45.955
This was not the response that David 
and his men were expecting to hear. 


01:45.955 --> 01:50.960
The Bible describes Nabal 
as a very harsh, worthless man, 


01:50.960 --> 01:54.397
and this is certainly evidenced by his reply. 


01:54.397 --> 01:58.569
“He screamed insults” 
at the messengers and ridiculed David, 


01:58.568 --> 02:01.971
comparing him to a runaway servant. 


02:01.972 --> 02:05.842
So David decided 
to take matters into his own hands 


02:05.842 --> 02:09.745
and resolve the situation 
the way many people today might 


02:09.745 --> 02:11.948
—by fighting. 


02:11.948 --> 02:13.950
In verse 13, 


02:13.950 --> 02:17.087
he has 400 of his men 
prepare themselves for battle, 


02:17.087 --> 02:19.122
with one mission


02:19.122 --> 02:22.000
—to wipe out every male 
in Nabal’s household. 


02:23.493 --> 02:28.063
Eventually, word got back to Abigail 
about what her husband had done. 


02:28.063 --> 02:31.200
Without telling Nabal, 
she gathered an abundance of food 


02:31.200 --> 02:33.537
and went out to meet David. 


02:33.537 --> 02:37.340
When she met up with him, 
she poured out her heart at length, 


02:37.340 --> 02:39.942
asking David to forgive her personally 


02:39.942 --> 02:42.145
and making a powerful plea for mercy 


02:42.145 --> 02:45.415
on behalf of her husband and her household. 


02:45.415 --> 02:49.352
She acknowledged that Nabal 
was a foolish and senseless man, 


02:49.352 --> 02:52.255
so she urged David not to take any action 


02:52.255 --> 02:54.390
that might bring bloodguilt upon him 


02:54.390 --> 02:58.393
or cause him to be affected 
by a troubled conscience. 


02:58.393 --> 03:01.696
As Abigail concluded her appeal to David, 


03:01.697 --> 03:05.602
notice what she tells him in verse 29, 


03:05.602 --> 03:08.739
the theme of our discussion: 


03:08.738 --> 03:13.241
“When someone rises up 
to pursue you and seeks your life, 


03:13.242 --> 03:16.412
“the life of my lord will be wrapped securely 


03:16.412 --> 03:19.382
“in the bag of life with Jehovah your God, 


03:19.382 --> 03:21.384
“but the lives of your enemies 


03:21.383 --> 03:25.455
he will hurl away like stones from a sling.” 


03:25.455 --> 03:28.457
Just as we might wrap up something valuable 


03:28.457 --> 03:30.960
in order to protect and preserve it, 


03:30.960 --> 03:34.097
Abigail was telling David 
that that is how his life 


03:34.097 --> 03:36.265
would be in Jehovah’s hands. 


03:36.265 --> 03:40.237
Jehovah would protect and preserve 
David’s life from his enemies 


03:40.237 --> 03:44.524
as long as he did not seek 
to save himself by personal efforts 


03:44.523 --> 03:46.725
but waited on Jehovah, 


03:46.725 --> 03:50.000
trusting in the One to whom he owed his life.


03:51.415 --> 03:55.285
What lessons can we learn from this account? 


03:55.285 --> 03:59.855
As David saw, his relationship 
with Jehovah was a protection. 


03:59.855 --> 04:04.000
In verse 32, he acknowledges 
that God had sent Abigail with the warning. 


04:05.682 --> 04:09.299
We learn 
that Jehovah’s spiritual protection for us 


04:09.298 --> 04:13.870
is related to the quality 
of our relationship with him. 


04:13.870 --> 04:18.000
That’s why the Bible tells us at James 4:8: 


04:19.542 --> 04:22.212
“Draw close to God, 


04:22.212 --> 04:25.282
and he will draw close to you.” 


04:25.282 --> 04:28.284
Jehovah invites us to draw near to him 


04:28.283 --> 04:32.988
because he wants to receive us 
into his favor as his friends. 


04:32.988 --> 04:37.260
When we dedicate our lives 
and vow to serve him unconditionally, 


04:37.260 --> 04:39.595
we gain an approved standing with him; 


04:39.595 --> 04:43.032
we’re figuratively put in that “bag of life.” 


04:43.032 --> 04:47.370
And as we work to develop 
a close personal relationship with him, 


04:47.370 --> 04:51.640
then we can experience 
Jehovah’s friendship and protection. 


04:51.640 --> 04:54.510
We would never want 
to restrict Jehovah’s protection 


04:54.510 --> 04:59.915
by not looking to him for guidance 
or relying on our own thinking. 


04:59.915 --> 05:03.018
Now, can we think of areas or situations 


05:03.018 --> 05:06.331
that might require us to wait on Jehovah? 


05:06.332 --> 05:11.349
Perhaps we’re experiencing 
literal opposition at work or at school. 


05:11.348 --> 05:16.000
Like Abigail, we might face the challenge 
of living with a difficult marriage mate. 


05:17.067 --> 05:19.069
Maybe we’re battling a health issue 


05:19.068 --> 05:22.638
and loyalty is needed 
regarding our medical choices. 


05:22.638 --> 05:24.640
Or it may be that we live in a country 


05:24.640 --> 05:26.742
where we cannot preach freely 


05:26.742 --> 05:29.745
or that we face opposition for our beliefs. 


05:29.745 --> 05:33.248
Really, it could be any number of situations. 


05:33.248 --> 05:36.651
But it is our response


05:36.652 --> 05:39.189
—the way we handle the situation—


05:39.188 --> 05:44.193
that indicates how much 
we are allowing Jehovah to help us. 


05:44.193 --> 05:49.198
Do we trust him enough 
that we can leave the matter in his hands 


05:49.198 --> 05:53.231
and see how he works 
things out in our behalf? 


05:53.232 --> 05:57.982
We have to manifest 
Christian qualities in order to do that. 


05:57.982 --> 06:02.000
Think about what qualities displayed 
by Abigail and David impress you most. 


06:03.545 --> 06:07.950
Two that come to mind 
are patience and reasonableness. 


06:07.950 --> 06:10.720
Patience is closely connected with endurance 


06:10.720 --> 06:14.323
and enables one to put up 
with difficult circumstances 


06:14.323 --> 06:17.693
while maintaining a positive attitude. 


06:17.693 --> 06:21.196
Reasonableness describes 
a person who is fair, 


06:21.197 --> 06:25.099
considerate, willing to yield to others. 


06:25.098 --> 06:28.536
How well this describes Abigail! 


06:28.537 --> 06:32.175
It must have been quite a challenge 
to live with someone like Nabal. 


06:32.175 --> 06:36.378
But nowhere do we read 
that she was ever disrespectful of him 


06:36.378 --> 06:38.380
or that she belittled him. 


06:38.380 --> 06:42.618
Even when she referred to him 
as senseless in verse 25, 


06:42.618 --> 06:46.121
from Jehovah’s standpoint, 
her comments were proper 


06:46.122 --> 06:51.127
because Nabal’s actions 
put his entire household in danger. 


06:51.127 --> 06:53.229
How about David? 


06:53.228 --> 06:55.396
He was in a position of authority, 


06:55.397 --> 07:00.069
but he showed great patience 
and reasonableness in listening to Abigail 


07:00.068 --> 07:03.538
and having the good sense 
to know that she was right. 


07:03.538 --> 07:06.508
That’s not always easy to do 
in the heat of the moment 


07:06.508 --> 07:08.978
or when we’re upset. 


07:08.978 --> 07:10.980
Perhaps you recall that at our 


07:10.980 --> 07:13.783
“Don’t Give Up!” 
Regional Convention last year, 


07:13.783 --> 07:17.853
when discussing 2 Peter 1:5-8, 


07:17.853 --> 07:20.490
we learned a nice formula 
that can help us 


07:20.490 --> 07:24.060
to cultivate and strengthen 
Christian qualities. 


07:24.060 --> 07:27.530
We were encouraged to study them, 


07:27.530 --> 07:29.932
meditate on them, 


07:29.932 --> 07:32.502
and put them into practice. 


07:32.502 --> 07:34.504
If we apply this formula 


07:34.503 --> 07:37.206
with the qualities 
of patience and reasonableness, 


07:37.207 --> 07:40.910
it can help us to endure 
our trials successfully. 


07:40.910 --> 07:43.478
And we’re confident 
that Jehovah will supply us 


07:43.478 --> 07:45.915
with whatever power we need 


07:45.915 --> 07:48.217
so that we will not tire out 


07:48.217 --> 07:52.000
as we continue to endure 
and put our trust in him. 


07:53.388 --> 07:55.525
In addition to developing these qualities, 


07:55.525 --> 07:59.295
something else that can help us 
is our spiritual routine. 


07:59.295 --> 08:03.498
Our consistent routine 
of study, meeting attendance, 


08:03.498 --> 08:07.035
and the ministry will help us remain busy, 


08:07.035 --> 08:11.040
stay active, and make good decisions. 


08:11.040 --> 08:14.543
We’ll have no time 
to become curious or occupied 


08:14.543 --> 08:17.980
with the things this world has to offer. 


08:17.980 --> 08:21.750
It’s good to remember 
the people during the days of Haggai. 


08:21.750 --> 08:26.755
When the Jews lost their focus 
and started neglecting Jehovah’s temple, 


08:26.755 --> 08:31.160
they lost his blessing 
and protection spiritually. 


08:31.160 --> 08:33.762
And what was the result? 


08:33.762 --> 08:36.532
Well, notice how Haggai draws our attention 


08:36.532 --> 08:39.069
to a different type of “bag” 


08:39.068 --> 08:43.313
at Haggai 1:6: 


08:43.313 --> 08:48.343
“You have sown much seed, 
but you harvest little. 


08:48.343 --> 08:52.281
“You eat, but it is not to satisfaction. 


08:52.282 --> 08:55.930
“You drink, but you do not drink your fill. 


08:55.930 --> 09:00.557
“You put on clothing, but no one gets warm. 


09:00.557 --> 09:04.060
“The one who hires himself out puts his wages 


09:04.060 --> 09:06.762
in a bag full of holes.”


09:06.762 --> 09:11.197
The Jews sowed seed 
but had a meager harvest. 


09:11.197 --> 09:14.397
They lacked enough food 
to satisfy their needs. 


09:14.397 --> 09:17.874
They were unable to clothe 
themselves with warm garments. 


09:17.873 --> 09:21.110
Because Jehovah withheld his blessings, 


09:21.110 --> 09:24.113
Haggai rightly compared them to a man 


09:24.113 --> 09:28.500
who “puts his wages in a bag full of holes.” 


09:28.500 --> 09:32.905
Imagine the disappointment 
of discovering that hard-earned wages 


09:32.905 --> 09:36.792
had gradually disappeared 
through a leaking bag! 


09:36.792 --> 09:40.714
Of course, 
our focus is not material prosperity, 


09:40.713 --> 09:44.333
because, whether we have 
an abundance of material things or not, 


09:44.333 --> 09:47.836
if we fail to receive Jehovah’s blessing, 


09:47.837 --> 09:51.247
our spirituality is jeopardized. 


09:51.247 --> 09:56.047
So we must be determined 
never to lose our focus 


09:56.047 --> 10:00.482
and keep Jehovah 
in the forefront of our lives.


10:00.482 --> 10:03.385
When we examine the life of David, 


10:03.385 --> 10:05.487
it’s evident that he enjoyed 


10:05.487 --> 10:09.542
a preserved and protected 
relationship with God. 


10:09.542 --> 10:11.910
When you read the book of Psalms, 


10:11.910 --> 10:16.748
take note of how David 
describes Jehovah’s protective care 


10:16.748 --> 10:18.750
in Psalm 18, 


10:18.750 --> 10:21.870
Psalm 31, and Psalm 34 


10:21.870 --> 10:23.938
as he went through distresses 


10:23.938 --> 10:26.796
—just beautiful accounts! 


10:26.797 --> 10:30.747
Now, did David always do 
everything the right way? 


10:30.747 --> 10:32.315
No. 


10:32.315 --> 10:34.650
Think of his encounter with Nabal. 


10:34.650 --> 10:37.920
While his angry reaction was understandable, 


10:37.920 --> 10:41.823
his way of expressing it was not correct. 


10:41.823 --> 10:44.793
But David learned from his mistakes, 


10:44.793 --> 10:47.830
and each new trial that he went through 


10:47.830 --> 10:51.647
strengthened his relationship 
with Jehovah even more. 


10:51.647 --> 10:55.437
For example, 
after the ordeal with Nabal, 


10:55.437 --> 10:58.907
a short time later, 
David married Abigail. 


10:58.907 --> 11:00.927
They were still fugitives, 


11:00.927 --> 11:03.495
but he found a king that befriended them, 


11:03.495 --> 11:07.433
and he gave David’s men 
and family a land to dwell in. 


11:07.433 --> 11:10.401
One day, while all the men were away, 


11:10.402 --> 11:13.589
the Amalekites raided and burned the city 


11:13.588 --> 11:16.191
and carried off all the men’s wives, 


11:16.192 --> 11:18.477
children, and flocks. 


11:18.477 --> 11:21.214
Upon returning 
and seeing what had happened, 


11:21.213 --> 11:24.183
David and his men wept. 


11:24.183 --> 11:26.851
Grief quickly turned to bitterness, 


11:26.852 --> 11:30.280
and David’s men spoke of stoning him. 


11:30.280 --> 11:33.842
This was likely quite stressful for David. 


11:33.842 --> 11:36.845
He was concerned 
for the safety of his family, 


11:36.845 --> 11:40.750
and likely he was frustrated 
that his men had turned on him. 


11:40.750 --> 11:45.687
Maybe he felt disrespected again, 
as he had with Nabal. 


11:45.687 --> 11:49.525
So how would he handle this situation? 


11:49.525 --> 11:51.893
We get a glimpse of David’s feelings 


11:51.893 --> 11:56.000
at 1 Samuel 30:6: 


11:57.232 --> 12:00.335
“David was very distressed, 


12:00.335 --> 12:03.213
“because the men were talking of stoning him, 


12:03.213 --> 12:05.881
“for all the men had become very bitter 


12:05.882 --> 12:09.079
over the loss of their sons and daughters.” 


12:09.078 --> 12:13.981
But notice, 
how did David handle the situation? 


12:13.982 --> 12:16.000
The verse continues: 


12:17.547 --> 12:22.580
“But David strengthened himself 
by Jehovah his God.” 


12:22.580 --> 12:25.080
How did he do this? 


12:25.080 --> 12:27.330
Verse 8 says: 


12:27.330 --> 12:32.530
“David inquired of Jehovah.” 


12:32.530 --> 12:37.205
This time, David has 
a different thought process and response. 


12:37.205 --> 12:42.230
Immediately he remembers 
to consult Jehovah. 


12:42.230 --> 12:44.247
Isn’t this a nice reminder 


12:44.247 --> 12:48.180
that when you and I are going 
through difficult trials and situations, 


12:48.180 --> 12:51.987
we want to immediately pray to Jehovah 


12:51.987 --> 12:55.690
and seek his direction 
through the pages of his Word, the Bible? 


12:55.690 --> 13:00.000
This is essential 
for our spiritual protection. 


13:01.630 --> 13:06.635
So in review, 
as we face difficult situations in life, 


13:06.635 --> 13:11.290
may we look for opportunities 
to show and develop our Christian qualities 


13:11.290 --> 13:14.527
—such as patience and reasonableness. 


13:14.527 --> 13:18.347
These qualities show Jehovah 
that we want to be like him, 


13:18.347 --> 13:20.934
that we have 
the mental disposition of Christ, 


13:20.933 --> 13:25.630
and that we will allow Him 
to guide us constantly. 


13:25.630 --> 13:30.413
Next, may we keep focused and busy 
“in the work of the Lord.” 


13:30.413 --> 13:33.395
By drawing close to Jehovah through prayer 


13:33.395 --> 13:35.998
and engaging in spiritual activities, 


13:35.998 --> 13:39.568
we make the best of our situation now. 


13:39.568 --> 13:41.570
But we will also find 


13:41.570 --> 13:44.823
everlasting protection in Jehovah’s hands, 


13:44.823 --> 13:46.825
safely swaddled 


13:46.825 --> 13:56.435
and securely wrapped in his “bag of life”!
