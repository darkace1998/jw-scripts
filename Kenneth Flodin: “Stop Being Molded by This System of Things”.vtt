‎The theme is

00:00:02.986 --> 00:00:06.022 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Stop Being Molded 
by This System of Things.” 

00:00:06.756 --> 00:00:08.758 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In describing godly wisdom,

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:10.493 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the ancient man Job

00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:13.096 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎recognized it as priceless. 

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:15.498 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At Job 28:17, he said:

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:19.803 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Gold and glass cannot be compared to it.” 

00:00:19.803 --> 00:00:23.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Glass
—it has been around for centuries,

00:00:23.907 --> 00:00:26.409 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎even back in Job’s day. 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.312 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, 
what revolutionized glass production

00:00:29.312 --> 00:00:32.449 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was the invention of glassblowing. 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:34.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By blowing through a hollow tube,

00:00:34.651 --> 00:00:38.988 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a glassblower can quickly mold 
superheated molten glass

00:00:38.988 --> 00:00:41.024 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into a specific shape.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.495 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan’s system has developed the art

00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of shaping the minds of people

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:52.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into fragile glass vessels 
with little useful purpose. 

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, 
Romans 9:22 refers to such ones

00:00:56.773 --> 00:01:01.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as “vessels of wrath made fit for destruction.” 

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:06.116 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Find with me Romans 12:2. 

00:01:06.116 --> 00:01:10.053 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What is responsible for molding and shaping

00:01:10.053 --> 00:01:13.189 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the inclinations of the people of the world? 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.358 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Romans 12:2:

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:18.962 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“And stop being molded 
by this system of things,

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:23.233 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“but be transformed 
by making your mind over,

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:25.468 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“so that you 
may prove to yourselves

00:01:25.468 --> 00:01:29.873 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the good and acceptable 
and perfect will of God.” 

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:33.443 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To counteract “being molded,” 
the verse said:

00:01:33.443 --> 00:01:36.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“But be transformed 
by making your mind over.” 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.184 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So the molding of this system 
is related to our thinking

00:01:41.184 --> 00:01:43.353 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the shaping of our minds.

00:01:44.587 --> 00:01:49.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what evil air 
is blown down the hollow tube? 

00:01:49.592 --> 00:01:54.597 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s identified quite clearly for us 
at Ephesians 2:2, 3. 

00:01:56.432 --> 00:02:00.036 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Concerning a Christian’s previous 
unclean thinking and behavior, 

00:02:00.036 --> 00:02:01.504 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎verse 2 says:

00:02:01.504 --> 00:02:04.240 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In which you at one time walked

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.644 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“according to the system 
of things of this world,

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:11.915 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“according to the ruler 
of the authority of the air,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:16.519 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the spirit that is now at work 
in the sons of disobedience.” 

00:02:17.353 --> 00:02:22.192 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The verse makes clear 
that this “system of things” has a ruler. 

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:26.863 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan is called 
“the ruler of the authority of the air.” 

00:02:26.863 --> 00:02:31.367 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The verse indicates 
that “the air” is “the spirit” of the world. 

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:33.469 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, with such a mind-set,

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:37.740 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what kind of behavior 
does the thinking of the world lead to? 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.275 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Verse 3:

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:43.780 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Yes, among them 
we all at one time conducted ourselves

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.817 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“in harmony with the desires of our flesh,

00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:52.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“carrying out the will 
of the flesh and of our thoughts,

00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:56.759 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and we were naturally children 
of wrath just as the rest.” 

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:58.995 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For this reason, they become

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:02.332 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“vessels of wrath made fit for destruction.”

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:07.470 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Glassblowers often work 
in groups known as “shops.” 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.475 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎An apprentice dips 
a hollow blowpipe into the liquid glass. 

00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:16.779 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By twirling it, 
he gathers a blob of molten glass. 

00:03:16.779 --> 00:03:19.449 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He shapes the blob by rolling it

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:22.018 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on a smooth surface called a marver. 

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:25.655 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He then passes the tube 
to the gaffer, or shop master. 

00:03:26.456 --> 00:03:31.394 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He blows air into the tube 
and fashions the glass into a globe. 

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If a wine glass is being made,

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:36.432 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the tube is then passed to the stem-maker

00:03:36.432 --> 00:03:39.202 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and another gather of glass is attached. 

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:42.305 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is then shaped 
by means of long-pointed tongs

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:44.841 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to form the stem. 

00:03:44.841 --> 00:03:49.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then, another gather of hot glass
is added to the stem. 

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.649 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The craftsman rolls the tube 
on the arm of his chair. 

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:56.386 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He forms the base of the glass.

00:03:56.386 --> 00:03:59.055 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We will briefly consider four ways

00:03:59.055 --> 00:04:01.891 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that this system subtly tries to shape

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:04.560 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our mind into Satan’s designs. 

00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:09.599 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The first is harmful peer pressure. 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.069 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, often this is just an apprentice
in Satan’s shop

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:17.540 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—maybe fellow students in school,
fellow workers on the job. 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.510 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Don’t you think Satan will try to capitalize

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.379 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎on these circumstantial relationships? 

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:25.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Absolutely! 

00:04:25.381 --> 00:04:29.252 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Peer pressure
—it can have an influence on our mind.

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They may make fun 
of our wholesome morals,

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:36.192 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our clean speech, our dignified dress. 

00:04:36.192 --> 00:04:38.227 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That is pressure. 

00:04:38.227 --> 00:04:43.166 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Possibly, they invite us to do things
that we know will lead to no good. 

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They are twirling us

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.603 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with their thinking, with their taunts,

00:04:47.603 --> 00:04:50.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or maybe with their flattery and temptation. 

00:04:50.773 --> 00:04:54.610 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They are rolling things 
over and over in our mind.

00:04:56.813 --> 00:05:00.316 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Turn to 2 Peter 2:18, 19. 

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:03.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And as you read this,

00:05:03.886 --> 00:05:08.224 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎can you pick out a word 
that is equivalent to peer pressure?

00:05:08.224 --> 00:05:09.759 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s read

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.328 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎2 Peter 2:18, 19:

00:05:12.328 --> 00:05:17.333 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“They make high-sounding statements
that are empty [like air]. 

00:05:17.333 --> 00:05:21.471 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“By appealing to the desires of the flesh
and with acts of brazen conduct,

00:05:21.471 --> 00:05:26.275 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“they entice [that’s peer pressure] people

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:29.712 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“who have just escaped 
from those who live in error.

00:05:29.712 --> 00:05:32.315 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“While they are promising them freedom,

00:05:32.315 --> 00:05:35.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“they themselves are slaves of corruption;

00:05:35.451 --> 00:05:38.521 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“for if anyone is overcome by someone,

00:05:38.521 --> 00:05:41.758 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎he is his slave.” 

00:05:42.025 --> 00:05:45.695 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The verse says that if we are overcome 
by peer pressure—enticed—

00:05:45.695 --> 00:05:48.364 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we actually become a “slave” of that person. 

00:05:48.364 --> 00:05:50.166 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That is scary!

00:05:50.166 --> 00:05:52.268 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s dangerous! 

00:05:52.268 --> 00:05:56.005 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Peer pressure is deceptively strong.

00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:58.841 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what is another way
that the spirit of this system

00:05:58.841 --> 00:06:00.877 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎can shape our thinking? 

00:06:00.877 --> 00:06:04.013 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You recall that the apprentice 
passed the glassblowing tube

00:06:04.013 --> 00:06:08.518 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the gaffer who blew air 
into the glass, giving it shape. 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:14.157 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What does Satan and this system 
next use to mold our thinking? 

00:06:15.358 --> 00:06:18.327 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Enticing advertisements. 

00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:20.797 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Like the air of a glassblower,

00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:24.867 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎advertisements often have little substance. 

00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:27.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
that product we decided to buy

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.273 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when we last went shopping. 

00:06:30.273 --> 00:06:32.275 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Maybe it was a brand of clothing

00:06:32.275 --> 00:06:35.511 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or a brand of dry cereal 
we bought for breakfast. 

00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:40.216 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Is that always purely a personal,
rational decision on our part?

00:06:40.216 --> 00:06:42.985 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Or did advertising

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:46.989 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎subtly but powerfully affect our choice? 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.260 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, it’s not that all advertising
is bad or misleading. 

00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:55.832 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But the more 
we allow ourselves to be influenced by it,

00:06:55.832 --> 00:07:00.169 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the more we are in danger 
of being led into a materialistic way of life. 

00:07:01.204 --> 00:07:04.540 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
instead of dry cereal,

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.545 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎are we now influenced 
to buy that flashy-looking sports car?

00:07:09.545 --> 00:07:12.548 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Turn to 1 John 2:15-17. 

00:07:14.984 --> 00:07:19.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This system inflates our thinking
by means of “things.”

00:07:19.722 --> 00:07:22.125 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First John 2:15, 16:

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:26.195 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Do not love either the world
or the things in the world. 

00:07:26.195 --> 00:07:30.633 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If anyone loves the world, 
the love of the Father is not in him;

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:33.436 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“because everything in the world

00:07:33.436 --> 00:07:37.440 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“—the desire of the flesh 
and the desire of the eyes

00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.243 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and the showy display 
of one’s means of life—

00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:42.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“does not originate with the Father,

00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:45.515 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but originates with the world.” 

00:07:45.781 --> 00:07:48.117 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why do we need to resist catering

00:07:48.117 --> 00:07:51.621 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to advertisements 
that feed the spirit of the world? 

00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:53.389 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Verse 17:

00:07:53.723 --> 00:07:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Furthermore, the world is passing away

00:07:57.093 --> 00:08:00.496 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and so is its desire,

00:08:00.496 --> 00:08:05.334 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the one who does 
the will of God remains forever.” 

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:07.537 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Remember Eve! 

00:08:07.537 --> 00:08:10.973 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan advertised the forbidden fruit. 

00:08:10.973 --> 00:08:14.544 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The scripture says 
it was “desirable to the eyes,

00:08:14.544 --> 00:08:17.313 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎. . . the tree was pleasing to look at.” 

00:08:17.313 --> 00:08:20.116 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎She succumbed to the advertisement

00:08:20.116 --> 00:08:22.118 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with disastrous results. 

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:28.191 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Similarly, Satan used advertisements 
to try to reshape Jesus’ focus. 

00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:30.793 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Matthew chapter 4 says that Satan

00:08:30.793 --> 00:08:34.597 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“showed him all the kingdoms of the world,”

00:08:34.597 --> 00:08:38.234 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎offering them 
in exchange for one act of worship. 

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:43.472 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jesus simply turned him off. 

00:08:45.908 --> 00:08:49.412 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Don’t be overly influenced by advertisements.

00:08:50.813 --> 00:08:54.817 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What’s the next aspect of this system
that can distort our minds? 

00:08:55.851 --> 00:08:58.421 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Bad associations. 

00:08:58.421 --> 00:09:01.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is as if the gaffer 
has now passed the glassblowing tube

00:09:01.724 --> 00:09:03.759 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎ to the stem-maker.

00:09:03.759 --> 00:09:06.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He takes another gather of molten glass

00:09:06.295 --> 00:09:09.498 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and attaches it to our globe. 

00:09:09.498 --> 00:09:12.235 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Then he stretches that associated blob

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:14.403 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎into the form of a stem. 

00:09:15.304 --> 00:09:18.140 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we already talked about peer pressure,

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.244 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but that often comes 
from those who are not necessarily

00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:23.412 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎our close associates. 

00:09:23.412 --> 00:09:27.016 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What we’re discussing now is our decisions

00:09:27.016 --> 00:09:30.653 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about whom we spend a lot of time with. 

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:35.324 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎People who don’t love Jehovah 
can stretch and misshape our minds,

00:09:35.324 --> 00:09:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎providing a stem or a handle 
for the world to hold us by. 

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:43.766 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Turn to 1 Corinthians 15:33. 

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:50.539 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Sometimes we hear the phrase 
that some of the kids in school

00:09:50.539 --> 00:09:54.043 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎are nicer than some of the kids 
in the congregation. 

00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:58.381 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But usually, nicer actually means more fun

00:09:58.381 --> 00:10:00.383 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎rather than more wholesome. 

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:06.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But let’s look 
at 1 Corinthians 15:33 in its context. 

00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:08.557 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What did the apostle Paul mean

00:10:08.557 --> 00:10:13.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when he said to the Corinthians 
“bad associations”? 

00:10:13.062 --> 00:10:15.564 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First Corinthians 15:33:

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:18.534 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Do not be misled.

00:10:18.534 --> 00:10:22.672 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Bad associations spoil useful habits.” 

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:26.509 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what made these ones bad association? 

00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:28.811 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s see it in context. 

00:10:28.811 --> 00:10:31.647 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at 1 Corinthians 15:12:

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:36.719 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Now if it is being preached 
that Christ has been raised from the dead,

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:41.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎how is it that some among you say 
there is no resurrection of the dead?”

00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:45.961 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, what was the initial problem 
with these associates? 

00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:49.198 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They did not believe the same way. 

00:10:49.198 --> 00:10:52.635 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Why would that make them bad associations? 

00:10:52.635 --> 00:10:55.504 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Because what an associate believes

00:10:55.504 --> 00:10:58.407 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎will eventually affect our thinking,

00:10:58.407 --> 00:11:02.011 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and our thinking affects our behavior. 

00:11:02.011 --> 00:11:04.680 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Notice how Paul describes this. 

00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:08.150 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Look at 1 Corinthians 15:32. 

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:13.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What good is it to endure 
the rigors of the Christian race for life

00:11:13.155 --> 00:11:16.325 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if there is no resurrection,
no future, no hope? 

00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:18.160 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Verse 32:

00:11:18.527 --> 00:11:22.365 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If like other men, 
I have fought with wild beasts at Ephesus,

00:11:22.365 --> 00:11:24.467 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“of what good is it to me? 

00:11:24.467 --> 00:11:26.736 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“If the dead are not to be raised up,

00:11:26.736 --> 00:11:31.374 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘let us eat and drink, 
for tomorrow we are to die.’”

00:11:31.774 --> 00:11:34.877 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May all of us avoid bad association

00:11:34.877 --> 00:11:39.215 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎whether in person, 
on TV, or on the Internet.

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:42.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What’s a fourth means by which Satan

00:11:42.451 --> 00:11:46.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎attempts to fashion us, 
reshaping our thinking?

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Higher education. 

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:54.563 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Most of us remember 
the January 2015 JW Broadcasting program

00:11:54.563 --> 00:11:58.100 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎hosted by Brother Morris
of the Governing Body. 

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:02.371 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He focused on the value of divine education. 

00:12:02.371 --> 00:12:04.373 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But he also reaffirmed

00:12:04.373 --> 00:12:08.811 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the dangers 
of pursuing higher secular education. 

00:12:08.811 --> 00:12:13.616 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Its whole purpose is for learning
—influencing one’s thinking. 

00:12:13.616 --> 00:12:16.786 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And while a person’s intention
might be just to create

00:12:16.786 --> 00:12:20.322 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a stable base for his secular future,

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:22.458 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎his decision could expose him

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:25.795 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to unscriptural ideas and practices.

00:12:27.062 --> 00:12:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Back to the glass shop. 

00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:32.001 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Recall that another gather of hot glass

00:12:32.001 --> 00:12:34.670 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is added to the end of the stem. 

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:38.140 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The craftsman then rolls the tube 
backward and forward. 

00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.511 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He forms the base for the glass. 

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, we will say no more about this topic

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.717 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎other than what Brother Morris 
has already shared. 

00:12:48.717 --> 00:12:52.521 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You might want to go back 
and review that broadcast. 

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:57.026 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, 
we would like to read 1 Timothy 6:20, 21:

00:12:57.393 --> 00:13:02.231 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Timothy, guard what 
has been entrusted to you

00:13:02.231 --> 00:13:04.500 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“[that’s divine education],

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:08.771 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“turning away from the empty speeches 
that violate what is holy

00:13:08.771 --> 00:13:10.806 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and from the contradictions

00:13:10.806 --> 00:13:13.876 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“of the falsely called ‘knowledge.’ 

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:16.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“By making a show of such knowledge,

00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎some have deviated from the faith.” 

00:13:20.516 --> 00:13:23.486 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Unfortunately, in an effort to make

00:13:23.486 --> 00:13:26.288 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎a stable base for one’s financial future,

00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:29.458 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many “have deviated from the faith.”

00:13:31.327 --> 00:13:33.462 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the visuals of a glassblowing shop,

00:13:33.462 --> 00:13:36.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we observed the skill of the workers involved. 

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And that shop obviously produces

00:13:39.435 --> 00:13:42.104 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎beautiful, useful glass vessels. 

00:13:43.439 --> 00:13:47.943 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan’s glass shop 
is also skilled at shaping one’s thinking. 

00:13:48.711 --> 00:13:51.280 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But what does it produce? 

00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.618 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Instead of a person becoming 
a valuable vessel that Jehovah can use,

00:13:55.618 --> 00:13:59.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Satan is actually mass-producing

00:13:59.722 --> 00:14:03.192 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎worthless vessels that Jehovah cannot use. 

00:14:03.192 --> 00:14:06.929 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What could you do 
with this misshaped creation? 

00:14:06.929 --> 00:14:09.431 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Nothing
—it is useless. 

00:14:10.733 --> 00:14:14.069 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎At the outset, 
Romans 9:22 was quoted. 

00:14:14.069 --> 00:14:17.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those who conform 
to Satan’s system are referred to

00:14:17.773 --> 00:14:21.944 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as “vessels of wrath 
made fit for destruction.”

00:14:25.347 --> 00:14:28.317 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah has paid a high price for us. 

00:14:28.317 --> 00:14:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Gold and glass cannot be compared to it. 

00:14:31.654 --> 00:14:35.591 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎May we make over our minds 
by applying godly wisdom. 

00:14:35.591 --> 00:14:39.628 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Glorify Jehovah 
as a vessel that he can use. 

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:43.999 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First Corinthians 6:20 
concludes this discussion nicely, saying:

00:14:43.999 --> 00:14:47.002 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“For you were bought with a price.

00:14:47.002 --> 00:14:51.407 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎By all means, glorify God in your body.”
