00:00:02.652 --> 00:00:07.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are delighted to welcome one and all

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the June 2022 program

00:00:10.694 --> 00:00:13.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:00:35.552 --> 00:00:36.953 line:10% position:50% align:center
all of the students

00:00:36.953 --> 00:00:39.322 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the previous class of Gilead

00:00:39.322 --> 00:00:41.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
were from the United States.

00:00:41.658 --> 00:00:46.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we were very happy
that the Governing Body approved

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:50.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
for 24 fully vaccinated brothers and sisters

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 13 different lands

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:58.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be invited to the 151st class of Gilead.

00:00:59.576 --> 00:01:03.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
On March 12, 2022,

00:01:03.513 --> 00:01:07.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
this enthusiastic class graduated.

00:01:07.617 --> 00:01:12.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they personally benefit
from the school?

00:01:12.088 --> 00:01:16.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will they use their five months
of Bible training?

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:19.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where will they be assigned?

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:22.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy Part 1

00:01:22.699 --> 00:01:27.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the 151st Gilead graduation program.

00:01:28.738 --> 00:01:30.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, class 151,

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:34.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
you seem excited, and you should be.

00:01:34.144 --> 00:01:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a very special day for you
—one you’ll never forget.

00:01:37.413 --> 00:01:42.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as with the entire course of Gilead,
you’ll never forget.

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:44.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re happy to be with you today.

00:01:44.654 --> 00:01:48.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will all benefit
from the things that are said today

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
at this spiritual program.

00:01:52.028 --> 00:01:57.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even so, we know that although
this will benefit everyone involved,

00:01:57.967 --> 00:02:01.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
the program has been designed
with you in mind.

00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:03.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with every talk given,

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:08.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers have prayerfully considered
what can be said to encourage.

00:02:08.144 --> 00:02:11.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you listen, just be certain
that the brothers have had that in mind.

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:14.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
But all of us listening today will benefit

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:17.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the good things
that will come out in this program.

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:20.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the day is over,
you’ll look back and recall a program

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:24.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
that honored Jehovah
and confirmed his love for you.

00:02:24.327 --> 00:02:27.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again, you’re never going to forget it.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the past five months
of your schooling, you were asked to draw out

00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:34.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
principles from many different
Bible accounts.

00:02:34.537 --> 00:02:37.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you worked hard to do that, didn’t you?

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
You learned new ways to do that,

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:41.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see the Scriptures

00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:46.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
as something that Jehovah wants us
to listen to very carefully

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:49.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then apply its fine points in our lives.

00:02:49.953 --> 00:02:54.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
So those accounts focused
on genuine servants of God

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
who with his help
succeeded in doing His will.

00:02:57.627 --> 00:03:00.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you were doing the same.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
You examined principles for Christian living,

00:03:02.765 --> 00:03:05.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
you examined principles for teaching others,

00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:07.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
you looked at principles

00:03:07.203 --> 00:03:10.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
about how to organize the work, and so forth.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
This graduation program will do the same.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:19.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind, I have a theme
for these brief introductory comments.

00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:20.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it would keep me focused.

00:03:20.717 --> 00:03:22.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s my theme:

00:03:22.752 --> 00:03:26.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You Are Ready to Face the Things Ahead.”

00:03:26.522 --> 00:03:29.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, notice that it’s not a question:
Are you ready?

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:34.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a statement: You are ready
to face the things ahead.

00:03:34.731 --> 00:03:38.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why can we say this
with such confidence?

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we see your faith.

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:44.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see your deep love
for our heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:03:44.807 --> 00:03:46.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his Son.

00:03:46.476 --> 00:03:49.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve trusted in Jehovah,
you have done well,

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:52.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ve made it to graduation day.

00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:55.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know some of you wondered
if you would make it, but you did.

00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:56.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here you are.

00:03:56.753 --> 00:04:01.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re graduating
with the 151st class of Gilead.

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:02.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a delight!

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
You undoubtedly agree more than ever before
with what the apostle Paul wrote

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
 at Philippians 4:13,

00:04:11.868 --> 00:04:16.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he said: “For all things
I have the strength through [who?]

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one who gives me power.”

00:04:19.642 --> 00:04:21.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know who that is.

00:04:21.644 --> 00:04:25.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has surely helped you
during these months

00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:28.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a success of Gilead school.

00:04:28.318 --> 00:04:30.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re very proud of you for that.

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:33.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can be certain that Jehovah
is just delighted to see that

00:04:33.856 --> 00:04:35.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you love him

00:04:35.925 --> 00:04:39.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you went through this course,
you’ve gone through it

00:04:39.595 --> 00:04:42.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that in mind, true?

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:44.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave you what you needed,

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:47.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s a blessing you must never forget.

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:51.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
By remembering it, you will put
that blessing to work for you

00:04:51.741 --> 00:04:54.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever you are in your service to Jehovah

00:04:54.944 --> 00:04:57.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the weeks, months, and years ahead.

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, these things you learn
and that all of us learn now

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
will serve us well forever.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, whenever you face
a task in the future

00:05:07.156 --> 00:05:11.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seems almost too large
for you to tackle or handle,

00:05:11.661 --> 00:05:15.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll remember how Jehovah helped you
in this school.

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:19.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your experience in going through Gilead

00:05:19.702 --> 00:05:23.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
now adds to your extensive experience,

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:26.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
the experience you already had
in serving Jehovah,

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:29.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this just enriches it that much more.

00:05:29.512 --> 00:05:32.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will help you as you face

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:35.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
trials and tests ahead

00:05:35.118 --> 00:05:39.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that you’ll know you can make it through
what you may view as difficult times

00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:41.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah will help you to do it.

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:46.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are growing ever more and more ready
to face the things ahead.

00:05:46.462 --> 00:05:51.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
You already are, but you’ll grow
more and more so, like all of us will,

00:05:51.067 --> 00:05:55.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you reflect on and remember
what Jehovah has done for you,

00:05:55.238 --> 00:05:59.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as helping you
to complete this Bible school course.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an example of things
you must be ready to handle or you may face.

00:06:05.715 --> 00:06:09.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon after your graduation,
you will be off to your assignments.

00:06:09.085 --> 00:06:11.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as you go,

00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:15.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
have in mind Jesus’ words,
where he taught his disciples to pray:

00:06:15.825 --> 00:06:18.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not bring us into temptation,

00:06:18.494 --> 00:06:21.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
but deliver us from the wicked one.”

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:23.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now focus on the words

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“temptation” and “wicked one.”

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:28.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
They go together, don’t they?

00:06:28.805 --> 00:06:30.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Temptation and wicked one.

00:06:30.373 --> 00:06:34.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan, “the wicked one,”
doesn’t like your success here at Gilead.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can be certain that he hates this school

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:41.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the good that it has accomplished
through the years in honoring Jehovah

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:45.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and benefiting His people
and those in the field.

00:06:45.054 --> 00:06:48.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, what temptations
or stumbling blocks

00:06:48.991 --> 00:06:52.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
might Satan try to place before you

00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:54.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
now that you’ve graduated from this school?

00:06:54.997 --> 00:06:57.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here are a few things,
and they are things

00:06:57.533 --> 00:07:00.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
that all of us must face.

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:02.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:07:02.171 --> 00:07:04.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you’re not careful, you might be tempted

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:08.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become self-satisfied
with what you have accomplished.

00:07:08.778 --> 00:07:10.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t ever let that happen to you.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never be self-satisfied.

00:07:12.782 --> 00:07:14.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep setting goals for yourself.

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:18.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strive to please Jehovah
more and more each day

00:07:18.321 --> 00:07:20.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all that you do.

00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:23.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the principles that we draw
from God’s Word

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
that help us to do that.

00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:29.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, here’s a caution:
Your healthy desire to keep setting goals

00:07:29.632 --> 00:07:32.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
must not be allowed
to lead you into the next temptation.

00:07:32.635 --> 00:07:37.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is this:
the temptation to give in to pride.

00:07:37.006 --> 00:07:39.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
That can happen.

00:07:39.008 --> 00:07:43.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can happen to a person
when he or she forgets

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:47.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has truly helped them to succeed

00:07:47.150 --> 00:07:49.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and that is Jehovah.

00:07:49.152 --> 00:07:51.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those who forget about Jehovah may become

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
ambitious and try to outshine others.

00:07:53.489 --> 00:07:58.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must never allow that to happen
to our heart and mind.

00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:00.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must never become like that.

00:08:00.096 --> 00:08:01.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we must fight against pride.

00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:03.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one key way to do this

00:08:03.866 --> 00:08:07.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to remember that in all that you do
—in all that we do—

00:08:07.904 --> 00:08:11.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is always about Jehovah.

00:08:11.507 --> 00:08:13.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we have that focus,

00:08:13.809 --> 00:08:17.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will succeed in doing things his way,
the right way,

00:08:17.813 --> 00:08:20.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what we face in the future.

00:08:20.216 --> 00:08:22.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we reflect on his blessings.

00:08:22.218 --> 00:08:24.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see how he’s strengthened us.

00:08:24.220 --> 00:08:29.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re confident he will continue to do so,
and he will do that for you.

00:08:29.025 --> 00:08:31.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we never forget that he’s in charge.

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:33.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always about Jehovah.

00:08:33.763 --> 00:08:38.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we do everything out of love for him.

00:08:38.367 --> 00:08:40.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that, of course,
leads into love for others,

00:08:40.836 --> 00:08:43.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he loves others.

00:08:43.906 --> 00:08:48.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a person fails to remember
how Jehovah has blessed him or her,

00:08:48.444 --> 00:08:52.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
that person might become big
in their own eyes, like King Saul did.

00:08:52.682 --> 00:08:54.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll recall his example.

00:08:54.684 --> 00:08:56.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did that eventually lead Saul?

00:08:56.686 --> 00:08:59.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
It led him away from Jehovah’s favor
and blessing.

00:08:59.922 --> 00:09:04.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
People like Saul fail to maintain faith.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
They fail to remain humble.

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:11.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about your faith and your humility?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we see those good qualities in you,

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:18.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s why we confidently state
that you’re ready to face the things ahead.

00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:22.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with Jehovah’s blessing,
your faith will help you to conquer

00:09:22.445 --> 00:09:27.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
any temptation that the wicked one,
“the Tempter,” may place before you,

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:29.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your humility will help you

00:09:29.852 --> 00:09:32.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain unbreakable.

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will be able to defeat the Tempter.

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:38.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with resisting temptation,

00:09:38.127 --> 00:09:41.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
your Gilead training will also help you

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
to continue supporting our vital work
for Jehovah’s Kingdom,

00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:47.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
his people, and for those
who will yet listen.

00:09:47.403 --> 00:09:50.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, for all of God’s people,

00:09:50.139 --> 00:09:53.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is the greater purpose
behind any training

00:09:53.276 --> 00:09:56.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we receive from him, right?

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, then, wherever you serve,

00:09:58.147 --> 00:10:00.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
never forget the purpose behind the blessings

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:03.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have experienced in this school.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:06.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust in Jehovah and in his Son
to help you at all times.

00:10:06.489 --> 00:10:10.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use your Gilead training in the branches
and territories where you are going.

00:10:10.926 --> 00:10:15.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind that with God’s help,
the One who gives you power,

00:10:15.364 --> 00:10:18.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are ready to face the things ahead.

00:10:18.467 --> 00:10:22.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we will say a little bit more
about this at the conclusion of the program.

00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:27.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now we’re going to enjoy a series
of encouraging talks that for all of us

00:10:27.443 --> 00:10:30.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
will strengthen our faith,
build up our trust in God,

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:34.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
and highlight his wonderful purpose
that we support.

00:10:35.584 --> 00:10:38.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for the first talk,

00:10:38.921 --> 00:10:42.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have Brother Gerrit Lösch
of the Governing Body.

00:10:42.792 --> 00:10:47.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will speak on the subject
“Cultivate Love That Never Fails.”

00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:53.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to be loved by others?

00:10:53.035 --> 00:10:57.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Naturally, we all want to be loved.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:11:00.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is a basic human need.

00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:03.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Babies thrive on it.
Teenagers thrive on it.

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:05.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Marriage mates thrive on it.

00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:08.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethelites and Gilead students thrive on it.

00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:12.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes us happy to be loved.

00:11:12.455 --> 00:11:14.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about loving others?

00:11:14.657 --> 00:11:16.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is unselfish.

00:11:16.692 --> 00:11:19.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Loving others makes the receivers happy,

00:11:19.695 --> 00:11:23.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it also makes us as givers happy.

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:27.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is the reason why we exist.

00:11:27.536 --> 00:11:31.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created us out of unselfish love

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:33.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
to let us share not only life

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:36.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also the privilege to love him.

00:11:36.912 --> 00:11:41.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not need our love
since he does not depend on anybody else,

00:11:41.617 --> 00:11:44.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he appreciates our love.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:48.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves to be loved by us.

00:11:48.357 --> 00:11:51.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
He created us also with the ability

00:11:51.193 --> 00:11:54.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love others besides him.

00:11:54.029 --> 00:11:56.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to do good to others.

00:11:56.866 --> 00:11:59.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to love them.

00:11:59.935 --> 00:12:02.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since when does love exist?

00:12:02.972 --> 00:12:05.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
It always existed.

00:12:05.775 --> 00:12:08.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had no beginning.

00:12:08.177 --> 00:12:09.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:11.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because “God is love.”

00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:13.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know God had no beginning,

00:12:13.949 --> 00:12:17.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
so God’s love had no beginning.

00:12:18.354 --> 00:12:23.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was no time in the past
when God existed but love did not.

00:12:23.225 --> 00:12:25.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah not only has love,

00:12:25.494 --> 00:12:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he is love personified.

00:12:30.566 --> 00:12:33.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created us in his image.

00:12:33.135 --> 00:12:36.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is why we have this superb privilege

00:12:36.305 --> 00:12:38.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reflect his love.

00:12:39.909 --> 00:12:44.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the world, books, movies, and songs
often deal with love.

00:12:44.513 --> 00:12:46.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what kind of love?

00:12:46.515 --> 00:12:51.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Usually romantic love—love that often fails.

00:12:51.153 --> 00:12:53.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genuine love of God and of neighbor

00:12:53.823 --> 00:12:56.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
is widely lacking today.

00:12:56.759 --> 00:12:59.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
When describing “the last days,”

00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:03.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophecy at 2 Timothy 3:2 has come true

00:13:03.732 --> 00:13:07.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people are often “lovers of themselves.”

00:13:07.937 --> 00:13:11.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me-ism and egotism is widespread.

00:13:12.608 --> 00:13:16.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
One journal carries the title <i>Self.</i>

00:13:16.245 --> 00:13:19.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
People think, ‘First me, then nothing,

00:13:19.849 --> 00:13:23.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then me again,
and then perhaps somebody else.’

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Timothy 3:2, Paul also wrote

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:31.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people would be “lovers of money.”

00:13:31.961 --> 00:13:35.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the same prophecy,
it says that the majority

00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:39.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be “lovers of pleasures
rather than lovers of God.”

00:13:40.636 --> 00:13:43.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
For many, entertainment and sports

00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:47.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
have become the dominant aspect
of their lives.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Furthermore, 1 John 2:15 indicates

00:13:50.446 --> 00:13:54.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is a battle between two loves

00:13:54.016 --> 00:13:58.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
—love of Jehovah and love of the world.

00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
The stronger our love for Jehovah is,

00:14:00.723 --> 00:14:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
the better we will be able to resist
the love of the world.

00:14:06.028 --> 00:14:08.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 22:37,

00:14:08.397 --> 00:14:11.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus encouraged cultivating love for God

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the fullest extent possible.

00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:18.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God

00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:22.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with your whole heart
and with your whole soul

00:14:22.077 --> 00:14:24.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with your whole mind.”

00:14:25.548 --> 00:14:28.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does love for Jehovah grow?

00:14:28.651 --> 00:14:31.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must tend to the good soil of our heart

00:14:31.854 --> 00:14:35.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the seed of Kingdom truth was sown.

00:14:36.358 --> 00:14:39.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does love between two persons grow?

00:14:39.929 --> 00:14:43.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way is by communication.

00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:46.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
We communicate with Jehovah through prayer.

00:14:46.936 --> 00:14:49.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah communicates with us

00:14:49.238 --> 00:14:53.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the Bible and his organization.

00:14:53.275 --> 00:14:56.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we study the Bible and read it daily

00:14:56.512 --> 00:14:58.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as attend the congregation meetings,

00:14:58.948 --> 00:15:02.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love for him will continue to grow.

00:15:03.719 --> 00:15:06.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love needs to grow.

00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:09.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not a matter of how much we know

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:12.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how much we love what we know.

00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:16.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Head knowledge is not enough.

00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:19.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
There needs to be heart knowledge.

00:15:20.603 --> 00:15:23.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing in love is a process.

00:15:23.038 --> 00:15:25.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
A plant grows when it is watered;

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:30.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
love grows if it is watered
with the water of truth.

00:15:30.279 --> 00:15:33.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Philippians 1:9, Paul says:

00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:37.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this is what I continue praying,

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:41.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your love may abound yet more and more.”

00:15:43.325 --> 00:15:45.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love grows gradually.

00:15:45.661 --> 00:15:48.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not enough to have a little love;

00:15:48.297 --> 00:15:51.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
we should abound in love.

00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:53.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sets the example.

00:15:53.502 --> 00:15:58.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
He expressed his love
by providing the ransom.

00:15:58.007 --> 00:16:00.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Matthew chapter 18,

00:16:00.442 --> 00:16:05.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus compares Jehovah with a king
who was willing to forgive a debt

00:16:05.147 --> 00:16:08.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 60 million denarii,

00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:11.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 10,000 silver talents.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
This certainly impresses his love for us.

00:16:16.025 --> 00:16:18.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus expressed his love by being willing

00:16:18.627 --> 00:16:21.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
to die for our sins.

00:16:21.163 --> 00:16:23.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
This stirs our love in return.

00:16:23.532 --> 00:16:27.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more one has been forgiven,
the more one will love.

00:16:28.871 --> 00:16:33.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
But love is not dependent
on having one’s sins forgiven.

00:16:33.142 --> 00:16:36.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus loved Jehovah so much

00:16:36.145 --> 00:16:41.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
but had not a single sin
that needed to be forgiven.

00:16:41.016 --> 00:16:45.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he loved Jehovah, and he loved us.

00:16:45.521 --> 00:16:50.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
The night before he died,
he said at John 14:31:

00:16:50.259 --> 00:16:53.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I love the Father.”

00:16:53.095 --> 00:16:56.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we not (all of us) feel the same?

00:16:57.332 --> 00:17:02.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we demonstrate
our love of God in return?

00:17:03.605 --> 00:17:07.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do so by serving Jehovah
with all our heart.

00:17:07.976 --> 00:17:10.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes preaching and teaching.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:13.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
True or false?

00:17:13.882 --> 00:17:17.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
The most important reason
for preaching and teaching is

00:17:17.186 --> 00:17:19.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
love of neighbor.

00:17:19.388 --> 00:17:23.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sounds good, but it is wrong.

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:25.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
The most important motive for preaching

00:17:25.294 --> 00:17:28.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
is, first of all, love for Jehovah.

00:17:28.731 --> 00:17:30.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the most important objective

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:34.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to praise Jehovah.

00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:39.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to glorify him and to support
the vindication of his sovereignty.

00:17:40.576 --> 00:17:43.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love of neighbor comes second.

00:17:43.779 --> 00:17:46.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we also need to show love
to our brothers.

00:17:46.482 --> 00:17:48.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
In one congregation, several sisters

00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:51.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
took daily turns to prepare a hot meal

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a quadriplegic brother.

00:17:55.124 --> 00:17:59.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
This shows that our love
extends beyond preaching.

00:17:59.561 --> 00:18:02.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is like with the parable of the Samaritan

00:18:02.931 --> 00:18:07.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
who cared for the man
who was assaulted and hurt by robbers.

00:18:07.302 --> 00:18:11.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Samaritan did not preach to the man
who fell among the robbers.

00:18:11.373 --> 00:18:14.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just showed unselfish love to him.

00:18:16.044 --> 00:18:18.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus emphasized that our neighborly love

00:18:18.781 --> 00:18:22.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
should include even enemies.

00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:24.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 5:44, he said:

00:18:26.288 --> 00:18:29.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I say to you: Continue to love your enemies

00:18:29.758 --> 00:18:32.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to pray for those persecuting you.”

00:18:34.663 --> 00:18:36.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our love will be perfect

00:18:36.698 --> 00:18:39.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we love even our enemies.

00:18:39.701 --> 00:18:42.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives sunshine and rain

00:18:42.037 --> 00:18:44.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
even to wicked opposers.

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:49.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
One publisher went to a hospital
to visit an opposing husband.

00:18:49.444 --> 00:18:54.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man appreciated this kind gesture
very much.

00:18:55.784 --> 00:18:58.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of what Jesus has endured.

00:18:58.187 --> 00:19:02.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was hated without cause,
persecuted, reviled, and murdered.

00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:06.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help people to develop their appreciation

00:19:06.361 --> 00:19:09.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what Jesus did for us.

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:13.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show interested ones
that because of the ransom,

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:16.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah forgives us our sins

00:19:16.305 --> 00:19:19.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
and opens the way to everlasting life.

00:19:20.709 --> 00:19:24.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you talk about the ransom,
don’t do it just in a legalistic way

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
by saying: “See, like on scales,

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:31.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on one side was Adam
and on the other side was Jesus.

00:19:31.887 --> 00:19:34.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God’s justice required
that by giving his life,

00:19:34.756 --> 00:19:37.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus restored what Adam had lost.”

00:19:38.293 --> 00:19:41.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, make the student meditate

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:45.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
and develop heart appreciation and love
for what Jesus did.

00:19:45.667 --> 00:19:50.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Review with a student what Jesus
went through prior to his execution.

00:19:50.639 --> 00:19:54.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help him picture in his mind
how Jesus was flogged,

00:19:54.509 --> 00:19:57.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
producing quivering ribbons
of bleeding flesh.

00:19:59.047 --> 00:20:03.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help the student sense how Jesus was mocked.

00:20:03.151 --> 00:20:05.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
After his tortured beating,

00:20:05.988 --> 00:20:08.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
soldiers said to him mockingly:

00:20:08.757 --> 00:20:11.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Good day, you King of the Jews!”

00:20:12.728 --> 00:20:16.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, they spit on him
and slapped him in the face.

00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:22.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remind the student
how the soldiers later pounded large nails

00:20:22.437 --> 00:20:25.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
into his hands and into his feet.

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the stake swung upright,
the pain was excruciating,

00:20:29.778 --> 00:20:34.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the weight of the body
tore all the nail wounds.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:38.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, rather than threaten,
Jesus prayed for the Roman soldiers:

00:20:38.987 --> 00:20:43.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Father, forgive them,
for they do not know what they are doing.”

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditating on what Jesus did for us,

00:20:48.397 --> 00:20:52.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
does this not greatly deepen
our love for him?

00:20:53.535 --> 00:20:56.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 3:19, Paul wrote:

00:20:56.705 --> 00:21:01.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The love of the Christ
. . . surpasses knowledge.”

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:06.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not the love for the Christ
but the love that Jesus displayed

00:21:06.081 --> 00:21:08.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
that surpasses head knowledge

00:21:08.216 --> 00:21:12.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strikes a wonderful chord
in our figurative heart.

00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:17.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ course stimulates a response in us.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:20.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we think about what Christ
has done for us,

00:21:20.162 --> 00:21:22.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love for him deepens.

00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:26.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, 2 Corinthians 5:14 says:

00:21:26.101 --> 00:21:30.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the love the Christ has compels us.”

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:35.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
After mentioning gifts of the spirit,
such as healing and speaking in tongues,

00:21:35.911 --> 00:21:40.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul explained at 1 Corinthians 12:31:

00:21:40.115 --> 00:21:44.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet I will show you a surpassing way.”

00:21:44.653 --> 00:21:46.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is this “way”?

00:21:46.788 --> 00:21:50.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way of love.

00:21:50.158 --> 00:21:52.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way is it surpassing?

00:21:52.995 --> 00:21:55.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the sense that the gifts of the spirit,

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:59.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
including prophesying,
would be “done away with.”

00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:02.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
But love would always be there.

00:22:02.871 --> 00:22:04.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is eternal.

00:22:04.906 --> 00:22:08.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
His love will never fail, never end,

00:22:08.377 --> 00:22:13.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
but will continue forever and ever and ever.

00:22:14.349 --> 00:22:17.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, Paul wrote: “There remain

00:22:17.219 --> 00:22:20.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“faith, hope, love, these three;

00:22:20.422 --> 00:22:24.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the greatest of these is love.”

00:22:24.526 --> 00:22:28.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also wrote: “Love never fails.”

00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:31.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love “endures all things.”

00:22:31.633 --> 00:22:34.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many brothers suffered a lot
during World War II

00:22:34.503 --> 00:22:37.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also today in Russia and other countries.

00:22:37.439 --> 00:22:41.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, there are a number of governments
in the world that suppress the truth.

00:22:42.811 --> 00:22:46.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we live in the time of the end,
this is not surprising to us.

00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:51.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will get worse as the great tribulation
comes closer.

00:22:51.186 --> 00:22:55.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
World conditions are also getting worse
in many parts of the world,

00:22:55.123 --> 00:22:59.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
and COVID has claimed many human victims.

00:22:59.394 --> 00:23:02.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we Witnesses keep enduring

00:23:02.464 --> 00:23:05.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
by pursuing the surpassing way of love

00:23:05.967 --> 00:23:07.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
that never fails.

00:23:07.769 --> 00:23:10.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
We shall not only live forever

00:23:10.172 --> 00:23:14.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also love forever and be loved forever.

00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:25.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you very much, Brother Lösch,

00:23:25.987 --> 00:23:30.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
for reminding us of how great
Jehovah’s love is for us

00:23:30.459 --> 00:23:32.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we in turn must show

00:23:32.694 --> 00:23:36.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
heartfelt, wholehearted love
for Jehovah and others.

00:23:36.631 --> 00:23:39.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our next talk on the program will be given

00:23:39.568 --> 00:23:44.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Brother Gajus Glockentin,
a helper to the Publishing Committee.

00:23:44.506 --> 00:23:48.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the theme for his talk is
“How Often Will You Go to Shiloh?”

00:23:51.746 --> 00:23:54.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were speechless when they heard

00:23:54.683 --> 00:23:58.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
she would leave home
and join full-time service.

00:23:58.653 --> 00:24:02.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of pursuing their common goals,
dreams, and hopes,

00:24:02.824 --> 00:24:05.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
she would do whatever she was told to do.

00:24:05.927 --> 00:24:07.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a sacrifice!

00:24:07.929 --> 00:24:10.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were so proud of her.

00:24:10.098 --> 00:24:14.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they started thinking
about what to do in order to support her.

00:24:14.836 --> 00:24:17.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whom are we talking about?

00:24:17.672 --> 00:24:21.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us open to Judges 11,

00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:24.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s find out who they were

00:24:24.513 --> 00:24:27.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what they did.

00:24:27.482 --> 00:24:31.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear soon-to-be graduates, what they did

00:24:31.753 --> 00:24:33.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
is something that will help you

00:24:33.989 --> 00:24:36.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
to succeed in your assignment.

00:24:36.958 --> 00:24:41.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read, please, Judges 11:40:

00:24:41.496 --> 00:24:43.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From year to year,

00:24:43.698 --> 00:24:46.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the young women of Israel

00:24:46.835 --> 00:24:49.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
“would go to give commendation

00:24:49.905 --> 00:24:52.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite

00:24:52.474 --> 00:24:54.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
four days in the year.”

00:24:55.944 --> 00:24:58.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young women of Israel

00:24:58.313 --> 00:25:01.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
went to the sanctuary in Shiloh
in order to give

00:25:01.883 --> 00:25:05.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
commendation and praise
to the daughter of Jephthah.

00:25:05.453 --> 00:25:09.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Commendation strengthened
this full-time servant of Jehovah.

00:25:09.424 --> 00:25:12.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this not what you want to do too?

00:25:12.727 --> 00:25:16.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s why we have the question for you,

00:25:16.064 --> 00:25:20.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
How often will you “go to Shiloh”?

00:25:20.902 --> 00:25:24.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you strengthen others
and stabilize the organization

00:25:24.706 --> 00:25:28.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
by regularly commending and praising others?

00:25:29.678 --> 00:25:32.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us, therefore, ask
the following questions:

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:37.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
What type of commendation
is effective in strengthening others?

00:25:37.085 --> 00:25:40.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you imitate
the young women of Israel?

00:25:40.655 --> 00:25:45.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why do you want to give
commendation regularly?

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start with the first question,

00:25:47.696 --> 00:25:51.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
What type of commendation is effective
in strengthening others?

00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:54.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
And let us, please, look at the example
that Jesus set

00:25:54.669 --> 00:25:57.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we turn to Mark chapter 5.

00:25:57.539 --> 00:25:59.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here he commends

00:25:59.874 --> 00:26:04.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
the frightened, sick woman
who touched his outer garment.

00:26:04.112 --> 00:26:08.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read Mark 5:34,

00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:11.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
please watch out for five elements

00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:15.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
of effective commendation

00:26:15.023 --> 00:26:18.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark 5:34:

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:22.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to her:

00:26:22.063 --> 00:26:26.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Daughter, your faith has made you well.

00:26:26.835 --> 00:26:31.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go in peace, and be healed
from your grievous sickness.’”

00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note
what made this commendation effective?

00:26:36.678 --> 00:26:40.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, effective commendation is specific.

00:26:40.882 --> 00:26:43.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus commended the woman for what she did.

00:26:43.952 --> 00:26:47.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her faith moved her to act.

00:26:47.722 --> 00:26:51.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Effective commendation is sincere.

00:26:51.326 --> 00:26:53.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
The woman’s faith was real

00:26:53.495 --> 00:26:56.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and outstanding.

00:26:56.398 --> 00:27:00.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that Jesus
did not use the opportunity

00:27:00.001 --> 00:27:03.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
to counsel her for violating the Law?

00:27:03.271 --> 00:27:07.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
This might have made
his commendation sound insincere.

00:27:08.677 --> 00:27:11.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third, effective commendation is personal.

00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:15.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus used the expression “daughter.”

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:19.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
That expression emphasized
his tender concern for her.

00:27:21.323 --> 00:27:24.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fourth, effective commendation
is more than words.

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:27.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus acknowledged the needs of the woman

00:27:27.462 --> 00:27:29.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and followed up with deeds.

00:27:29.464 --> 00:27:31.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
He healed her.

00:27:31.299 --> 00:27:33.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
And fifth,

00:27:33.134 --> 00:27:37.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
effective commendation is unselfish.

00:27:37.205 --> 00:27:42.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus did not commend the woman
in order to make himself look good,

00:27:42.143 --> 00:27:44.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he was concerned about her

00:27:44.713 --> 00:27:47.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wanted to make her feel good.

00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:49.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can you do the same?

00:27:49.984 --> 00:27:52.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back to Judges 11,

00:27:52.454 --> 00:27:54.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s look again at verse 40.

00:27:54.989 --> 00:27:59.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is Judges 11:40,
and let’s answer the second question,

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you imitate
the young women of Israel?

00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:05.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the verse started here
in verse 40 by saying

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from year to year,”

00:28:07.268 --> 00:28:11.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
so this means regularly,

00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
repeatedly.

00:28:13.675 --> 00:28:17.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young women would praise
the same person

00:28:17.512 --> 00:28:19.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
again and again.

00:28:20.548 --> 00:28:24.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
In your assignment as you work with others
in Bethel, in the ministry,

00:28:24.552 --> 00:28:26.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
or watch them in your congregation,

00:28:26.588 --> 00:28:30.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you repeatedly praise them?

00:28:30.592 --> 00:28:33.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, could you praise them
for their zeal,

00:28:33.995 --> 00:28:36.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
their fine efforts,

00:28:36.164 --> 00:28:38.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
or for their acts of love?

00:28:38.299 --> 00:28:41.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you send
an upbuilding text message saying

00:28:41.369 --> 00:28:45.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Great job,” “Well done,”
“Thumbs up,” “Loved it,”

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:49.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe along with a brief comment?

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:53.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
These messages do not require
a lot of effort and time,

00:28:53.748 --> 00:28:56.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they can go a long way.

00:28:56.384 --> 00:28:59.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
One time is not enough.

00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do it again and again.

00:29:00.889 --> 00:29:03.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry that the person
could get a big head.

00:29:03.391 --> 00:29:05.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible,

00:29:05.393 --> 00:29:08.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah praised and commended

00:29:08.563 --> 00:29:12.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
the persons whom he loved repeatedly.

00:29:12.267 --> 00:29:16.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Commending others again and again
is a good thing.

00:29:18.173 --> 00:29:20.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the verse continues here, saying:

00:29:20.975 --> 00:29:23.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The young women of Israel
would go to give commendation

00:29:23.878 --> 00:29:26.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite

00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:28.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
four days in the year.”

00:29:30.051 --> 00:29:32.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being away from their family obligations

00:29:32.887 --> 00:29:35.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
must have been a sacrifice.

00:29:35.557 --> 00:29:38.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
Somebody else must have taken over
their usual work.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to travel to Shiloh

00:29:41.963 --> 00:29:45.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they may also have brought a gift.

00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:48.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, could this serve as a reminder

00:29:48.236 --> 00:29:52.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
that giving commendation
might sometimes require

00:29:52.407 --> 00:29:56.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
a little bit more time and effort
and can come at a personal cost?

00:29:56.778 --> 00:29:58.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:29:58.179 --> 00:30:02.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Calling somebody or visiting him

00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:05.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires time and effort.

00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:09.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spending time with your brother and sister
honors them.

00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:14.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being out with them in the ministry,
working together on a project,

00:30:14.529 --> 00:30:18.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
or asking them for advice

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:22.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
really makes them feel good
and can be a powerful commendation.

00:30:22.604 --> 00:30:26.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s worth all it costs.

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:29.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Timing is important too.

00:30:29.911 --> 00:30:32.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 15:23 states:

00:30:32.914 --> 00:30:34.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A word spoken

00:30:34.949 --> 00:30:38.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the right time—how good it is!”

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:41.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is “the right time”
for commendation?

00:30:41.623 --> 00:30:44.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
The verses leading up
to our theme scripture here

00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:46.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned that Jephthah’s daughter

00:30:46.828 --> 00:30:50.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
right away got much needed support.

00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:54.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
So generally speaking,
commendation is of greatest value

00:30:54.302 --> 00:30:59.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it’s given
as soon as the opportunity comes up,

00:30:59.073 --> 00:31:02.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if it’s initially just a brief comment.

00:31:02.677 --> 00:31:06.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sooner somebody receives
positive feedback,

00:31:06.814 --> 00:31:10.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
the quicker feelings of insecurity or doubts
will vanish

00:31:10.418 --> 00:31:14.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sooner the other person
will be happy and feel good.

00:31:14.756 --> 00:31:18.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please do not wait too long,

00:31:18.126 --> 00:31:20.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
but act right away.

00:31:21.229 --> 00:31:24.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this leads us
to our third and final question,

00:31:24.032 --> 00:31:28.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you want to give
commendation regularly?

00:31:28.102 --> 00:31:30.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you go to your assignments,

00:31:30.605 --> 00:31:35.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will be surrounded
by many “daughters of Jephthah”

00:31:35.143 --> 00:31:38.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
—faithful, full-time servants of Jehovah

00:31:38.646 --> 00:31:41.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made sacrifices to serve.

00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:46.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
This auditorium is full of them,
and you are among them.

00:31:47.822 --> 00:31:50.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will meet

00:31:50.258 --> 00:31:53.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers and sisters in the congregation,

00:31:53.127 --> 00:31:58.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some of them are insecure—worried.

00:31:58.132 --> 00:32:02.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes they doubt
that they are worth anything.

00:32:02.503 --> 00:32:06.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are giving their very best
to stay faithful despite challenges

00:32:06.574 --> 00:32:08.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
—fighting with their own imperfection,

00:32:08.409 --> 00:32:10.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with the results
of their own mistakes,

00:32:10.812 --> 00:32:13.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are sometimes discouraged

00:32:13.848 --> 00:32:16.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of setbacks.

00:32:16.618 --> 00:32:20.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
They need commendation.

00:32:20.088 --> 00:32:23.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all need commendation

00:32:23.157 --> 00:32:26.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
because commendation
enhances a person’s self-esteem,

00:32:26.694 --> 00:32:29.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
it builds confidence and motivates to action,

00:32:29.497 --> 00:32:32.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
it reinforces our desire

00:32:32.266 --> 00:32:34.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do good things,

00:32:34.869 --> 00:32:38.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it encourages us
to keep on doing our very best.

00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:42.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please “go to Shiloh” as often as possible.

00:32:43.745 --> 00:32:46.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there’s another important aspect.

00:32:48.082 --> 00:32:50.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reality is

00:32:50.251 --> 00:32:53.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when you work closely
with brothers and sisters,

00:32:53.087 --> 00:32:57.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
you see their flaws and mistakes.

00:32:57.825 --> 00:32:59.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are you going to do?

00:32:59.927 --> 00:33:02.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you ignore that person?

00:33:02.664 --> 00:33:05.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or will you try to imitate Jehovah,

00:33:05.633 --> 00:33:08.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is searching for the good in us?

00:33:08.670 --> 00:33:12.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make it a habit to search for the good,

00:33:12.206 --> 00:33:15.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then give voice to the positive.

00:33:15.677 --> 00:33:19.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what happens to us

00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we are doing it that way?

00:33:22.550 --> 00:33:25.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can change us.

00:33:25.253 --> 00:33:29.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can change us from being a complainer

00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:32.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
to being a commender.

00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
A commender focuses on the good in others.

00:33:36.531 --> 00:33:38.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees others

00:33:38.199 --> 00:33:41.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s eyes.

00:33:43.237 --> 00:33:46.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
A commender is very happy
because he sees

00:33:46.841 --> 00:33:49.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the beauty around him.

00:33:50.712 --> 00:33:53.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you gain a reputation

00:33:53.047 --> 00:33:56.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
for commending rather than complaining,

00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:59.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will succeed in your assignment

00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:02.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
because others will love to work with you.

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:06.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear soon-to-be graduates
of the 151st class of Gilead,

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:10.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
please make commending and praising others

00:34:10.698 --> 00:34:15.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
part of your personality
—something that comes naturally.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:19.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how often will you “go to Shiloh”?

00:34:19.207 --> 00:34:22.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please “go to Shiloh” as often as possible.

00:34:27.815 --> 00:34:30.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you very much,
Brother Glockentin.

00:34:30.551 --> 00:34:35.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was such a nice follow-up
to Brother Lösch’s talk on love.

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:39.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you really helped us,
all of us brothers and sisters,

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remember the need to encourage

00:34:41.496 --> 00:34:45.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and repeatedly commend others.

00:34:45.032 --> 00:34:47.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this next subject

00:34:47.301 --> 00:34:50.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
seems to follow right along too so nicely:

00:34:50.404 --> 00:34:52.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does Jehovah Recognize You?”

00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it will be delivered
by Brother Luther Georges,

00:34:56.144 --> 00:34:58.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the U.S. Branch Committee.

00:34:59.881 --> 00:35:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you feel when you
have exerted yourself in some way

00:35:04.152 --> 00:35:08.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
and someone you deeply respect says to you,

00:35:08.122 --> 00:35:10.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well done”?

00:35:10.158 --> 00:35:12.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you feel assured that your efforts

00:35:12.827 --> 00:35:16.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
were recognized and appreciated?

00:35:16.364 --> 00:35:19.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, when you dear brothers and sisters

00:35:19.567 --> 00:35:21.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the 151st class of Gilead

00:35:21.736 --> 00:35:24.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
arrive at your assignments
and you exert yourself

00:35:24.806 --> 00:35:26.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish the work you’ve been given

00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:29.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give of yourself
to encourage and help others,

00:35:29.844 --> 00:35:34.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
suppose you don’t always receive

00:35:34.315 --> 00:35:38.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
an audible “well done” from others.

00:35:38.152 --> 00:35:40.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
How will you feel?

00:35:40.655 --> 00:35:45.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that mean that your efforts
were not appreciated and recognized?

00:35:45.593 --> 00:35:47.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
To answer those questions,
we are going to consider:

00:35:47.995 --> 00:35:50.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
first, what Jesus had to say on the subject;

00:35:50.898 --> 00:35:54.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
second, what we can learn
from some Bible examples;

00:35:54.202 --> 00:35:58.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and third, what this means
for you personally.

00:35:58.606 --> 00:36:02.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the desire to receive recognition
from humans is normal,

00:36:02.977 --> 00:36:07.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus helps us to have a balanced view
in Matthew chapter 6.

00:36:07.882 --> 00:36:11.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please turn to Matthew chapter 6,
and note verse 3

00:36:11.786 --> 00:36:13.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 6:3:

00:36:13.921 --> 00:36:16.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But you, when making gifts of mercy,

00:36:16.624 --> 00:36:21.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not let your left hand know
what your right hand is doing.”

00:36:21.395 --> 00:36:23.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what did Jesus mean?

00:36:23.397 --> 00:36:27.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, these “gifts of mercy”
were really donations for needy ones.

00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:32.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with these words,
Jesus was exhorting his disciples

00:36:32.306 --> 00:36:34.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to imitate

00:36:34.442 --> 00:36:37.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
the insincere religious leaders of his day

00:36:37.411 --> 00:36:39.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
who publicized their gifts of mercy

00:36:39.914 --> 00:36:42.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to be recognized by humans.

00:36:42.683 --> 00:36:47.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what would be the result
of heeding Jesus words here in verse 3?

00:36:47.388 --> 00:36:50.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus explains in verse 4.

00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:55.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “So that your gifts of mercy
may be in secret.”

00:36:55.162 --> 00:36:58.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for a moment,
think of the gifts of mercy

00:36:58.232 --> 00:37:01.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the kindnesses
and the theocratic assignments

00:37:01.135 --> 00:37:04.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you have performed in secret.

00:37:04.038 --> 00:37:07.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, likely you’ve
many times telephoned or visited

00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:10.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
an ailing brother or sister
just to reassure them

00:37:10.645 --> 00:37:13.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your love and your concern,

00:37:13.014 --> 00:37:15.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ve even prayed with them,

00:37:15.016 --> 00:37:18.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps you spent considerable time

00:37:18.452 --> 00:37:22.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
being a spiritual mentor
to a Christian youth,

00:37:22.523 --> 00:37:25.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you may have given generously of yourself

00:37:25.026 --> 00:37:28.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage and provide practical assistance

00:37:28.362 --> 00:37:31.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a distressed brother or sister

00:37:31.032 --> 00:37:34.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all of this you did “in secret.”

00:37:34.735 --> 00:37:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jesus said that someone
that you deeply respect did take note.

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:44.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look there at Matthew 6:4.

00:37:44.745 --> 00:37:47.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
He stated in the <i>B </i> part:

00:37:47.348 --> 00:37:51.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your Father who looks on in secret.”

00:37:51.485 --> 00:37:54.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point is that Jehovah,
who resides in the heavens,

00:37:54.789 --> 00:37:57.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
is invisible to mankind,

00:37:57.458 --> 00:38:01.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he remains in secret
as far as humans are concerned.

00:38:01.929 --> 00:38:04.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
But your good deeds

00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:09.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
are recognized with approval by Jehovah.

00:38:09.203 --> 00:38:12.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how can we be sure of that?

00:38:12.106 --> 00:38:14.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are many Bible examples

00:38:14.308 --> 00:38:17.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
of faithful men and women, young and old,

00:38:17.244 --> 00:38:20.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
whose good deeds and heartfelt devotion

00:38:20.614 --> 00:38:23.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
were recognized with approval by Jehovah.

00:38:23.451 --> 00:38:26.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
One example is Obadiah, the household steward

00:38:26.921 --> 00:38:28.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
of wicked King Ahab.

00:38:28.923 --> 00:38:31.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Kings chapter 18 explains

00:38:31.492 --> 00:38:35.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he discreetly, secretly,
and cautiously hid

00:38:35.296 --> 00:38:37.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
100 of Jehovah’s prophets

00:38:37.965 --> 00:38:41.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they would not be killed
by wicked Jezebel.

00:38:41.235 --> 00:38:46.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as illustrated here,
Obadiah supplied them with bread and water

00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:48.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
in groups of 50 in caves

00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:51.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
without being observed by others.

00:38:51.779 --> 00:38:56.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we know that Jehovah in secret
recognized with approval

00:38:56.317 --> 00:39:00.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
this faithful, generous, compassionate man?

00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:05.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we know because his courageous acts
are recorded in the Bible

00:39:05.059 --> 00:39:07.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
for generations of people to read about.

00:39:08.929 --> 00:39:13.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example is the young,
nameless Israelite girl

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in 2 Kings chapter 5.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:21.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was taken away
from her God-fearing family by the Syrians.

00:39:21.575 --> 00:39:24.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as can be seen in this picture,

00:39:24.545 --> 00:39:28.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
although surrounded by false worshippers,

00:39:28.015 --> 00:39:31.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
she courageously told Naaman’s wife

00:39:31.085 --> 00:39:33.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s prophet Elisha.

00:39:33.721 --> 00:39:38.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
That led to Naaman’s miraculous healing
of leprosy,

00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:42.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
it led to Naaman’s becoming
a worshipper of Jehovah,

00:39:42.129 --> 00:39:45.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it certainly contributed
to Jehovah’s praise.

00:39:47.101 --> 00:39:50.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know the name of that little girl
—do we?—

00:39:50.504 --> 00:39:53.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah does, who in secret

00:39:53.107 --> 00:39:55.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
looked favorably on that young girl.

00:39:56.444 --> 00:40:00.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
So these two examples and many others
in the Scriptures assure you

00:40:00.347 --> 00:40:05.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your good deeds are noted by Jehovah.

00:40:07.221 --> 00:40:11.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please note, though, that Jehovah does more

00:40:11.158 --> 00:40:14.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
than just look on in secret.

00:40:14.695 --> 00:40:19.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look again, please, at Matthew 6:4.

00:40:20.201 --> 00:40:24.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>B</i>  part read in its entirety says:

00:40:24.105 --> 00:40:27.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then your Father who looks on in secret

00:40:27.842 --> 00:40:29.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
will repay you.”

00:40:29.844 --> 00:40:33.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, Jehovah repays us in unexpected ways

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
—in ways that are better and more meaningful

00:40:36.584 --> 00:40:39.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
than humans could ever give us

00:40:39.753 --> 00:40:42.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the way of recognition.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does Jehovah repay us?

00:40:45.993 --> 00:40:48.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
While there are many ways,

00:40:48.262 --> 00:40:51.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to focus
just on three significant ones.

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:55.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way is mentioned at Matthew 5:7

00:40:55.803 --> 00:40:57.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Matthew 5:7.

00:40:57.404 --> 00:41:02.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “Happy are the merciful,
since they will be shown mercy.”

00:41:02.243 --> 00:41:04.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by our being kind and merciful,

00:41:04.879 --> 00:41:09.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah mercifully forgives us
and allows us to enjoy

00:41:09.884 --> 00:41:13.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
a warm, personal relationship with him.

00:41:13.387 --> 00:41:16.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second way he repays us is mentioned

00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:20.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Mark 10:29, 30.

00:41:20.127 --> 00:41:24.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
There Jesus promised
that we would receive “100 times more”

00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:27.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
than anything we sacrifice to serve Jehovah.

00:41:27.568 --> 00:41:32.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one resulting, tangible reward
that Jehovah provides

00:41:32.106 --> 00:41:36.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
is our ever-expanding,
loving spiritual family.

00:41:36.477 --> 00:41:39.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
A third way he repays us
is by means of his promise

00:41:39.446 --> 00:41:44.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the priceless reward
of everlasting life in God’s new world.

00:41:44.218 --> 00:41:47.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
And regarding righteous ones

00:41:47.288 --> 00:41:50.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
who perform good deeds
but fall asleep in death

00:41:50.491 --> 00:41:52.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the end of this system,

00:41:52.560 --> 00:41:56.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus at Luke 14:14 gave the assurance

00:41:56.697 --> 00:41:59.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they will be repaid in the resurrection.

00:41:59.466 --> 00:42:02.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then they will see the full effect

00:42:02.102 --> 00:42:05.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s recognition and blessing

00:42:05.272 --> 00:42:07.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their good deeds.

00:42:09.643 --> 00:42:13.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to your gifts of mercy

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:15.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your new assignments,

00:42:15.583 --> 00:42:19.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
your heartfelt devotion will be reflected

00:42:19.853 --> 00:42:23.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you, with Jehovah’s help,

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:27.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
face and successfully endure
various challenges

00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:31.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
—many of which
others will know nothing about.

00:42:31.799 --> 00:42:35.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even though
you may not receive recognition

00:42:35.135 --> 00:42:38.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a complimentary “well done” from others

00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:41.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your good deeds, your kindnesses,

00:42:41.809 --> 00:42:44.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
your sacrifices, and your endurance,

00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:46.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
please remain confident

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:49.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you will be recognized with approval

00:42:49.617 --> 00:42:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a loving Father, Jehovah.

00:42:52.086 --> 00:42:54.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as Jesus promised:

00:42:54.088 --> 00:42:57.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[Jehovah] who looks on in secret

00:42:57.524 --> 00:42:59.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
will repay you.”

00:43:09.403 --> 00:43:12.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Georges,
for highlighting

00:43:12.373 --> 00:43:14.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
that no matter what happens around us,

00:43:14.908 --> 00:43:19.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sees and treasures
the good that we try so hard to do.

00:43:20.614 --> 00:43:23.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, we have here Brother Richard Chilton,

00:43:23.951 --> 00:43:25.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the Gilead School instructors,

00:43:25.953 --> 00:43:29.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will speak on the subject
“‘Who Will Rise Up for Me?’”

00:43:35.229 --> 00:43:38.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to start
by telling you an experience

00:43:38.265 --> 00:43:41.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a brother at Patterson Bethel.

00:43:41.969 --> 00:43:44.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had recently lost a loved one

00:43:44.438 --> 00:43:46.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a parent, in fact—

00:43:46.507 --> 00:43:49.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a horrible accident.

00:43:49.043 --> 00:43:52.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he desperately needed
to talk with someone

00:43:52.112 --> 00:43:55.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what he was going through
and how he was feeling.

00:43:56.517 --> 00:44:00.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was, in a word, unraveling,
and he needed help.

00:44:02.189 --> 00:44:07.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he called a close friend of his
at Wallkill Bethel

00:44:07.194 --> 00:44:11.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, unfortunately,
the brother said that at that time

00:44:11.265 --> 00:44:13.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was unable to talk.

00:44:14.568 --> 00:44:19.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever found yourself
in a similar situation

00:44:19.273 --> 00:44:22.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that is, feeling like you’re drowning

00:44:22.443 --> 00:44:24.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in need of assistance?

00:44:24.945 --> 00:44:27.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist did.

00:44:27.314 --> 00:44:31.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read with me his words
in the 94th Psalm

00:44:31.118 --> 00:44:33.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note his question.

00:44:34.755 --> 00:44:39.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Psalm 94:16.

00:44:39.326 --> 00:44:42.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist asked in part:

00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:46.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who will rise up for me?”

00:44:48.369 --> 00:44:52.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who will rise up for me?”

00:44:53.807 --> 00:44:56.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
He goes on to answer his own question

00:44:56.577 --> 00:44:59.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verses 17 and 19.

00:44:59.313 --> 00:45:02.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “If Jehovah had not been my helper,

00:45:02.716 --> 00:45:06.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I would soon have perished. . . .

00:45:06.153 --> 00:45:08.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:45:08.722 --> 00:45:13.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
you [Jehovah, you]
comforted and soothed me.”

00:45:14.294 --> 00:45:18.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when you and I send up
such heartfelt prayers to Jehovah,

00:45:18.699 --> 00:45:21.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does he rise up for us?

00:45:21.735 --> 00:45:25.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can we imitate him

00:45:25.105 --> 00:45:28.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
by rising up in behalf of others?

00:45:29.543 --> 00:45:33.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go back in time
and consider an example.

00:45:33.614 --> 00:45:37.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the days of Israel’s judges,

00:45:37.117 --> 00:45:42.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
there lived a wealthy landowner named Boaz.

00:45:42.122 --> 00:45:44.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
In obedience to Jehovah’s Law,

00:45:44.925 --> 00:45:47.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
he made sure that in his fields

00:45:47.761 --> 00:45:52.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
gleanings were left
for the afflicted and poor.

00:45:52.433 --> 00:45:54.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,

00:45:54.435 --> 00:45:58.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
he observes a woman working in his fields

00:45:58.138 --> 00:46:00.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he does not recognize.

00:46:00.407 --> 00:46:05.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
And soon he learns
that she is the foreigner Ruth,

00:46:05.212 --> 00:46:09.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
who up to this point,
he has only heard about.

00:46:09.149 --> 00:46:11.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does Boaz do?

00:46:11.718 --> 00:46:15.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how he rose up for her

00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:18.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ruth 2:8

00:46:18.792 --> 00:46:21.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Ruth chapter 2,

00:46:21.028 --> 00:46:23.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
starting with verse 8:

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:27.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boaz said to Ruth: ‘Listen, my daughter.

00:46:27.801 --> 00:46:31.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do not go away to glean in another field,

00:46:31.238 --> 00:46:33.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and do not go anywhere else;

00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:36.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘stay close by my young women.

00:46:36.677 --> 00:46:40.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Keep your eyes
on the field that they harvest,

00:46:40.647 --> 00:46:42.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and go with them.

00:46:42.816 --> 00:46:46.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I have commanded the young men
not to touch you.

00:46:46.653 --> 00:46:48.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘When you are thirsty,

00:46:48.655 --> 00:46:52.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to the water jars and drink
from what the young men have drawn.’”

00:46:53.861 --> 00:46:57.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Boaz protected Ruth.

00:46:57.898 --> 00:47:01.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
He brought her under his loving care.

00:47:01.001 --> 00:47:04.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see him looking out for, shielding,

00:47:04.972 --> 00:47:08.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
defending the one in need.

00:47:08.609 --> 00:47:11.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when Ruth, according to verse 10,

00:47:11.612 --> 00:47:16.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
questions his motive
for helping her, a foreigner,

00:47:16.149 --> 00:47:20.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice a second way he rose up in her behalf

00:47:20.621 --> 00:47:23.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ruth 2:11:

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:25.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boaz answered her:

00:47:25.759 --> 00:47:28.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘A full report was made to me

00:47:28.896 --> 00:47:32.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘of all you have done for your mother-in-law

00:47:32.032 --> 00:47:34.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘after the death of your husband

00:47:34.601 --> 00:47:39.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and how you left
your father and your mother

00:47:39.373 --> 00:47:41.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the land of your relatives

00:47:41.375 --> 00:47:45.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to go to a people
whom you had not known before.

00:47:45.913 --> 00:47:50.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘May Jehovah reward you
for what you have done,

00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and may there be a perfect wage for you

00:47:53.487 --> 00:47:57.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘from Jehovah the God of Israel,

00:47:57.291 --> 00:48:01.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“under whose wings
you have come to seek refuge.’

00:48:01.328 --> 00:48:03.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To this she said:

00:48:03.897 --> 00:48:07.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Let me find favor in your eyes, my lord,

00:48:07.367 --> 00:48:11.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘because you have comforted me

00:48:11.505 --> 00:48:15.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and spoken reassuringly

00:48:15.175 --> 00:48:17.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to your servant,

00:48:17.177 --> 00:48:19.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
although I’m not even one of your servants.’”

00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:25.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Boaz spoke reassuringly to Ruth,

00:48:25.485 --> 00:48:30.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
the footnote says
that he ‘spoke to her heart.’

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:32.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:48:32.392 --> 00:48:36.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
His words were not
just general expressions of praise.

00:48:36.563 --> 00:48:39.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were specific to Ruth

00:48:39.032 --> 00:48:42.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to her personal circumstances.

00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:46.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reassured Ruth that Jehovah loved her

00:48:46.073 --> 00:48:49.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all the sacrifices she had made

00:48:49.276 --> 00:48:52.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that she would not be forgotten.

00:48:52.279 --> 00:48:55.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those comforting, encouraging words of Boaz

00:48:55.616 --> 00:48:57.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
convinced Ruth

00:48:57.618 --> 00:49:01.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
that everything was going to be OK.

00:49:01.455 --> 00:49:06.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Boaz did more
than offer reassuring words.

00:49:06.259 --> 00:49:09.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the third way he rose up

00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:12.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ruth 4:9.

00:49:12.866 --> 00:49:15.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
By taking swift action,

00:49:15.969 --> 00:49:19.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Boaz ensured that the inheritance

00:49:19.106 --> 00:49:21.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his deceased relative Elimelech

00:49:21.608 --> 00:49:24.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
would remain in their family

00:49:24.411 --> 00:49:27.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
—chapter 4, verse 9:

00:49:27.114 --> 00:49:31.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Boaz said to the elders and all the people:

00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:33.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You are witnesses today

00:49:33.954 --> 00:49:37.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that I am buying from Naomi

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:42.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘all that belonged to Elimelech

00:49:42.195 --> 00:49:46.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and all that belonged
to Chilion and Mahlon.

00:49:46.767 --> 00:49:49.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I am also acquiring Ruth the Moabitess,

00:49:49.970 --> 00:49:54.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the wife of Mahlon, as a wife
[for what reason?]

00:49:54.241 --> 00:49:57.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to restore the name
of the dead man

00:49:57.611 --> 00:49:59.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to his inheritance,

00:49:59.713 --> 00:50:02.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that the name of the dead man

00:50:02.249 --> 00:50:05.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘will not be cut off from among his brothers

00:50:05.218 --> 00:50:07.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and from the city gate of his home.

00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:09.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are witnesses today.’”

00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:15.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah used Boaz

00:50:15.195 --> 00:50:18.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rise up for Ruth and Naomi

00:50:18.331 --> 00:50:20.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
in three main ways.

00:50:20.467 --> 00:50:22.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
One,

00:50:22.469 --> 00:50:26.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
he protected those under his care.

00:50:26.239 --> 00:50:28.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second,

00:50:28.241 --> 00:50:31.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
he spoke reassuringly to them.

00:50:31.812 --> 00:50:33.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third,

00:50:33.814 --> 00:50:36.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
he took action.

00:50:36.216 --> 00:50:40.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing the need, he rose up to meet it

00:50:40.921 --> 00:50:42.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he protected,

00:50:42.923 --> 00:50:44.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
he reassured,

00:50:44.925 --> 00:50:46.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
he took action.

00:50:48.261 --> 00:50:52.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how about you and me?

00:50:52.365 --> 00:50:54.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we not do the same

00:50:54.735 --> 00:50:58.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those in need of assistance?

00:50:58.305 --> 00:51:00.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what can result when we do?

00:51:02.409 --> 00:51:04.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, before you answer that,

00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:09.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s go back to our opening experience.

00:51:09.916 --> 00:51:12.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, the very next morning

00:51:12.385 --> 00:51:16.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
upon arriving at his work assignment,

00:51:16.690 --> 00:51:19.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
our distressed brother received a phone call

00:51:19.826 --> 00:51:22.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Patterson lobby.

00:51:22.629 --> 00:51:27.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was the brother, the friend from Wallkill.

00:51:27.567 --> 00:51:30.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had gotten up early that morning

00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:34.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had driven over an hour
from the Wallkill complex

00:51:34.708 --> 00:51:38.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach the Patterson complex by 8:00 a.m.

00:51:38.278 --> 00:51:42.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had arranged
for a private conference room,

00:51:42.249 --> 00:51:47.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was there
waiting for that distressed friend

00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:51.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could find out, “How can I help?”

00:51:51.391 --> 00:51:54.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was 22 years ago.

00:51:54.461 --> 00:51:56.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I can tell you now,

00:51:56.763 --> 00:51:59.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have never forgotten

00:51:59.232 --> 00:52:01.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
what that friend did for me

00:52:01.768 --> 00:52:05.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he rose up for me on that day.

00:52:05.572 --> 00:52:08.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of the action that he took,

00:52:08.675 --> 00:52:10.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt reassured,

00:52:10.844 --> 00:52:14.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt protected, and I felt loved.

00:52:14.848 --> 00:52:17.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question

00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:21.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you 24 students—

00:52:21.188 --> 00:52:23.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the question for all of us

00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our hearing audience is this:

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:28.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will you do

00:52:28.962 --> 00:52:32.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rise up for someone in need?

00:52:32.132 --> 00:52:34.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have every confidence

00:52:34.534 --> 00:52:37.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
that each and every one of you

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:40.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
will answer that call when it comes,

00:52:40.006 --> 00:52:42.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying: “Here I am.

00:52:42.142 --> 00:52:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will rise up for you.
How can I help?”

00:52:52.819 --> 00:52:54.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Chilton.

00:52:54.821 --> 00:52:59.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciated that reassurance
that when we rise up to help others,

00:52:59.826 --> 00:53:01.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will love us for it

00:53:01.995 --> 00:53:05.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and others will rise up in turn for us.

00:53:05.999 --> 00:53:09.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, we have another instructor
from the Gilead School,

00:53:09.769 --> 00:53:11.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Trent Lippold.

00:53:11.771 --> 00:53:16.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his theme is a question:
“Will I Be More?”

00:53:19.045 --> 00:53:22.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Paul
was not a man given to boasting.

00:53:22.148 --> 00:53:24.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on one occasion,

00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:28.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
he felt compelled to boast a little.

00:53:28.054 --> 00:53:32.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that account is found for us
in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 11.

00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:37.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please read with me 2 Corinthians 11:23:

00:53:40.934 --> 00:53:44.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are they ministers of Christ?

00:53:44.371 --> 00:53:46.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I reply like a madman,

00:53:46.573 --> 00:53:49.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am more outstandingly one.”

00:53:51.278 --> 00:53:54.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the subject of Paul’s boast?

00:53:55.682 --> 00:53:58.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being a minister of Christ.

00:53:58.985 --> 00:54:03.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now, being a minister of Christ,
what was Paul’s focus in this boast?

00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:05.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said:

00:54:05.992 --> 00:54:09.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am more outstandingly one.”

00:54:09.896 --> 00:54:12.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
William Tyndale,
when he translated this verse,

00:54:12.265 --> 00:54:16.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
kept the very terseness
and the clarity of the Greek

00:54:16.269 --> 00:54:19.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he simply said: “I am more.”

00:54:19.873 --> 00:54:21.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Paul’s boast.

00:54:23.476 --> 00:54:28.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is he focusing on, though,
as a minister of Christ in his boast?

00:54:28.481 --> 00:54:32.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I have done more work.”

00:54:32.385 --> 00:54:34.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now from verses 23 through 27,

00:54:34.821 --> 00:54:37.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gives almost a résumé

00:54:37.657 --> 00:54:41.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what happened to him because of the work

00:54:41.127 --> 00:54:44.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
he did as a minister of Christ.

00:54:45.899 --> 00:54:50.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how will your
properly focusing on your work

00:54:50.904 --> 00:54:55.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a minister of Christ
help you to succeed in your assignments?

00:54:56.676 --> 00:54:58.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider an example.

00:54:58.979 --> 00:55:02.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s found in the book of Luke chapter 8

00:55:03.583 --> 00:55:07.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke 8:1-3:

00:55:11.458 --> 00:55:14.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Shortly afterward he [this is Christ]

00:55:14.894 --> 00:55:18.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
“traveled from city to city
and from village to village,

00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:22.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“preaching and declaring the good news
of the Kingdom of God.

00:55:22.102 --> 00:55:25.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the Twelve were with him,
as were certain women

00:55:25.872 --> 00:55:29.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who had been cured
of wicked spirits and sicknesses:

00:55:29.642 --> 00:55:32.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mary who was called Magdalene,

00:55:32.345 --> 00:55:35.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from whom seven demons had come out;

00:55:35.749 --> 00:55:40.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Joanna the wife of Chuza,
Herod’s man in charge;

00:55:40.286 --> 00:55:44.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Susanna; and many other women,

00:55:44.057 --> 00:55:48.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were ministering to them
from their belongings.”

00:55:49.929 --> 00:55:54.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
A group: Christ, the Twelve,

00:55:54.701 --> 00:55:56.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and women

00:55:56.903 --> 00:56:00.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
(women who ministered to the others)

00:56:00.673 --> 00:56:02.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what did that mean?

00:56:02.242 --> 00:56:06.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did it mean they cooked the meals,
washed the dishes, mended the clothes?

00:56:06.579 --> 00:56:11.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Possibly but not necessarily entirely that.

00:56:11.451 --> 00:56:14.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
These women ministered to the others

00:56:14.487 --> 00:56:18.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
by helping them to complete their assignment

00:56:18.158 --> 00:56:22.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they went on completing
their assignment as disciples of Christ.

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:26.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the backgrounds of these women.

00:56:27.834 --> 00:56:29.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke mentions three.

00:56:29.302 --> 00:56:33.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says they’re women who were cured
of wicked spirits and sicknesses.

00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at Mary.

00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:38.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mary,” he says,
“from whom seven demons had come out.”

00:56:39.446 --> 00:56:44.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
He also mentions “Joanna,
the wife of Chuza, Herod’s man in charge,”

00:56:44.417 --> 00:56:46.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “Susanna.”

00:56:46.019 --> 00:56:48.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of their backgrounds.

00:56:48.021 --> 00:56:50.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mary—seven demons came out of her.

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:54.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder how that demon possession
contributed to her personality.

00:56:54.727 --> 00:56:57.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Joanna?

00:56:57.931 --> 00:57:02.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Joanna,” it says “the wife of Chuza,
Herod’s man in charge.”

00:57:02.035 --> 00:57:06.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
Joanna lived in Herod’s palace;

00:57:06.072 --> 00:57:08.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was a woman of the court.

00:57:09.008 --> 00:57:11.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also Susanna

00:57:11.578 --> 00:57:14.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it doesn’t say specifically much about her

00:57:14.681 --> 00:57:18.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
other than perhaps she was
one of the women who was cured of a sickness.

00:57:18.985 --> 00:57:21.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was her personality like?

00:57:21.721 --> 00:57:25.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did these personalities work together?

00:57:26.493 --> 00:57:31.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s part of the example of what
can help us to minister,

00:57:31.397 --> 00:57:35.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is to realize that when
we look through the Gospel accounts,

00:57:35.401 --> 00:57:40.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
we never find these women
bickering or arguing among themselves

00:57:40.006 --> 00:57:43.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
about position or prominence or place,

00:57:43.610 --> 00:57:46.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
unlike some others in the group
that were with them.

00:57:48.615 --> 00:57:50.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:57:50.283 --> 00:57:54.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because these women
focused on their ministry;

00:57:54.087 --> 00:57:56.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
they focused on their work.

00:57:56.623 --> 00:58:00.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
They served others,
and they served each other.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:05.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is a powerful example
for you and for me.

00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:10.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember at Isaiah 11:6, it’s prophesied:

00:58:10.370 --> 00:58:13.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The wolf will reside . . . with the lamb.”

00:58:13.072 --> 00:58:17.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lions with calves
—it’s not going to be all lambs.

00:58:19.078 --> 00:58:23.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will meet diverse personalities
in your assignments,

00:58:23.650 --> 00:58:27.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will have to work
with diverse personalities

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like the women did.

00:58:29.656 --> 00:58:31.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what will you do?

00:58:31.824 --> 00:58:36.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that some of the very qualities
that make a lion or make a wolf

00:58:36.829 --> 00:58:40.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be exactly the qualities
you need

00:58:40.099 --> 00:58:43.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help you fulfill your assignment.

00:58:43.570 --> 00:58:48.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
So they’re not all lambs,
but they are all our brothers and sisters.

00:58:49.409 --> 00:58:53.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if Jehovah allows
a diversity of personalities

00:58:53.279 --> 00:58:57.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
within the context of the new personality,
then so should we.

00:58:57.884 --> 00:59:01.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Diverse personalities
make for rich friendships.

00:59:03.456 --> 00:59:05.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, Luke wrote these words,

00:59:05.458 --> 00:59:07.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s talking about events

00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:10.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
that took place
around the Passover of 31 C.E.

00:59:10.196 --> 00:59:11.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think of these women,

00:59:11.998 --> 00:59:16.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
these women were with Jesus

00:59:16.536 --> 00:59:18.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Golgotha.

00:59:18.538 --> 00:59:21.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
These women were at the tomb.

00:59:21.908 --> 00:59:25.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely these women may have been
in the upper room as well.

00:59:25.612 --> 00:59:28.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
That tells us that these women endured

00:59:28.481 --> 00:59:30.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
challenging circumstances.

00:59:30.917 --> 00:59:32.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stuck with the Lord.

00:59:32.919 --> 00:59:35.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped them?

00:59:35.088 --> 00:59:37.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look back at the verse.

00:59:37.090 --> 00:59:38.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 2 says:

00:59:38.925 --> 00:59:43.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As were certain women who had been cured
of wicked spirits and sicknesses.”

00:59:45.164 --> 00:59:49.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
These women deeply appreciated
what Jesus had done for them.

00:59:50.737 --> 00:59:54.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly they glorified God
because of what Jesus had done for them.

00:59:54.774 --> 00:59:56.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they also

00:59:56.776 --> 01:00:01.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
allowed their appreciation
to help them endure

01:00:01.147 --> 01:00:05.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to endure in a self-sacrificing life
of ministering to others.

01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:10.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
So stay appreciative,
and that will help you endure.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:17.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our friends are dying;
our friends are getting sick.

01:00:19.432 --> 01:00:23.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on how Jehovah has blessed you.

01:00:23.736 --> 01:00:27.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditate on the little things each day,

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:30.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
the little gifts Jehovah gives you

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:35.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
—maybe it’s simply the peace
in your heart and mind this day.

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:37.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remain appreciative for that,

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:42.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that will help you endure
as a minister in your assignment.

01:00:43.923 --> 01:00:45.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
One other thing that’s noteworthy
about these women

01:00:45.958 --> 01:00:50.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that these women were not easily
thrown off by others.

01:00:50.596 --> 01:00:53.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember we said—
We talked about others, the other disciples.

01:00:53.866 --> 01:00:56.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
When other disciples left Christ,
the women stayed.

01:00:58.538 --> 01:01:02.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Golgotha, even the apostles

01:01:02.508 --> 01:01:05.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a certain degree had left Christ or fled.

01:01:05.211 --> 01:01:07.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
The women stayed.

01:01:08.314 --> 01:01:12.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
They stood solidly on their own faith.

01:01:12.151 --> 01:01:16.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
do not be thrown off easily by others.

01:01:16.389 --> 01:01:19.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes—and you can imagine
for these women with the disciples—

01:01:19.726 --> 01:01:22.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
it felt like a family.

01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:26.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes today in families
ones choose to leave Jehovah

01:01:26.299 --> 01:01:28.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
even at this late hour.

01:01:28.301 --> 01:01:32.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stand solidly on your own faith.

01:01:32.038 --> 01:01:35.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the women,
do not be easily thrown off.

01:01:35.007 --> 01:01:37.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay with Jehovah.

01:01:38.044 --> 01:01:40.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
These women must have made
quite an impression on Luke,

01:01:40.546 --> 01:01:45.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he’s the only Gospel writer
who mentions them by name in this way.

01:01:47.019 --> 01:01:49.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interestingly, Luke was
a traveling companion of Paul’s.

01:01:49.756 --> 01:01:51.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
From about 50 C.E. in Troas,

01:01:51.557 --> 01:01:53.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
he picked up with Paul
and started traveling with him,

01:01:53.559 --> 01:01:56.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he traveled with him for years.

01:01:56.496 --> 01:01:58.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder if they spoke together.

01:01:58.898 --> 01:02:01.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder if they spoke about these women.

01:02:01.768 --> 01:02:04.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder if they talked
about how important it is

01:02:04.404 --> 01:02:07.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
to focus on the work of ministering

01:02:07.740 --> 01:02:11.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not to get distracted by other things.

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:16.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or I wonder if they talked
about the value of preserving unity

01:02:16.182 --> 01:02:18.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
by learning to work
with different personalities.

01:02:20.253 --> 01:02:23.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they talk about the power
of appreciation to endure?

01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:26.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know.

01:02:26.893 --> 01:02:30.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what we do know is this:
When Paul was in prison in Rome,

01:02:30.897 --> 01:02:32.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he wrote his letter to the Hebrews,

01:02:32.899 --> 01:02:37.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
the congregation in Judea in Jerusalem,
Luke was with him.

01:02:37.303 --> 01:02:39.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do you remember what Paul wrote
at Hebrews 6:10?

01:02:39.806 --> 01:02:43.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “God is not unrighteous
so as to forget your work and the love

01:02:43.776 --> 01:02:48.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
you showed for his name by ministering.”

01:02:49.816 --> 01:02:52.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not forget these women.

01:02:52.785 --> 01:02:56.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah will not forget you.

01:02:56.088 --> 01:02:58.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you work hard

01:02:58.558 --> 01:03:02.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put into practice the things
that you have learned.

01:03:02.528 --> 01:03:04.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may you be able to say

01:03:04.897 --> 01:03:09.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you are more outstandingly
a minister of Christ.

01:03:16.676 --> 01:03:19.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you very much, Brother Lippold,
for those Scriptural examples.

01:03:19.946 --> 01:03:22.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are more determined to focus on our work

01:03:22.982 --> 01:03:25.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
as ministers of the Christ.

01:03:26.085 --> 01:03:28.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a delightful program!

01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:31.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that was only the first part.

01:03:31.958 --> 01:03:35.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later this month, Parts 2 and 3

01:03:35.595 --> 01:03:39.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be available on jw.org,

01:03:39.065 --> 01:03:43.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
so be sure to tune in.

01:03:43.202 --> 01:03:46.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s video postcard,

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:51.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are visiting the islands
of São Tomé and Príncipe.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:52.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
On a world map,

01:03:52.411 --> 01:03:55.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
they look like tiny spots

01:03:55.014 --> 01:03:57.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
located in the Gulf of Guinea

01:03:57.016 --> 01:03:59.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
off the western coast of Africa.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:02.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rainy, humid climate

01:04:02.421 --> 01:04:05.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
in São Tomé and Príncipe produces

01:04:05.658 --> 01:04:08.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
luxurious rain forests,

01:04:08.127 --> 01:04:11.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
covering the slopes of mountains
that can rise

01:04:11.197 --> 01:04:13.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
to over 2,000 meters,

01:04:13.766 --> 01:04:16.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 6,600 feet.

01:04:17.503 --> 01:04:22.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
These tropical islands are surrounded
by palm-fringed beaches.

01:04:22.508 --> 01:04:25.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
The residents are often gifted

01:04:25.912 --> 01:04:28.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
with amazing sunsets.

01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:32.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people of São Tomé and Príncipe

01:04:32.752 --> 01:04:34.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
are hardworking

01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:39.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
—often washing their clothes
in the Abade River.

01:04:39.191 --> 01:04:43.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many have work related to palm trees,

01:04:43.429 --> 01:04:45.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
which includes palm oil,

01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:49.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
palm wine,

01:04:49.802 --> 01:04:52.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and handicraft production.

01:04:52.071 --> 01:04:55.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can see that it is hard work!

01:04:56.842 --> 01:04:58.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their delicious cuisine

01:04:58.844 --> 01:05:02.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
is based on a wide variety of fruits,

01:05:02.014 --> 01:05:06.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as guava, passion fruit, papaya, mango,

01:05:06.352 --> 01:05:08.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as seafood dishes.

01:05:08.754 --> 01:05:11.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is another work

01:05:11.057 --> 01:05:15.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
taking place on São Tomé and Príncipe.

01:05:15.428 --> 01:05:19.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
These friendly and warmhearted people

01:05:19.131 --> 01:05:23.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
have a deep appreciation for God’s Word,

01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:25.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is customary

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:28.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see them reading the Bible
on their balconies.

01:05:30.042 --> 01:05:32.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic,

01:05:32.044 --> 01:05:35.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brothers and sisters
adapted their preaching work

01:05:35.915 --> 01:05:39.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
by writing letters and delivering them

01:05:39.752 --> 01:05:41.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
as conditions permitted.

01:05:42.788 --> 01:05:45.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 933 publishers

01:05:45.091 --> 01:05:48.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the 14 congregations

01:05:48.227 --> 01:05:53.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
are conducting 1,705 Bible studies,

01:05:53.232 --> 01:05:57.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and baptisms continued
throughout the pandemic.

01:05:58.638 --> 01:06:02.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the high cost of Internet access,

01:06:02.875 --> 01:06:07.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of our brothers and sisters
along with other interested ones

01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
can attend the meetings,

01:06:09.815 --> 01:06:11.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Memorial,

01:06:11.917 --> 01:06:13.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
and conventions

01:06:13.953 --> 01:06:18.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of the only local TV channel.

01:06:19.025 --> 01:06:21.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to this arrangement,

01:06:21.093 --> 01:06:25.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
many Bible studies are requested every week.
