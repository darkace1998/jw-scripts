Welcome,
brothers and sisters, to JW Broadcasting.

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll learn ways to deal with worry and anxiety.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some highlights.

00:00:12.862 --> 00:00:15.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From childhood, this brother found it a challenge

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:19.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend meetings, go to school, hold a job,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:22.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even leave his home each morning.

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we learn from his experience

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us cope with our anxieties

00:00:28.978 --> 00:00:31.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one day at a time?

00:00:31.414 --> 00:00:34.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These two sisters have worked
shoulder to shoulder in full-time service

00:00:34.851 --> 00:00:37.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more than 60 years.

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:40.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll learn what has helped them to remain joyful

00:00:40.724 --> 00:00:45.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite everyday struggles and unexpected trials.

00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:47.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever wondered what motivates

00:00:47.063 --> 00:00:51.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters
to make themselves available for Bethel service?

00:00:51.468 --> 00:00:54.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll hear from ones who are serving at Bethel,

00:00:54.671 --> 00:00:57.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ll learn how to prepare and qualify

00:00:57.807 --> 00:01:01.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this special form of full-time service.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:05.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s much to enjoy in this May 2019 edition

00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:07.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do you sometimes feel completely overwhelmed

00:01:29.806 --> 00:01:32.675 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when life’s problems cause you anxiety?

00:01:32.675 --> 00:01:35.478 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Just trying to provide the necessities

00:01:35.478 --> 00:01:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for one’s family can lead to anxiety.

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:44.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might be dealing
with a chronic or life-threatening illness,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
caring for a sick or elderly relative,

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:50.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grieving the death of a loved one,

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:54.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loneliness, a natural disaster,

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:58.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe you’re struggling
with the devastating effects

00:01:58.902 --> 00:02:02.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of past or present abuse.

00:02:02.272 --> 00:02:06.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you firmly believe
that God’s Kingdom will fix these problems,

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:09.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that’s in the future.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about today?

00:02:12.282 --> 00:02:14.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you feel like David,

00:02:14.284 --> 00:02:17.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who prayed at Psalm 13:2:

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:20.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How long will I have anxious concern,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with grief in my heart each day?”

00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:28.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister who has struggled
with anxiety for many years wrote this:

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:35.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anxiety robs me of sleep,
 impacts my health,

00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:40.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
affects the way I treat others,
and makes me want to give up.”

00:02:40.276 --> 00:02:45.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She added: “Anxiety is like a monster

00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:49.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that lives in my body
somewhere between my heart and my belly.

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:53.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I cannot wait for Jehovah
to kill that monster in the new world.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But until then,
the monster snarls and tears at my insides

00:02:59.162 --> 00:03:02.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tries to take over my life.”

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:06.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you identify with her feelings?

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:09.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We often hear a person say concerning anxiety:

00:03:09.973 --> 00:03:13.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m just trying to take it one day at a time.”

00:03:13.343 --> 00:03:15.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But one brother put it this way:

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I try to take it one day at a time,

00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:21.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but sometimes several days attack me at once.”

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For so many of us, anxiety is a daily struggle.

00:03:29.726 --> 00:03:31.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you battle with anxiety,

00:03:31.895 --> 00:03:35.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please know this: You are not alone.

00:03:35.932 --> 00:03:38.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do not give up the fight.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:42.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah and Jesus are aware of the anxieties

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that weigh on your mind
and that are deep in your heart.

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:51.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body
knows that living in this system of things

00:03:51.414 --> 00:03:53.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is especially “hard to deal with.”

00:03:53.883 --> 00:03:57.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the theme chosen for this program is

00:03:57.387 --> 00:04:02.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Deal With Anxiety One Day at a Time.”

00:04:02.392 --> 00:04:06.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, what is anxiety?

00:04:06.296 --> 00:04:08.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:04:08.831 --> 00:04:12.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the word “anxious” occurs 19 times.

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:16.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first occurrence
is in Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount.

00:04:16.272 --> 00:04:20.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Jesus knew that people
worried about how to provide for their family.

00:04:20.944 --> 00:04:24.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at Matthew 6:25,

00:04:24.948 --> 00:04:27.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he gave this wise counsel:

00:04:27.784 --> 00:04:30.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“On this account I say to you:

00:04:30.553 --> 00:04:33.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Stop being anxious about your lives

00:04:33.156 --> 00:04:36.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as to what you will eat or what you will drink,

00:04:36.526 --> 00:04:39.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or about your bodies as to what you will wear.

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:42.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Does not life mean more than food

00:04:42.498 --> 00:04:45.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the body than clothing?”

00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:49.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Study Bible note for verse 25

00:04:49.405 --> 00:04:52.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that “the Greek term for ‘anxious’

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:56.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“can refer to worry that divides a person’s mind

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:59.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and distracts him, robbing him of joy.”

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:03.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 12:29,

00:05:03.052 --> 00:05:06.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus says to “stop being in anxious suspense”

00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:08.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to “stop worrying.”

00:05:08.958 --> 00:05:11.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study note here says

00:05:11.227 --> 00:05:14.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Greek word
for “anxious suspense” was used

00:05:14.897 --> 00:05:18.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to refer “to ships being tossed at sea.”

00:05:18.001 --> 00:05:21.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says that Jesus used it “figuratively

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for being anxious or unsettled,

00:05:24.507 --> 00:05:27.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as if tossed about or wavering

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of doubt and anxiety.”

00:05:30.413 --> 00:05:34.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By saying “stop being anxious,”

00:05:34.183 --> 00:05:38.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus recognizes
that anxiety is already in progress.

00:05:38.654 --> 00:05:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is very aware of our imperfect nature.

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:46.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows that we tend
to bring our worries from yesterday

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:49.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the would-haves,
could-haves, and should-haves)

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:53.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our imagined worries about tomorrow

00:05:53.102 --> 00:05:56.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the what-ifs) to today.

00:05:56.739 --> 00:05:58.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But ask yourself,

00:05:58.741 --> 00:06:03.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How often have I worried myself
sick about what might happen tomorrow,

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:08.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only to find that tomorrow
wasn’t nearly as bad as I feared it would be?’

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:13.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus also knows that anxiety can have real,

00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:16.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes painful, consequences.

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:20.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can stop us from making spiritual progress.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:24.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overthinking and overanalyzing our problems

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can literally shut us down.

00:06:27.503 --> 00:06:31.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How, though, can we “stop being anxious”?

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the antidote?

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:38.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider four practical things we can do.

00:06:38.214 --> 00:06:40.983 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, rely on Jehovah

00:06:40.983 --> 00:06:44.787 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and take one day at a time.

00:06:44.787 --> 00:06:48.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is exactly what Jesus prescribed for us

00:06:48.224 --> 00:06:53.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 6:33, 34:

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:56.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom

00:06:56.632 --> 00:06:58.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and his righteousness,

00:06:58.634 --> 00:07:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all these other things will be added to you.

00:07:01.437 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So never be anxious about the next day,

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:09.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the next day will have its own anxieties.

00:07:09.579 --> 00:07:13.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each day has enough of its own troubles.”

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:16.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 34 has a study note

00:07:16.352 --> 00:07:21.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
telling us that “undue anxiety
about what may happen in the future

00:07:21.023 --> 00:07:24.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“can adversely affect
a person’s relationship with God,

00:07:24.594 --> 00:07:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
causing him to rely 
on his own wisdom rather than on God’s.”

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of relying on ourselves,

00:07:34.704 --> 00:07:39.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rely on Jehovah, and take one day at a time.

00:07:39.442 --> 00:07:42.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A cross-reference to Matthew 6:34

00:07:42.778 --> 00:07:46.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
takes us to Exodus 16:4.

00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:47.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this account,

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:51.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provided
the Israelites with enough manna

00:07:51.053 --> 00:07:54.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for every day of their 40-year trek.

00:07:54.757 --> 00:07:56.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could Jehovah have provided

00:07:56.926 --> 00:08:01.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a week’s worth of manna?
a month’s worth? a year’s worth?

00:08:01.731 --> 00:08:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:08.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So why did
he only provide enough for each day?

00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:10.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think about it.

00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:13.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they stepped out
of their tents each morning,

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:18.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was no question whether
there would be manna on the ground or not,

00:08:18.014 --> 00:08:21.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there was
no question where it came from.

00:08:21.817 --> 00:08:25.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never failed to provide for their needs,

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not even for one day.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also knew from the past that Jehovah

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:35.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
always provided for those who were loyal to him.

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We too can look back
at how Jehovah provided for his servants.

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:43.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can have
complete confidence that Jehovah knows exactly

00:08:43.806 --> 00:08:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we need when we need it

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:51.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—for today, tomorrow, and for all eternity.

00:08:51.614 --> 00:08:54.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if we have such confidence,

00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:58.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why do we sometimes continue to feel anxious?

00:08:58.154 --> 00:09:00.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The simple answer:

00:09:00.323 --> 00:09:03.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re imperfect people trying our best

00:09:03.059 --> 00:09:06.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve Jehovah in Satan’s wicked world.

00:09:06.562 --> 00:09:11.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daily challenges cause anxiety
that can make us forget to rely on Jehovah

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:13.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take one day at a time.

00:09:13.903 --> 00:09:18.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we need to add
our second way to deal with anxiety:

00:09:18.574 --> 00:09:20.643 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Pour your heart out

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:23.713 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah in earnest prayer.

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:25.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read with me the reassuring words

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:29.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:6, 7:

00:09:29.285 --> 00:09:32.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not be anxious over anything,

00:09:32.788 --> 00:09:35.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but in everything by prayer

00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:39.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and supplication along with thanksgiving,

00:09:39.228 --> 00:09:42.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“let your petitions be made known to God;

00:09:42.398 --> 00:09:45.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the peace of God that surpasses

00:09:45.735 --> 00:09:48.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“all understanding will guard your hearts

00:09:48.804 --> 00:09:52.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your mental powers by means of Christ Jesus.”

00:09:52.942 --> 00:09:56.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul doesn’t simply tell us not to be anxious,

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he tells us how.

00:09:58.981 --> 00:10:03.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said “by prayer and supplication,”

00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is earnest and specific prayer.

00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With what benefit?

00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:13.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The “peace of God . . . will guard your hearts.”

00:10:14.897 --> 00:10:17.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Guard” was a military expression referring to troops

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:19.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
assigned to protect a city.

00:10:19.902 --> 00:10:22.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The inhabitants could sleep soundly

00:10:22.838 --> 00:10:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing that soldiers were guarding them at night.

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:30.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way,
when we have “the peace of God,”

00:10:30.813 --> 00:10:33.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our hearts and minds can rest.

00:10:33.683 --> 00:10:38.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can prevent us from being
overwhelmed by anxiety or discouragement.

00:10:38.688 --> 00:10:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How reassuring are the words of the psalmist

00:10:42.391 --> 00:10:45.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 4:8:

00:10:45.695 --> 00:10:49.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will lie down and sleep in peace,

00:10:49.732 --> 00:10:51.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you alone, O Jehovah,

00:10:51.967 --> 00:10:54.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
make me dwell in security.”

00:10:54.937 --> 00:10:59.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we feel trapped,
like there’s no way out of our worries,

00:10:59.942 --> 00:11:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the peace from God gives us hope

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:06.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there’s light at the end of the tunnel.

00:11:06.716 --> 00:11:09.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What, though, must you do?

00:11:09.518 --> 00:11:14.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn your worries into deep, heartfelt prayers.

00:11:14.523 --> 00:11:18.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, at 1 Peter 5:7,

00:11:18.361 --> 00:11:22.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah invites you
to “throw all your anxiety on him,

00:11:22.031 --> 00:11:24.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[and leave it with him]

00:11:24.133 --> 00:11:27.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he cares for you.”

00:11:27.303 --> 00:11:32.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is the one person
who truly understands how you feel.

00:11:32.308 --> 00:11:35.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows every moment of your life

00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—why you feel or react a certain way.

00:11:38.748 --> 00:11:42.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He loves and values you personally

00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:46.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite your imperfections, your anxieties,

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:48.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your cares and worries.

00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:53.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He not only has
the power to help you, he wants to.

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:59.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing this
should move you to pray specifically,

00:11:59.135 --> 00:12:02.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressing your deepest emotions

00:12:02.204 --> 00:12:07.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pleading
that he grant you peace of mind and heart.

00:12:07.209 --> 00:12:09.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the extent you do so,

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:12.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 Peter 5:10 promises

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “he will make you firm,

00:12:14.817 --> 00:12:16.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he will make you strong,

00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:21.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he will firmly ground you.”

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never underestimate the power of prayer!

00:12:25.261 --> 00:12:28.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is always ready to help you

00:12:28.197 --> 00:12:30.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one day at a time.

00:12:32.268 --> 00:12:34.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third way to deal with anxiety

00:12:34.703 --> 00:12:39.508 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is to read and meditate on God’s Word.

00:12:39.508 --> 00:12:41.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let Jehovah speak to you.

00:12:41.544 --> 00:12:46.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Allow Jehovah’s thoughts to become your thoughts.

00:12:46.382 --> 00:12:49.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Psalm 94:19,

00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:54.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice how the psalmist admitted his own anxiety:

00:12:54.323 --> 00:12:57.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When anxieties overwhelmed me,

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:02.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you comforted and soothed me.”

00:13:02.131 --> 00:13:06.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, even servants of God
can feel overwhelmed by anxieties

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:11.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or, as one translation says,
“burdened with worries.”

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That in itself is comforting

00:13:14.143 --> 00:13:18.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an inspired Bible writer
struggled with anxieties.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah “comforted and soothed” him,

00:13:22.985 --> 00:13:25.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calming his troubled heart.

00:13:25.554 --> 00:13:28.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God can do the same for us

00:13:28.123 --> 00:13:30.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his inspired Word, the Bible.

00:13:30.526 --> 00:13:35.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember,
the Bible is how Jehovah speaks to us.

00:13:35.164 --> 00:13:38.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather than allowing our emotions to run wild,

00:13:38.868 --> 00:13:43.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can learn to focus
our mind on upbuilding things,

00:13:43.606 --> 00:13:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as what
the apostle Paul listed at Philippians 4:8:

00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:53.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Finally, brothers, whatever things are true,

00:13:53.616 --> 00:13:56.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are of serious concern,

00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:58.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are righteous,

00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:00.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are chaste,

00:14:00.956 --> 00:14:02.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are lovable,

00:14:02.992 --> 00:14:05.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are well-spoken-of,

00:14:05.427 --> 00:14:07.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are virtuous,

00:14:07.763 --> 00:14:10.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and whatever things are praiseworthy,

00:14:10.299 --> 00:14:14.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue considering these things.”

00:14:14.403 --> 00:14:18.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote to verse 8 shows that “considering”

00:14:18.541 --> 00:14:22.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves “thinking about” or “meditating on.”

00:14:22.878 --> 00:14:27.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can and should
meditate on positive things from the Bible,

00:14:27.883 --> 00:14:32.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
replacing negative things
that may enter our mind and cause anxiety.

00:14:32.888 --> 00:14:37.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask Jehovah to help you to find passages

00:14:37.192 --> 00:14:40.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his Word that will soothe your heart.

00:14:40.596 --> 00:14:45.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask others what scriptures have calmed
their heart during anxious moments.

00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:48.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Make your own personal list.

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:51.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then set aside time to read

00:14:51.206 --> 00:14:54.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and meditate on those passages.

00:14:54.476 --> 00:14:58.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is the doorway to your heart.

00:14:58.681 --> 00:15:02.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation lets God’s thoughts affect you

00:15:02.184 --> 00:15:05.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the deepest possible level.

00:15:05.087 --> 00:15:08.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that Jehovah is speaking directly to you,

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he is.

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:14.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never underestimate the power of God’s Word

00:15:14.563 --> 00:15:18.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—of letting Jehovah speak to you.

00:15:18.567 --> 00:15:21.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our fourth way to deal with anxiety

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:25.441 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is to share your feelings with a trusted friend.

00:15:25.441 --> 00:15:29.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 12:25 says:

00:15:29.345 --> 00:15:33.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anxiety in a man’s heart weighs it down

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:36.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[or, as the footnote says, ‘depresses him’],

00:15:36.352 --> 00:15:39.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a good word cheers it up.”

00:15:39.221 --> 00:15:42.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A good word” can come from a fellow believer

00:15:42.658 --> 00:15:47.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is motivated
by God’s spirit and guided by his Word.

00:15:47.429 --> 00:15:50.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the apostle Paul was alone in prison,

00:15:50.499 --> 00:15:52.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he prayed for encouragement

00:15:52.968 --> 00:15:56.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah provided
what he needed to cheer him up.

00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:59.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With a heart full of appreciation,

00:15:59.475 --> 00:16:01.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said at Colossians 4:11

00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:04.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “my fellow workers  . . . have become

00:16:04.313 --> 00:16:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a source of great comfort to me,”

00:16:06.582 --> 00:16:10.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “a strengthening aid.”

00:16:10.119 --> 00:16:15.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can you do if you feel
weighed down or imprisoned by anxiety?

00:16:15.124 --> 00:16:19.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Paul, pray for encouragement.

00:16:19.361 --> 00:16:21.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray for someone you can talk to,

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone you can trust with your feelings.

00:16:24.533 --> 00:16:28.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer to your prayer may be an elder

00:16:28.037 --> 00:16:31.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a mature Christian brother or sister.

00:16:31.573 --> 00:16:34.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if it’s difficult for you

00:16:34.143 --> 00:16:37.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to open up to others and confide in them?

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try the advice
in the March 1, 1997, Watchtower article

00:16:42.885 --> 00:16:45.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Afraid to Trust Others?”

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:47.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When confiding in someone

00:16:47.956 --> 00:16:51.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Reveal your concerns gradually.

00:16:51.527 --> 00:16:54.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If he [or she] responds in an appropriate,

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“sympathetic, and discreet way,

00:16:57.132 --> 00:17:00.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might then try disclosing more.”

00:17:00.302 --> 00:17:03.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if it takes some effort,

00:17:03.706 --> 00:17:07.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never underestimate the power of our brotherhood.

00:17:07.743 --> 00:17:10.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can use a fellow worshipper

00:17:10.345 --> 00:17:13.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ease your mind of “anxious concern.”

00:17:13.882 --> 00:17:16.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even at times when there’s no one to talk to,

00:17:16.985 --> 00:17:19.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can let the experiences,

00:17:19.354 --> 00:17:21.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upbuilding music,

00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and talks on JW Broadcasting® be like

00:17:24.493 --> 00:17:28.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an encouraging hug from a trusted friend.

00:17:28.764 --> 00:17:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, when we make the effort,
we give Jehovah something to bless.

00:17:33.769 --> 00:17:38.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah can help us
conquer the seemingly unconquerable.

00:17:38.774 --> 00:17:42.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That may not mean
that we’ll completely eliminate anxiety,

00:17:42.745 --> 00:17:45.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can learn to take control.

00:17:45.748 --> 00:17:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How?

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:49.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember our four ways:

00:17:49.852 --> 00:17:53.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, rely on Jehovah

00:17:53.021 --> 00:17:55.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take one day at time;

00:17:55.557 --> 00:17:58.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, pour out your heart

00:17:58.594 --> 00:18:02.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah in earnest, specific prayer;

00:18:02.431 --> 00:18:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
third, read and meditate on God’s Word

00:18:06.235 --> 00:18:09.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—let Jehovah speak to you;

00:18:09.138 --> 00:18:13.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fourth, share your feelings with a trusted friend.

00:18:13.041 --> 00:18:15.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,

00:18:15.077 --> 00:18:19.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can deal with anxiety one day at a time.

00:18:20.382 --> 00:18:23.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, I read a quote from the sister who described

00:18:23.418 --> 00:18:26.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anxiety as a monster living inside her.

00:18:27.489 --> 00:18:31.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m so pleased to say that the sister
who wrote that letter about her anxieties

00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is actually here with us in the studio
to tell us more about her experience.

00:18:37.766 --> 00:18:39.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Jordan Williams
and her husband, Robert.

00:18:39.968 --> 00:18:41.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much

00:18:41.103 --> 00:18:45.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for coming here
to share with us your battle with anxiety.

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:47.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you elaborate on that, please?

00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:50.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel ashamed of my anxiety.

00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:55.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like there’s something
wrong with me, and I feel guilty about that.

00:18:55.284 --> 00:18:59.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like I’m
letting Jehovah down by feeling anxious

00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:01.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that I’m even being disobedient to Jesus,

00:19:01.723 --> 00:19:03.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he says: “Stop being anxious.”

00:19:03.759 --> 00:19:05.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I just can’t.

00:19:05.427 --> 00:19:06.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for sharing that.

00:19:06.762 --> 00:19:11.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Robert, what do you do
to help Jordan battle this anxiety?

00:19:12.134 --> 00:19:15.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a monster
—sometimes a very stubborn monster—

00:19:15.237 --> 00:19:17.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that won’t go away.

00:19:17.272 --> 00:19:20.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remembering that it’s not her fault

00:19:20.676 --> 00:19:23.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps me be more compassionate

00:19:23.645 --> 00:19:27.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and caring—listening
when she’s explaining these anxieties

00:19:27.349 --> 00:19:29.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I may not completely understand.

00:19:29.585 --> 00:19:34.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jordan, are there other
practical things that help you battle anxiety?

00:19:34.223 --> 00:19:37.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The single biggest help
is walking with Jehovah every day.

00:19:38.493 --> 00:19:39.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean that literally.

00:19:39.528 --> 00:19:42.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll wake up in the morning super anxious.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I can’t breathe; and my chest is tight.

00:19:45.334 --> 00:19:48.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll get up, and I’ll read the chapter

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:50.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Bible that the daily text comes from.

00:19:50.405 --> 00:19:54.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then I’ll go on a walk
and talk to Jehovah for an hour,

00:19:54.042 --> 00:19:56.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I try to use
the model prayer as an outline.

00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:59.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I’ll talk to Jehovah about his name

00:19:59.381 --> 00:20:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how I feel so privileged
to have that name on me.

00:20:04.152 --> 00:20:06.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll talk to him about his Kingdom

00:20:06.488 --> 00:20:10.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s going to solve
all of these problems, including anxiety.

00:20:10.692 --> 00:20:13.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll talk to him about his will

00:20:13.996 --> 00:20:17.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and specifically what his will is for me that day.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:20.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of the time,

00:20:20.202 --> 00:20:23.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those three things
cover the things that were worrying me.

00:20:23.338 --> 00:20:27.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if there is another thing,
I’ll talk to him specifically about that.

00:20:27.142 --> 00:20:29.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a nice walk you have with Jehovah.

00:20:29.344 --> 00:20:33.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there other things
that help you deal and battle anxiety?

00:20:33.482 --> 00:20:35.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Personal study projects help a lot,

00:20:35.083 --> 00:20:37.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially if they
don’t have anything to do with anxiety.

00:20:37.319 --> 00:20:42.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I do a study project
on the spiritual suit of armor or the ransom,

00:20:42.324 --> 00:20:46.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it kind of distracts the “anxiety monster”
so that my heart can calm down,

00:20:47.696 --> 00:20:51.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then these pearls of wisdom will
come from Jehovah, and they can get in.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:56.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of those pearls are actually
just what I need to deal with my anxiety.

00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:59.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there specific things that help you?

00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:02.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I made an Anxiety tab
in the Personal Study section

00:21:02.644 --> 00:21:04.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of my Study Bible on my tablet,

00:21:04.846 --> 00:21:08.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I collect scriptures and comments

00:21:08.383 --> 00:21:10.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really help with my anxiety.

00:21:10.419 --> 00:21:15.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, in 2014,
there was a regional convention talk

00:21:15.023 --> 00:21:20.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Matthew chapter 6
and six specific things that combat anxiety.

00:21:20.028 --> 00:21:24.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it made me think
of the twelve-step program  to overcoming addiction.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are the six steps to overcome anxiety.

00:21:27.669 --> 00:21:29.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are those six steps?

00:21:29.371 --> 00:21:31.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first one is to help those in need,

00:21:31.873 --> 00:21:35.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then pray a lot, to be forgiving,

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to be hypocritical,
to store up treasures in heaven,

00:21:39.414 --> 00:21:42.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then to focus on spiritual matters.

00:21:42.217 --> 00:21:44.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we got back from the convention,

00:21:44.553 --> 00:21:46.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she took those items and she wrote them down

00:21:46.722 --> 00:21:49.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put them on magnets
and put them on our refrigerator.

00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:52.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to do each one
of those six things every day.

00:21:52.527 --> 00:21:54.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when I accomplish one, I’ll turn the magnet

00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:57.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I can see what I still need to work on.

00:21:57.265 --> 00:22:00.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I come
to the refrigerator in the morning,

00:22:00.002 --> 00:22:02.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if the magnets are turned,
we know where she’s at.

00:22:02.004 --> 00:22:03.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’re not turned,
we know we’re in trouble.

00:22:03.805 --> 00:22:04.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a bad day.

00:22:04.806 --> 00:22:05.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to do something else.

00:22:05.807 --> 00:22:06.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Very good—nice barometer.

00:22:06.942 --> 00:22:09.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what can others do or say

00:22:09.244 --> 00:22:12.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be helpful
to those going through anxiety?

00:22:12.114 --> 00:22:16.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the friends,
it’s really nice when they’re understanding

00:22:16.752 --> 00:22:18.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and nonjudgmental

00:22:18.787 --> 00:22:22.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and respect my privacy (that’s really helpful)

00:22:22.457 --> 00:22:25.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when they don’t freeze me in time

00:22:25.093 --> 00:22:29.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or decide that ‘Oh, she’s anxious,
and this is how she’s going to be all the time.’

00:22:29.531 --> 00:22:30.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s really helpful.

00:22:30.732 --> 00:22:34.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I even forget that Jehovah approves of me.

00:22:34.536 --> 00:22:36.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So reminding me of that

00:22:36.638 --> 00:22:41.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—reminding me that the things
that I do to please him are successful

00:22:41.643 --> 00:22:45.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe even reminding me
of things that I have accomplished for Jehovah

00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:47.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the past.

00:22:47.215 --> 00:22:49.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, you should
tell Ron about your broken dish.

00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:50.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, yeah.

00:22:50.919 --> 00:22:53.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.
I’d like to know about that.

00:22:53.088 --> 00:22:57.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I just found out
about this Japanese art called Kintsukuroi.

00:22:57.292 --> 00:22:59.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s basically taking

00:22:59.294 --> 00:23:03.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a broken piece of pottery
and fixing it by putting it back together

00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:06.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with gold or silver lacquer,

00:23:06.001 --> 00:23:11.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the concept is that the piece
is more beautiful for having been broken.

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:16.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that really resonates
with me because I do feel broken by anxiety.

00:23:16.445 --> 00:23:19.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah gave Jesus as a ransom,

00:23:19.748 --> 00:23:21.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that ransom is just pure gold;

00:23:21.983 --> 00:23:25.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He can take
all the broken anxious little bits of me

00:23:25.921 --> 00:23:27.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and put me back together.

00:23:27.956 --> 00:23:32.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe I’ll even be more
useful to Jehovah for having been broken.

00:23:32.527 --> 00:23:34.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very precious.

00:23:34.229 --> 00:23:35.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for sharing that.

00:23:35.931 --> 00:23:39.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there other things
that help you deal with anxiety?

00:23:39.067 --> 00:23:42.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve learned to recognize
when anxiety is clouding my thinking,

00:23:42.504 --> 00:23:45.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’ll ask him,
“Can I borrow your brain for a minute, please?”

00:23:45.807 --> 00:23:49.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what we did is we went
and purchased a whiteboard and put it in my office.

00:23:49.978 --> 00:23:51.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sometimes we’ll go to the whiteboard

00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and write out all
the anxieties that she’s dealing with.

00:23:54.749 --> 00:23:56.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we are writing them out,

00:23:56.785 --> 00:23:59.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes we realize that those
are yesterday’s anxieties

00:23:59.554 --> 00:24:02.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they’ve been cared for,
so we can erase those from the board.

00:24:02.624 --> 00:24:05.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are for tomorrow,

00:24:05.227 --> 00:24:07.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so we don’t want
to borrow those and bring them to today.

00:24:07.929 --> 00:24:09.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re tomorrow’s anxieties.

00:24:09.598 --> 00:24:12.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some anxieties
can be grouped in little clusters,

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you can realize,
‘The root is here; let’s focus on that.’

00:24:16.571 --> 00:24:20.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I fight anxiety every single day.

00:24:20.108 --> 00:24:25.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And anxiety is constantly
changing its tactics, so I have to be adaptable.

00:24:25.113 --> 00:24:30.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah never
leaves me to fight anxiety alone—ever.

00:24:30.051 --> 00:24:35.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t understand
what I’ve done to merit all of his attention,

00:24:35.056 --> 00:24:39.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I do realize that I don’t
need to understand why he loves me.

00:24:39.961 --> 00:24:42.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I trust him, and he never lies,

00:24:42.631 --> 00:24:45.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I just need to accept it
when he shows me that love.

00:24:45.834 --> 00:24:48.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We appreciate
you sharing those personal feelings.

00:24:48.436 --> 00:24:52.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And again, we know
that Jehovah and Jesus are so proud of you.

00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we know that those
who are listening in to this interview

00:24:55.043 --> 00:24:59.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will benefit so much
from listening to your personal expressions.

00:24:59.447 --> 00:25:01.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much.

00:25:01.016 --> 00:25:05.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anxieties can surface at any time in our lives,

00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:07.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when we’re very young.

00:25:07.589 --> 00:25:11.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine, though, if the stress
of growing up in this system

00:25:11.726 --> 00:25:14.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was made worse by a chronic disorder,

00:25:14.129 --> 00:25:18.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one that made anxiety feel impossible to overcome.

00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:22.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll be encouraged
by the experience of Brother Steing Dott,

00:25:22.470 --> 00:25:24.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who never gave up on Jehovah.

00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:28.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if you can identify what has helped him cope

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one day at a time.

00:25:31.913 --> 00:25:33.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Steing Dott.

00:25:33.915 --> 00:25:38.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in 1988 in Darwin,
Northern Territory.

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:40.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was eight years old,

00:25:40.755 --> 00:25:45.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that life
was getting very difficult for me.

00:25:45.694 --> 00:25:48.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was diagnosed with ADHD,

00:25:48.363 --> 00:25:51.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obsessive-compulsive disorder,
Tourette syndrome.

00:25:51.733 --> 00:25:55.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on top of all of that,
I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as well.

00:25:55.437 --> 00:25:59.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mum said this affected the entire family

00:25:59.407 --> 00:26:02.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I would repeatedly
yell out “Good night!”

00:26:02.510 --> 00:26:05.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to each individual person in the family.

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And on top of that,
I used to constantly go

00:26:09.184 --> 00:26:12.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around the house,
checking the locks and the windows.

00:26:13.622 --> 00:26:17.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My school life was the hardest thing
I’ve ever had to deal with.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:22.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My school was approximately
500 meters from my home.

00:26:22.697 --> 00:26:25.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would take me
at least two hours to get to school

00:26:25.967 --> 00:26:30.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because one of my obsessions was
that if there were cracks on the footpath

00:26:30.472 --> 00:26:32.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if I stepped on one,

00:26:32.974 --> 00:26:36.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d have to go all the way back home
and start again.

00:26:37.412 --> 00:26:40.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I found life
to be a constant struggle,

00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:43.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as I got older,
it only got worse.

00:26:43.418 --> 00:26:48.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even at ten years old,
I decided that I wanted to end my life

00:26:48.657 --> 00:26:52.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that it would make
everyone in the family’s life a lot easier.

00:26:52.627 --> 00:26:56.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then we decided
to use some medication,

00:26:56.464 --> 00:26:58.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which eased my problems a little bit.

00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:01.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite having medication,

00:27:01.503 --> 00:27:04.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
life was still completely unbearable for me.

00:27:04.673 --> 00:27:08.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a constant struggle
every day within myself.

00:27:08.209 --> 00:27:11.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I used to wash my hands
hundreds of times a day.

00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:13.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t leave the home;

00:27:13.181 --> 00:27:17.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t get a driver’s license;
I couldn’t even get a job.

00:27:17.285 --> 00:27:20.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A major turning point in my life

00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:23.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was my mum’s unwavering faith in Jehovah.

00:27:23.058 --> 00:27:25.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She used to iron
my clothes for the meeting

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and hang them on the doorknob,

00:27:27.662 --> 00:27:30.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though I wasn’t ready
to attend the meeting.

00:27:30.131 --> 00:27:32.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what she didn’t know
was that when my mum

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:35.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
went to the meeting with my sister,
I’d get a Bible,

00:27:35.537 --> 00:27:37.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’d try and start to read it.

00:27:37.906 --> 00:27:41.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also began to pray to Jehovah.

00:27:41.109 --> 00:27:45.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then one day, I thought,
‘I’m going to give this a shot.’

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I put my suit on, I got ready,

00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:49.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I went to the meeting.

00:27:49.217 --> 00:27:52.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went to the Kingdom Hall,
I was absolutely terrified.

00:27:53.488 --> 00:27:54.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so nervous.

00:27:54.889 --> 00:27:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I got there, I saw an elder

00:27:57.726 --> 00:28:01.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who used to come and visit me,
and he made me feel very relaxed.

00:28:02.297 --> 00:28:05.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then the amazing welcome
by the brothers and sisters

00:28:05.667 --> 00:28:10.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it made me feel like I was part
of Jehovah’s organization again.

00:28:10.505 --> 00:28:12.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture that really helped me

00:28:12.674 --> 00:28:16.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was 1 Peter 5:7 because it says:

00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:21.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“While you throw all your anxiety on him,
because he cares for you.”

00:28:21.182 --> 00:28:25.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this made me feel like
I had a very powerful Friend,

00:28:25.453 --> 00:28:30.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah wanted me to throw
my anxieties on him because he loved me.

00:28:30.258 --> 00:28:33.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On September 4, 2010,

00:28:33.528 --> 00:28:35.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was my most important day of my life.

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:39.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:28:39.401 --> 00:28:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Adelaide Entertainment Centre.

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I now serve as a ministerial servant.

00:28:44.706 --> 00:28:47.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had the privilege of giving public talks,

00:28:47.575 --> 00:28:50.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is something I never thought
I’d ever be able to do.

00:28:50.945 --> 00:28:54.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I completed pioneer school
after three attempts

00:28:54.716 --> 00:28:57.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the pioneer school
environment made me feel

00:28:57.952 --> 00:29:01.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like I was back at school
and made me have anxiety again.

00:29:01.956 --> 00:29:04.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the third time I completed it.

00:29:04.225 --> 00:29:09.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And none of this would ever have been
possible without Jehovah’s help.

00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the 6th of August 2016,

00:29:12.801 --> 00:29:15.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I married my beautiful wife, Laura,

00:29:15.036 --> 00:29:17.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who helps me serve Jehovah,

00:29:17.005 --> 00:29:19.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can serve
Jehovah every day together.

00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:21.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I, like the apostle Paul,

00:29:21.743 --> 00:29:25.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still feel like I have
a war inside me sometimes.

00:29:25.213 --> 00:29:29.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But definitely,
Jehovah has never let me down.

00:29:29.217 --> 00:29:32.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never give up on serving Jehovah

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:34.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah
will never give up on you.

00:29:35.323 --> 00:29:39.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what Steing
considered the turning point in his life?

00:29:39.694 --> 00:29:43.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the unwavering faith of his Mum,

00:29:43.598 --> 00:29:46.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the warmth of the congregation

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:49.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, most of all, help from Jehovah.

00:29:49.537 --> 00:29:53.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He called Jehovah “a very powerful Friend.”

00:29:53.374 --> 00:29:55.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s so true!

00:29:55.443 --> 00:29:59.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Dott overcame monumental challenges,

00:29:59.314 --> 00:30:02.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but is his struggle with anxiety over?

00:30:02.417 --> 00:30:04.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:30:04.118 --> 00:30:06.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that like the apostle Paul,

00:30:06.754 --> 00:30:11.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he sometimes still feels a war within himself.

00:30:11.226 --> 00:30:13.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you ever feel that way?

00:30:13.695 --> 00:30:16.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s music video reminds us

00:30:16.931 --> 00:30:20.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can find peace and joy despite our burdens.

00:30:20.902 --> 00:30:25.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s entitled Each Day Has Its Own Anxieties.

00:30:31.279 --> 00:30:38.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know about the Paradise
under God’s Kingdom,

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:46.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I believe with all my heart
that better days will come.

00:30:46.261 --> 00:30:53.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes in this life, for me,
It’s hard to see the things unseen,

00:30:53.368 --> 00:31:00.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To feel the love I know is there
when my heart is in despair.

00:31:00.842 --> 00:31:07.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I know Jehovah’s near.

00:31:10.919 --> 00:31:21.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I say a prayer from the heart.
When worries overtake my mind,

00:31:21.829 --> 00:31:34.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On his strength I can rely.
I’m not alone; I know he’s there.

00:31:34.142 --> 00:31:40.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have his words of comfort
And true friends who really care.

00:31:40.949 --> 00:31:52.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, each day has its own anxieties.
So I take one day at a time;

00:31:52.961 --> 00:31:59.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave tomorrow until tomorrow;
Peace is what I find

00:31:59.534 --> 00:32:04.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day at a time.

00:32:07.275 --> 00:32:14.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So take these words I’ve said, my friend,
And know that I care.

00:32:14.082 --> 00:32:23.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Focus on the joys in life,
Not the burdens that we bear.

00:32:23.024 --> 00:32:29.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about what God has done.
To show his love, he gave his Son.

00:32:29.063 --> 00:32:36.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So never doubt; keep trusting him.
He gave his best so we could live.

00:32:36.838 --> 00:32:43.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t give in to fear.

00:32:43.244 --> 00:32:54.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say a prayer from the heart.
When worries overtake our mind,

00:32:54.722 --> 00:33:05.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On his strength we can rely.
We’re not alone, for he is there.

00:33:05.767 --> 00:33:13.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have his words of comfort
And true friends who really care.

00:33:13.941 --> 00:33:25.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, each day has its own anxieties.
So take one day at a time;

00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:31.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave tomorrow until tomorrow;
Peace is what we’ll find

00:33:31.693 --> 00:33:36.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day at a time.

00:33:54.849 --> 00:34:05.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Say a prayer from the heart.
When worries overtake our mind,

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:17.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On his strength we can rely.
We’re not alone, for he is there.

00:34:17.305 --> 00:34:25.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have his words of comfort
And true friends who really care.

00:34:25.446 --> 00:34:36.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, each day has its own anxieties.
So take one day at a time;

00:34:36.124 --> 00:34:42.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Leave tomorrow until tomorrow;
Peace is what we’ll find

00:34:42.697 --> 00:34:51.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day at a time—
One day at a time.

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:02.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We’re not alone, for he is there.

00:35:02.416 --> 00:35:06.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have his words of comfort and true friends

00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:08.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who really care.”

00:35:08.022 --> 00:35:11.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouraging thought from that song!

00:35:11.125 --> 00:35:16.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, true friends who share
our love for Jehovah are invaluable.

00:35:17.165 --> 00:35:20.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in this story from Japan.

00:35:20.034 --> 00:35:24.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sisters Takako Sato and Hisako Wakui

00:35:24.172 --> 00:35:28.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have worked together as pioneers since 1957.

00:35:28.342 --> 00:35:30.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s learn how their friendship

00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:33.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped them serve Jehovah with joy.

00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:36.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are pioneer partners.

00:35:38.452 --> 00:35:40.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve been working together

00:35:40.521 --> 00:35:43.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for over 60 years.

00:35:43.024 --> 00:35:45.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1956,

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:49.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was the only Jehovah’s Witness
in Nagano prefecture.

00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:52.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was lonesome,

00:35:52.099 --> 00:35:55.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I applied for regular pioneer service.

00:35:55.369 --> 00:35:57.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Surprisingly,

00:35:57.605 --> 00:36:01.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was appointed
as a special pioneer.

00:36:01.142 --> 00:36:04.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was so happy that I found myself

00:36:04.812 --> 00:36:07.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rolling around on the tatami-mat floor

00:36:07.815 --> 00:36:10.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the appointment letter in my hand.

00:36:10.751 --> 00:36:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the way
I expressed my joy and appreciation.

00:36:15.156 --> 00:36:17.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was invited to serve

00:36:17.225 --> 00:36:19.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a special pioneer,
I was sent to Nagano,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:23.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s where I met Hisako.

00:36:23.030 --> 00:36:26.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takako and I focused on our ministry.

00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:31.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When an isolated group was established,

00:36:31.672 --> 00:36:33.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since there were no brothers,

00:36:33.841 --> 00:36:36.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would wear a head covering
and conduct the meetings.

00:36:38.246 --> 00:36:41.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes the outlines were in English.

00:36:41.282 --> 00:36:43.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We didn’t understand anything.

00:36:44.919 --> 00:36:47.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But people were delighted to hear

00:36:47.321 --> 00:36:51.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even just the scriptures and went home satisfied,

00:36:51.726 --> 00:36:55.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that strongly impressed on me
the power of God’s Word.

00:36:58.599 --> 00:37:03.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned
to a territory in the city after that.

00:37:03.404 --> 00:37:06.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We found so many not-at-homes,

00:37:06.774 --> 00:37:11.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we were determined to meet people.

00:37:11.112 --> 00:37:13.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we changed the times we preached,

00:37:13.281 --> 00:37:15.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we talked to people on the street

00:37:15.483 --> 00:37:17.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were going to work.

00:37:17.285 --> 00:37:20.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cherished even small opportunities.

00:37:20.721 --> 00:37:23.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we had a chance to meet a householder,

00:37:23.925 --> 00:37:26.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we always tried to have a conversation

00:37:26.994 --> 00:37:29.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we could link to the next visit.

00:37:29.563 --> 00:37:34.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before long, I had ten Bible studies.

00:37:35.603 --> 00:37:38.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takako acts like she’s cheerful,

00:37:38.406 --> 00:37:43.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she’s been fighting various illnesses.

00:37:43.144 --> 00:37:46.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, it was so bad

00:37:46.914 --> 00:37:50.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I could not even go out in service.

00:37:50.117 --> 00:37:53.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had a serious skin condition.

00:37:53.754 --> 00:37:56.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could not bear

00:37:56.157 --> 00:38:00.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at the illustration of Job in the magazine,

00:38:00.061 --> 00:38:02.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I covered it up with paper.

00:38:06.767 --> 00:38:09.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah helped me
to look to Job’s example.

00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:12.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our endurance under trial

00:38:14.909 --> 00:38:17.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would become praise to God.

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have often had health problems.

00:38:23.851 --> 00:38:26.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just at one of those times,

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:29.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received a letter from the branch.

00:38:29.023 --> 00:38:31.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It said:

00:38:31.359 --> 00:38:34.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What you
can accomplish now may be limited.

00:38:36.163 --> 00:38:40.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“However, think
about all that you have done up to now

00:38:40.101 --> 00:38:42.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to give praise to Jehovah

00:38:42.236 --> 00:38:46.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and about the people
you were able to help learn the truth,

00:38:46.974 --> 00:38:51.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be joyful knowing
that you have been used by Jehovah fully.”

00:38:54.548 --> 00:38:56.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t stop crying

00:38:56.584 --> 00:39:00.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I really felt the care and concern

00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:03.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the organization and from Jehovah.

00:39:05.726 --> 00:39:09.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hisako also
took really good care of me

00:39:09.196 --> 00:39:11.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayed with me.

00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:16.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our thinking and personalities are different,

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:20.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we made efforts to talk things out.

00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:25.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our heartfelt desire
to want to serve Jehovah full-time

00:39:25.379 --> 00:39:28.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has always been the same.

00:39:30.117 --> 00:39:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For 60 years, we’ve enjoyed

00:39:33.187 --> 00:39:36.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a truly wonderful life of service to Jehovah.

00:39:36.724 --> 00:39:40.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has supported us in difficult times

00:39:40.728 --> 00:39:44.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the Bible, the organization, and friends.

00:39:44.098 --> 00:39:47.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have tasted the truthfulness of the words:

00:39:47.802 --> 00:39:52.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I am weak, then I am powerful.”

00:39:54.608 --> 00:39:58.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘When I said: “My foot is slipping,”

00:39:58.312 --> 00:40:02.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your kindness, O Jehovah, has supported me.’

00:40:02.183 --> 00:40:05.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can say that too.

00:40:05.753 --> 00:40:09.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we don’t have energy or ability,

00:40:09.090 --> 00:40:13.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve been able to enjoy
full-time service together up until now.

00:40:15.296 --> 00:40:17.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m really content now.

00:40:17.231 --> 00:40:20.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all thanks to Jehovah.

00:40:23.370 --> 00:40:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the apostle Paul,
our sisters cultivated singleness

00:40:27.608 --> 00:40:31.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and focused on full-time service to Jehovah

00:40:31.011 --> 00:40:33.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more than 60 years.

00:40:33.447 --> 00:40:36.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they face everyday challenges

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the extra ones that come with age,

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:43.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but their heartfelt desire
to serve Jehovah whole-souled

00:40:43.357 --> 00:40:48.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brings Takako and Hisako
real joy and contentment.

00:40:48.996 --> 00:40:53.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whole-souled service
for nearly 20,000 brothers and sisters

00:40:53.601 --> 00:40:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a full-time assignment at Bethel.

00:40:57.104 --> 00:41:01.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What motivates them
to reach out for this special privilege?

00:41:01.675 --> 00:41:04.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What blessings do they experience?

00:41:04.345 --> 00:41:09.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s the best way
to prepare and qualify for Bethel service?

00:41:09.183 --> 00:41:12.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to invite my friend Patrick LaFranca

00:41:12.253 --> 00:41:14.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to discuss these and other questions.

00:41:14.588 --> 00:41:15.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome, Pat.

00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:17.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Ron.

00:41:18.826 --> 00:41:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How heartwarming it’s been

00:41:20.327 --> 00:41:23.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see millions take their stand for true worship!

00:41:23.964 --> 00:41:27.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thousands more are joining us every week.

00:41:27.535 --> 00:41:30.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is speeding up the ingathering work,

00:41:30.971 --> 00:41:33.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this makes us very happy.

00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:38.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But who will work
to provide the Bibles, Bible literature,

00:41:38.579 --> 00:41:41.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the audio and video publications

00:41:41.015 --> 00:41:43.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that sustain us spiritually

00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:47.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help us to accomplish
our Kingdom preaching and teaching work?

00:41:47.721 --> 00:41:50.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bethel is a unique place.

00:41:50.858 --> 00:41:53.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s where mature Christians

00:41:53.227 --> 00:41:55.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
render sacred service to Jehovah

00:41:55.629 --> 00:41:58.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in close association with Christ’s brothers.

00:41:58.999 --> 00:42:02.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They minister to the needs
of our worldwide brotherhood

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and support the preaching work.

00:42:05.673 --> 00:42:09.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bethel family is a group of dedicated,

00:42:09.643 --> 00:42:11.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
baptized servants of Jehovah

00:42:11.812 --> 00:42:14.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who live and work together closely.

00:42:14.782 --> 00:42:18.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they experience in a special way

00:42:18.285 --> 00:42:21.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Psalm 133:1 says:

00:42:21.555 --> 00:42:24.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! How good

00:42:24.325 --> 00:42:27.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and how pleasant it is for brothers

00:42:27.027 --> 00:42:29.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dwell together in unity!”

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:33.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very pleased to see
that many have expanded their service

00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:36.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah by making themselves available

00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:40.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the special privilege of Bethel service.

00:42:40.274 --> 00:42:43.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you considered this as a goal?

00:42:44.612 --> 00:42:46.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Making yourself available

00:42:46.614 --> 00:42:50.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Bethel service
is like knocking on a door that leads

00:42:50.017 --> 00:42:52.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to many other privileges of service.

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:55.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, to serve at Bethel requires

00:42:55.422 --> 00:42:57.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a self-sacrificing spirit

00:42:57.658 --> 00:42:59.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a willingness to serve

00:42:59.493 --> 00:43:03.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wherever there is a need,
in harmony with the attitude displayed

00:43:03.264 --> 00:43:06.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the prophet Isaiah at Isaiah 6:8:

00:43:06.433 --> 00:43:10.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then I heard the voice of Jehovah saying:

00:43:10.337 --> 00:43:13.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?’

00:43:13.907 --> 00:43:18.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said: ‘Here I am! Send me!’”

00:43:18.912 --> 00:43:21.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Isaiah learned about an opportunity

00:43:21.715 --> 00:43:23.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do more in Jehovah’s service,

00:43:23.717 --> 00:43:25.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he responded eagerly,

00:43:25.719 --> 00:43:27.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though he did not know exactly

00:43:27.888 --> 00:43:30.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he was going to be assigned to do.

00:43:30.357 --> 00:43:32.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was enough for him to know that Jehovah

00:43:32.426 --> 00:43:36.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was extending an invitation
to serve in a special way,

00:43:36.363 --> 00:43:39.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Isaiah wanted to volunteer.

00:43:39.433 --> 00:43:43.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same spirit is shown
by Bethel family members worldwide.

00:43:45.439 --> 00:43:48.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What especially motivates
so many to serve at Bethel?

00:43:49.443 --> 00:43:51.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love for Jehovah moves us

00:43:51.812 --> 00:43:54.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to put Kingdom interests ahead of self-interest.

00:43:54.815 --> 00:43:58.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As stated in the Proclaimers book, page 295:

00:43:58.652 --> 00:44:01.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is not work in which they gain

00:44:01.322 --> 00:44:04.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“personal prominence or material possessions.

00:44:04.325 --> 00:44:07.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Their desire is to honor Jehovah,
and they are satisfied

00:44:07.828 --> 00:44:10.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with the provisions made for them

00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:11.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in the way of food, lodging,

00:44:11.965 --> 00:44:14.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a modest [allowance]
for personal expenses.”

00:44:16.036 --> 00:44:19.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are there any rewards
that come from serving in this unique way?

00:44:20.574 --> 00:44:23.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have offered themselves willingly

00:44:23.043 --> 00:44:26.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Bethel service have truly been blessed.

00:44:27.748 --> 00:44:31.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The love and unity we feel here is incomparable.

00:44:31.719 --> 00:44:34.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not like in a company out in the world

00:44:34.154 --> 00:44:37.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because here you can work
with your friends every day.

00:44:39.426 --> 00:44:41.195 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Like-minded people

00:44:41.195 --> 00:44:43.530 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have the same goals and support each other.

00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:44.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what you can feel here.

00:44:46.033 --> 00:44:47.735 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’re assigned a task

00:44:47.735 --> 00:44:50.104 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that you’ve never performed before,

00:44:50.104 --> 00:44:52.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there are
many experienced brothers and sisters

00:44:52.473 --> 00:44:55.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who can help
—professionally as well as personally.

00:44:56.677 --> 00:45:00.781 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Whether it is the consideration of the daily text

00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:02.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the Watchtower Study with the Bethel family,

00:45:02.783 --> 00:45:05.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
listening to the practical, valuable comments

00:45:05.052 --> 00:45:08.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers and sisters is really refreshing.

00:45:08.522 --> 00:45:10.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You really feel that they love Jehovah,

00:45:10.357 --> 00:45:12.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their comments help you to feel the same.

00:45:14.395 --> 00:45:16.463 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Here in Bethel, you have the best Employer

00:45:16.463 --> 00:45:18.465 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that there is—Jehovah.

00:45:18.465 --> 00:45:22.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No other employer
is as grateful and considerate as he is,

00:45:22.236 --> 00:45:25.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so out of love for Jehovah,
you’re simply happy to give him your best.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.442 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Whenever I think about what

00:45:28.442 --> 00:45:30.077 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is being done at Bethel

00:45:30.077 --> 00:45:31.445 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—publications are being

00:45:31.445 --> 00:45:32.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produced and shipped,

00:45:32.579 --> 00:45:35.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
videos for our conventions are being made,

00:45:35.182 --> 00:45:37.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and translation is being done

00:45:37.451 --> 00:45:39.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into so many different languages—

00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:41.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I keep getting goose bumps.

00:45:42.256 --> 00:45:44.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
No matter what I can do here,

00:45:44.258 --> 00:45:46.393 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
knowing that by doing it

00:45:46.393 --> 00:45:49.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am supporting Christ’s brothers
makes me feel very, very good.

00:45:51.131 --> 00:45:53.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how does a young person

00:45:53.133 --> 00:45:55.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
qualify for Bethel service?

00:45:55.869 --> 00:45:59.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents raised me to have

00:45:59.139 --> 00:46:00.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a spiritual focus.

00:46:00.774 --> 00:46:02.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So during the school holidays

00:46:02.776 --> 00:46:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and growing up,
our life revolved around the ministry

00:46:06.747 --> 00:46:08.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—doing spiritual activities.

00:46:08.749 --> 00:46:09.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it really helped us

00:46:09.950 --> 00:46:13.987 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
keep focused spiritually as a family

00:46:13.987 --> 00:46:17.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and helped me stay focused
on the goals that I wanted to achieve.

00:46:17.658 --> 00:46:20.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really enjoy reading,

00:46:20.594 --> 00:46:22.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one day my Dad just said to me,

00:46:22.329 --> 00:46:24.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why don’t you read the Bible?”

00:46:24.865 --> 00:46:27.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I know it sounds obvious,
but at that point, I had never read it

00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:29.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Genesis to Revelation.

00:46:29.636 --> 00:46:31.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I finished reading the Bible,

00:46:31.638 --> 00:46:35.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it really changed my thinking,

00:46:35.242 --> 00:46:39.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it really proved the truth to myself.

00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:43.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this helped me to keep

00:46:43.317 --> 00:46:47.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a spiritual focus, and it really was the first step

00:46:47.855 --> 00:46:49.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in reaching out and achieving

00:46:49.857 --> 00:46:52.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the spiritual goals that I wanted to achieve.

00:46:52.025 --> 00:46:54.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the congregation, I was able to help out

00:46:54.962 --> 00:46:57.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with doing the magazines
and the sound and the platform.

00:46:59.032 --> 00:47:02.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these privileges really helped me to build

00:47:02.803 --> 00:47:05.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a good work ethic and give in ways

00:47:05.806 --> 00:47:07.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I could give more to Jehovah.

00:47:07.808 --> 00:47:10.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the elders used to work
with me a lot in the ministry.

00:47:10.811 --> 00:47:12.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I felt

00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:14.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘I can’t do this’

00:47:14.982 --> 00:47:16.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘This is too much’ or ‘It’s too overwhelming’

00:47:16.984 --> 00:47:21.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or ‘I’ll never be able to reach this goal,’
an elder showed me

00:47:21.054 --> 00:47:23.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a scripture in the Bible where Jehovah

00:47:23.957 --> 00:47:26.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was encouraging Joshua to be courageous.

00:47:26.894 --> 00:47:29.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that really impacted me,

00:47:29.897 --> 00:47:34.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that I was able to be courageous,
too, and to reach my goal of Bethel.

00:47:36.503 --> 00:47:38.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I visited Bethel,

00:47:38.505 --> 00:47:41.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that they were normal people,

00:47:41.441 --> 00:47:44.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they had so many good qualities

00:47:44.878 --> 00:47:47.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I wanted to imitate

00:47:47.114 --> 00:47:49.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—very hospitable, very warm,

00:47:49.182 --> 00:47:52.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
very inviting.

00:47:52.286 --> 00:47:56.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That helped me to want to reach my goal,
so that I could be like them.

00:47:57.391 --> 00:47:59.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To serve at Bethel

00:47:59.226 --> 00:48:01.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are qualifications that need to be met.

00:48:01.428 --> 00:48:04.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should have a deep love for Jehovah

00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:07.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the organization, which is demonstrated

00:48:07.668 --> 00:48:10.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by living in harmony with Bible standards.

00:48:10.437 --> 00:48:12.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You must have a fine reputation

00:48:12.906 --> 00:48:14.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a spiritual person.

00:48:14.908 --> 00:48:16.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should have respect

00:48:16.944 --> 00:48:18.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah’s moral standards,

00:48:18.946 --> 00:48:21.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
avoiding uncleanness and sexual immorality.

00:48:21.982 --> 00:48:24.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should have a clean conscience

00:48:24.051 --> 00:48:27.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before Jehovah and be at peace with yourself

00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with Jehovah’s organization.

00:48:30.090 --> 00:48:32.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your dress and grooming should be exemplary,

00:48:32.993 --> 00:48:35.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
befitting a Christian minister

00:48:35.095 --> 00:48:37.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even during leisure time.

00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:39.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Styles that are faddish

00:48:39.232 --> 00:48:41.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or extreme or that identify us

00:48:41.935 --> 00:48:44.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with undesirable elements of the world

00:48:44.438 --> 00:48:46.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not acceptable at Bethel.

00:48:47.908 --> 00:48:50.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The applicant should not read, listen to,

00:48:50.611 --> 00:48:53.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or view any type of material

00:48:53.013 --> 00:48:55.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is inappropriate for a Christian.

00:48:55.282 --> 00:48:57.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such unwholesome material

00:48:57.417 --> 00:48:59.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
certainly would include pornography,

00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:03.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
debasing music, or any kind of entertainment

00:49:03.323 --> 00:49:05.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that features sexual immorality,

00:49:05.659 --> 00:49:08.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spiritism, or violence.

00:49:09.162 --> 00:49:11.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bethel applicants should be

00:49:11.164 --> 00:49:14.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from 19 to 35 years of age.

00:49:14.067 --> 00:49:16.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Occasionally, there is an opening

00:49:16.303 --> 00:49:18.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for someone over 35 years of age

00:49:18.572 --> 00:49:20.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who may have specialized skills

00:49:20.574 --> 00:49:22.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are needed at Bethel,

00:49:22.576 --> 00:49:24.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as those with certain technical

00:49:24.578 --> 00:49:27.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or medical experience, translation skills,

or building trades such as plumbing, electrical,

00:49:31.818 --> 00:49:35.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
heavy equipment mechanics, or carpentry.

00:49:35.288 --> 00:49:37.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those with such capabilities and training

00:49:37.924 --> 00:49:39.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are welcome to apply.

00:49:40.994 --> 00:49:43.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In view of the unique demands

00:49:43.063 --> 00:49:45.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a full-time assignment at Bethel,

00:49:45.198 --> 00:49:48.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you should be mentally and emotionally sound,

00:49:48.669 --> 00:49:52.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physically strong, and able to work long hours.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You should be able to read, write,

00:49:54.975 --> 00:49:56.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and speak the primary language

00:49:56.977 --> 00:49:58.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the branch territory.

00:49:58.979 --> 00:50:01.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This will enable you to communicate well

00:50:01.148 --> 00:50:03.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with others serving at Bethel,

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:06.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive needed training, and to work safely

00:50:06.186 --> 00:50:08.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Bethel environment.

00:50:09.056 --> 00:50:11.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bethel applicants agree to serve

00:50:11.058 --> 00:50:13.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for a minimum of one year,

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:15.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during which time you will receive training

00:50:15.462 --> 00:50:17.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for continued Bethel service.

00:50:19.032 --> 00:50:22.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With regard to secular skills,
we do not encourage individuals

00:50:22.536 --> 00:50:25.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to obtain university education

00:50:25.539 --> 00:50:28.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or training with the thought that this will improve

00:50:28.108 --> 00:50:30.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their chances of being called into Bethel.

00:50:30.711 --> 00:50:33.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best way to prepare for Bethel service

00:50:33.814 --> 00:50:37.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to first serve in the full-time pioneer ministry.

00:50:38.752 --> 00:50:41.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The greatest need is for single brothers.

00:50:41.555 --> 00:50:44.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, all who meet
the qualifications, including sisters,

00:50:44.958 --> 00:50:49.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are encouraged to apply
for temporary volunteer service.

00:50:49.229 --> 00:50:52.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Serving as
a temporary volunteer at Bethel may open

00:50:52.132 --> 00:50:54.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the way to other opportunities

00:50:54.134 --> 00:50:57.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to expand your service to Jehovah.

00:50:57.404 --> 00:51:00.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are interested
in applying for Bethel service,

00:51:00.273 --> 00:51:03.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which application should you request

00:51:03.376 --> 00:51:05.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a member
of your Congregation Service Committee?

00:51:05.812 --> 00:51:07.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since there are two types

00:51:07.814 --> 00:51:10.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of applications available, first give careful

00:51:10.751 --> 00:51:12.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayerful consideration

00:51:12.753 --> 00:51:14.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to your circumstances.

00:51:14.755 --> 00:51:18.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thereafter, decide whether
you will request from the elders

00:51:18.825 --> 00:51:21.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Application for Volunteer Program (A-19),

00:51:21.061 --> 00:51:23.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is available for those interested

00:51:23.830 --> 00:51:25.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in serving on a temporary basis

00:51:25.999 --> 00:51:28.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for as brief as one week or as long

00:51:28.235 --> 00:51:30.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as several consecutive months.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:32.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or you may decide to request

00:51:32.739 --> 00:51:35.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Application to Become
a Member of the Worldwide Order

00:51:35.675 --> 00:51:40.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Special Full-Time Servants
of Jehovah’s Witnesses (A-8).

00:51:40.046 --> 00:51:42.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This application is for those interested

00:51:42.816 --> 00:51:44.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in serving on a long-term basis

00:51:44.985 --> 00:51:47.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for one full year or longer.

00:51:47.454 --> 00:51:50.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the Branch Committee
determines that there is a need

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:52.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your services, they will decide

00:51:52.659 --> 00:51:55.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where you can best be used, whether at Bethel

00:51:55.695 --> 00:51:58.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps on
a theocratic construction assignment.

00:51:59.966 --> 00:52:02.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Submitting your application may open

00:52:02.469 --> 00:52:04.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a door of opportunity to serve Jehovah

00:52:04.504 --> 00:52:07.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his organization in a variety of ways.

00:52:10.443 --> 00:52:12.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, not all of us

00:52:12.946 --> 00:52:16.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have such a self-sacrificing spirit

00:52:16.283 --> 00:52:20.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have the circumstances in life to serve at Bethel.

00:52:20.153 --> 00:52:23.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we can encourage others who do.

00:52:23.423 --> 00:52:26.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, follow the example

00:52:26.359 --> 00:52:28.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of God-fearing parents

00:52:28.562 --> 00:52:31.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as Hannah and Elkanah,

00:52:31.264 --> 00:52:33.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who willingly made their son available

00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for expanded theocratic privileges.

00:52:37.003 --> 00:52:41.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Continue to place the goal
of Bethel service before your young ones,

00:52:41.708 --> 00:52:45.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stimulate
their interest in the full-time ministry

00:52:45.212 --> 00:52:49.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by your example and your positive expressions.

00:52:49.583 --> 00:52:51.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If possible,

00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:55.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bring them on tour
of world headquarters in New York, U.S.A.,

00:52:55.989 --> 00:53:00.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or make arrangements
to bring them on a tour of the Bethel

00:53:00.093 --> 00:53:03.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the branch territory in which you live.

00:53:03.563 --> 00:53:07.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Such visits can help
young ones to witness firsthand

00:53:07.701 --> 00:53:12.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work that’s being done
at Bethel to promote Kingdom interests.

00:53:12.372 --> 00:53:16.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Elders, help young ones in your congregation

00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:18.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have the potential to expand their service

00:53:18.812 --> 00:53:22.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah to meet the qualifications.

00:53:22.482 --> 00:53:26.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah continues to look
for those willing to respond

00:53:26.586 --> 00:53:30.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to his invitation to expand their service to him.

00:53:30.857 --> 00:53:33.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As in Isaiah’s day, He asks:

00:53:33.627 --> 00:53:37.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will you answer as did the prophet:

00:53:40.667 --> 00:53:43.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Here I am! Send me!”

00:53:43.470 --> 00:53:47.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We encourage you to progress to spiritual maturity

00:53:47.274 --> 00:53:49.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and serve Jehovah whole-souled.

00:53:49.676 --> 00:53:53.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In due time, you may qualify to serve at Bethel

00:53:53.446 --> 00:53:57.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or in another form of exciting theocratic service

00:53:57.284 --> 00:54:00.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that permits you to use the health and strength

00:54:00.086 --> 00:54:03.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has granted you in an expanded way,

00:54:03.590 --> 00:54:05.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all to his praise.

00:54:07.093 --> 00:54:09.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please be assured that we love you

00:54:09.963 --> 00:54:12.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the willing spirit you show

00:54:12.065 --> 00:54:15.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you continue to reach out in Jehovah’s service.

00:54:17.137 --> 00:54:19.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Pat.

00:54:19.172 --> 00:54:22.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hope
that the information Brother LaFranca shared

00:54:22.909 --> 00:54:25.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
motivates many more to have

00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:29.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the prophet Isaiah’s willing and self-sacrificing spirit.

00:54:29.282 --> 00:54:33.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So much of what Jehovah provides encourages us

00:54:33.053 --> 00:54:35.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep busy with spiritual things.

00:54:35.755 --> 00:54:39.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For one,
we’re looking forward to our upcoming conventions.

00:54:39.926 --> 00:54:44.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme for this year is “‘Love Never Fails’!”

00:54:44.331 --> 00:54:47.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like a preview of the program?

00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:49.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look.

00:54:49.102 --> 00:54:51.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love

00:54:51.705 --> 00:54:53.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—is it gone?

00:54:55.976 --> 00:54:58.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have we lost it?

00:54:59.846 --> 00:55:01.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it the possession of the wealthy?

00:55:03.249 --> 00:55:05.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the strong?

00:55:06.319 --> 00:55:08.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or is it somewhere else?

00:55:09.656 --> 00:55:13.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the 2019 convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:55:13.626 --> 00:55:16.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will learn what real love is,

00:55:16.629 --> 00:55:18.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where to find it,

00:55:18.331 --> 00:55:19.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to show it

00:55:19.966 --> 00:55:22.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have it shown in return.

00:55:27.207 --> 00:55:30.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God cares deeply about you.

00:55:30.310 --> 00:55:31.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he wants you to know

00:55:31.444 --> 00:55:33.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in this hate-filled world,

00:55:33.813 --> 00:55:37.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
love can be found.

00:55:37.350 --> 00:55:39.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is not lost.

00:55:39.786 --> 00:55:44.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that love will never fail.

00:55:49.229 --> 00:55:53.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ve discussed,
we should never underestimate the power

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:57.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our brotherhood
to help us overcome worries and anxiety.

00:55:57.804 --> 00:56:02.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our conventions are wonderful opportunities
for us to encourage one another

00:56:02.242 --> 00:56:06.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the hundreds,
thousands, and tens of thousands.

00:56:06.846 --> 00:56:09.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this year, we’re especially excited

00:56:09.916 --> 00:56:12.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that 24 international conventions

00:56:12.819 --> 00:56:15.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be held throughout the world.

00:56:15.121 --> 00:56:20.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Use the opportunity
to get to know more of your brothers and sisters

00:56:20.126 --> 00:56:25.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the regional
or international convention you attend.

00:56:25.031 --> 00:56:27.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To conclude this month’s program,

00:56:27.567 --> 00:56:30.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s visit our brothers in Turkey.

00:56:30.303 --> 00:56:34.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turkey is a nation of more than 80 million people

00:56:34.674 --> 00:56:38.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a land rich in Bible history.

00:56:39.245 --> 00:56:44.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turkey occupies a unique geographic position,
bridging Europe and Asia.

00:56:45.552 --> 00:56:49.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s here that Noah’s ark
came to rest near Mount Ararat,

00:56:49.255 --> 00:56:51.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turkey’s highest mountain.

00:56:52.759 --> 00:56:56.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the land
of the congregations in Colossae and Galatia,

00:56:56.262 --> 00:56:58.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as all seven congregations

00:56:58.598 --> 00:57:00.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mentioned in Revelation.

00:57:01.901 --> 00:57:04.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The territory is diverse and vast,

00:57:04.070 --> 00:57:07.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a publisher-to-population ratio

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:10.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 1 to more than 26,000.

00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:14.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the capital city of Ankara,

00:57:14.047 --> 00:57:16.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a single congregation is working hard

00:57:16.349 --> 00:57:19.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach almost 5.5 million people.

00:57:21.654 --> 00:57:26.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many congregations in Turkey
focus on public witnessing, with encouraging results.

00:57:27.727 --> 00:57:30.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit the Hatay Congregation,

00:57:30.263 --> 00:57:33.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
near the ancient city of Syrian Antioch.

00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:38.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul used Antioch
as his home base for his missionary tours.

00:57:38.538 --> 00:57:43.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was here
that the disciples were first called Christians.

00:57:43.543 --> 00:57:45.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today,

00:57:45.078 --> 00:57:48.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this part of Turkey is known for its food

00:57:49.782 --> 00:57:53.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such as spices, herbs, fruits, and sweets.

00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent times,

00:57:55.822 --> 00:57:59.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
unrest and war have disrupted the region.

00:57:59.626 --> 00:58:04.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of our brothers and sisters
have been so near to the conflict

00:58:04.097 --> 00:58:08.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they could hear
explosions from bombs and gunfire.

00:58:08.868 --> 00:58:12.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite these threats and anxieties,

00:58:12.238 --> 00:58:17.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the 56 publishers, including 11 regular pioneers

00:58:17.177 --> 00:58:20.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 2 special pioneers, attend the meetings

00:58:20.146 --> 00:58:23.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and preach without letup.

00:58:23.082 --> 00:58:27.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in Turkey send their love and greetings

00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:29.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:58:29.722 --> 00:58:34.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our love goes back to them
for their zeal and steadfast faith.

00:58:34.627 --> 00:58:37.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
