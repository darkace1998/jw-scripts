00:02.397 --> 00:05.359
We would like to welcome all of you 


00:05.358 --> 00:09.028
to this update on the situation facing 


00:09.028 --> 00:11.740
our brothers in Russia.


00:11.740 --> 00:15.660
As you know, on April 20th, 


00:15.660 --> 00:20.165
the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation 


00:20.165 --> 00:26.088
ruled against Jehovah’s Witnesses 
and decided to liquidate


00:26.088 --> 00:30.675
the Administrative Center 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia 


00:30.675 --> 00:35.222
and all of our Local Religious Organizations. 


00:35.222 --> 00:37.892
We appealed this decision, 


00:37.892 --> 00:40.269
and the hearing for the appeal 


00:40.268 --> 00:45.983
took place in Moscow on July 17th. 


00:45.983 --> 00:50.905
Sadly, the three-judge panel upheld 


00:50.905 --> 00:54.658
this unjust decision against us, 


00:54.658 --> 00:57.703
which effectively bans 


00:57.703 --> 01:01.000
our religious activity in Russia.


01:02.123 --> 01:05.710
In a few moments, 
we will be speaking 


01:05.710 --> 01:10.215
with Brother Mark Sanderson 
of the Governing Body, 


01:10.215 --> 01:14.803
who was with our brothers 
during the appeal hearing in Moscow. 


01:14.803 --> 01:18.681
But before we talk 
to Brother Sanderson, 


01:18.682 --> 01:21.977
let’s first visit with the delegation 


01:21.977 --> 01:24.187
that accompanied him 


01:24.187 --> 01:27.859
in attending 
the Supreme Court hearing. 


01:27.858 --> 01:32.780
The delegation’s resolve 
to help our brothers in Russia 


01:32.780 --> 01:37.117
reassures us of the unity  


01:37.117 --> 01:42.372
of our organization
and the need for all of us


01:42.372 --> 01:47.000
to face challenges with courage.


01:48.712 --> 01:50.880
We are en route to Heathrow Airport. 


01:50.880 --> 01:54.175
I’m flying to Frankfurt 
to meet up with some brothers 


01:54.175 --> 01:56.303
who are heading off to Moscow together 


01:56.303 --> 01:58.013
to go to the Supreme Court hearing 


01:58.013 --> 02:00.306
on July the 17th.


02:00.307 --> 02:05.145
Our delegation is made up
of 20 brothers from 18 different lands.


02:05.145 --> 02:07.480
I truly love the brothers in Russia. 


02:07.480 --> 02:10.275
I’ve had association with them 
for many years. 


02:10.275 --> 02:12.277
I was in a Russian congregation, 


02:12.277 --> 02:16.000
and so my heart is right 
with the brothers and sisters in Russia.


02:17.407 --> 02:21.579
I worked in the Russian-language field 
for 13 years before I came to Bethel. 


02:21.578 --> 02:24.246
So I feel like 
the Russian brothers and sisters 


02:24.247 --> 02:26.875
are really my family.


02:26.875 --> 02:28.585
Everywhere I go, 
the brothers are always asking, 


02:28.585 --> 02:31.172
“How are the friends in Russia?” 


02:31.172 --> 02:35.259
And they want me to reassure them 
that they have been praying for them, 


02:35.258 --> 02:38.511
and that’s not just mature brothers 
in the congregation


02:38.512 --> 02:41.807
—young children ask the question as well 
because they have been taught to pray 


02:41.807 --> 02:43.559
for their brothers in Russia.


02:43.558 --> 02:45.518
I could have filled up my luggage 


02:45.518 --> 02:49.398
with many drawings 
from the children in Belgium 


02:49.398 --> 02:52.943
for the brothers
—their little brothers in Russia. 


02:52.943 --> 02:58.031
And we also have heard of some cases 
of inactive brothers and sisters 


02:58.032 --> 03:00.159
who have been deeply moved 


03:00.158 --> 03:03.578
by the determination 
of our brothers in Russia.


03:03.578 --> 03:06.581
The brothers in Sweden 


03:06.582 --> 03:08.875
were so impressed 


03:08.875 --> 03:10.627
by their fine attitude, 


03:10.627 --> 03:14.965
especially when the police 
were raiding the Kingdom Halls. 


03:14.965 --> 03:17.092
Sometimes they were threatened, 


03:17.092 --> 03:20.000
but they were sitting there quiet and calm, 


03:21.097 --> 03:24.600
and they were not insulting in return.


03:24.600 --> 03:27.310
Do I fear going to Russia 
where our work is under ban? 


03:27.310 --> 03:29.605
Not at all. 


03:29.605 --> 03:32.148
There is no reason to be afraid. 


03:32.148 --> 03:35.193
I am ready to join my brothers 
and stand by their side 


03:35.193 --> 03:37.000
in this historic moment.


03:38.280 --> 03:40.782
I’m not afraid to go to Russia, 


03:40.782 --> 03:43.619
not because I feel I’m so strong, 


03:43.618 --> 03:47.748
but because I feel 
that Jehovah is going to be with us 


03:47.748 --> 03:50.000
and he’s the one 
who is going to be supporting us.


03:51.960 --> 03:54.212
Our intent is to try to meet 


03:54.212 --> 03:56.799
with as many of the high officials 


03:56.798 --> 04:00.676
from the various embassies 
in Moscow as possible.


04:00.677 --> 04:02.637
We have done those meetings 


04:02.637 --> 04:06.559
in the spirit of 1 Peter 3:15 


04:06.558 --> 04:10.520
where it says that we should defend 
our faith and our hope, 


04:10.520 --> 04:15.192
but do it “with a mild temper 
and deep respect.” 


04:15.192 --> 04:17.027
And that’s what we have done. 


04:17.027 --> 04:19.489
We don’t demand 
anything from the officials, 


04:19.488 --> 04:23.000
but we tell them 
what’s the situation with our brothers.


05:26.805 --> 05:30.058
The court case 
against our brothers in Russia 


05:30.058 --> 05:32.101
in some aspects 


05:32.102 --> 05:36.147
resembles the court case 
against Jesus Christ. 


05:36.147 --> 05:39.694
In Luke 22:67, 


05:39.693 --> 05:43.280
when asked if he was the Christ, 


05:43.280 --> 05:46.408
Jesus said to the Sanhedrin: 


05:46.408 --> 05:49.076
“Even if I told you, 


05:49.077 --> 05:52.330
you would not believe it at all.” 


05:52.330 --> 05:55.583
Similarly, our brothers 


05:55.583 --> 05:57.835
have been able to show striking evidence 


05:57.835 --> 06:00.880
to prove that the charges against us 


06:00.880 --> 06:03.592
are completely unfounded. 


06:03.592 --> 06:06.762
But despite such evidence, 


06:06.762 --> 06:10.224
which is clear even to non-Witnesses, 


06:10.223 --> 06:14.853
it is as if we have said nothing. 


06:14.853 --> 06:18.773
Such treatment of God’s people, though,


06:18.773 --> 06:23.000
is to be expected in these last days. 


06:24.153 --> 06:26.155
But now, we have 


06:26.155 --> 06:28.325
Brother Mark Sanderson 
of the Governing Body 


06:28.325 --> 06:29.910
tied in with us. 


06:29.910 --> 06:31.995
And first we’d like to say, Mark, 


06:31.995 --> 06:35.582
thank you very much 
for joining us for this interview. 


06:35.582 --> 06:39.670
And especially, 
thank you very much 


06:39.670 --> 06:42.000
for being with the brothers 
there in Russia.


06:43.882 --> 06:45.884
Well, thank you so much, Steve. 


06:45.883 --> 06:48.595
It really was a joy and really an honor 


06:48.595 --> 06:51.000
to be with our brothers 
in the courtroom in Russia.


06:52.390 --> 06:54.433
But now, 
let me ask you this: 


06:54.433 --> 06:58.230
What impact will this decision


06:58.230 --> 07:03.000
have on our brothers
and sisters in Russia?


07:05.028 --> 07:08.406
Well, perhaps it’s too early 
to know exactly 


07:08.407 --> 07:10.325
what will take place. 


07:10.325 --> 07:13.537
But certainly, 
when we met with various officials 


07:13.537 --> 07:15.830
at the embassies in Moscow, 


07:15.830 --> 07:20.752
their feeling is that this is going 
to give open license 


07:20.752 --> 07:23.964
for individuals who are prejudiced 


07:23.963 --> 07:28.676
to really just take out their feelings 
on all of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


07:28.677 --> 07:33.474
Already we’ve seen incidences 
of Witnesses having their homes burned; 


07:33.473 --> 07:36.225
we’ve had Kingdom Halls 
be vandalized; 


07:36.225 --> 07:40.688
we’ve had children harassed 
at school by their teachers; 


07:40.688 --> 07:43.900
we’ve had brothers threatened 
with loss of employment, 


07:43.900 --> 07:46.068
so we can expect 


07:46.068 --> 07:50.000
that we will see 
 greater persecution in that land.


07:52.533 --> 07:56.413
Well, we’re sorry to hear that, 
but we know that’s reality. 


07:56.413 --> 07:58.373
But let me ask you, 


07:58.373 --> 08:02.000
Are there options for appeal 
available at this point?


08:04.128 --> 08:06.255
Well, 
within the country of Russia, 


08:06.255 --> 08:09.633
we’ve exhausted 
all of the available appeals. 


08:09.633 --> 08:12.803
But of course, 
we are going to take this matter 


08:12.803 --> 08:15.223
to the European Court 
of Human Rights. 


08:15.223 --> 08:17.641
In fact, 
within the next day or two, 


08:17.642 --> 08:22.230
we will be applying 
for what is called “interim measures,”


08:22.230 --> 08:25.400
where the European Court, 
if they choose, 


08:25.400 --> 08:29.570
can step in 
and even attempt to block 


08:29.570 --> 08:33.950
the carrying out 
of a major decision. 


08:33.950 --> 08:38.622
Of course, really it’s very uncertain 
as to whether Russia 


08:38.622 --> 08:42.209
will actually respect 
the actions of the European Court. 


08:42.208 --> 08:45.961
We’ll have to wait and see.


08:45.962 --> 08:48.965
Mark, 
do you see any Scriptural parallels 


08:48.965 --> 08:52.000
to the events you witnessed 
at the Supreme Court?


08:54.553 --> 08:57.098
You know, Steve, 
I couldn’t help but continually think 


08:57.098 --> 08:59.391
of what Jesus had said 


08:59.392 --> 09:02.895
in Matthew 5:11 


09:02.895 --> 09:06.483
when he said 
that they would “lyingly say 


09:06.483 --> 09:10.070
every sort 
of wicked thing against you.” 


09:10.070 --> 09:13.073
And that is just exactly 
what we heard again 


09:13.073 --> 09:15.366
this time 
during the appeal hearing. 


09:15.367 --> 09:18.079
These officials 
were just repeating 


09:18.078 --> 09:22.206
these ridiculous accusations 
against Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


09:22.207 --> 09:27.170
attempting to even equate us 
with terrorist groups. 


09:27.170 --> 09:31.048
Now, 
already the authorities of the world 


09:31.048 --> 09:33.050
are speaking out about this. 


09:33.050 --> 09:37.263
The United States Commission 
on International Religious Freedom, 


09:37.263 --> 09:40.266
on Monday, 
already issued a statement. 


09:40.267 --> 09:42.977
And maybe I can just read you 
the first paragraph  


09:42.977 --> 09:45.105
of this statement that was released. 


09:45.105 --> 09:49.567
They said: “The U.S. Commission 
on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) 


09:49.567 --> 09:53.905
“denounces the Russian Supreme Court 
ruling on Monday 


09:53.905 --> 09:56.867
“rejecting an appeal 
by the Jehovah’s Witnesses 


09:56.867 --> 10:00.829
“against an April decision 
declaring them as extremist. 


10:00.828 --> 10:05.791
“USCIRF Chairman
 Daniel Mark commented 


10:05.792 --> 10:11.005
“that ‘The Supreme Court’s decision 
sadly reflects the government’s 


10:11.005 --> 10:15.968
“‘continued equating 
of peaceful religious freedom practice 


10:15.968 --> 10:17.970
“‘to extremism. 


10:17.970 --> 10:21.348
“‘The Witnesses 
are not an extremist group, 


10:21.348 --> 10:24.768
“‘and should be able 
to practice their faith openly 


10:24.768 --> 10:29.440
and freely and 
without government repression.’” 


10:29.440 --> 10:32.818
So these government officials of the world


10:32.818 --> 10:34.905
—they recognize the truth. 


10:34.905 --> 10:37.532
They understand that these charges 


10:37.532 --> 10:41.000
that have been laid against us 
are truly ridiculous and absurd.


10:42.078 --> 10:45.081
What a powerful statement 
you read there! 


10:45.082 --> 10:49.669
Now, we learned in the segment 
we just watched 


10:49.668 --> 10:52.588
that the brothers in the delegation 


10:52.588 --> 10:54.966
had an opportunity to speak 


10:54.967 --> 10:58.052
to embassy representatives in Moscow. 


10:58.052 --> 11:00.097
Let me ask you, Mark, 


11:00.097 --> 11:03.000
What were the results of those meetings?


11:04.642 --> 11:07.895
Well, just to begin, Steve, 
I’d like to just comment 


11:07.895 --> 11:10.315
about the courage of these men 


11:10.315 --> 11:12.900
who accepted 
this assignment to go to Moscow. 


11:12.900 --> 11:17.363
You know, when they were invited 
to come on this assignment, 


11:17.363 --> 11:22.201
not one of these men 
even for a moment asked a question like: 


11:22.202 --> 11:24.000
“Is this safe?” 


11:25.122 --> 11:28.875
“Will I be in danger 
in going on this assignment?” 


11:28.875 --> 11:32.587
Immediately they said yes 
and began making their plans. 


11:32.587 --> 11:34.630
And then once in Moscow, 


11:34.630 --> 11:38.050
we divided into five different groups 


11:38.050 --> 11:41.597
so that we could visit the embassies 


11:41.597 --> 11:44.515
of the countries that we belonged to. 


11:44.515 --> 11:47.143
And so, myself, 
I was assigned to go 


11:47.143 --> 11:50.438
with the group that met 
with four different embassies. 


11:50.438 --> 11:54.608
We visited the United States, 
the United Kingdom, 


11:54.608 --> 11:57.570
the European Union, 
and Canada. 


11:57.570 --> 12:00.240
And at each of these four embassies, 


12:00.240 --> 12:02.992
we were given a beautiful reception. 


12:02.992 --> 12:05.495
In one case, 
we met with an ambassador; 


12:05.495 --> 12:08.038
in two cases, 
we met with deputy ambassadors; 


12:08.038 --> 12:11.793
and in the final one, 
we met with one of the secretaries. 


12:11.793 --> 12:13.795
But I have to say, 


12:13.795 --> 12:17.257
as these people listened 
to what we had to say, 


12:17.257 --> 12:19.969
of course they’re already 
very informed about our issue, 


12:19.968 --> 12:23.763
the question that kept coming 
over and over again was: 


12:23.763 --> 12:25.806
“Why Jehovah’s Witnesses? 


12:25.807 --> 12:28.519
“Why is it that Jehovah’s Witnesses 
are receiving 


12:28.518 --> 12:31.228
this kind of attention 
from the government?” 


12:31.228 --> 12:35.275
Well, we were able 
to give a very, very fine witness 


12:35.275 --> 12:37.818
and include many Scriptural thoughts. 


12:37.818 --> 12:41.615
And particularly to one ambassador 
who’s a real gentleman 


12:41.615 --> 12:43.992
and really listened to us patiently, 


12:43.992 --> 12:48.622
we were able to say 
that Jehovah’s Witnesses have come 


12:48.622 --> 12:51.625
through the concentration camps 
in the Nazi times, 


12:51.625 --> 12:54.877
we’ve survived being exiled to Siberia, 


12:54.877 --> 12:57.547
we survived the work camps in the Gulag, 


12:57.547 --> 13:02.094
and all of this because 
of the protection of our God, Jehovah. 


13:02.093 --> 13:04.095
That’s why we’re still here, 


13:04.095 --> 13:08.642
and we continue to look 
to our God, Jehovah, for his protection. 


13:08.642 --> 13:12.312
And so the reason that we had come 
to see these officials 


13:12.312 --> 13:15.399
was because 
we are reasonable people, 


13:15.398 --> 13:18.443
and we wanted to talk 
to other reasonable people 


13:18.443 --> 13:22.530
to see what might be done 
to help our brothers and sisters. 


13:22.530 --> 13:26.408
And these officials 
were so extremely receptive 


13:26.408 --> 13:28.578
to this type of approach. 


13:28.578 --> 13:30.913
And what an honor 
it was to be able 


13:30.913 --> 13:33.541
to praise the name 
of Jehovah before them!


13:33.542 --> 13:36.294
Very encouraging, Mark. 


13:36.293 --> 13:39.380
How did the brothers, 
though, react 


13:39.380 --> 13:43.000
when they heard the negative decision?


13:44.885 --> 13:47.263
Well, you know, Steve, 


13:47.263 --> 13:51.141
there’s always been 
a joyful presence in the courtroom 


13:51.142 --> 13:54.229
on these different occasions 
when I’ve been present in Russia, 


13:54.228 --> 13:57.481
but this time 
with the reading of this decision, 


13:57.482 --> 14:00.902
there is certainly 
a soberness among our brothers, 


14:00.902 --> 14:04.864
and they recognize 
the seriousness of this matter. 


14:04.863 --> 14:08.241
But I have to say, 
I think the apostle Paul 


14:08.242 --> 14:12.080
really sums up the way 
our brothers feel in Russia. 


14:12.080 --> 14:17.043
In 2 Corinthians 4:8, 
where he said: 


14:17.043 --> 14:20.171
“We are hard-pressed 
in every way, 


14:20.172 --> 14:22.590
“but not cramped 
beyond movement; 


14:22.590 --> 14:24.758
“we are perplexed, 


14:24.758 --> 14:27.511
“but not absolutely 
with no way out; 


14:27.512 --> 14:31.349
“we are persecuted,
but not abandoned;


14:31.348 --> 14:35.228
we are knocked down, 
but not destroyed.” 


14:35.228 --> 14:39.856
And I think just even in a small way,
 you know where it says 


14:39.857 --> 14:42.610
that “we are persecuted, 
but not abandoned,” 


14:42.610 --> 14:45.530
I think that to have 


14:45.530 --> 14:48.700
this international delegation 
in the courtroom; 


14:48.700 --> 14:51.912
to see that brothers 
were willing to come, 


14:51.912 --> 14:54.289
risking their own safety 
to support the brothers; 


14:54.288 --> 14:57.958
to be there with them 
in the courtroom at this difficult time 


14:57.958 --> 15:01.921
was just a reassurance 
that Jehovah himself was with them 


15:01.922 --> 15:03.924
and that these representatives, 


15:03.923 --> 15:06.216
in some small way, 


15:06.217 --> 15:10.305
represented to them 
Jehovah’s love, Jehovah’s care, 


15:10.305 --> 15:14.433
and that certainly 
we were not going to abandon   


15:14.433 --> 15:18.000
our dear brothers in Russia, 
no matter what situation may come.


15:19.397 --> 15:21.859
I like that thought too, Mark, 


15:21.858 --> 15:24.485
that we’re knocked down 


15:24.485 --> 15:27.113
but we’re not destroyed. 


15:27.113 --> 15:30.825
We could say we’re knocked down 
but not knocked out. 


15:30.825 --> 15:32.535
That’s right.


15:32.535 --> 15:34.578
With Jehovah’s help, 
we get back up again.


15:34.578 --> 15:38.415
But now, how have our brothers 
and sisters in Russia been faring  


15:38.415 --> 15:42.000
since the first Supreme Court 
ruling in April?


15:43.588 --> 15:46.756
Well, you know, Steve, 
as I mentioned earlier, 


15:46.757 --> 15:49.219
there have been many incidents


15:49.218 --> 15:53.346
across the country of vandalism, 
of attacks, of course. 


15:53.347 --> 15:57.352
We’ve been reporting on jw.org 


15:57.352 --> 15:59.520
about our dear 
Brother Dennis Christensen 


15:59.520 --> 16:02.732
who was arrested 
and has been held now 


16:02.732 --> 16:07.654
for two months, basically, 
in the prison there in Russia. 


16:07.653 --> 16:12.283
He has not been allowed to communicate 
with his wife during this time. 


16:12.283 --> 16:15.620
And now we learned, 
when we were present in Russia, 


16:15.620 --> 16:19.498
that the officials only allow him 
to shower twice a week. 


16:19.498 --> 16:20.541
Can you imagine? 


16:20.542 --> 16:24.295
Treating him as though 
he was a very, very serious criminal 


16:24.295 --> 16:27.090
when all he did 
was attend a meeting 


16:27.090 --> 16:31.135
to read God’s Word 
and worship Jehovah. 


16:31.135 --> 16:32.762
What a horrible thing! 


16:32.762 --> 16:36.349
And of course, the officials 
from all the countries of the world 


16:36.348 --> 16:40.436
recognize the terrible, terrible injustice 
that’s being done here. 


16:40.437 --> 16:42.439
But having said that, 


16:42.438 --> 16:46.233
in spite of these attacks 
that we have seen across the country, 


16:46.233 --> 16:50.405
what we also see is 
that our brothers and sisters 


16:50.405 --> 16:52.740
are continuing 
in their worship for Jehovah. 


16:52.740 --> 16:56.660
They’re continuing 
to have their meetings. 


16:56.660 --> 16:59.372
One of the brothers 
commented to me, he said: 


16:59.372 --> 17:01.624
“Some who used to 
never comment at the meetings, 


17:01.623 --> 17:05.295
“now they love to come 
and comment and express themselves. 


17:05.295 --> 17:07.297
“Some who have been inactive 


17:07.297 --> 17:09.465
have begun 
to attend the meetings again.” 


17:09.465 --> 17:10.883
And one brother told me 


17:10.883 --> 17:15.221
that when they held 
a small mini-convention, 


17:15.222 --> 17:19.184
you know, watching some of the replays
 that have been made available, 


17:19.183 --> 17:23.145
that just in their small group, 
they had five baptized. 


17:23.145 --> 17:25.690
Can you imagine? 


17:25.690 --> 17:27.733
So we can say with confidence 


17:27.733 --> 17:29.776
that all of these efforts 


17:29.777 --> 17:33.782
that are being made 
to try to stop our worship of Jehovah, 


17:33.782 --> 17:37.619
to wipe it out, 
are not going to have any success. 


17:37.618 --> 17:39.786
It really reminds me, 
would it be OK 


17:39.787 --> 17:41.957
if I just shared 
this Scriptural thought?


17:41.957 --> 17:44.417
Absolutely! 
Please.


17:44.417 --> 17:49.000
It just makes me think 
of this thought in Psalm 124. 


17:50.465 --> 17:53.508
And this really has to be 
the confidence of our brothers in Russia, 


17:53.508 --> 17:56.678
but it needs to be the confidence, really, 
of God’s people all around the world. 


17:56.678 --> 17:59.681
We have to put 
our faith in these words. 


17:59.682 --> 18:03.477
It says: 
“If Jehovah had not been with us,” 


18:03.477 --> 18:06.897
this is verse 2: 
“If Jehovah had not been with us 


18:06.897 --> 18:09.650
“when men 
rose up to attack us, 


18:09.650 --> 18:12.778
“then they 
would have swallowed us up alive 


18:12.778 --> 18:15.948
“when their anger 
was burning against us. 


18:15.948 --> 18:19.201
“Then the waters 
would have washed us away, 


18:19.202 --> 18:21.787
“the torrent 
would have swept over us. 


18:21.787 --> 18:24.957
“The raging waters 
would have overwhelmed us. 


18:24.957 --> 18:27.377
“May Jehovah be praised, 


18:27.377 --> 18:30.964
“for he has not given us 
as prey to their teeth. 


18:30.963 --> 18:34.675
“We are like a bird that escaped 
from the hunter’s trap; 


18:34.675 --> 18:38.095
“the trap was broken, 
and we escaped. 


18:38.095 --> 18:41.098
“Our help is 
in the name of Jehovah, 


18:41.098 --> 18:43.976
the Maker of heaven and earth.” 


18:43.977 --> 18:46.604
Well, you know, 
so many times, 


18:46.603 --> 18:50.358
our enemies have thought 
that they had us locked in that trap 


18:50.358 --> 18:52.610
and that there 
was no way to escape, 


18:52.610 --> 18:55.613
but how Jehovah 
has proven them wrong, 


18:55.613 --> 18:58.490
and how he has come 
to the aid of his people! 


18:58.490 --> 19:01.785
And that is the same confidence 
that we have today, 


19:01.785 --> 19:03.955
and it’s the same confidence 
our brothers will have. 


19:03.955 --> 19:07.333
It’s the same confidence we’ll have 
no matter where we are in the world 


19:07.333 --> 19:10.000
as the scene of this world 
continues to change.


19:11.003 --> 19:14.590
We wholeheartedly agree with you, 


19:14.590 --> 19:17.385
and it definitely warms our heart 


19:17.385 --> 19:20.388
to hear these strengthening comments. 


19:20.388 --> 19:22.473
Thank you very much, Mark, 


19:22.473 --> 19:24.475
and thank you again, too, 


19:24.475 --> 19:26.518
and the rest of the delegation, 


19:26.518 --> 19:29.271
for traveling to Russia


19:29.272 --> 19:32.525
to be with our dear brothers and sisters. 


19:32.525 --> 19:36.445
And we’re confident 
that your presence assured them 


19:36.445 --> 19:38.655
of Jehovah’s love 


19:38.655 --> 19:40.908
and Jehovah’s care for them.


19:40.908 --> 19:42.701
Thank you so much, Steve. 


19:42.702 --> 19:45.872
As I said, it was a great, 
great honor and privilege. 


19:45.872 --> 19:48.000
I truly love our dear brothers in Russia.


19:50.793 --> 19:55.756
Although the appeal decision 
was not in our favor, 


19:55.757 --> 19:59.427
we are not disheartened. 


19:59.427 --> 20:03.974
As our regional convention theme 
for this year emphasizes, 


20:03.973 --> 20:08.101
we do not give up! 


20:08.102 --> 20:11.397
Brothers and sisters in Russia, 


20:11.397 --> 20:13.690
we encourage you 


20:13.690 --> 20:17.612
to stay close 
to Jehovah and his organization. 


20:17.612 --> 20:20.949
Continue to pray to Jehovah for strength 


20:20.948 --> 20:24.451
to face this persecution with boldness, 


20:24.452 --> 20:28.080
knowing he will provide you 


20:28.080 --> 20:30.708
with the strength needed 


20:30.708 --> 20:34.295
along with the guidance 
and wisdom that you need. 


20:34.295 --> 20:37.298
And please know 


20:37.298 --> 20:40.341
that you are excellent examples 


20:40.342 --> 20:43.012
for the rest of us to follow 


20:43.012 --> 20:46.015
when we face persecution.


20:46.015 --> 20:48.475
We wholeheartedly agree 


20:48.475 --> 20:50.978
with the Bible writer’s expressions 


20:50.978 --> 20:54.856
in Habakkuk 3:18. 


20:54.857 --> 20:56.984
He said: 


20:56.983 --> 21:00.488
“Yet, as for me, 


21:00.488 --> 21:04.033
“I will exult in Jehovah; 


21:04.033 --> 21:06.410
“I will be joyful 


21:06.410 --> 21:09.663
in the God of my salvation.” 


21:09.663 --> 21:13.458
Yes, 
whatever the world does to us, 


21:13.458 --> 21:17.921
we maintain our faith 
in Jehovah’s saving power 


21:17.922 --> 21:22.050
and will do our utmost to remain 


21:22.050 --> 21:25.805
in Jehovah’s protective care.


21:25.805 --> 21:30.643
This is JW Broadcasting 


21:30.643 --> 21:42.968
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
