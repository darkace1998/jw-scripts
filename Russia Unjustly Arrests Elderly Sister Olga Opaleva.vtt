00:00:05.651 --> 00:00:07.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I regularly visit my mother

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.364 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to clean the house, to prepare meals,

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:13.075 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and, well, to just spend some time with her.

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:15.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A criminal case was initiated

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against Vitaliy’s mother, Olga Opaleva,

00:00:18.247 --> 00:00:21.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on November 12, 2018.

00:00:22.751 --> 00:00:25.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On November 25, officers raided her apartment

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the homes
of three other fellow believers.

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:31.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was 66 years old at the time.

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:36.432 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They used a saw

00:00:36.432 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to break through my door.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:41.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They asked me, “Why didn’t you open up?”

00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:44.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t answer them
because just the night before,

00:00:44.607 --> 00:00:46.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had had a heart attack.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Neither Olga’s age nor her health condition

00:00:50.821 --> 00:00:53.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
stopped the law enforcement officers’ cruel

00:00:53.157 --> 00:00:56.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and inhumane treatment.

00:00:56.452 --> 00:01:00.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the officers called the investigator.

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:02.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They told him what happened

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:05.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they had called an ambulance.

00:01:05.669 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyway, the investigator said,

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:10.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Bring her in for interrogation.”

00:01:10.758 --> 00:01:12.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they did.

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:16.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Olga spent the next two days
in a temporary detention facility.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After I had the heart attack,

00:01:18.557 --> 00:01:20.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I, of course, felt very ill.

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They handcuffed me,

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took me to court, and put me into that cage.

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The court ordered Olga
to be placed under house arrest.

00:01:32.488 --> 00:01:35.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
She is accused of discussing

00:01:35.282 --> 00:01:36.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Bible topics with people,

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and these kinds of conversations

00:01:38.827 --> 00:01:42.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are interpreted by the investigation
as recruitment.

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:46.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prosecution doesn’t deny the fact
that Olga Opaleva

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has done no harm
—no real harm to anyone.

00:01:50.381 --> 00:01:53.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On October 10, 2019,

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Olga had to return to court.

00:01:55.761 --> 00:01:57.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the Federal Penitentiary Service vehicle

00:01:57.888 --> 00:02:02.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
arrived to take her to court,
she suffered a stroke.

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:04.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Olga was eventually taken by ambulance

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a local hospital
and placed in intensive care.

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:10.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to her medical records,

00:02:10.442 --> 00:02:13.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she was admitted to the hospital,
she was in critical condition.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the time of her stroke,
she was under house arrest.

00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:21.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To say that I was worried
when I saw her in that condition

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be putting it mildly.

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:27.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our eyes met, the first thing she did

00:02:27.292 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was smile and then she cried.

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:33.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few days after Olga had the stroke,

00:02:33.382 --> 00:02:36.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her only son, Vitaliy Ilinykh,

00:02:36.677 --> 00:02:38.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was detained.

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:43.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this litigation began
with the criminal prosecution of my mother,

00:02:43.058 --> 00:02:44.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now it has affected me.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:47.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The court imposed a restriction

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the form of a recognizance agreement
on Vitaliy.

00:02:50.107 --> 00:02:51.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now both mother and son

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are named in criminal cases
because of their faith.

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the investigator told me,

00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:00.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If you remain one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:03:00.284 --> 00:03:03.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in essence, then you’re an ‘extremist.’”

00:03:03.495 --> 00:03:07.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The investigator refused to listen
when I tried to explain the difference

00:03:07.708 --> 00:03:10.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between faith and a legal entity.

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:14.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “That doesn’t interest me at all.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’m just doing my job.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m told what to do, and I do it.”

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:22.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s absurd to accuse
people like Olga and Vitaliy

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of activities of an “extremist” nature.

00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:28.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is becoming standard practice
among law enforcement agencies

00:03:28.604 --> 00:03:32.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to inflate the statistics
of their so-called successful fight

00:03:32.357 --> 00:03:35.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against “extremism”
by prosecuting peaceful religious believers.

00:03:35.986 --> 00:03:38.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often when investigators
have accused somebody,

00:03:38.697 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they subsequently bring charges
against their relatives.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Olga and Vitaliy do not intend to give up,

00:03:44.453 --> 00:03:47.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the persecution has not caused
their faith in God to waver.

00:03:48.624 --> 00:03:51.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s better to be in prison with God
than to be free without God.
