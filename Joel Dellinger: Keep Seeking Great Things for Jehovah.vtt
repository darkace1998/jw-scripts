Our theme this month is

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep Seeking Great Things for Jehovah.”

00:00:07.611 --> 00:00:10.030 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s based on some powerful advice

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.158 line:10% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah gave to a man named Baruch.

00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:14.785 line:10% position:50% align:center
Who was Baruch?

00:00:14.785 --> 00:00:17.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can his example teach us?

00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how can the divine counsel
he received help us today?

00:00:21.584 --> 00:00:23.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out.

00:00:23.878 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch was a faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:29.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
He appears in the Bible book of Jeremiah

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the year 625 B.C.E.

00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:35.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s start our journey

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:39.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
by reading Jeremiah 45:1:

00:00:40.728 --> 00:00:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:46.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“spoke to Baruch the son of Neriah

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:50.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when he wrote in a book
these words dictated by Jeremiah

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:54.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the fourth year
of Jehoiakim son of Josiah,

00:00:54.408 --> 00:00:56.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
the king of Judah.”

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:01.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch served
as Jeremiah’s personal secretary.

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:05.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
The two worked closely together
for some 18 years,

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:10.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
including after the destruction
of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.

00:01:10.382 --> 00:01:13.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was certainly
a special privilege of service

00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:15.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
during a very challenging time.

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:20.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why did Jeremiah need an assistant?

00:01:20.768 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some 23 years,

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:26.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah had been conveying a message
of judgment and hope

00:01:26.023 --> 00:01:28.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
to God’s people in Judah.

00:01:28.442 --> 00:01:31.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the year 625 B.C.E.,

00:01:31.028 --> 00:01:34.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
it seems that Jeremiah
had been barred from the temple area

00:01:34.949 --> 00:01:37.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah’s message was to be read.

00:01:37.701 --> 00:01:40.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, Jehovah asked Jeremiah

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
to write His warnings in a scroll.

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:47.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s where Baruch,
a scribe (or, secretary),

00:01:47.419 --> 00:01:49.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes into the picture.

00:01:49.129 --> 00:01:53.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote in a scroll
all the words that Jehovah had spoken

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
through Jeremiah up until that time

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
—23 years’ worth!

00:01:58.722 --> 00:02:02.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following year, when the time came
for the contents of that scroll

00:02:02.476 --> 00:02:05.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be read aloud in the temple courtyard,

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:08.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah asked Baruch to deliver the message.

00:02:08.524 --> 00:02:11.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, Baruch did just so.

00:02:12.236 --> 00:02:14.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened next?

00:02:14.113 --> 00:02:17.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the princes of Judah
heard what Baruch had done,

00:02:17.783 --> 00:02:20.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
they wanted to hear the message firsthand.

00:02:20.703 --> 00:02:23.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Baruch read it out loud again.

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:26.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As soon as they heard [it],”
the account says

00:02:26.917 --> 00:02:30.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they looked at one another in dread.”

00:02:30.713 --> 00:02:35.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told Baruch: “We must certainly tell
the king all these words.”

00:02:36.051 --> 00:02:38.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before doing so, they warned Baruch:

00:02:38.345 --> 00:02:41.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go and hide yourselves, you and Jeremiah,

00:02:41.473 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not let anyone know where you are.”

00:02:45.102 --> 00:02:50.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wicked King Jehoiakim was hot with anger!

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:52.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
He burned the scroll

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ordered that Jeremiah
and Baruch be arrested.

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:00.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s pause and think.

00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:05.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
From what we’ve considered so far,
what can we learn from Baruch?

00:03:05.956 --> 00:03:09.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he was humble.

00:03:09.043 --> 00:03:14.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many scholars believe that he belonged
to a prominent scribal family.

00:03:14.006 --> 00:03:16.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, when the invitation came
to help Jeremiah,

00:03:16.842 --> 00:03:19.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch “proceeded to do according to all

00:03:19.344 --> 00:03:22.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jeremiah the prophet had commanded him.”

00:03:22.598 --> 00:03:25.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like you, brothers and sisters,

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:28.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch was happy to support Jehovah’s work

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:32.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to do whatever was asked of him.

00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:37.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did not let his family status
or personal goals distract him.

00:03:37.154 --> 00:03:39.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he was humble,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
he put Jehovah’s will first in his life.

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:47.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch also demonstrated endurance.

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:51.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think putting 23 years’ worth

00:03:51.376 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
of divine messages in writing took some time?

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course.

00:03:56.006 --> 00:04:00.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch didn’t have a modern tool,
such as a smartphone, tablet, or computer.

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:03.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a lot of manual work.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
And imagine Baruch’s shock

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the king burned up the first scroll.

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was Jehovah’s message.

00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:18.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the scroll that Baruch
had written by hand

00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:21.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hours of work up in smoke!

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:27.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 36:32 says:

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:32.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jeremiah then took another scroll
and gave it to Baruch . . . ,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and at Jeremiah’s dictation

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he wrote on it all the words of the scroll

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that King Jehoiakim of Judah
had burned in the fire.

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many more words like those were added.”

00:04:46.723 --> 00:04:50.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Baruch, we too need endurance

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:53.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stick to our sacred work
when there are challenges.

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider, too, Baruch’s courage.

00:04:57.943 --> 00:05:02.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
He must have known how dangerous
it would be to work with Jeremiah.

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:05.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Earlier, the same king
that burned up the scroll

00:05:05.868 --> 00:05:07.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
killed another prophet of Jehovah,

00:05:07.995 --> 00:05:10.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Urijah, by the sword.

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:16.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Baruch fearlessly used his
professional skills and contacts

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:18.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
to support Jehovah’s prophet.

00:05:19.047 --> 00:05:22.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s so much we can learn
from this God-fearing man

00:05:22.968 --> 00:05:25.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
who demonstrated humility,

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
endurance, and courage.

00:05:28.015 --> 00:05:31.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loved Baruch, and so do we.

00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Baruch, like us,

00:05:35.898 --> 00:05:38.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
confronted negative thoughts and feelings.

00:05:38.901 --> 00:05:42.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was one challenge
that could have cost him dearly.

00:05:42.613 --> 00:05:44.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it?

00:05:44.072 --> 00:05:46.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s continue the reading

00:05:46.074 --> 00:05:49.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Jeremiah 45:2, 3.

00:05:49.745 --> 00:05:54.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And please note
Jehovah’s personal interest in Baruch.

00:05:54.541 --> 00:05:57.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah 45:2, 3 says:

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what Jehovah the God of Israel says

00:06:01.548 --> 00:06:04.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
“concerning you, Baruch,

00:06:04.134 --> 00:06:07.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You have said: “Woe to me,

00:06:07.429 --> 00:06:10.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“for Jehovah has added grief to my pain!

00:06:10.724 --> 00:06:13.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“I am weary from my groaning,

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:16.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I have found no resting-place.”’”

00:06:17.898 --> 00:06:21.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was Baruch feeling like that?

00:06:21.193 --> 00:06:23.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he getting tired of his assignment

00:06:23.946 --> 00:06:27.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps the circumstances
in which he had to perform it?

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:30.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep reading verses 4 and 5:

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:33.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You should say to him,

00:06:33.664 --> 00:06:36.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This is what Jehovah says:

00:06:36.208 --> 00:06:40.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Look! What I have built up

00:06:40.128 --> 00:06:42.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“I am tearing down,

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“and what I have planted I am uprooting

00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:47.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“—the entire land.

00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:51.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“But you are seeking
great things for yourself.

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:54.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Stop seeking such things.

00:06:54.226 --> 00:06:57.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For I am about to bring
a calamity on all flesh,”

00:06:57.521 --> 00:07:01.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘declares Jehovah, “and wherever you may go,

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:04.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will grant you your life as a spoil.”’”

00:07:06.822 --> 00:07:11.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
What reason did Jehovah give
for Baruch’s feelings?

00:07:11.702 --> 00:07:16.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was not the assignment itself
or even his circumstances.

00:07:16.748 --> 00:07:21.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 5, Jehovah said:
“You are seeking great things for yourself.”

00:07:22.337 --> 00:07:24.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about that.

00:07:24.131 --> 00:07:26.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was Baruch’s own view

00:07:26.675 --> 00:07:30.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what seemed great or most important.

00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:34.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a time, he was focused
on “seeking great things” for himself.

00:07:35.976 --> 00:07:39.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think
those “great things” could have been?

00:07:39.438 --> 00:07:43.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it a desire for fame or prestige?

00:07:43.108 --> 00:07:46.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was he sensing
that his support for God’s prophet

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:49.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
was putting at risk his position and career?

00:07:49.823 --> 00:07:52.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or did the “great things”
have to do with getting more money,

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:55.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
property, or some material possessions?

00:07:55.495 --> 00:07:59.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know,
but Baruch knew what they were.

00:07:59.583 --> 00:08:04.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah’s counsel was clear:
“Stop seeking such things.”

00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:09.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems Baruch
took Jehovah’s counsel to heart.

00:08:10.093 --> 00:08:13.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
I imagine him reasoning something like this:

00:08:14.765 --> 00:08:19.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah knows my thoughts and feelings.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Have I really been seeking
great things for myself?

00:08:24.316 --> 00:08:25.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s true.

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:27.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah is always right.

00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:30.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘My desires got the better of me,

00:08:30.697 --> 00:08:33.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and I was so distressed!

00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘But Jehovah is kindly telling me:
“Baruch, be realistic.

00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:40.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“A divine judgment is coming.

00:08:40.332 --> 00:08:44.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Everything that seems so stable
will be uprooted.”

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:49.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Material things, property,
money, or a prominent career

00:08:49.841 --> 00:08:51.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘—it’s all temporary.

00:08:51.676 --> 00:08:54.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Seeking those things is dangerous.

00:08:55.097 --> 00:08:58.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah wants me and others

00:08:58.308 --> 00:09:01.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to survive the coming calamity.

00:09:01.269 --> 00:09:04.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And that’s what I want.

00:09:04.064 --> 00:09:08.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
I need to get back to seeking
great things for Jehovah!’

00:09:10.153 --> 00:09:15.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s just a possibility
of how Baruch might have been thinking.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did he accept and follow the counsel?

00:09:18.787 --> 00:09:20.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes!

00:09:20.372 --> 00:09:25.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem,
about 17 years later,

00:09:25.377 --> 00:09:28.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch appears again in the inspired record,

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:30.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
supporting Jeremiah.

00:09:30.424 --> 00:09:32.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
And though many others died

00:09:32.342 --> 00:09:35.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the catastrophic
destruction of Jerusalem,

00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:38.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch and Jeremiah survived.

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:42.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baruch’s humble response
to Jehovah’s counsel

00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:44.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
saved his life.

00:09:45.272 --> 00:09:48.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
And such a response to divine counsel

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:51.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
can do the same for us.

00:09:52.112 --> 00:09:54.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure, as you think more about Baruch,

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:58.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see other ways
we can benefit from his example.

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:02.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s briefly discuss
one particular challenge that some of us

00:10:02.414 --> 00:10:07.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
might be facing right now
and how Baruch’s experience can help.

00:10:07.419 --> 00:10:09.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
The challenge:

00:10:09.254 --> 00:10:12.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
being balanced while providing materially

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:14.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
for ourselves and our families.

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:17.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
In today’s world,

00:10:17.012 --> 00:10:20.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people
are “seeking great things” for themselves

00:10:20.932 --> 00:10:25.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they pursue
secular education and secular work.

00:10:25.395 --> 00:10:28.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many believe that the key to success

00:10:28.648 --> 00:10:31.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the key
to their and their family’s happiness

00:10:31.234 --> 00:10:34.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
involves money
and getting more material things,

00:10:34.988 --> 00:10:39.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a “resting-place,”
in this system of things.

00:10:39.451 --> 00:10:42.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such thinking could influence us.

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re a family head, consider Chibisa.

00:10:47.667 --> 00:10:49.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a brother in Malawi

00:10:49.711 --> 00:10:54.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
who, along with his wife and seven children,
was doing well spiritually.

00:10:54.341 --> 00:10:58.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, at one point,
they faced financial problems.

00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:02.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, there was not enough money
to buy food for each day.

00:11:02.974 --> 00:11:05.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
How stressful!

00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:10.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like many others, Chibisa decided
to go to South Africa to find work.

00:11:10.565 --> 00:11:13.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a personal decision.

00:11:13.193 --> 00:11:15.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was it wise?

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:19.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back, Chibisa said this:

00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:22.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This affected me spiritually

00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:24.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because I did not know the language,

00:11:24.162 --> 00:11:28.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was unable to preach,
and I did not benefit from the meetings.

00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:30.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Being so far from my family

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:34.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
“caused me to neglect
my responsibility as a family head.

00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:39.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a result,
my family grew weak spiritually

00:11:39.052 --> 00:11:42.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we all missed each other very much.

00:11:42.138 --> 00:11:46.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I realized that I had made
a wrong decision going abroad.

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:49.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
My conscience started to trouble me greatly.”

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:54.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
You parents must also make personal decisions

00:11:54.651 --> 00:11:58.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
about secular education for your children.

00:11:58.238 --> 00:12:01.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Naturally, you want them
to get a good education.

00:12:01.491 --> 00:12:05.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you have to think carefully
about potential dangers.

00:12:05.912 --> 00:12:07.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in some countries,

00:12:07.998 --> 00:12:12.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
parents send their young children
away to boarding schools.

00:12:12.127 --> 00:12:15.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
The March 15, 1997, issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:12:15.755 --> 00:12:18.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
discussed the Scriptural principles involved

00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:22.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and related a number of experiences
highlighting the dangers.

00:12:22.762 --> 00:12:26.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother named Clement said
that before going away to boarding school,

00:12:26.933 --> 00:12:30.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
he loved the truth
and enjoyed participating in the ministry,

00:12:30.895 --> 00:12:33.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
in family worship, and at meetings.

00:12:34.024 --> 00:12:35.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However,” he said,

00:12:35.817 --> 00:12:39.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
“once I went into boarding school
at the age of 14,

00:12:39.404 --> 00:12:42.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I left the truth completely.

00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:45.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Throughout the five years
I spent in boarding school,

00:12:45.035 --> 00:12:46.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I never attended meetings.

00:12:46.911 --> 00:12:50.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a result of bad company,
I got involved with drugs,

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:52.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
smoking, and heavy drinking.”

00:12:54.044 --> 00:12:56.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider one more situation.

00:12:56.630 --> 00:12:59.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
You younger Christians approaching adulthood

00:12:59.466 --> 00:13:01.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
must make decisions involving

00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:04.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
education and employment.

00:13:04.512 --> 00:13:06.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
There may be many choices.

00:13:06.556 --> 00:13:11.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
But which ones will help you
live up to your dedication to Jehovah?

00:13:11.061 --> 00:13:13.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister said this:

00:13:13.146 --> 00:13:16.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As a baptized Witness,
I had read and heard

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:19.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about the dangers
of pursuing university education,

00:13:19.653 --> 00:13:21.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I dismissed such warnings.

00:13:21.946 --> 00:13:26.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought the counsel did not apply to me.”

00:13:26.951 --> 00:13:30.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, our sister
made her personal choice in the matter.

00:13:30.121 --> 00:13:32.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was it a wise one?

00:13:32.082 --> 00:13:33.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
She continues:

00:13:33.833 --> 00:13:38.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Studying for my courses
took so much time and effort

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that I was too busy

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:43.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to linger in prayer to Jehovah
the way I used to,

00:13:43.551 --> 00:13:47.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“too exhausted to enjoy
Bible discussions with others,

00:13:47.055 --> 00:13:50.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and too tired
to prepare well for the meetings.

00:13:50.684 --> 00:13:54.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thankfully, once I realized
that being immersed in higher education

00:13:54.562 --> 00:13:57.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was damaging my relationship with Jehovah,

00:13:57.524 --> 00:13:59.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I knew I had to stop.

00:13:59.609 --> 00:14:01.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I did.”

00:14:02.779 --> 00:14:06.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of what do these
real-life examples remind us?

00:14:06.825 --> 00:14:11.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Satan’s system of things,
we will face challenges

00:14:11.037 --> 00:14:13.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
that test our determination

00:14:13.581 --> 00:14:16.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put Jehovah’s will first in our lives.

00:14:16.626 --> 00:14:21.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Baruch,
personal desires could distract us.

00:14:21.047 --> 00:14:22.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that ever happens,

00:14:22.799 --> 00:14:27.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to take quick action
to correct our viewpoint, as did Baruch.

00:14:28.388 --> 00:14:30.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
Happily, through the Bible

00:14:30.432 --> 00:14:33.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spiritual instruction
from the faithful slave,

00:14:33.184 --> 00:14:37.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah helps us make
better choices in personal areas of life,

00:14:37.397 --> 00:14:42.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as those involving
secular education and secular work.

00:14:42.068 --> 00:14:45.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 32:8, he promises:

00:14:46.906 --> 00:14:51.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will give you insight
and instruct you in the way you should go.

00:14:51.953 --> 00:14:56.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will give you advice with my eye upon you.”

00:14:57.792 --> 00:15:02.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are wise to seek out
such advice by doing research,

00:15:02.839 --> 00:15:07.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
by talking to mature Christians,
and then applying such counsel.

00:15:07.677 --> 00:15:09.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chibisa did that.

00:15:09.763 --> 00:15:13.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
After moving to South Africa,
his conscience started bothering him

00:15:13.933 --> 00:15:17.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he remembered the example of Baruch.

00:15:17.145 --> 00:15:19.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chibisa said this:

00:15:19.147 --> 00:15:24.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Baruch may have wanted
to pursue material riches as I had.

00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:27.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he was helped, he returned.

00:15:27.238 --> 00:15:31.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I decided then to put Jehovah in first place

00:15:31.117 --> 00:15:33.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
“instead of searching for material things.

00:15:33.536 --> 00:15:38.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So I started to make changes to go home
and help my family spiritually.

00:15:38.082 --> 00:15:41.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I left South Africa
and reached the border of Malawi . . . ,

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I felt great happiness in my heart,

00:15:44.547 --> 00:15:46.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I am still happy . . .

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Studying the Bible has helped me.

00:15:49.177 --> 00:15:51.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We still encounter financial problems,

00:15:51.971 --> 00:15:54.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but I remember that in Satan’s world,

00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:58.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there is nowhere we can go
and have no problems. . . .

00:15:58.228 --> 00:16:01.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My family is progressing spiritually.

00:16:01.439 --> 00:16:05.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And this makes me very happy,

00:16:05.068 --> 00:16:09.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my relationship
with Jehovah is strong.”

Like Baruch,

00:16:12.116 --> 00:16:16.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Chibisa was humble and courageous.

00:16:16.579 --> 00:16:19.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know those same qualities

00:16:19.123 --> 00:16:22.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
characterize you, brothers and sisters!

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:25.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when Jehovah, our loving Father,

00:16:25.088 --> 00:16:29.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us timely advice,
as he did to his close friend Baruch,

00:16:29.634 --> 00:16:31.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s take it to heart.

00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:35.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s do whatever it takes
to make sure we and our families

00:16:35.682 --> 00:16:39.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue “seeking first the Kingdom
and [God’s] righteousness.”

00:16:39.853 --> 00:16:41.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And never forget,

00:16:41.604 --> 00:16:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we continue to seek
great things for Jehovah,

00:16:45.441 --> 00:16:49.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll continue to do great things
for us and our families!

00:16:49.529 --> 00:16:54.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, it’s his blessing
that makes us truly rich,

00:16:54.117 --> 00:16:56.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he adds no pain with it.”
