00:01.450 --> 00:04.087
Welcome, brothers and sisters! 


00:04.087 --> 00:08.625
As Jesus’ followers, 
we’re happy to be related in the faith. 


00:08.625 --> 00:13.497
This month’s program 
is full of faithful examples and ways 


00:13.497 --> 00:17.534
you and I can act in faith 
to make things happen. 


00:17.533 --> 00:20.303
We’ll visit with the Lachmuth sisters 


00:20.303 --> 00:22.105
at the Canada branch. 


00:22.105 --> 00:25.742
How did their faith help them adjust 
 to leaving their home in Canada 


00:25.742 --> 00:28.277
to serve in a missionary assignment 


00:28.277 --> 00:31.214
in India?


00:31.213 --> 00:34.783
For decades, 
the apartheid laws in South Africa 


00:34.783 --> 00:37.720
separated our brothers from one another. 


00:37.720 --> 00:41.490
How were their neutrality, brotherly love,
and faith in Jehovah  


00:41.490 --> 00:44.560
put to the test? 


00:44.560 --> 00:47.430
And our music video depicts 
how a person’s faith grows 


00:47.430 --> 00:50.233
from when they first study the Bible 


00:50.233 --> 00:54.470
to when they face trials 
as a dedicated Witness of Jehovah. 


00:54.470 --> 00:58.273
This is the April 2017 edition 


00:58.273 --> 01:01.000
of JW Broadcasting!


01:20.062 --> 01:22.332
Has fear of failure 


01:22.332 --> 01:25.169
ever held you back 
from doing something good, 


01:25.168 --> 01:27.770
even something for Jehovah? 


01:27.770 --> 01:31.440
Some have hesitated 
to dedicate themselves to God 


01:31.440 --> 01:35.612
and get baptized, 
for fear of breaking God’s laws. 


01:35.612 --> 01:39.549
In other cases, 
we might not reach out for a form of service 


01:39.548 --> 01:42.000
because we feel 
we cannot do a good job. 


01:43.285 --> 01:45.322
In this dramatization,


01:45.322 --> 01:49.259
a Bible student faces his fear of failure. 


01:49.258 --> 01:53.228
It’s based on lessons found 
in chapter 1 of the book 


01:53.228 --> 01:56.065
“Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.” 


01:56.065 --> 01:58.902
Look for what helps him 
overcome his fear 


01:58.902 --> 02:01.000
and move ahead in faith.


02:08.077 --> 02:11.000
When is your turn, Dad?


02:15.785 --> 02:18.588
Our family was contacted 
by Jehovah’s Witnesses 


02:18.588 --> 02:20.456
a few years ago.


02:20.457 --> 02:22.692
Rachel started studying first.


02:22.692 --> 02:24.860
Soon, we all joined in.


02:24.860 --> 02:27.997
For the first time, we were all learning 


02:27.997 --> 02:30.032
what the Bible really teaches.


02:30.032 --> 02:32.035
It wasn’t long 


02:32.035 --> 02:35.638
before we were sharing 
the truth with others.


02:35.638 --> 02:38.000
Well, most of us were.


02:39.508 --> 02:41.610
I knew it was the truth, 


02:41.610 --> 02:43.680
but I didn’t know if I could live up to 


02:43.680 --> 02:46.000
everything Jehovah asks.


02:48.985 --> 02:51.000
Get away.


02:52.655 --> 02:55.000
What if I let everyone down?


02:56.825 --> 03:00.000
What if I let Jehovah down?


03:14.477 --> 03:16.245
You know, 
can you just give me one second?


03:16.245 --> 03:17.247
Yeah, no problem. 


03:17.247 --> 03:19.882
All right. 
Yeah.


03:19.882 --> 03:23.319
A kind elder named Ben 
noticed I was struggling.


03:23.318 --> 03:25.588
You OK?


03:25.588 --> 03:27.656
He took the initiative to help.


03:27.657 --> 03:30.360
He asked, 
“What drew you to Jehovah 


03:30.360 --> 03:33.697
in the first place?”


03:33.697 --> 03:37.667
I guess it was learning 
that Jehovah isn’t harsh and demanding, 


03:37.667 --> 03:40.337
but that he’s a loving Father.


03:40.337 --> 03:42.672
Ben agreed and said, 


03:42.672 --> 03:45.174
“When we do our best to serve Jehovah, 


03:45.173 --> 03:47.376
he does the rest.” 


03:47.377 --> 03:50.045
He explained that Jehovah 
knows our limitations 


03:50.045 --> 03:52.082
and doesn’t expect perfection. 


03:52.082 --> 03:54.084
And he’s always there to help 


03:54.083 --> 03:57.886
because he wants us to succeed.


03:57.887 --> 04:01.190
Then he read Isaiah 41:10: 


04:01.190 --> 04:03.192
“Do not be afraid, 


04:03.192 --> 04:05.227
“for I am with you. 


04:05.227 --> 04:07.230
“Do not be anxious, 


04:07.230 --> 04:10.000
“for I am your God. 


04:14.370 --> 04:17.807
I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,” 


04:17.807 --> 04:18.609
Help!


04:18.608 --> 04:20.743
“I will really hold on to you 


04:20.743 --> 04:24.000
with my right hand of righteousness.”


04:28.652 --> 04:31.887
I don’t need to be perfect to serve Jehovah. 


04:31.887 --> 04:36.392
I just need to love him and trust him. 


04:36.392 --> 04:39.000
And he’ll do the rest.


04:45.033 --> 04:48.236
Our brother learned 
what the love of God means.


04:48.237 --> 04:50.740
As 1 John 5:3 tells us,


04:50.740 --> 04:53.375
it means “that we observe 
his commandments; 


04:53.375 --> 04:56.545
and yet his commandments 
are not burdensome.”


04:56.545 --> 05:00.983
Jehovah is a loving Father 
who wants us to succeed.


05:00.983 --> 05:04.820
As our brother concluded, 
we need to trust Jehovah,


05:04.820 --> 05:07.000
knowing He’ll do the rest.


05:08.323 --> 05:10.960
That lesson provides 
an excellent introduction 


05:10.960 --> 05:13.062
to our discussion for this month. 


05:13.062 --> 05:18.334
The theme is 
“Faith in Jehovah Makes It Happen.”


05:18.333 --> 05:20.670
During his earthly ministry, 


05:20.670 --> 05:22.672
Jesus miraculously healed 


05:22.672 --> 05:25.207
many sick or disabled persons. 


05:25.207 --> 05:27.510
At times, 
he would say to such ones 


05:27.510 --> 05:31.447
the expression we find 
at Matthew 9:29: 


05:31.447 --> 05:36.452
“According to your faith 
let it happen to you.” 


05:36.452 --> 05:38.755
The principle of what Jesus stated 


05:38.755 --> 05:43.292
applies in every aspect 
of our Christian life and ministry. 


05:43.292 --> 05:46.829
But today we will discuss how this principle 


05:46.828 --> 05:49.765
that faith in Jehovah makes things happen 


05:49.765 --> 05:51.767
can work for us in three areas. 


05:51.767 --> 05:53.770
We will see: 


05:53.770 --> 05:58.607
1) how our faith has made positive things 
happen in our personal life, 


05:58.607 --> 06:02.712
2) how we can accomplish 
things in God’s service 


06:02.712 --> 06:07.850
that would not be possible 
without faith in Jehovah God, 


06:07.850 --> 06:12.722
and 3) how faith moves us 
to step out of our comfort zone 


06:12.722 --> 06:16.059
to do more in Jehovah’s service.


06:16.058 --> 06:19.961
The principle that faith in Jehovah 
makes things happen 


06:19.962 --> 06:24.167
is well illustrated in one 
of the miracles Jesus performed. 


06:24.167 --> 06:28.337
Please open your Bible to Mark chapter 5, 


06:28.337 --> 06:32.242
and let’s read verses 25-29: 


06:32.242 --> 06:34.644
“Now there was a woman 


06:34.643 --> 06:38.180
“who had had 
a flow of blood for 12 years. 


06:38.180 --> 06:41.783
“She had suffered much 
at the hands of many physicians 


06:41.783 --> 06:44.320
“and had spent all her resources, 


06:44.320 --> 06:48.023
“and she was no better but, 
rather, had become worse. 


06:48.023 --> 06:51.993
“When she heard 
the reports about Jesus, 


06:51.993 --> 06:56.798
“she came up behind him in the crowd 
and touched his outer garment, 


06:56.798 --> 06:59.201
“for she kept saying: 


06:59.202 --> 07:03.940
“‘If I touch just his outer garments, 
I will get well.’ 


07:03.940 --> 07:08.177
“And immediately her flow 
of blood dried up, 


07:08.177 --> 07:10.279
“and she sensed in her body 


07:10.278 --> 07:14.683
that she had been healed 
of the grievous sickness.” 


07:14.683 --> 07:18.888
In the following verses, 
Jesus asked who had touched him. 


07:18.888 --> 07:20.890
The woman then revealed 
before the crowd 


07:20.890 --> 07:24.193
what she had done 
and how she’d been cured. 


07:24.193 --> 07:28.730
Now notice Jesus’ response in verse 34: 


07:28.730 --> 07:31.333
“He said to her: 


07:31.333 --> 07:35.103
“‘Daughter, 
your faith has made you well. 


07:35.103 --> 07:37.540
“‘Go in peace, and be healed


07:37.540 --> 07:39.675
from your grievous sickness.’”


07:39.675 --> 07:41.677
What comforting words 


07:41.677 --> 07:44.047
Jesus spoke to this trembling woman: 


07:44.047 --> 07:47.049
“Your faith has made you well.” 


07:47.048 --> 07:49.051
What did Jesus mean? 


07:49.052 --> 07:52.489
Let’s examine the account more closely.


07:52.488 --> 07:56.791
It says that the woman 
heard “reports about Jesus.” 


07:56.792 --> 07:59.062
Many others heard the same reports, 


07:59.062 --> 08:01.364
but not all put faith in Jesus. 


08:01.363 --> 08:03.798
And think of the circumstances 


08:03.798 --> 08:07.370
that could have prevented her 
from even coming to Jesus. 


08:07.370 --> 08:10.038
She had been disappointed many times 


08:10.038 --> 08:12.208
over the past 12 years. 


08:12.208 --> 08:14.210
She might well have thought: 


08:14.210 --> 08:16.212
‘What’s the use? 


08:16.212 --> 08:19.415
‘I’m tired and weak and poor. 


08:19.415 --> 08:21.417
I’m staying home.’ 


08:21.417 --> 08:24.020
Or ‘I would like for Jesus to see me, 


08:24.020 --> 08:26.188
‘but there is such a crowd. 


08:26.188 --> 08:28.456
‘How will I ever get through to him? 


08:28.457 --> 08:32.160
‘And after all, 
I’m in an unclean state, 


08:32.160 --> 08:34.230
‘and if the people discover this, 


08:34.230 --> 08:36.232
perhaps they will punish me.’ 


08:36.232 --> 08:39.702
No, she did not allow 
these negative thoughts 


08:39.702 --> 08:42.205
or doubts to fill her mind. 


08:42.205 --> 08:44.207
She left her home. 


08:44.207 --> 08:47.610
She found Jesus 
despite the large crowd. 


08:47.610 --> 08:49.645
And what was she saying? 


08:49.645 --> 08:51.647
Did she say, 


08:51.647 --> 08:53.950
“If I touch just his outer garments, 


08:53.950 --> 08:56.252
maybe I will get well”? 


08:56.252 --> 08:58.254
No, she said, 


08:58.253 --> 09:00.255
“I will get well.” 


09:00.255 --> 09:02.958
Now, it was not the case 


09:02.958 --> 09:05.093
that her faith healed her. 


09:05.093 --> 09:09.265
No, but her faith moved her 
to come to Jesus, 


09:09.265 --> 09:12.067
and she was healed 
by the power from Jehovah 


09:12.067 --> 09:14.270
that flowed through his Son. 


09:14.270 --> 09:16.738
Faith to approach Jesus 


09:16.738 --> 09:19.000
made it happen for her.


09:20.142 --> 09:23.279
If you are a dedicated, 
baptized Christian, 


09:23.278 --> 09:26.615
don’t you agree 
that your faith has already made 


09:26.615 --> 09:29.452
positive things happen 
in your personal life? 


09:29.452 --> 09:32.522
No, you were not miraculously healed 


09:32.522 --> 09:34.557
of your physical sicknesses. 


09:34.557 --> 09:37.192
We look forward 
to physical healing of our ills 


09:37.192 --> 09:39.862
during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ. 


09:39.862 --> 09:43.565
But today Jesus Christ directs a program 


09:43.565 --> 09:45.835
of spiritual healing. 


09:45.835 --> 09:48.770
When we were a part 
of this godless world, 


09:48.770 --> 09:53.008
many of us were sick spiritually, 
morally, and emotionally. 


09:53.008 --> 09:55.143
No one could cure us. 


09:55.143 --> 09:59.748
Perhaps we desperately 
tried material things or pleasures 


09:59.748 --> 10:01.816
to fill our spiritual need, 


10:01.817 --> 10:04.920
but our condition only got worse. 


10:04.920 --> 10:07.857
We were helpless and hopeless. 


10:07.857 --> 10:10.994
But then we heard “reports”


10:10.993 --> 10:14.730
—the good news 
of God’s Kingdom under Christ! 


10:14.730 --> 10:16.732
We studied the Bible. 


10:16.732 --> 10:20.904
Our faith moved us 
to make positive changes in our life 


10:20.903 --> 10:24.206
and to associate 
with the Christian congregation. 


10:24.207 --> 10:28.877
Today, we enjoy 
good spiritual health and happiness. 


10:28.877 --> 10:31.000
Our faith has made it happen.


10:33.282 --> 10:35.584
Faith has also made it possible 


10:35.583 --> 10:38.220
to accomplish things in God’s service 


10:38.220 --> 10:41.357
that perhaps 
we never thought we could do. 


10:41.357 --> 10:46.229
Please open your Bibles 
to Hebrews chapter 11. 


10:46.228 --> 10:49.931
In this portion 
of Paul’s letter to the Hebrews, 


10:49.932 --> 10:52.034
he focuses on faith. 


10:52.033 --> 10:55.436
He begins with a definition of faith. 


10:55.437 --> 10:58.174
But then, starting in verse 4, 


10:58.173 --> 11:01.243
Paul acts as a sort of tour guide, 


11:01.243 --> 11:03.245
walking us through the corridor 


11:03.245 --> 11:06.182
of thousands of years of Bible history. 


11:06.182 --> 11:08.317
He stops along the way 


11:08.317 --> 11:10.887
to point out the extraordinary things 


11:10.887 --> 11:13.222
that men and women of the past did 


11:13.222 --> 11:16.825
by means of faith in Jehovah God. 


11:16.825 --> 11:21.563
Just glance down the columns 
in this chapter 


11:21.563 --> 11:24.933
and notice how Paul introduces 
each paragraph 


11:24.933 --> 11:27.000
with the words “by faith.” 


11:28.770 --> 11:31.607
This expression “by faith” 


11:31.607 --> 11:35.000
appears 18 times in this one chapter. 


11:36.945 --> 11:39.115
Now, when we look at the names 


11:39.115 --> 11:41.150
Paul lists in this chapter, 


11:41.150 --> 11:42.918
we may think, 


11:42.918 --> 11:46.255
‘Well, these were spiritual “giants.”’ 


11:46.255 --> 11:49.958
But in reality, 
they were ordinary humans 


11:49.958 --> 11:53.228
with weaknesses 
like all of us have today. 


11:53.228 --> 11:56.131
The thing they all had in common 


11:56.132 --> 11:58.134
was faith, 


11:58.133 --> 12:00.268
and faith in Jehovah 


12:00.268 --> 12:03.805
made it possible 
for them to do amazing things. 


12:03.805 --> 12:07.342
Let’s look at some of them 
and compare what they did 


12:07.342 --> 12:10.245
with what many of you 
are doing today 


12:10.245 --> 12:12.280
by faith.


12:12.280 --> 12:14.850
Let’s read verse 5: 


12:14.850 --> 12:18.720
“By faith Enoch was transferred 


12:18.720 --> 12:20.923
“so as not to see death, 


12:20.923 --> 12:22.991
“and he was nowhere to be found 


12:22.992 --> 12:25.660
“because God had transferred him; 


12:25.660 --> 12:27.763
“for before he was transferred 


12:27.763 --> 12:29.765
“he received the witness 


12:29.765 --> 12:32.468
that he had pleased God well.” 


12:32.468 --> 12:35.838
The book of Jude, verses 14 and 15, 


12:35.838 --> 12:39.040
informs us that Enoch boldly proclaimed 


12:39.040 --> 12:41.077
that Jehovah was going to destroy 


12:41.077 --> 12:43.679
that ungodly world. 


12:43.678 --> 12:46.381
It appears that wicked, violent men 


12:46.382 --> 12:48.384
were going to take Enoch’s life 


12:48.383 --> 12:50.385
because of his bold witness. 


12:50.385 --> 12:53.155
So God chose to take him


12:53.155 --> 12:56.192
—that is, gently cutting short his life, 


12:56.192 --> 13:00.964
sparing him the pangs of a violent death.


13:00.963 --> 13:03.198
In modern times, like Enoch, 


13:03.198 --> 13:05.200
many brothers and sisters 


13:05.200 --> 13:07.803
have boldly declared God’s judgments 


13:07.803 --> 13:10.771
even when faced with death. 


13:10.772 --> 13:13.242
One brother, 
after receiving a death sentence 


13:13.242 --> 13:16.112
at Nazi hands during World War II, 


13:16.112 --> 13:20.015
wrote these words 
shortly before his execution: 


13:20.015 --> 13:24.920
“I have such peace, such tranquillity, 


13:24.920 --> 13:28.223
that you can’t possibly imagine!” 


13:28.223 --> 13:30.893
Faith made such boldness 


13:30.893 --> 13:33.095
and calmness possible. 


13:33.095 --> 13:35.597
In many ways, you very likely 


13:35.597 --> 13:38.000
have shown the same faith as Enoch. 


13:39.402 --> 13:43.272
By faith, 
you stand up to an ungodly world 


13:43.272 --> 13:46.409
by not adopting its corrupt ways. 


13:46.408 --> 13:50.078
By faith, 
you boldly declare God’s Word 


13:50.078 --> 13:53.015
from house to house 
and in public places. 


13:53.015 --> 13:55.783
Before you became a baptized Witness, 


13:55.783 --> 13:59.288
you may have thought you would never do 
this preaching work! 


13:59.288 --> 14:01.290
But you are doing it, 


14:01.290 --> 14:03.292
sometimes even in the face 


14:03.292 --> 14:05.694
of verbal abuse and opposition. 


14:05.693 --> 14:08.796
Faith has made it happen.


14:08.797 --> 14:11.434
Let’s read verse 7: 


14:11.433 --> 14:13.968
“By faith Noah, 


14:13.968 --> 14:17.640
“after receiving divine warning 
of things not yet seen, 


14:17.640 --> 14:21.077
“showed godly fear 
and constructed an ark 


14:21.077 --> 14:23.445
“for the saving of his household; 


14:23.445 --> 14:26.648
“and through this faith 
he condemned the world, 


14:26.648 --> 14:29.116
“and he became an heir 
of the righteousness 


14:29.117 --> 14:31.087
that results from faith.” 


14:31.087 --> 14:33.889
Nothing in the Bible indicates 


14:33.888 --> 14:36.758
that Jehovah chose Noah 
to construct an ark 


14:36.758 --> 14:39.795
because he was an experienced builder. 


14:39.795 --> 14:43.932
Certainly, he never had built 
such a gigantic vessel 


14:43.932 --> 14:46.902
as what Jehovah 
had asked him to construct. 


14:46.902 --> 14:50.539
Noah likely pondered many questions:


14:50.538 --> 14:53.441
‘How will I get all the building materials? 


14:53.442 --> 14:56.712
‘Do I have the right tools to do the job? 


14:56.712 --> 14:59.449
‘How will I gather all the animals? 


14:59.448 --> 15:02.483
‘What food will they need, and how much? 


15:02.483 --> 15:06.188
‘When, exactly, will the Deluge begin? 


15:06.188 --> 15:08.290
‘How long will it last? 


15:08.290 --> 15:12.027
Where will the ark land 
after the Flood subsides?’ 


15:12.027 --> 15:14.564
Nothing in the record indicates 


15:14.563 --> 15:18.066
that Jehovah gave Noah 
all the details in advance. 


15:18.067 --> 15:21.504
What Noah did have was faith. 


15:21.503 --> 15:24.238
Faith moved him to begin building. 


15:24.238 --> 15:27.810
His faith saved him and his family. 


15:27.810 --> 15:31.847
Faith in Jehovah made it happen.


15:31.847 --> 15:35.284
Like Noah, during this time of the end, 


15:35.283 --> 15:37.551
Jehovah’s people have taken on 


15:37.552 --> 15:40.755
challenging theocratic building projects. 


15:40.755 --> 15:43.592
Certainly, constructing 
the new world headquarters 


15:43.592 --> 15:45.460
at Warwick, New York, 


15:45.460 --> 15:48.830
was one of these projects 
that required much faith. 


15:48.830 --> 15:51.133
A committee of brothers was assigned 


15:51.133 --> 15:53.301
to complete this vast project 


15:53.302 --> 15:55.304
in less than four years. 


15:55.303 --> 15:58.373
To do so, they knew they had to begin 


15:58.373 --> 16:01.243
by July 2013. 


16:01.243 --> 16:03.978
They moved ahead in faith. 


16:03.978 --> 16:07.816
Though the town 
had not yet approved the site permits, 


16:07.817 --> 16:10.419
they began inviting workers to the site 


16:10.418 --> 16:13.255
with that date in mind. 


16:13.255 --> 16:15.290
Time was passing quickly. 


16:15.290 --> 16:18.993
The invited volunteers 
were buying plane tickets. 


16:18.993 --> 16:22.965
Bethel was arranging rooming 
and other details. 


16:22.965 --> 16:26.535
Yet, the committee 
still did not have site permits. 


16:26.535 --> 16:29.103
Would they cancel these invitations? 


16:29.103 --> 16:31.506
They state: 


16:31.507 --> 16:34.410
“We spent a lot of time praying about it. 


16:34.410 --> 16:37.847
“We decided we needed to act in faith. 


16:37.847 --> 16:40.249
“And we were just convinced 


16:40.248 --> 16:43.085
Jehovah was going to make it happen.” 


16:43.085 --> 16:45.753
As the deadline approached, 


16:45.753 --> 16:48.223
the brothers had done everything possible 


16:48.223 --> 16:50.258
to obtain the permits. 


16:50.258 --> 16:54.328
The town planning board 
was holding a public hearing. 


16:54.328 --> 16:56.998
And to the brothers’ great surprise, 


16:56.998 --> 17:00.068
within 15 minutes 
of the start of the meeting, 


17:00.068 --> 17:03.438
the town board voted 
to approve the project. 


17:03.438 --> 17:06.875
These overseers commented, 


17:06.875 --> 17:09.612
“When the approval came through, 


17:09.612 --> 17:12.715
“we knew it was 
only by Jehovah’s spirit 


17:12.715 --> 17:14.583
that that happened.” 


17:14.583 --> 17:18.020
True, but it was 
also the brothers’ faith 


17:18.020 --> 17:20.822
to act that made it happen. 


17:20.822 --> 17:24.059
Those experiences 
are found in the video 


17:24.058 --> 17:27.930
World Headquarters
—History Is Being Written. 


17:27.930 --> 17:31.267
You can find it 
in the “Our Activities” section 


17:31.267 --> 17:34.000
under the “Construction” category.


17:35.237 --> 17:39.240
Now let’s read Hebrews 11:8: 


17:39.240 --> 17:43.412
“By faith Abraham, when he was called, 


17:43.412 --> 17:45.547
“obeyed by going out to a place 


17:45.547 --> 17:48.417
“he was to receive as an inheritance; 


17:48.417 --> 17:51.120
“he went out, although not knowing 


17:51.120 --> 17:52.955
where he was going.” 


17:52.955 --> 17:54.990
What faith it took 


17:54.990 --> 17:57.960
for Abraham 
and his submissive wife, Sarah, 


17:57.960 --> 18:00.595
to leave the prosperous city of Ur 


18:00.595 --> 18:03.765
and to go wherever 
Jehovah would lead them! 


18:03.765 --> 18:07.235
It meant leaving the security 
of a pleasant home 


18:07.235 --> 18:11.607
and moving to some strange 
and potentially hostile land 


18:11.607 --> 18:16.000
some 1,000 miles, 
or 1,609 kilometers, away.


18:17.645 --> 18:19.915
Do we see such faith today? 


18:19.915 --> 18:21.917
Absolutely! 


18:21.917 --> 18:23.985
Since 2014, 


18:23.985 --> 18:26.087
thousands of brothers and sisters 


18:26.087 --> 18:29.024
have attended the School 
for Kingdom Evangelizers, 


18:29.023 --> 18:31.660
agreeing to be assigned 
to wherever 


18:31.660 --> 18:34.228
there is a need 
by the organization. 


18:34.228 --> 18:37.000
Faith has made it happen. 


18:38.300 --> 18:41.170
When a call goes out 
for skilled volunteers 


18:41.170 --> 18:44.573
to help build 
or expand branch facilities, 


18:44.573 --> 18:49.176
faith moves brothers and sisters 
to simplify their lives 


18:49.177 --> 18:52.849
and to leave their comfort zone 
in order to assist. 


18:52.848 --> 18:56.351
For example, in 2009, 


18:56.352 --> 18:59.755
the congregations 
in the United States were informed 


18:59.755 --> 19:03.192
that an expansion project 
at Wallkill, New York, 


19:03.192 --> 19:05.260
was being planned. 


19:05.260 --> 19:08.430
One couple moved out 
of their newly built 


19:08.430 --> 19:13.968
2,200-square-foot, 
or 200-square-meter, dream home 


19:13.968 --> 19:18.973
and into a 270-square-foot, 
or 25-square-meter, apartment 


19:18.973 --> 19:21.643
so that they could make 
themselves available. 


19:21.643 --> 19:23.645
What happened? 


19:23.645 --> 19:25.147
They explain: 


19:25.147 --> 19:28.684
“One month after we moved 
into our small apartment, 


19:28.683 --> 19:31.186
“we received an invitation to serve 


19:31.187 --> 19:34.255
“as temporary volunteers at Wallkill. 


19:34.255 --> 19:38.327
“It was clear to us 
that by simplifying our life, 


19:38.327 --> 19:41.864
we had given Jehovah 
something to bless.” 


19:41.863 --> 19:45.400
Faith made it happen for them.


19:45.400 --> 19:49.403
So, what have we learned today? 


19:49.403 --> 19:54.108
Faith in Jehovah God 
is a powerful motivating force 


19:54.108 --> 19:57.645
that impels us to act 
in harmony with his will. 


19:57.645 --> 20:00.315
Jehovah rewards such faith. 


20:00.315 --> 20:05.053
Remember, the very meaning 
of the name of our God, Jehovah, 


20:05.053 --> 20:08.090
is “He Causes to Become.” 


20:08.090 --> 20:12.293
Truly, he is a God 
who makes things happen! 


20:12.293 --> 20:17.198
Brothers and sisters, 
let us continue to act in faith. 


20:17.198 --> 20:19.968
Jehovah will continue 
to make wonderful things 


20:19.968 --> 20:22.370
happen in our personal life. 


20:22.370 --> 20:25.373
We will accomplish things 
we never could do 


20:25.373 --> 20:27.608
through our own personal efforts. 


20:27.608 --> 20:30.645
We will be able to do more 
in Jehovah’s service. 


20:30.645 --> 20:35.000
May it happen to you 
“according to your faith.”


20:36.485 --> 20:40.388
We met two examples 
of faith at the Canada branch. 


20:40.388 --> 20:43.058
Tillie and Leona Lachmuth 


20:43.058 --> 20:45.393
showed faith like Abraham’s 


20:45.393 --> 20:47.661
when they stepped out of their comfort zone 


20:47.662 --> 20:49.932
to preach in a faraway land. 


20:49.932 --> 20:53.169
But that wasn’t the only 
big adjustment they would make 


20:53.168 --> 20:55.870
in their long theocratic history. 


20:55.870 --> 20:59.440
In their interview, 
look for the challenge that came 


20:59.440 --> 21:03.245
after nearly 50 years in their assignment.


21:03.245 --> 21:06.982
We were brought up 
in a small town in Saskatchewan. 


21:06.982 --> 21:08.984
It was friendly. 


21:08.983 --> 21:12.186
I don’t think they moved to other places. 


21:12.187 --> 21:15.457
They stayed right there. 


21:15.457 --> 21:18.327
One time, our father said: 


21:18.327 --> 21:20.595
“Why do you have to go so far as India? 


21:20.595 --> 21:23.000
Why can’t you preach in Canada?” 


21:25.800 --> 21:26.635
Dad was very strict.


21:26.635 --> 21:27.535
Very strict. 


21:27.535 --> 21:30.005
When we were out playing 
and he came out and called us, 


21:30.005 --> 21:31.873
we had to come immediately.


21:31.873 --> 21:33.175
They were strict.


21:33.175 --> 21:36.345
Don’t question; just do what you’re told.


21:36.345 --> 21:36.978
Yeah, do what you’re told. 


21:36.978 --> 21:37.000
Yeah. 
That’s right. 


21:39.113 --> 21:41.483
Strict. 


21:41.483 --> 21:44.318
My father was the one that was interested, 


21:44.318 --> 21:46.321
but he never came into the truth.


21:46.322 --> 21:49.024
He enjoyed having Witnesses 
come to our home, 


21:49.023 --> 21:51.025
but he never ever thought 


21:51.025 --> 21:54.863
of himself as being 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


21:54.863 --> 21:58.466
Coming into the truth, I think, 
changed our life, 


21:58.467 --> 22:01.302
and we had a different purpose. 


22:01.302 --> 22:03.905
So that was when we decided, 


22:03.905 --> 22:06.808
“Well, I guess we should pioneer now too.” 


22:06.808 --> 22:09.711
And we only pioneered two years, 


22:09.712 --> 22:11.714
and we were called to Gilead. 


22:11.713 --> 22:15.350
So then we graduated in 1953. 


22:15.350 --> 22:18.653
On your application for Gilead, 
one question is: 


22:18.653 --> 22:21.221
Are you willing to go 
any place in the world? 


22:21.222 --> 22:24.727
Brother Knorr always would say, 
“A one-way ticket.” 


22:24.727 --> 22:27.000
So that was on your mind.


22:28.163 --> 22:29.363
We were happy to go. 


22:29.363 --> 22:32.000
And if we didn’t get back, that was OK.


22:34.903 --> 22:37.505
And then the 13 of us, for one month, 


22:37.505 --> 22:39.842
we all went together back to India 


22:39.842 --> 22:41.444
on a ship.


22:41.443 --> 22:43.545
Well, we were a bit nervous 
because we didn’t know 


22:43.545 --> 22:46.448
just what kind of people 
we would be meeting 


22:46.448 --> 22:50.718
or what kind of atmosphere 
we’d be experiencing.


22:50.718 --> 22:53.921
That was why it was a shock 
when we landed in Bombay 


22:53.922 --> 22:56.725
because all we could see 


22:56.725 --> 23:00.000
was people, 
people everywhere and noise.


23:01.563 --> 23:03.965
And then they gave us such hot food. 


23:03.965 --> 23:07.268
We were burning all the way down.


23:07.268 --> 23:10.771
And then when we arrived there, 
the missionary home had no furniture 


23:10.772 --> 23:13.642
and we had to sleep on the floor 
for quite a few months 


23:13.642 --> 23:15.744
before the furniture was made. 


23:15.743 --> 23:18.446
We boiled our water;
we filtered our water.


23:18.447 --> 23:22.050
When we went to the market, 
we’d bring all our vegetables and fruit home 


23:22.050 --> 23:24.052
and we washed them with a solution. 


23:24.052 --> 23:26.254
And we were very careful in that respect.


23:26.253 --> 23:28.790
It was all a shock to us in many things.


23:28.790 --> 23:30.492
Yes. 


23:30.492 --> 23:32.494
We made up our mind, I guess, 


23:32.493 --> 23:34.495
that it’s not going to be 
the same as Canada, we know. 


23:34.495 --> 23:37.398
We didn’t worry about the things 
we had to put up with 


23:37.398 --> 23:40.268
because we had the joy in the ministry. 


23:40.268 --> 23:44.238
The Society wanted us 
to get the Joy booklet out, 


23:44.238 --> 23:47.908
and we had to just stand on the street 
with this carton of literature 


23:47.908 --> 23:50.078
and just keep calling out to the people, 


23:50.078 --> 23:52.080
and everybody would take it.


23:52.080 --> 23:54.082
And they were so appreciative, 
really appreciative.


23:54.082 --> 23:55.184
Yeah, they were. 
Yeah. 


23:55.183 --> 23:59.086
In those days, 
we had to put in 150 hours. 


23:59.087 --> 24:02.590
And in South India, after 4:00 p.m., 


24:02.590 --> 24:04.125
women were not out. 


24:04.125 --> 24:06.193
So we had to get all our time in


24:06.193 --> 24:10.098
early in the morning 
and work right through until four o’clock.


24:10.098 --> 24:13.000
We sure did.


24:14.102 --> 24:17.205
We were using the Malayalam language, 


24:17.205 --> 24:19.975
and the children repeated what we said.


24:19.975 --> 24:22.110
They’d run ahead and tell people 


24:22.110 --> 24:24.512
what we were talking about.


24:24.512 --> 24:26.515
And they’d all yell, 
“Ma’damma, ma’damma.”


24:26.515 --> 24:28.283
“White woman, white woman.”


24:28.283 --> 24:30.000
Yeah, and we had many studies then. 


24:31.052 --> 24:34.857
We enjoyed the ministry, 
and we enjoyed the hospitality.


24:34.857 --> 24:37.159
Be with the brothers and go to their homes 


24:37.158 --> 24:42.063
and eat their food and do things 
the way they do things.


24:42.063 --> 24:44.531
So we had to make India our home. 


24:44.532 --> 24:48.337
We lived in India about 50 years. 


24:48.337 --> 24:51.372
And then the news came 
that we had to leave. 


24:51.372 --> 24:53.375
So that was why the Governing Body said, 


24:53.375 --> 24:56.377
“Well, you go to the Canada branch then.” 


24:56.377 --> 25:00.382
Well, it was like a culture shock too 
after being so many years in India.


25:00.382 --> 25:01.382
Yes.


25:01.382 --> 25:04.000
A lot of things we had 
to sort of adjust to here now. 


25:07.655 --> 25:10.192
I’m working down in the laundry, folding.


25:10.192 --> 25:11.192
Same. 


25:11.192 --> 25:14.000
Folding and folding until we fold in.


25:18.933 --> 25:20.935
Well, we always tell the younger ones 


25:20.935 --> 25:22.937
to be in the full-time service 
serving Jehovah. 


25:22.937 --> 25:27.009
This, we think, 
is a wonderful life to choose.


25:27.008 --> 25:30.545
It’s good for the young people 
to learn when they’re young like that.


25:30.545 --> 25:34.000
And, no doubt, 
they’ll make progress in the truth too.


25:35.083 --> 25:38.353
We’re glad we started pioneering 
and moved about.


25:38.353 --> 25:40.355
Yeah. 
We lacked nothing, really. 


25:40.355 --> 25:43.000
We have nothing to complain about.


25:46.562 --> 25:49.932
It wasn’t easy, 
but Tillie and Leona 


25:49.932 --> 25:52.034
adapted to a culture in India 


25:52.033 --> 25:54.735
that was very different 
from what they knew. 


25:54.735 --> 25:58.740
It was interesting, however, 
that they felt a similar culture shock 


25:58.740 --> 26:01.008
when returning home to Canada. 


26:01.008 --> 26:04.946
But through all of it, 
Jehovah rewarded their faith. 


26:04.947 --> 26:08.817
After more than 67 years 
of full-time service, 


26:08.817 --> 26:12.000
they can say with confidence 
that they lacked nothing.


26:13.388 --> 26:16.090
Young ones, 
why not imitate the faith 


26:16.090 --> 26:18.793
of ones like Tillie and Leona 


26:18.793 --> 26:22.863
and set a goal for a form of service 
that’s new to you? 


26:22.863 --> 26:25.000
And, older ones, 


26:25.000 --> 26:29.003
if an assignment you treasured 
for many years comes to an end, 


26:29.003 --> 26:33.140
know that Jehovah remembers 
the love you showed for his name 


26:33.140 --> 26:37.012
and wants you to find joy 
in your new assignment. 


26:37.012 --> 26:41.717
No matter our circumstances, 
Jehovah wants us all to do 


26:41.717 --> 26:45.520
what was recently discussed 
at a Bethel morning worship: 


26:45.520 --> 26:48.957
Seek first the Kingdom.


26:48.957 --> 26:50.959
Our text for discussion today, 


26:50.958 --> 26:53.661
here at Matthew 6:33, 


26:53.662 --> 26:56.230
contains two parts. 


26:56.230 --> 26:59.667
The first part is what we have to do; 


26:59.667 --> 27:03.405
it says: 
“Keep on, then, seeking first the Kingdom 


27:03.405 --> 27:05.740
and his righteousness.” 


27:05.740 --> 27:09.343
The second part is what Jehovah will do: 


27:09.343 --> 27:13.515
“And all these other things 
will be added to you.” 


27:13.515 --> 27:16.652
We think carefully about these words. 


27:16.652 --> 27:21.022
Jesus actually was educating his disciples 


27:21.022 --> 27:24.825
to make a dramatic change 
in their lifestyle. 


27:24.825 --> 27:26.995
What do we mean by that? 


27:26.995 --> 27:29.497
Well, look at verse 31. 


27:29.497 --> 27:34.135
He says: “So never be anxious and say, 


27:34.135 --> 27:37.638
“‘What are we to eat?’ 
or, ‘What are we to drink?’ 


27:37.638 --> 27:39.973
or, ‘What are we to wear?’” 


27:39.973 --> 27:42.543
Did Jesus say never? 


27:42.543 --> 27:44.711
Yes! 


27:44.712 --> 27:47.415
But those are the things we normally do. 


27:47.415 --> 27:50.818
We are anxious about our existence, 


27:50.818 --> 27:55.223
and Jesus recognizes 
that most people are that way. 


27:55.223 --> 27:57.225
He says in verse 32: 


27:57.225 --> 27:59.427
“For all these are the things 


27:59.427 --> 28:02.797
the nations are eagerly pursuing.” 


28:02.797 --> 28:05.067
But then he says: 


28:05.067 --> 28:10.739
“Your heavenly Father knows 
that you need all these things.”


28:10.738 --> 28:12.773
Here in this chapter, 


28:12.773 --> 28:17.578
Jesus outlines a number 
of very important principles 


28:17.578 --> 28:22.216
that actually change the way we look at life 


28:22.217 --> 28:24.985
and the way we see our existence 


28:24.985 --> 28:27.222
in relationship to Jehovah God. 


28:27.222 --> 28:30.692
He puts service to Jehovah 


28:30.692 --> 28:32.727
in the first place, 


28:32.727 --> 28:35.630
regardless of our circumstances.


28:35.630 --> 28:38.265
Let us have a look 
at two of these principles. 


28:38.265 --> 28:41.903
The one that’s here 
 at Matthew 6:24, 


28:41.903 --> 28:43.938
he says: 


28:43.938 --> 28:48.275
“No one can slave for two masters; 


28:48.275 --> 28:51.712
“for either he will hate the one 
and love the other, 


28:51.712 --> 28:55.550
“or he will stick to the one 
and despise the other. 


28:55.550 --> 28:58.052
“You cannot slave 


28:58.052 --> 29:00.955
for God and for Riches.” 


29:00.955 --> 29:03.157
It is just not possible. 


29:03.157 --> 29:06.394
Some have tried, but they’ve failed. 


29:06.393 --> 29:11.165
Satan approached Jesus and said to him: 
‘I will give you riches. 


29:11.165 --> 29:14.935
I’ll give you all the kingdoms 
of the world and their glory.’ 


29:14.935 --> 29:17.772
Of course, Jesus refused. 
Why? 


29:17.772 --> 29:21.977
Because he knew 
there was a price attached to it. 


29:21.977 --> 29:23.979
What is the price? 


29:23.978 --> 29:25.980
Worship


29:25.980 --> 29:28.348
—divided worship—
which is impossible. 


29:28.348 --> 29:30.385
He knew that it is impossible 


29:30.385 --> 29:33.120
to worship both Jehovah and Riches. 


29:33.120 --> 29:36.657
In verse 21, Jesus says: 


29:36.657 --> 29:38.827
“For where your treasure is, 


29:38.827 --> 29:42.000
there your heart will be also.”


29:46.433 --> 29:51.205
The second principle is in verse 25: 


29:51.205 --> 29:54.742
“On this account I say to you: 


29:54.742 --> 29:58.714
“Stop being anxious about your lives 


29:58.713 --> 30:01.715
“as to what you will eat 
or what you will drink, 


30:01.715 --> 30:04.952
or about your bodies 
as to what you will wear.” 


30:04.952 --> 30:06.955
And here is the principle: 


30:06.955 --> 30:10.758
“Does not life mean more than food 


30:10.758 --> 30:13.000
and the body [more] than clothing?” 


30:14.695 --> 30:17.498
You can have a storehouse full of food; 


30:17.498 --> 30:20.935
if you don’t have life, you cannot eat it. 


30:20.935 --> 30:24.005
You can have a warehouse full of clothes; 


30:24.005 --> 30:27.000
but if there’s no body, you cannot wear it.


30:28.008 --> 30:32.913
Jesus illustrated this principle 
beautifully in Luke. 


30:32.913 --> 30:35.183
Turn to Luke 


30:35.183 --> 30:38.185
chapter 12 


30:38.185 --> 30:41.622
and from verse 16: 


30:41.622 --> 30:44.759
“With that he told them an illustration, 
saying: 


30:44.758 --> 30:47.628
“‘The land of a rich man produced well. 


30:47.628 --> 30:50.365
“‘So he began reasoning within himself, 


30:50.365 --> 30:54.368
“‘“What should I do now 
that I have nowhere to gather my crops?” 


30:54.368 --> 30:56.403
“‘Then he said, “I will do this:


30:56.403 --> 31:00.375
“‘“I will tear down my storehouses 
and build bigger ones, 


31:00.375 --> 31:04.612
“‘“and there I will gather 
all my grain and all my goods, 


31:04.612 --> 31:06.647
“‘“and I will say to myself: 


31:06.647 --> 31:09.717
“‘“‘You have many good things 
stored up for many years; 


31:09.717 --> 31:13.722
“‘“‘take it easy, eat, 
drink, enjoy yourself.’”


31:13.722 --> 31:16.124
“‘But God said to him, 


31:16.123 --> 31:18.560
“‘“Unreasonable one, 


31:18.560 --> 31:22.130
“‘“this night they are demanding 
your life from you. 


31:22.130 --> 31:26.100
“‘“Who, then, is to have 
the things you stored up?” 


31:26.100 --> 31:30.805
“‘So it goes with the man 
who stores up treasure for himself 


31:30.805 --> 31:34.000
but is not rich toward God.’” 


31:35.377 --> 31:38.880
Jesus didn’t say this man was dishonest 


31:38.880 --> 31:42.450
or that he’d never thought about God. 


31:42.450 --> 31:45.253
The mistake the man made was 


31:45.253 --> 31:47.655
that his priorities were wrong. 


31:47.655 --> 31:52.393
He focused primarily on amassing wealth. 


31:52.393 --> 31:55.696
He did not do what it says in verse 21. 


31:55.697 --> 31:58.634
He did not store up treasure for himself— 


31:58.633 --> 32:01.468
He ‘stored up treasure for himself,’ 


32:01.468 --> 32:04.571
but did not store up treasure 
with God in heaven. 


32:04.572 --> 32:07.442
He was “not rich toward God.” 


32:07.442 --> 32:10.110
And that is the key element, isn’t it? 


32:10.110 --> 32:12.780
Our service to Jehovah God, 


32:12.780 --> 32:15.082
our life for Jehovah, 


32:15.082 --> 32:17.085
that is the key element. 


32:17.085 --> 32:19.753
And as Jesus says in verse 15, 


32:19.753 --> 32:22.323
the second part of verse 15: 


32:22.323 --> 32:26.526
“Because even when a person 
has an abundance, 


32:26.527 --> 32:29.430
“his life does not result 


32:29.430 --> 32:31.398
from the things he possesses.”


32:31.398 --> 32:33.400
So these are 


32:33.400 --> 32:36.337
the two very important principles 
we’ve covered. 


32:36.337 --> 32:38.339
First of all, 


32:38.338 --> 32:41.275
make our service to God a priority 


32:41.275 --> 32:43.577
and not amassing wealth. 


32:43.577 --> 32:45.580
And the second one: 


32:45.580 --> 32:49.283
“Keep on, then, 
seeking first the Kingdom 


32:49.283 --> 32:51.318
“and [God’s] righteousness, 


32:51.318 --> 32:54.655
and all these other things 
will be added to you.” 


32:54.655 --> 32:57.792
We do not know precisely 
when the end will come, 


32:57.792 --> 33:02.297
but we want to keep on 
seeking first the Kingdom.


33:02.297 --> 33:06.400
Rather than putting our trust 
in the securities of this world, 


33:06.400 --> 33:10.572
we want to put our trust 
in our heavenly Father. 


33:10.572 --> 33:14.009
Jehovah gives everything; 


33:14.008 --> 33:17.378
he gives more than what we need. 


33:17.378 --> 33:20.915
In Ecclesiastes 5:19, 


33:20.915 --> 33:24.452
it summarizes this whole principle. 


33:24.452 --> 33:29.357
It establishes the truth
—the reality of the matter. 


33:29.357 --> 33:33.627
It says, Ecclesiastes 5:19: 


33:33.627 --> 33:38.532
“Also, when the true God 
gives a man riches 


33:38.532 --> 33:40.835
“and material possessions 


33:40.835 --> 33:44.705
“along with the ability to enjoy them, 


33:44.705 --> 33:47.608
“he should take his reward 


33:47.608 --> 33:50.243
“and rejoice in his hard work. 


33:50.243 --> 33:54.981
This is the gift of God.”


33:54.982 --> 33:56.984
Did you note two things 


33:56.983 --> 33:59.220
that Brother Marais 
said could prevent us 


33:59.220 --> 34:02.290
from seeking 
the Kingdom first in our lives? 


34:02.290 --> 34:06.327
One was being divided
—trying to serve Jehovah 


34:06.327 --> 34:09.830
while seeking riches 
or other things in the world. 


34:09.830 --> 34:12.500
The second was anxiety 


34:12.500 --> 34:14.802
over what we need to survive. 


34:14.802 --> 34:18.605
We can avoid both of these distractions 


34:18.605 --> 34:22.577
by building up our faith 
that Jehovah cares for us. 


34:22.577 --> 34:25.212
We’re assured that he will provide 


34:25.212 --> 34:27.449
for our needs in this system. 


34:27.448 --> 34:30.885
And in the new world, 
we know he’ll satisfy 


34:30.885 --> 34:32.887
any wholesome desires 


34:32.887 --> 34:35.000
that we choose to sacrifice for now.


34:36.923 --> 34:38.993
It may help to recall 


34:38.993 --> 34:41.000
what Jehovah has already done for us. 


34:42.397 --> 34:44.632
Can you remember your faith growing 


34:44.632 --> 34:46.700
when you first studied the Bible? 


34:46.700 --> 34:50.872
when you began your ministry, 
sharing the Kingdom good news? 


34:50.872 --> 34:53.540
when you dedicated your life to God? 


34:53.540 --> 34:56.443
or when he helped you 
through a serious trial? 


34:56.443 --> 34:59.913
If so, you can say with conviction 


34:59.913 --> 35:03.183
that faith makes things happen 


35:03.183 --> 35:06.853
and you can appreciate 
the experiences depicted 


35:06.853 --> 35:09.000
in this encouraging music video.


35:19.767 --> 35:25.740
A heart full of questions, 
a life so unsure,


35:25.740 --> 35:30.277
I heard what you told me; 
I wanted more.


35:30.277 --> 35:41.655
What you told me, 
I wanted more.


35:41.655 --> 35:46.793
Unanswered questions 
were answered that day.


35:46.793 --> 35:51.631
The worry I was feeling 
melted away.


35:51.632 --> 36:01.000
All my worries 
faded away.


36:02.277 --> 36:13.054
It’s a long road we’re going down,
But faith can make things happen.


36:13.053 --> 36:19.060
When there’s no way through 
and no way round,


36:19.060 --> 36:31.000
Faith can make things happen,
Make things happen.


36:37.678 --> 36:42.716
I love what I’m learning 
and share what I know.


36:42.717 --> 36:47.622
I’m ready and waiting, 
so here I go.


36:47.622 --> 36:57.000
Yes, I’m ready
To share what I know.


36:58.498 --> 37:04.105
My faith is like a fire 
that burns within my heart.


37:04.105 --> 37:09.077
I’ve got to keep it burning 
and do my part.


37:09.077 --> 37:19.620
Keep it burning 
deep in my heart.


37:19.620 --> 37:30.097
It’s a long road we’re going down,
But this I’ve not forgotten:


37:30.097 --> 37:36.337
When there’s no way through 
and no way round,


37:36.337 --> 37:48.984
Faith can make things happen,
Make things happen.


37:48.983 --> 37:59.493
Seeing sad days, bad days, 
bring stormy weather.


37:59.493 --> 38:09.803
Praying over and over, 
staying close to Jehovah.


38:09.803 --> 38:16.043
He said, “If you put your trust in me,
I’ll give you strength, and then you’ll see


38:16.043 --> 38:21.015
The trials that came to be,
We faced them together.”


38:21.015 --> 38:31.458
It’s a long road we’re going down,
But this I’ve not forgotten:


38:31.458 --> 38:37.631
When there’s no way through 
and no way round,


38:37.632 --> 38:42.537
Faith can make things happen.


38:42.537 --> 38:52.547
Now I’m so sure, I have no doubt,
Faith can make things happen.


38:52.547 --> 38:58.819
When there’s no way through 
and no way round,


38:58.818 --> 39:12.000
Faith can make things happen,
Make things happen.


39:13.200 --> 39:17.037
Nothing we experience 
is too difficult for Jehovah. 


39:17.037 --> 39:20.607
That may be easy to remember 
when things are going well. 


39:20.607 --> 39:23.577
But when anxiety or trials come, 


39:23.577 --> 39:26.000
can we remember to trust Jehovah? 


39:27.648 --> 39:30.785
What was one thing 
our sister did to build her faith? 


39:30.785 --> 39:32.787
She prayed! 


39:32.787 --> 39:35.155
Even Jesus’ apostles begged him: 


39:35.155 --> 39:37.157
“Give us more faith.” 


39:37.157 --> 39:39.894
We can ask Jehovah for more faith 


39:39.893 --> 39:43.000
and then act with the courage 
and strength that he provides.


39:45.432 --> 39:48.169
Jehovah gives us his holy spirit, 


39:48.168 --> 39:51.005
both individually and as a group. 


39:51.005 --> 39:55.843
To see evidence of that, 
we need only go to a part of the world 


39:55.843 --> 39:59.546
where Jehovah’s people 
were put under intense pressure. 


39:59.547 --> 40:02.215
In South Africa, for example, 


40:02.215 --> 40:07.187
the government’s policy 
of racial segregation, called apartheid, 


40:07.187 --> 40:11.359
lasted for 46 years, until 1994. 


40:11.358 --> 40:15.830
Our brothers were pressured 
to take sides in armed conflict. 


40:15.830 --> 40:18.932
Their freedom to worship together 
was limited. 


40:18.932 --> 40:23.104
And the prevailing attitudes 
 towards people of different races 


40:23.103 --> 40:25.138
threatened their unity. 


40:25.138 --> 40:28.908
In this report, we learn 
how our South African brothers 


40:28.908 --> 40:33.000
remained united and neutral 
and in support of God’s Kingdom.


40:43.490 --> 40:47.193
One afternoon 
when we came to the station, 


40:47.193 --> 40:50.998
there were men who were directing things
and we were directed  


40:50.998 --> 40:53.433
to a coach for whites only. 


40:53.433 --> 40:55.268
That was the first time 


40:55.268 --> 41:00.000
that we saw apartheid being law enforced.


41:01.875 --> 41:04.778
You could not leave the black areas 


41:04.778 --> 41:07.000
where your home was 
without getting a permit. 


41:08.548 --> 41:12.886
We were even given a permit that stipulated 
which area we were allowed 


41:12.887 --> 41:15.000
to do the preaching work in.


41:17.992 --> 41:20.227
People would always ask us: 


41:20.227 --> 41:22.664
“What are you doing to fight apartheid?” 


41:22.663 --> 41:24.665
We had to boldly tell them: 


41:24.665 --> 41:27.233
“God’s Kingdom is the only solution. 


41:27.233 --> 41:30.570
“God will help the whole earth 
to live in peace one day, 


41:30.570 --> 41:34.000
so we cannot take sides 
on political issues now.”


41:37.043 --> 41:39.078
Here at home in Soweto, 
we heard the sound 


41:39.078 --> 41:42.000
of children running in the streets. 


41:43.217 --> 41:46.220
We heard the sound of gunshots; 


41:46.220 --> 41:49.390
tear gas was everywhere.


41:49.390 --> 41:51.692
When my husband came home that day, 


41:51.692 --> 41:54.629
we sat with the children 
and took out the book 


41:54.628 --> 41:56.930
Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It 


41:56.930 --> 41:59.000
and we studied the topic 
“How Do You View Your Parents?” 


42:02.202 --> 42:04.272
This was appropriate 


42:04.272 --> 42:06.507
because children had the spirit of rebelling 


42:06.507 --> 42:09.910
against their own parents.


42:09.910 --> 42:12.000
They went as far as burning people.


42:15.215 --> 42:17.952
They came shouting my son’s name:


42:17.952 --> 42:21.000
“Aquila, Mathiba, come out, come out!” 


42:22.590 --> 42:24.992
And one of them defended him and said:


42:24.992 --> 42:29.230
“No, no, no, not Aquila! 


42:29.230 --> 42:32.232
“Aquila does not do these things. 


42:32.232 --> 42:35.000
He will never protest.”


42:36.170 --> 42:41.775
Ahh, I saw Jehovah’s hand in this. 


42:41.775 --> 42:43.743
Even under those circumstances, 


42:43.743 --> 42:45.778
Jehovah helped our children 


42:45.778 --> 42:48.548
not to dwell on the madness 
in the streets, 


42:48.548 --> 42:51.000
and we focused on spiritual things.


42:53.487 --> 42:56.557
In 1968, when I was 19 years old, 


42:56.557 --> 42:58.559
I was sentenced to jail 


42:58.558 --> 43:00.860
for refusing to do military service.


43:00.860 --> 43:03.830
Over a period of 20 years, 


43:03.830 --> 43:06.633
close to 1,000 young white Witness men 


43:06.633 --> 43:10.070
similarly took their stand 
for neutrality in this country.


43:10.070 --> 43:14.107
We used to pray 
for our white brothers in prison. 


43:14.107 --> 43:18.279
People in the black townships respected us 


43:18.278 --> 43:21.000
for the stand these brothers were taking.


43:26.020 --> 43:27.755
In 1974, 


43:27.755 --> 43:31.592
over 30,000 black and white brothers met 


43:31.592 --> 43:36.000
for the afternoon session 
of the “Divine Victory” Assembly.


43:37.765 --> 43:39.767
When we first arrived, 


43:39.767 --> 43:42.000
there were policemen everywhere. 


43:45.172 --> 43:47.474
But after half an hour, 


43:47.473 --> 43:49.710
they saw how peaceful it was 


43:49.710 --> 43:51.000
and so they left.


43:53.880 --> 43:55.882
For those few hours 


43:55.882 --> 43:59.119
in the dark era of apartheid, 


43:59.118 --> 44:01.355
we felt 


44:01.355 --> 44:05.892
the glorious brotherly love 
as we praised Jehovah 


44:05.892 --> 44:08.000
together.


44:15.935 --> 44:18.238
Brother Moses Nyamussua was asked 


44:18.238 --> 44:21.041
by a group on their way to a political rally 


44:21.042 --> 44:23.110
to weld weapons for them. 


44:23.110 --> 44:26.047
He refused to do so.


44:26.047 --> 44:29.215
After their rally, 
they went back to him and said: 


44:29.215 --> 44:32.218
“You refused to weld our weapons, 


44:32.218 --> 44:36.223
“and some of our comrades 
were killed in a fight at the rally. 


44:36.223 --> 44:39.526
Now you will die.”


44:39.527 --> 44:42.797
Brother Nyamussua maintained his neutrality 


44:42.797 --> 44:44.599
all the way to death, 


44:44.598 --> 44:47.000
and Jehovah will remember him.


44:51.738 --> 44:54.408
In 1993, I was amazed 


44:54.408 --> 44:56.710
when a white person 
came preaching house to house. 


44:56.710 --> 44:58.745
They came with another white man 


44:58.745 --> 45:01.582
who could speak Venda fluently. 


45:01.582 --> 45:04.350
That excited me a lot, 
and as time went by, 


45:04.350 --> 45:06.353
I came to realize 


45:06.353 --> 45:09.556
that this is the true religion 
because they were faithful friends 


45:09.557 --> 45:13.594
and they spoke to me like we were family.


45:13.593 --> 45:16.930
In the late 1980’s, 
the government granted us permission 


45:16.930 --> 45:19.065
to come in and build Kingdom Halls 


45:19.065 --> 45:21.135
in the black townships. 


45:21.135 --> 45:23.403
The local community 
was absolutely amazed 


45:23.403 --> 45:25.271
to see all these whites 


45:25.272 --> 45:27.440
pouring in and working hard 


45:27.440 --> 45:29.610
along with their black brothers 


45:29.610 --> 45:31.645
to build these beautiful Kingdom Halls.


45:31.645 --> 45:34.080
It was a wonderful privilege 
to get to know other young people 


45:34.080 --> 45:36.083
of different races.


45:36.083 --> 45:39.051
Everyone in the congregation feels 
like family 


45:39.052 --> 45:41.054
as long as they serve Jehovah.


45:41.053 --> 45:44.458
Just see yourself.


45:44.458 --> 45:47.093
Just see me too.


45:47.093 --> 45:49.195
Just see us all. . .


45:49.195 --> 45:54.333
. . . in a world that is new.


45:54.333 --> 45:56.570
Today, in South Africa, 


45:56.570 --> 45:59.607
there are more than 100,000 Witnesses 


45:59.607 --> 46:03.144
worshipping together in spirit and truth. 


46:03.143 --> 46:06.513
South Africa has 11 official languages. 


46:06.513 --> 46:09.081
Yet, across that cultural variety, 


46:09.082 --> 46:13.454
our brothers and sisters 
are all speaking the “pure language”


46:13.453 --> 46:17.000
—the truth about Jehovah God 
and his purposes.


46:18.158 --> 46:21.728
When we build strong faith 
in times of peace, 


46:21.728 --> 46:25.931
we can find courage during times 
of testing and persecution. 


46:25.932 --> 46:29.637
Brother Rocky Webb 
from the United States 


46:29.637 --> 46:32.005
learned to be a fighter 
as a young man. 


46:32.005 --> 46:36.143
But as his faith grew, 
he learned that Jehovah is there 


46:36.143 --> 46:39.000
“to help us and to fight our battles.”


46:57.230 --> 47:00.667
All of us are going to be tested 
one way or the other 


47:00.667 --> 47:03.000
before we make it into the new world. 


47:05.138 --> 47:09.275
And if we can endure 
those tests faithfully, 


47:09.275 --> 47:13.000
faithfully, 
then we’ll make it.


47:15.082 --> 47:18.919
My dad and my mother 
taught me the truth. 


47:18.918 --> 47:22.821
What drove me to be baptized 


47:22.822 --> 47:25.325
was the convention in Washington, D.C. 


47:25.325 --> 47:30.663
Brother Rutherford gave the talk 
on “the meek shall inherit the earth.” 


47:30.663 --> 47:34.366
It touched my heart in a way 
that it’s never left 


47:34.367 --> 47:38.105
from that minute on,
right on up to now. 


47:38.105 --> 47:39.973
It gave me faith to stay 


47:39.973 --> 47:42.000
with Jehovah all the way.


47:45.212 --> 47:48.182
The bullies would come 
and jump onto me, 


47:48.182 --> 47:50.884
and I would come home 
pretty well beat up. 


47:50.883 --> 47:55.521
So that’s when I started training for boxing. 


47:55.522 --> 48:00.760
I was offered $40,000 for a fight
—win or lose. 


48:00.760 --> 48:05.000
And if I won the second fight, 
they would double the amount.


48:06.467 --> 48:11.405
Brother Macmillan was like a second 
dad to me and my brother. 


48:11.405 --> 48:14.307
And he asked me, and he said, 
“Would you do me a favor?” 


48:14.307 --> 48:17.210
He said, “Don’t put the gloves on no more.” 


48:17.210 --> 48:21.982
And so I didn’t put them on anymore. 


48:21.982 --> 48:25.385
I think he knew 
that it wouldn’t be very long 


48:25.385 --> 48:27.453
before there’d be an article on it. 


48:27.453 --> 48:32.691
It came out and told 
that boxing wasn’t for Christians. 


48:32.692 --> 48:34.929
I was drafted during this time, 


48:34.928 --> 48:38.598
and I refused to serve 
and was sent to prison.


48:38.598 --> 48:40.700
All the time, 


48:40.700 --> 48:44.103
I never, never, 
ever slowed down 


48:44.103 --> 48:46.706
on my theocratic deals, 


48:46.707 --> 48:48.175
never. 


48:48.175 --> 48:49.777
I kept right on on it. 


48:49.777 --> 48:52.379
The jail warden overheard me 


48:52.378 --> 48:54.848
witnessing to another inmate. 


48:54.848 --> 48:56.248
He told me, 


48:56.248 --> 48:58.018
“Don’t do anymore of that.” 


48:58.018 --> 49:00.253
He said, “We don’t allow it here.” 


49:00.253 --> 49:05.000
Three days had passed by, 
and he’d seen me talking to him again. 


49:06.860 --> 49:10.397
And they put me in a car that was shaded


49:10.397 --> 49:13.000
—you couldn’t see out. 


49:14.267 --> 49:15.935
I didn’t know where I was going. 


49:15.935 --> 49:18.738
It was an old, old prison, 


49:18.738 --> 49:21.000
just dark as could be in there. 


49:22.308 --> 49:25.778
It was three feet (1 m) around. 


49:25.778 --> 49:28.000
And they called it “the Sweat Box.” 


49:30.083 --> 49:33.586
All the time I was in there, 
I’d just sweat, sweat, sweat. 


49:33.587 --> 49:39.860
And I went in 
weighing 213 pounds (97 kg), 


49:39.860 --> 49:43.000
and I came out 
weighing 133 pounds (60 kg).


49:45.765 --> 49:48.368
Psalm 144 says:


49:48.368 --> 49:52.438
“May Jehovah, my Rock, be praised, 


49:52.438 --> 49:55.208
“who trains my hands for battle, 


49:55.208 --> 49:58.878
my fingers for warfare.” 


49:58.878 --> 50:01.815
I gave my life 


50:01.815 --> 50:04.000
to give Jehovah my faith.


50:05.418 --> 50:08.288
I lived in Wewoka. 


50:08.288 --> 50:11.491
Several congregations 
would come together to work. 


50:11.492 --> 50:14.795
We were confronted by mobs. 


50:14.795 --> 50:17.697
There were a lot of them 
that were injured. 


50:17.697 --> 50:22.869
I had 80 stitches up here, 


50:22.868 --> 50:27.140
and I had 13 in the side there, 


50:27.140 --> 50:29.242
on each stab. 


50:29.242 --> 50:33.000
I was really, really beat up. 


50:34.580 --> 50:37.850
But I couldn’t have stood up 
if it hadn’t been for Jehovah. 


50:37.850 --> 50:40.000
I knew he was with me 
some way or another. 


50:42.788 --> 50:47.000
So we sued the town and won $20,000. 


50:48.295 --> 50:52.598
The Society called us and said: 


50:52.598 --> 50:56.970
“You did very good 
in what all you’ve done” 


50:56.970 --> 51:01.708
but said, 
“Remember, we’re not out for money. 


51:01.708 --> 51:06.078
Make sure 
that that’s made known to them.” 


51:06.078 --> 51:08.315
When we walked up to the desk, 


51:08.315 --> 51:11.418
they slid the papers out to us 


51:11.418 --> 51:13.120
and said, “Sign them up.” 


51:13.120 --> 51:16.000
And we just took them and slid them back.


51:17.157 --> 51:19.459
It came out in the papers, 


51:19.458 --> 51:23.563
‘Tell them to come back 
and do all they want to do 


51:23.563 --> 51:26.165
in the way of their witnessing.’ 


51:26.165 --> 51:28.702
It said, ‘We won’t touch them.’ 


51:28.702 --> 51:33.000
They really highly respected us
for what we did, 


51:34.173 --> 51:37.076
and so that opened it up. 


51:37.077 --> 51:42.182
And we had 
a real good congregation there 


51:42.182 --> 51:45.000
that got started and everything.


51:53.727 --> 51:56.630
My first wife was a blessing for me, 


51:56.630 --> 51:59.465
but when she died, 


51:59.465 --> 52:02.368
Jehovah stepped in 
and gave me another good one. 


52:02.368 --> 52:05.000
We mow the lawns together. 


52:06.072 --> 52:10.577
No, no, we do most everything together. 


52:10.577 --> 52:14.447
We study to where 
we can feel it in our hearts. 


52:14.447 --> 52:17.350
When you give your faith to Jehovah, 


52:17.350 --> 52:19.987
you’re giving your life to him. 


52:19.987 --> 52:22.622
He’s permitted these things 
to come upon me; 


52:22.622 --> 52:24.657
I knew that. 


52:24.657 --> 52:27.000
But he protected me.


52:29.628 --> 52:33.633
Brother Webb is now 94 years old. 


52:33.633 --> 52:37.336
But as we saw, 
he and his wife, Charlene, 


52:37.337 --> 52:40.240
keep themselves spiritually active. 


52:40.240 --> 52:44.543
What lessons did you see 
in Rocky’s experience? 


52:44.543 --> 52:48.515
For one, we heard 
that Rocky learned to be a boxer 


52:48.515 --> 52:51.050
to protect himself from bullies; 


52:51.050 --> 52:55.355
yet he responded in faith 
to loving counsel to quit


52:55.355 --> 52:57.390
—even before God’s people 


52:57.390 --> 53:00.827
had a clear understanding 
of violent sports. 


53:00.827 --> 53:02.829
Making that change 


53:02.828 --> 53:05.198
helped Rocky to continue cultivating 


53:05.198 --> 53:07.600
a Christlike personality. 


53:07.600 --> 53:10.437
That prepared him to stand firm 


53:10.437 --> 53:12.739
when imprisoned for his faith, 


53:12.738 --> 53:16.208
and it helped him 
to not return evil for evil 


53:16.208 --> 53:18.845
when persecuted for his ministry. 


53:18.845 --> 53:21.213
He had faith that although Jehovah 


53:21.213 --> 53:23.250
permitted these things to happen, 


53:23.250 --> 53:26.953
He was also there to protect him. 


53:26.953 --> 53:31.356
Examples like those of Rocky 
and the others we’ve considered


53:31.357 --> 53:34.760
warm our hearts and let us know 


53:34.760 --> 53:38.665
we’re never alone 
in our fight for the faith.


53:38.665 --> 53:40.700
Like you, 


53:40.700 --> 53:43.970
our brothers around the world 
are standing firm 


53:43.970 --> 53:46.005
and earnestly seeking out people 


53:46.005 --> 53:48.107
to show them what the Bible teaches. 


53:48.107 --> 53:50.077
Later this month, 


53:50.077 --> 53:53.980
you’ll enjoy hearing a report 
from the Central America branch. 


53:53.980 --> 53:57.617
Preaching campaigns organized 
by the branch are reaching people 


53:57.617 --> 54:01.554
in seldom-worked territories
across several countries, 


54:01.553 --> 54:04.123
such as Mexico, El Salvador, 


54:04.123 --> 54:06.458
Costa Rica, Panama, 


54:06.458 --> 54:09.361
Nicaragua, and Guatemala. 


54:09.362 --> 54:11.599
Later, when it is posted, 


54:11.598 --> 54:14.233
you’ll find it in the 
“Video on Demand” section 


54:14.233 --> 54:17.870
under “Our Meetings and Ministry.”


54:17.870 --> 54:20.607
We’d like to conclude our program


54:20.607 --> 54:24.110
with a visit  
to the Catania Fleming English Congregation


54:24.110 --> 54:27.047
on the beautiful island of Sicily. 


54:27.047 --> 54:30.450
The small congregation 
has 46 publishers 


54:30.450 --> 54:32.452
and 16 pioneers, 


54:32.452 --> 54:34.487
but they’re conducting on average 


54:34.487 --> 54:37.690
more than 60 Bible studies. 


54:37.690 --> 54:40.027
Critical times in this system of things 


54:40.027 --> 54:42.395
are also giving them 
special opportunities 


54:42.395 --> 54:44.330
in the ministry. 


54:44.330 --> 54:46.465
Their territory includes 


54:46.465 --> 54:48.702
one of the largest refugee camps 
in Europe. 


54:48.702 --> 54:51.705
It provides shelter 
to people coming from countries 


54:51.705 --> 54:55.175
such as Nigeria, Gambia, Ghana, 


54:55.175 --> 54:57.743
Eritrea, and Somalia.


54:57.743 --> 55:01.546
Each week, a group of publishers 
drives an hour to the camp 


55:01.547 --> 55:04.817
to give a witness and conduct studies. 


55:04.817 --> 55:09.990
Residents from the camp also come by bus 
to attend the weekend meeting. 


55:09.990 --> 55:11.858
The brothers and sisters 


55:11.858 --> 55:14.760
of the Catania Fleming English Congregation 


55:14.760 --> 55:17.463
send you their love and greetings. 


55:17.463 --> 55:20.100
We thank Jehovah for their willing spirit 


55:20.100 --> 55:23.268
to bring comfort to others 
with the good news.


55:23.268 --> 55:26.171
Thank you for being with us this month. 


55:26.172 --> 55:29.075
From the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,   


55:29.075 --> 55:37.802
this is JW Broadcasting!
