Welcome to the December 2024 edition

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:08.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:29.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 140th annual meeting

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:32.219 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.804 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Pennsylvania

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:37.766 line:10% position:50% align:center
was held on October 5, 2024.

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
The program featured
encouraging spiritual talks and videos.

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:47.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please enjoy
the first part of the annual meeting!

00:00:48.694 --> 00:00:51.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what an eventful year it has been!

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:56.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
As expressed at Psalm 65:11,

00:00:56.035 --> 00:00:59.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has indeed
‘crowned the year with goodness’

00:00:59.496 --> 00:01:01.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a spiritual sense.

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:04.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since our last annual meeting,
Jehovah has directed his people 

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:08.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
in many different ways,
reflecting his love and wisdom.

00:01:08.005 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the most significant occurrence

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that we’ve welcomed back thousands

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:17.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had been removed from the congregation.

00:01:17.556 --> 00:01:21.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
And certainly there has been
great “joy in heaven”

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:23.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
but here on earth as well.

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:25.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re delighted to have these dear ones

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:27.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
back with us once again, wouldn’t you agree?

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, we were thrilled
by this year’s conventions

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:46.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
featuring <i>The Good News According to Jesus,</i>

00:01:46.543 --> 00:01:49.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we saw in the video prelude.

00:01:49.213 --> 00:01:53.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we just completed a global campaign
to start Bible studies.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see the growth
that’s taking place in the field.

00:01:58.389 --> 00:02:03.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in other news, there’s a new product
in the Bethel commissary—beard butter,

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be confused with the butter
that you spread on your toast.

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, adjustments to our dress and grooming
were also a highlight of the year.

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, less than a year ago,
the PVC opened for tours,

00:02:21.537 --> 00:02:23.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to be confused with polyvinyl chloride

00:02:23.956 --> 00:02:26.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all you plumbers out there.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:30.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we’re talking about the PVC,
the Patterson Visitors’ Center.

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:33.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an experience
from the first-century village.

00:02:33.173 --> 00:02:35.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
A young girl was very impressed
by the village

00:02:35.843 --> 00:02:38.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was trying to just understand,
or comprehend,

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:40.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
what she was seeing around her.

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:44.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
She noticed all the costumed attendants
walking around

00:02:44.518 --> 00:02:48.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
demonstrating trades
or just speaking with the visitors.

00:02:48.063 --> 00:02:51.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
She asked her mother,
“Are these resurrected ones?”

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:58.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
A young boy about ten was with his family

00:02:58.657 --> 00:03:03.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoyed seeing a brother in costume
demonstrating the winepress.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the family continued walking
through the marketplace

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:09.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then into the courtyard,
but the little boy kept coming back.

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
He kept coming back to the winepress,

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:14.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the costumed attendant told him,
“You must really enjoy it here.”

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said, “Yes!”

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:21.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then the boy paused, and he said,
“I’m from the future.”

00:03:35.444 --> 00:03:39.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went on to show his phone to the attendant
and show how he has the Bible on it.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
The attendant explained

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:45.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’d seen others
come through the village with such devices,

00:03:45.454 --> 00:03:47.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he only reads Hebrew.

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young brother looked at him and said,

00:03:51.168 --> 00:03:53.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have the Bible in many languages.”

00:03:54.713 --> 00:03:58.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the young brother put himself
into the spirit of the time period

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was quite affected
by the impact of the Bible village.

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:05.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no doubt you too will enjoy your tour,
if you haven’t already gone.

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:07.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if it’s a return visit,
you’ll still be delighted

00:04:07.601 --> 00:04:09.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see people from the first century.

00:04:11.146 --> 00:04:14.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in years gone by, Brother Russell Kurzen

00:04:14.775 --> 00:04:16.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
(many of you remember him)

00:04:16.944 --> 00:04:20.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
was sort of like the Bethel historian
because he would relate

00:04:20.447 --> 00:04:23.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
specific events that occurred on that day

00:04:23.992 --> 00:04:29.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Morning Worship chairman, who often
would share them then with the Bethel family.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, today is October 5,

00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:35.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
so put on your thinking caps for a moment.

00:04:35.087 --> 00:04:38.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
What noteworthy events in history

00:04:38.298 --> 00:04:40.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
have occurred on October 5?

00:04:42.344 --> 00:04:46.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does “MENE, MENE, TEKEL, and PARSIN”
ring a bell?

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the handwriting on the wall
appeared in Belshazzar’s palace

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:54.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
on October 5, 539 B.C.E.,

00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:56.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the Gregorian calendar.

00:04:58.152 --> 00:05:00.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about in our Common Era?

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the month of October 1924,

00:05:05.284 --> 00:05:08.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people were busy
distributing around the world

00:05:08.203 --> 00:05:10.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
a printed resolution entitled

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:13.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Ecclesiastics Indicted.</i>

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:16.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this is a copy of that tract, life-size.

00:05:16.837 --> 00:05:20.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine distributing this tract
to people in your territory

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
or putting it in their doors.

00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:25.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
The introduction to the resolution
stated the following:

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:32.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The indictment herein is laid chiefly
against the clergy,

00:05:32.728 --> 00:05:36.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“showing that they have fallen
before the temptations of Satan,

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
“proved unfaithful to the Lord
and to the responsibility resting upon them;

00:05:41.361 --> 00:05:43.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that this is the chief cause

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the world’s present deplorable state”

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
—strong words from the organization
back in 1924.

00:05:52.247 --> 00:05:54.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
Point number three
of the resolution stated this:

00:05:56.001 --> 00:06:00.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That they [the clergy] have failed
and refused to preach to the people

00:06:00.214 --> 00:06:02.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the message of Messiah’s kingdom

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:07.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to point them to the evidences
relating to his second coming;

00:06:07.095 --> 00:06:10.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and being unwilling to await
the Lord’s due time to set up His kingdom

00:06:10.891 --> 00:06:13.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and being ambitious
to appear wise and great,

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:16.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they have,
together with their co-conspirators,

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“claimed the ability to set up
God’s kingdom on earth without God,

00:06:21.735 --> 00:06:24.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and have endorsed the League of Nations
and declared it to be

00:06:24.738 --> 00:06:27.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the political expression
of God’s kingdom on earth,’

00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:33.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“thereby breaking their allegiance
to the Lord Jesus Christ

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:37.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and declaring their allegiance to the devil,
the god of evil;

00:06:39.962 --> 00:06:43.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to this end they have advocated
and sanctified war,

00:06:43.465 --> 00:06:47.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“turned their church edifices
into recruiting stations

00:06:47.094 --> 00:06:50.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[does that sound like any
of the churches in modern times?],

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
“acted as recruiting officers for pay,

00:06:52.474 --> 00:06:56.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and preached men into the trenches,
there to suffer and die”

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
—quite a resolution—

00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:03.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Ecclesiastics Indicted.</i>

00:07:03.318 --> 00:07:04.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing has changed.

00:07:04.695 --> 00:07:09.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
The clergy still teach lies, foment war,
and fail to preach the good news.

00:07:09.366 --> 00:07:11.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re still riding
on the back of the beast too.

00:07:13.412 --> 00:07:15.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, back in 1924, as reported

00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:19.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the October 2024 study edition
of <i>The Watchtower:</i>

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:22.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘In the small town of Cleveland, Oklahoma,

00:07:22.587 --> 00:07:25.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Brother Frank Johnson

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘finished distributing the tracts

00:07:26.883 --> 00:07:30.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘20 minutes before he was
to be picked up by other publishers.

00:07:30.512 --> 00:07:33.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, he couldn’t just wait out in the open
because men from the town

00:07:33.598 --> 00:07:37.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘were angered 
and they were seeking to find him.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:40.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘So Brother Johnson
decided to hide in a nearby church.

‘Finding it empty,

00:07:44.818 --> 00:07:47.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘he left copies of <i>Ecclesiastics Indicted</i>

00:07:47.321 --> 00:07:50.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘in the preacher’s Bible and at each seat.

00:07:51.616 --> 00:07:54.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He exited the church
as quickly as he had come.

00:07:54.077 --> 00:07:57.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, he still had some time,
so he visited two more churches,

00:07:57.497 --> 00:08:00.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘following a similar pattern.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Frank rushed back to the spot
where he was to be picked up.

‘He hid behind a fuel station,

00:08:04.046 --> 00:08:06.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘keeping an eye out for the men
who were after him.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘The men drove by, but they didn’t see him.

00:08:09.092 --> 00:08:11.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘As soon as they were gone,
Frank’s fellow preachers,

00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:13.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘who had been witnessing nearby,
arrived to pick him up,

00:08:13.388 --> 00:08:15.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and they all drove off together.

00:08:15.474 --> 00:08:17.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Now, as they were leaving town,

00:08:17.768 --> 00:08:19.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘one of the brothers recalled:

00:08:19.686 --> 00:08:22.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“We passed by the three churches.

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:26.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“There were as many as 50 people standing
out in front of each church.

‘“Some of the people were reading the tract,

‘“others were holding it up
for the preacher to see.

00:08:30.489 --> 00:08:32.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘“Well, we had a very close call!”

00:08:32.532 --> 00:08:36.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He said: “But we thanked
Jehovah our God for his protection

00:08:36.286 --> 00:08:39.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the knowledge to outwit
these enemies of the Kingdom.”’

00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:44.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s part of our theocratic history,
your theocratic history.

00:08:44.503 --> 00:08:46.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
You continue to preach
with the same boldness.

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:48.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were exciting times,

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:52.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we too are living in exciting times.

00:08:52.928 --> 00:08:56.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
On October 5, 2002,

00:08:56.807 --> 00:09:01.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was announced at the annual meeting
that printing operations in the United States

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be moved from Brooklyn to Wallkill.

00:09:05.607 --> 00:09:06.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:09:08.193 --> 00:09:11.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
On October 5, 2013, what happened?

00:09:11.822 --> 00:09:13.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely you recall, Brother Jackson

00:09:13.824 --> 00:09:17.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
released the revised <i>New World Translation</i>
in English.

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:18.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:09:19.788 --> 00:09:23.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
On October 5, 2019, what happened?

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:26.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Ramapo project was announced.

00:09:26.795 --> 00:09:28.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:09:28.296 --> 00:09:32.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah continues to bless his organization.

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:33.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what will we hear today?

00:09:35.011 --> 00:09:36.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Calls to action?

00:09:37.848 --> 00:09:39.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kind reminders?

00:09:40.225 --> 00:09:42.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exciting announcements?

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:44.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Praise to Jehovah?

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a few surprises along the way.

00:09:48.358 --> 00:09:49.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
So don’t change the channel.

00:09:52.028 --> 00:09:54.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ten years ago at the annual meeting of 2014,

00:09:54.614 --> 00:09:57.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were introduced to the first epic episode

00:09:57.909 --> 00:10:00.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the series <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend.</i>

00:10:01.163 --> 00:10:05.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was entitled
<i>Jehovah Will Help You Be Bold.</i>

00:10:05.667 --> 00:10:09.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since that time, five additional
epic episodes have been released,

00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:12.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
including <i>Make Jehovah Happy,</i>

00:10:12.215 --> 00:10:15.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Jehovah Forgives,</i>
<i>Does Jehovah Answer Prayers?,</i>

00:10:15.802 --> 00:10:19.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Who Should Be My Friend?,</i>
and <i> You Are Precious to Jehovah.</i>

00:10:19.097 --> 00:10:23.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
How these videos have helped
our young ones and really all of us

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:27.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
to visualize Bible accounts
and heavenly realities!

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:30.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re happy to inform you
that another epic episode

00:10:30.317 --> 00:10:33.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
will soon be ready for release
but not just yet.

00:10:34.821 --> 00:10:37.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we can show you the trailer
to increase anticipation.

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:41.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s entitled <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>
<i>—The Greatest Act of Love.</i>

00:10:41.369 --> 00:10:42.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:10:47.542 --> 00:10:49.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
I miss her so much.

00:10:52.797 --> 00:10:53.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:10:53.882 --> 00:10:55.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, we’re having the Memorial,

00:10:55.884 --> 00:10:57.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you have to come!

00:10:57.344 --> 00:10:59.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the most important event.

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:04.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves all of us.

00:11:04.476 --> 00:11:06.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves you.

00:11:06.228 --> 00:11:09.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon, Jesus will resurrect people,

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:12.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
and because he died for us,
we can all live forever!

00:11:13.068 --> 00:11:15.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the greatest gift anyone could give us.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom!

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:19.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we get ready for the Memorial?

00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:20.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s do it!

00:11:20.659 --> 00:11:22.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yay!

00:11:22.118 --> 00:11:24.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we all go home tonight,

00:11:24.913 --> 00:11:27.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about what Jesus’ sacrifice

00:11:27.832 --> 00:11:29.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
means to you.

00:11:51.106 --> 00:11:55.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, we anticipate the release
of the full-length episode.

00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:57.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the next part of our program

00:11:57.195 --> 00:12:00.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a symposium from three members
of the Governing Body.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:03.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each speaker will introduce the next.

00:12:03.076 --> 00:12:05.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the first talk of our symposium

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:10.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be given by the longest-serving member
of the Governing Body, Brother Gerrit Lösch.

00:12:10.292 --> 00:12:15.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
This past July, he completed 30 years
of serving on the Governing Body.

00:12:15.297 --> 00:12:20.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lösch will now discuss the theme
“Our Privilege to Glorify Jehovah.”

00:12:28.018 --> 00:12:31.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can see, this is a mirror.

00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:40.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you look into a mirror
before you came here?

00:12:41.781 --> 00:12:45.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps judging
by your neat and clean appearance,

00:12:45.827 --> 00:12:48.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
you obviously did.

00:12:48.288 --> 00:12:51.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ancient mirrors
were generally made of metal,

00:12:51.791 --> 00:12:56.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as bronze or copper
and even silver and gold.

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:59.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to be highly polished

00:12:59.174 --> 00:13:03.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
but still did not have
finely reflecting surfaces

00:13:03.511 --> 00:13:05.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
as do glass mirrors.

00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:11.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is why the apostle Paul said
at 1 Corinthians 13:12:

00:13:11.561 --> 00:13:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For now we see in hazy outline

00:13:16.232 --> 00:13:19.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of a metal mirror.”

00:13:19.527 --> 00:13:22.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Probably only in the first century

00:13:22.447 --> 00:13:25.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
were glass mirrors introduced.

00:13:26.534 --> 00:13:30.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Scriptures,
we find two figurative uses

00:13:30.997 --> 00:13:33.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the term “mirror.”

00:13:34.959 --> 00:13:38.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
at James chapter 1

00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:42.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 22-25, it says:

00:13:42.258 --> 00:13:47.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, become doers of the word
and not hearers only,

00:13:47.097 --> 00:13:50.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“deceiving yourselves with false reasoning.

00:13:50.558 --> 00:13:54.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For if anyone is a hearer of the word
and not a doer,

00:13:54.729 --> 00:13:58.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“this one is like a man
looking at his own face in a mirror.

00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:03.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he looks at himself,
and he goes away

00:14:03.738 --> 00:14:06.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and immediately forgets
what sort of person he is.

00:14:06.616 --> 00:14:08.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But the one who peers

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“into the perfect law that belongs to freedom

00:14:12.330 --> 00:14:14.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and continues in it

00:14:14.082 --> 00:14:19.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has become, not a forgetful hearer,
but a doer of the work;

00:14:19.087 --> 00:14:22.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will be happy in what he does.”

00:14:24.884 --> 00:14:27.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the apostle Paul

00:14:27.095 --> 00:14:31.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed that Christians reflect like mirrors

00:14:31.266 --> 00:14:35.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
the glory of Jehovah in their ministry.

00:14:35.729 --> 00:14:38.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Corinthians chapter 3,

00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:41.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wrote at chapter 3 and verse 18:

00:14:45.989 --> 00:14:47.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And all of us,

00:14:47.991 --> 00:14:50.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“while we with unveiled faces

00:14:50.994 --> 00:14:55.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
“reflect like mirrors the glory of Jehovah,

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:58.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are transformed into the same image

00:14:58.168 --> 00:15:01.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from one degree of glory to another,

00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:04.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
exactly as it is done by Jehovah the Spirit.”

00:15:05.675 --> 00:15:08.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in chapter 4, verse 1, he says:

00:15:08.678 --> 00:15:13.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, since we have this ministry

00:15:13.183 --> 00:15:17.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the mercy that was shown us,
we do not give up.”

00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:22.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
So God’s Word is compared to a mirror

00:15:22.734 --> 00:15:25.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can use to examine ourselves.

00:15:26.821 --> 00:15:30.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
Christians themselves

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
are also compared to a mirror

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:37.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a mirror that reflects Jehovah’s glory.

00:15:37.207 --> 00:15:40.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how do the Scriptures
use the word “glory”?

00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:44.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there are different types of glory.

00:15:45.924 --> 00:15:48.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Corinthians chapter 15,

00:15:48.635 --> 00:15:52.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 40-44, it says:

00:15:52.597 --> 00:15:56.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And there are heavenly bodies
and earthly bodies;

00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:59.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the glory of the heavenly bodies
is one sort,

00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:02.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that of the earthly bodies
is a different sort.

00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:05.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The glory of the sun is one sort,

00:16:05.527 --> 00:16:07.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the glory of the moon is another,

00:16:07.695 --> 00:16:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the glory of the stars is another;

00:16:10.573 --> 00:16:14.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in fact, one star differs
from another star in glory.

00:16:14.994 --> 00:16:17.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So it is with the resurrection of the dead.

00:16:17.747 --> 00:16:21.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is sown in corruption;
it is raised up in incorruption.

00:16:21.835 --> 00:16:26.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is sown in dishonor;
it is raised up in glory.

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:30.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is sown in weakness;
it is raised up in power.

00:16:30.802 --> 00:16:35.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is sown a physical body;
it is raised up a spiritual body.”

00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:41.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s discuss five types of glory.

00:16:42.981 --> 00:16:46.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah has and deserves

00:16:46.067 --> 00:16:48.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
the highest degree of glory.

00:16:49.445 --> 00:16:52.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then there’s the glory of Jesus,

00:16:52.407 --> 00:16:55.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is second to the one of God.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:58.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
At John 1:14, it says:

00:16:58.204 --> 00:17:01.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the Word became flesh
and resided among us,

00:17:01.624 --> 00:17:04.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we had a view of his glory,

00:17:04.502 --> 00:17:07.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a glory such as belongs

00:17:07.213 --> 00:17:10.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to an only-begotten son from a father;

00:17:10.049 --> 00:17:14.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was full of divine favor and truth.”

00:17:14.262 --> 00:17:16.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
—John 1:14.

00:17:18.016 --> 00:17:22.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible shows that Jesus was given
more glory after his resurrection

00:17:22.729 --> 00:17:25.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
than he had before he came to the earth.

00:17:25.899 --> 00:17:28.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Jesus, who was made

00:17:28.484 --> 00:17:31.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a little lower than angels,

00:17:31.946 --> 00:17:35.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“now crowned with glory and honor

00:17:35.617 --> 00:17:37.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
for having suffered death.”

00:17:37.702 --> 00:17:40.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Hebrews 2:9.

00:17:41.289 --> 00:17:42.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third point:

00:17:42.999 --> 00:17:47.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Annointed Christians
also have a measure of glory.

00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jude verse 8 says

00:17:49.505 --> 00:17:52.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in the first century there were some who

00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:56.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
were “speaking abusively of glorious ones.”

00:17:56.971 --> 00:18:00.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who were the “glorious ones”
in the first century?

00:18:00.808 --> 00:18:03.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anointed overseers.

00:18:03.394 --> 00:18:07.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had a measure of glory
when they lived on earth.

00:18:08.816 --> 00:18:13.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Number four:
When taken to heaven, all anointed,

00:18:13.696 --> 00:18:18.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only anointed overseers,
will receive everlasting glory.

00:18:18.701 --> 00:18:21.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 2:10 says:

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:24.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this reason I go on enduring all things

00:18:24.749 --> 00:18:27.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the sake of the chosen ones,

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:32.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they too may obtain the salvation
that is through Christ Jesus,

00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:35.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with everlasting glory.”

00:18:37.345 --> 00:18:41.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we have today
not a few but many glorious ones,

00:18:41.099 --> 00:18:43.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
even sitting in the audience right here.

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the expression “glorious ones”

00:18:49.023 --> 00:18:53.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
refers also to elders with an earthly hope. 

00:18:53.903 --> 00:18:56.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower,</i> 1997,

00:18:56.656 --> 00:19:00.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
September 1, page 16,

00:19:00.743 --> 00:19:03.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
paragraph 14 says:

00:19:03.454 --> 00:19:06.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Christian elders represent

00:19:06.457 --> 00:19:09.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the glorious Jehovah God and his Son

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:13.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and, as a result, have certain glory

00:19:13.297 --> 00:19:15.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
“conferred upon them.

00:19:15.550 --> 00:19:19.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“True, they make mistakes,
as did Peter himself,

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:22.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the Scriptures urge
members of the congregation

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:27.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be submissive to such glorious ones.”

00:19:27.311 --> 00:19:29.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
(End of quote)

00:19:29.731 --> 00:19:32.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
And number five:

00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:35.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s the glorious good news.

00:19:35.653 --> 00:19:37.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what hope we have,

00:19:37.947 --> 00:19:42.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
we glorify Jehovah
through our preaching and teaching.

00:19:42.493 --> 00:19:45.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Corinthians 4:3, 4 says:

00:19:45.079 --> 00:19:49.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In fact, the good news we declare is veiled,

00:19:49.333 --> 00:19:52.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is veiled among those who are perishing,

00:19:52.086 --> 00:19:54.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“among whom the god of this system of things

00:19:54.088 --> 00:19:56.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has blinded the minds of the unbelievers,

00:19:56.382 --> 00:20:00.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the illumination
of the glorious good news

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:03.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the Christ . . .
might not shine through.”

00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:10.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we all glorify Jehovah?

00:20:10.521 --> 00:20:13.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only overseers and other adults
in the congregation

00:20:13.983 --> 00:20:16.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflect Jehovah’s glory

00:20:16.569 --> 00:20:19.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also children can do so.

00:20:20.865 --> 00:20:23.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Children, are you aware of it?

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too!

00:20:25.828 --> 00:20:29.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we all can glorify Jehovah.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:30.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:20:30.583 --> 00:20:32.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
In at least six ways.

00:20:35.505 --> 00:20:37.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting with point one,

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:42.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
we glorify him through our prayers

00:20:42.178 --> 00:20:45.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then also by singing Kingdom songs.

00:20:46.516 --> 00:20:47.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another point,

00:20:47.975 --> 00:20:52.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
we glorify him
by accumulating accurate knowledge.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:56.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Corinthians 4:6, therefore, says:

00:20:56.984 --> 00:21:01.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For God is the one who said:
‘Let the light shine out of darkness,’

00:21:01.239 --> 00:21:05.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he has shone on our hearts
to illuminate them

00:21:05.076 --> 00:21:09.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the glorious knowledge of God
by the face of Christ.”

00:21:10.998 --> 00:21:15.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further, we glorify Jehovah
by our Christian conduct.

00:21:15.837 --> 00:21:19.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we absorb this light
of glorious knowledge of God

00:21:19.966 --> 00:21:23.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and transform our lives according to it.

00:21:23.302 --> 00:21:26.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
It brings glory to Jehovah God.

00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:31.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
One’s conduct can also cause others
to give glory to God.

00:21:31.185 --> 00:21:34.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our conduct is not perfect.
We all know that.

00:21:34.689 --> 00:21:37.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, Jehovah accepts us.

00:21:37.108 --> 00:21:41.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, that does not excuse us
from keeping ourselves as mirrors

00:21:41.529 --> 00:21:46.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a clean and polished shape
as much as we can.

00:21:47.368 --> 00:21:52.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the dark,
no mirror reflects anything

00:21:52.373 --> 00:21:54.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
except darkness.

00:21:54.834 --> 00:21:58.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
The mirror does not have
any glory or light in itself.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:04.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, we are aware
that any glory we might have

00:22:04.093 --> 00:22:07.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just a reflection of God’s glory.

00:22:09.182 --> 00:22:12.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 2:12 says:

00:22:12.393 --> 00:22:15.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Maintain your conduct fine
among the nations,

00:22:15.479 --> 00:22:19.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that when they accuse you
of being wrongdoers,

00:22:19.275 --> 00:22:22.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they may be eyewitnesses of your fine works

00:22:22.403 --> 00:22:25.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and, as a result, glorify God

00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:27.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the day of his inspection.”

00:22:30.328 --> 00:22:32.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further, we glorify him

00:22:32.663 --> 00:22:35.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
by doing good to others.

00:22:35.583 --> 00:22:39.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Matthew 5:16,
in the Sermon on the Mount,

00:22:39.378 --> 00:22:43.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus himself showed
that preaching and teaching is not enough.

00:22:45.301 --> 00:22:49.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to do good things to others
aside from it.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to love our neighbors,
including those at our workplace.

00:22:54.518 --> 00:22:58.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
This may prompt people
who are not Witnesses of Jehovah

00:22:58.356 --> 00:23:00.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
to glorify God.

00:23:00.650 --> 00:23:04.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jesus put it (I quote):

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let your light shine before men,

00:23:06.864 --> 00:23:10.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they may see your fine works

00:23:10.785 --> 00:23:13.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[so it’s not just preaching but fine works]

00:23:13.579 --> 00:23:17.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give glory to your Father
who is in the heavens.”

00:23:19.835 --> 00:23:21.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s another way

00:23:21.837 --> 00:23:26.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all can reflect the glory of Jehovah
like mirrors?

00:23:26.676 --> 00:23:30.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
We glorify him by our preaching and teaching.

00:23:30.012 --> 00:23:32.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to conduct many Bible studies,

00:23:32.723 --> 00:23:35.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to impart

00:23:35.476 --> 00:23:38.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the glorious knowledge of God” to others.

00:23:38.688 --> 00:23:42.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For God is the one who said:
‘Let the light shine out of darkness,’

00:23:42.233 --> 00:23:45.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he has shone on our hearts
to illuminate them,”

00:23:45.695 --> 00:23:49.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
says Paul at 2 Corinthians 4:6.

00:23:49.073 --> 00:23:50.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he continues:

00:23:50.741 --> 00:23:54.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Illuminate them
with the glorious knowledge of God

00:23:54.245 --> 00:23:56.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the face of Christ.”

00:23:57.373 --> 00:23:59.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of us who are older
have had the privilege

00:23:59.625 --> 00:24:03.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
of reflecting the glory of Jehovah

00:24:03.004 --> 00:24:05.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
for perhaps decades.

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:08.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has allowed us
not only the privilege

00:24:08.217 --> 00:24:11.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
of proclaiming the message
of the Kingdom

00:24:11.387 --> 00:24:15.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also some have served
as elders, pioneers,

00:24:15.224 --> 00:24:19.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
missionaries, Bethelites,
construction servants,

00:24:19.186 --> 00:24:22.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
circuit overseers,
or Branch Committee members.

00:24:22.773 --> 00:24:25.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are ways that we have reflected

00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:28.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
the glory of Jehovah.

00:24:28.195 --> 00:24:31.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege we’ve had to do so,
haven’t we?

00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:37.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
In spite of all these privileges,
we maintain a humble spirit.

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:40.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate
that the privileges we have enjoyed

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:44.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
are an undeserved kindness from Jehovah.

00:24:44.462 --> 00:24:46.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having enjoyed so many privileges,

00:24:46.714 --> 00:24:51.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
what unique responsibility
do we as older ones now have?

00:24:53.137 --> 00:24:55.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must allow
the next generation to come up

00:24:55.973 --> 00:24:58.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they too can enjoy

00:24:58.142 --> 00:25:01.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
unique privileges in glorifying Jehovah.

00:25:01.812 --> 00:25:05.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are the next generation
of circuit overseers,

00:25:05.483 --> 00:25:07.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bethelites, missionaries,

00:25:07.735 --> 00:25:12.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
construction servants,
Branch Committee members, and so on.

00:25:12.823 --> 00:25:17.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want them to have the marvelous privilege

00:25:17.078 --> 00:25:19.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have enjoyed as well.

00:25:19.747 --> 00:25:22.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means we must look for ways

00:25:22.833 --> 00:25:27.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
to teach them, to train them,
to encourage them

00:25:27.797 --> 00:25:31.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they may use their youth and strength

00:25:31.217 --> 00:25:34.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ability to glorify Jehovah.

00:25:34.387 --> 00:25:37.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege we have as older ones

00:25:37.264 --> 00:25:39.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
to train and teach younger ones!

00:25:41.977 --> 00:25:46.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind,
it is a pleasure to announce

00:25:46.107 --> 00:25:50.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
that two additional brothers

00:25:50.611 --> 00:25:55.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been appointed to serve
as members of the Governing Body.

00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:13.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Brothers Jody Jedele and Jacob Rumph

00:26:13.926 --> 00:26:16.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both brothers are anointed Christians

00:26:16.303 --> 00:26:20.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have a long history
of loyal service to Jehovah.

00:26:20.766 --> 00:26:24.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Jedele began
his full-time service in 1989

00:26:24.395 --> 00:26:27.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Bethel service in 1990.

00:26:27.606 --> 00:26:30.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Rumph began
his full-time service in 1995

00:26:30.734 --> 00:26:33.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Bethel service in 2020.

00:26:33.487 --> 00:26:35.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both brothers served as helpers

00:26:35.739 --> 00:26:39.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Service Committee
of the Governing Body for a while.

00:26:39.285 --> 00:26:41.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank our heavenly Father, Jehovah,

00:26:41.579 --> 00:26:44.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
for raising up such faithful men

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:46.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share in the work of the Governing Body.

00:26:46.584 --> 00:26:49.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pray that Jehovah will richly bless

00:26:49.336 --> 00:26:52.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Jedele and Rumph and their wives.

00:27:05.186 --> 00:27:09.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all worship our glorious God, Jehovah.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the glorious good news to spread.

00:27:12.735 --> 00:27:16.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our whole life
is for the glory of his praise.

00:27:16.947 --> 00:27:19.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote at 1 Corinthians 10:31:

00:27:19.575 --> 00:27:22.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whether you are eating or drinking

00:27:22.369 --> 00:27:25.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or doing anything else,

00:27:25.164 --> 00:27:28.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
do all things for God’s glory.”

00:27:29.752 --> 00:27:34.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you endeavor
to reflect like a mirror Jehovah’s glory

00:27:34.632 --> 00:27:39.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
by making the truth manifest
in word and example?

00:27:39.553 --> 00:27:41.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege!

00:27:41.597 --> 00:27:43.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the Millennium,

00:27:43.682 --> 00:27:48.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
faithful ones on earth
will receive and display a measure of glory

00:27:48.687 --> 00:27:52.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
as perfect sons and daughters of Jehovah.

00:27:53.526 --> 00:27:56.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says at Romans 8:21:

00:27:56.195 --> 00:27:59.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The creation itself will also be set free

00:27:59.281 --> 00:28:01.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from enslavement to corruption

00:28:01.992 --> 00:28:06.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have the glorious freedom
of the children of God.”

00:28:08.165 --> 00:28:12.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
So keep polishing that mirror.

00:28:12.336 --> 00:28:16.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at the mirror of God’s Word every day.

00:28:16.257 --> 00:28:19.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like a mirror, reflect God’s glory

00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
by what you say and do.

00:28:22.054 --> 00:28:25.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appreciate your privilege
to glorify Jehovah God.

00:28:25.307 --> 00:28:28.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Help young ones
to take on privileges of service.

00:28:28.894 --> 00:28:31.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
We trust you will,

00:28:31.021 --> 00:28:35.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we wish you Jehovah’s rich blessing
in this endeavor.

00:28:35.234 --> 00:28:39.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
So keep polishing
and keep reflecting the light.

00:28:59.383 --> 00:29:01.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how can you, our young ones,

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
glorify Jehovah by serving,

00:29:04.305 --> 00:29:08.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
for instance, at Bethel
and in theocratic construction?

00:29:09.518 --> 00:29:12.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
What opportunities are available

00:29:12.021 --> 00:29:14.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
for younger ones today?

00:29:14.607 --> 00:29:17.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the answers to these questions,

00:29:17.067 --> 00:29:19.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us now give our attention

00:29:19.486 --> 00:29:22.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Brother Jeffrey Winder,
a member of the Governing Body,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:27.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will share the next talk
in this symposium entitled

00:29:27.119 --> 00:29:30.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Opportunities to Glorify Jehovah

00:29:30.956 --> 00:29:33.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Bethel and in Theocratic Construction.”

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:39.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 2,700 years ago,

00:29:39.423 --> 00:29:43.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God inspired the faithful man Isaiah

00:29:43.052 --> 00:29:46.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
to utter a prophecy
that you and I are seeing fulfilled

00:29:46.764 --> 00:29:49.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
before our eyes.

00:29:49.475 --> 00:29:51.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found in Isaiah chapter 60.

00:29:51.602 --> 00:29:54.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to turn there with me.

00:29:57.441 --> 00:29:59.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 60

00:29:59.443 --> 00:30:01.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and let’s read together verse 22.

00:30:05.574 --> 00:30:09.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
That verse says:
“The little one will become a thousand

00:30:09.411 --> 00:30:12.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the small one a mighty nation.

00:30:12.498 --> 00:30:14.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I myself, Jehovah,

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:18.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
will speed it up in its own time.”

00:30:19.755 --> 00:30:24.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like passengers in a car
that is increasing in speed,

00:30:24.385 --> 00:30:26.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you sense the momentum

00:30:26.512 --> 00:30:29.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what Jehovah’s organization
is doing today?

00:30:38.649 --> 00:30:42.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is accomplishing
a tremendous work worldwide

00:30:42.653 --> 00:30:46.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
all in connection
with the Kingdom preaching work.

00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:51.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the face of Satanic attack
and the wickedness of the last days,

00:30:51.036 --> 00:30:55.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah is accomplishing
truly glorifies his name.

00:30:57.167 --> 00:30:59.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because so much work is being done,

00:30:59.586 --> 00:31:03.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a need for more workers
to keep up with this work.

00:31:03.966 --> 00:31:06.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this talk,
we’re specifically going to talk

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:10.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the needs at Bethel
and in theocratic construction.

00:31:11.765 --> 00:31:14.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what is the need?

00:31:14.059 --> 00:31:16.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Bethel, we have a constant need

00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:19.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
for spiritually qualified men and women

00:31:19.857 --> 00:31:24.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can help carry the load
of the ever-increasing and complex work.

00:31:24.862 --> 00:31:27.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there is a particular need

00:31:27.114 --> 00:31:30.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
for young brothers
who can apply to come to Bethel

00:31:30.534 --> 00:31:35.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be trained and in time qualify
to serve as overseers

00:31:35.038 --> 00:31:38.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to take the lead in departments
such as the Service Department,

00:31:38.083 --> 00:31:41.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Public Information Department,
Hospital Information Department,

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many others.

00:31:44.548 --> 00:31:48.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need brothers
who can in time qualify to serve

00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:51.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
on Branch Committees.

00:31:51.096 --> 00:31:54.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even in branches
where the Bethel family is small,

00:31:54.057 --> 00:31:56.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need young brothers to apply

00:31:56.643 --> 00:32:00.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the brothers and sisters
who have been carrying the load for years—

00:32:00.230 --> 00:32:03.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love them, but they’re getting older.

00:32:03.358 --> 00:32:05.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they have a zeal for the work,

00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:07.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they recognize the need to train others

00:32:07.613 --> 00:32:10.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that Jehovah’s work can continue.

00:32:12.159 --> 00:32:15.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about theocratic construction?

00:32:15.454 --> 00:32:18.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there, too,
there continues to be a need

00:32:18.081 --> 00:32:20.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
for spiritually qualified men and women

00:32:20.501 --> 00:32:23.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can help carry
the tremendous amount of work

00:32:23.128 --> 00:32:27.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is taking place
in facility construction worldwide.

00:32:27.257 --> 00:32:30.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there, too,
we need spiritually qualified men

00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:34.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can be trained in time
to take the lead as trade overseers,

00:32:34.723 --> 00:32:36.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve as construction committee members,

00:32:36.850 --> 00:32:39.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and care for other assignments.

00:32:39.561 --> 00:32:43.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how much work is there to do
in theocratic construction?

00:32:43.941 --> 00:32:46.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just to give you a glimpse,

00:32:46.151 --> 00:32:48.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
consider some of the needs
for Kingdom Halls

00:32:48.612 --> 00:32:51.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a few countries in Africa.

00:32:51.031 --> 00:32:53.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Congo reports a deficit

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
of nearly 1,900 new Kingdom Halls.

00:32:57.538 --> 00:32:59.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zambia reports a need

00:32:59.665 --> 00:33:02.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
for over 900 new Kingdom Halls.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mozambique and Angola
each have a need

00:33:05.796 --> 00:33:08.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
for almost 500 Kingdom Halls.

00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:11.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in Nigeria they have on their books

00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:14.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
a need for 2,000 renovations
of Kingdom Halls

00:33:14.012 --> 00:33:16.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
in addition to the new ones that they need.

00:33:16.265 --> 00:33:18.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s not to mention
all the work taking place

00:33:18.433 --> 00:33:21.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
in major branch construction,

00:33:21.144 --> 00:33:23.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
the construction
of remote translation offices,

00:33:23.772 --> 00:33:27.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
school facilities, Assembly Halls, and more.

00:33:27.025 --> 00:33:28.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a need?

00:33:28.569 --> 00:33:30.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely!

00:33:31.113 --> 00:33:34.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones,
especially you young ones in your teens

00:33:34.741 --> 00:33:37.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking about how you will use your life,

00:33:37.411 --> 00:33:40.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you get involved in the Bethel work

00:33:40.038 --> 00:33:42.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
and theocratic construction work?

00:33:42.916 --> 00:33:44.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should you?

00:33:44.918 --> 00:33:49.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you do, what will your life be like?

00:33:49.047 --> 00:33:51.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you live to regret it?

00:33:51.633 --> 00:33:54.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it possible that it would lead

00:33:54.052 --> 00:33:57.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a most fulfilling life
in this system of things?

00:33:58.724 --> 00:34:02.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to help answer those questions,
we invite you to watch the following video,

00:34:02.227 --> 00:34:06.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
which highlights comments
from ones who when they were young

00:34:06.565 --> 00:34:09.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
made the decision
to get involved in Bethel work

00:34:09.443 --> 00:34:11.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in theocratic construction work.

00:34:11.695 --> 00:34:13.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Watching this video

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:17.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
could be like looking at your life
in fast-forward.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:21.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you choose the course
that these ones chose,

00:34:21.204 --> 00:34:23.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
how would that turn out for you?

00:34:23.457 --> 00:34:24.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:34:40.933 --> 00:34:42.434 line:10% position:50% align:center
My name is Pavel.

00:34:42.434 --> 00:34:44.186 line:10% position:50% align:center
I serve at the Finland branch.

00:34:44.186 --> 00:34:46.313 line:10% position:50% align:center
My name is Brad Bourquin.

00:34:46.313 --> 00:34:48.649 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’m serving in the Congo.

00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:50.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
My name is Gina Slay.

00:34:50.567 --> 00:34:52.778 line:10% position:50% align:center
My name is Christopher Slay.

00:34:52.778 --> 00:34:55.447 line:10% position:50% align:center
And we serve in the Nigeria branch.

00:34:55.447 --> 00:34:57.240 line:10% position:50% align:center
My name is Karen Ferro.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.825 line:10% position:50% align:center
I live in Argentina.

00:34:58.825 --> 00:35:01.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up in a sign-language congregation
because I have deaf parents.

00:35:01.745 --> 00:35:04.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I saw the Sign Language
Department for the first time,

00:35:04.831 --> 00:35:06.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so impressed by it,

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:10.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so I developed
my first love for Bethel service.

00:35:11.797 --> 00:35:16.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a young man, there were
a lot of discussions with my father.

00:35:16.009 --> 00:35:20.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted, really, what amounted to
a normal life in this system.

00:35:20.305 --> 00:35:22.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think the contrast for me

00:35:22.557 --> 00:35:26.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the joy of being a fellow worker
with Jehovah in the preaching work

00:35:26.395 --> 00:35:29.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just to feel
that close friendship with him.

00:35:29.898 --> 00:35:32.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
I drifted from my goal
and from serving Jehovah

00:35:32.609 --> 00:35:34.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I didn’t have friends
in the congregation.

00:35:34.987 --> 00:35:36.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
I only had friends in school.

00:35:37.531 --> 00:35:40.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Jehovah,
I want to start serving you.

00:35:40.325 --> 00:35:44.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to give you my all, but tell me how.
Give me a kick.”

00:35:45.122 --> 00:35:47.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first step I took to be able to serve

00:35:47.416 --> 00:35:49.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
was when I was 18.

00:35:49.084 --> 00:35:51.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
I filled out a form to make myself available.

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:54.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a construction project
in my circuit,

00:35:54.089 --> 00:35:58.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
so with my older sister and two friends,
we started to work there.

00:35:58.301 --> 00:36:01.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was relatively near us,
so we supported the whole project.

00:36:01.972 --> 00:36:06.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say by getting closer
to happy pioneers

00:36:06.518 --> 00:36:09.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I realized that I was in the truth
and that they were in the truth,

00:36:09.688 --> 00:36:11.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they were happier than me.

00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:13.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I started regular auxiliary pioneering

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:15.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then regular pioneering.

00:36:15.902 --> 00:36:18.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our congregation,
there was a special pioneer couple.

00:36:18.780 --> 00:36:22.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before that, they served at Bethel,
and therefore they had a lot of experience.

00:36:22.993 --> 00:36:25.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked them questions:
“So I want to serve in Bethel.

00:36:25.787 --> 00:36:27.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do I need to do?
Tell me.”

00:36:29.416 --> 00:36:34.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I thought of Bethel,
I knew single sisters were serving there.

00:36:34.921 --> 00:36:37.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I became aware
of the construction work,

00:36:38.675 --> 00:36:42.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made myself available
to increase my service.

00:36:42.345 --> 00:36:45.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Serving Jehovah as fully as you can

00:36:45.307 --> 00:36:48.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not a matter of just drudgery

00:36:48.977 --> 00:36:51.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sacrifices in this system.

00:36:51.813 --> 00:36:55.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s actually the best way of life
we can live right now.

00:36:55.817 --> 00:37:00.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Taste and see that Jehovah is good”
—that will not fail.

00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:04.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be constantly active in serving Jehovah.

00:37:05.494 --> 00:37:08.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes it may seem
that it’s not much fun

00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:11.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
—perhaps it may seem boring—

00:37:11.625 --> 00:37:13.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
but actually

00:37:13.668 --> 00:37:17.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving Jehovah brings
so much joy and many blessings.

00:37:17.214 --> 00:37:19.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Genesis 48:15,

00:37:19.925 --> 00:37:24.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
it refers to Jehovah as being “the true God
who has been shepherding me

00:37:24.638 --> 00:37:27.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
during all my life until this day.”

00:37:27.849 --> 00:37:31.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob realized that Jehovah
had taken him to a spiritual place

00:37:31.645 --> 00:37:34.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he would never have been able
to go to on his own,

00:37:34.648 --> 00:37:37.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I feel that Jehovah
has done that with me.

00:37:52.707 --> 00:37:55.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
These friends are serving all over the globe
—aren’t they?—

00:37:55.627 --> 00:37:59.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
some in their home branch territories,
others in foreign assignments.

00:37:59.422 --> 00:38:02.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did they describe their life?

00:38:02.175 --> 00:38:05.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it drudgery and sacrifice and regret?

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:38:06.304 --> 00:38:08.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each one of them in one way or another

00:38:08.682 --> 00:38:12.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
said that it is the best way of life
that they could live.

00:38:12.394 --> 00:38:14.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
And didn’t you love what Karen said?

00:38:14.396 --> 00:38:18.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah can take you to a spiritual place
that you could never get to on your own.’

00:38:19.985 --> 00:38:24.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do these ones
find so much joy in their service?

00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one reason is because they know

00:38:27.242 --> 00:38:31.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are filling a clear need
in Jehovah’s work.

00:38:31.121 --> 00:38:34.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this way, they’re working
shoulder to shoulder with God and Christ

00:38:34.875 --> 00:38:37.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a work that is important to them,

00:38:37.169 --> 00:38:39.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that brings meaning to their life.

00:38:41.047 --> 00:38:43.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second reason
why they find so much joy

00:38:43.884 --> 00:38:46.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
is highlighted for us
in the book of Psalms.

00:38:46.219 --> 00:38:49.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to turn with me, please,
to Psalm 145,

00:38:52.225 --> 00:38:55.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s read together Psalm 145:2.

00:38:59.107 --> 00:39:00.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
That verse says:

00:39:00.817 --> 00:39:04.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All day long I will praise you;

00:39:04.321 --> 00:39:08.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will praise your name
forever and ever.”

00:39:08.491 --> 00:39:11.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Bethel
and in theocratic construction assignments,

00:39:11.286 --> 00:39:14.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have the opportunity to serve Jehovah

00:39:14.456 --> 00:39:17.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
all day every day, to praise Jehovah,

00:39:17.209 --> 00:39:19.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
to glorify him with all your strength.

00:39:19.628 --> 00:39:21.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
So all day of every day of your life

00:39:21.671 --> 00:39:24.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are engaged in theocratic activities,

00:39:24.216 --> 00:39:27.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that brings contentment and joy as well.

00:39:28.553 --> 00:39:31.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice
how each one of them got started?

00:39:31.306 --> 00:39:35.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
In many cases, it was someone else
in the congregation or in the circuit

00:39:35.185 --> 00:39:37.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
that encouraged them
to get involved in local projects,

00:39:37.646 --> 00:39:39.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
to turn in their application,

00:39:39.564 --> 00:39:42.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then their journey 
just continued from there.

00:39:43.526 --> 00:39:45.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young brothers and sisters,

00:39:45.528 --> 00:39:49.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want you to be able
to get involved in this exciting work

00:39:49.241 --> 00:39:51.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
as early as possible.

00:39:51.743 --> 00:39:55.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I have an exciting announcement
to read.

00:39:56.957 --> 00:39:59.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reads this way:

00:39:59.417 --> 00:40:02.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are pleased to inform you
that the Governing Body has decided

00:40:02.879 --> 00:40:06.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to reduce the minimum age requirement
to enter Bethel service

00:40:06.675 --> 00:40:10.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or to assist
with theocratic construction projects

00:40:10.095 --> 00:40:13.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
from 19 to 18 years of age.”

00:40:32.242 --> 00:40:35.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
It goes on:
“This adjustment is effective immediately.

00:40:36.663 --> 00:40:38.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why the change?

00:40:38.373 --> 00:40:41.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Here are three reasons
based on Bible principles.

00:40:41.876 --> 00:40:43.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reason number one:

00:40:43.878 --> 00:40:47.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is blessing his people with growth.

00:40:47.882 --> 00:40:50.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul stated at Colossians 1:6

00:40:50.176 --> 00:40:53.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that ‘the good news is bearing fruit

00:40:53.013 --> 00:40:55.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and increasing in all the world,

00:40:55.515 --> 00:40:57.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so it is also doing among you.’

00:40:58.852 --> 00:41:00.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Today, we are thrilled to see

00:41:00.979 --> 00:41:03.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“how the good news continues to bear fruit

00:41:03.398 --> 00:41:06.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and how much growth is taking place.

00:41:06.651 --> 00:41:10.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We also see Jehovah’s spirit
at work in you young ones,

00:41:10.613 --> 00:41:13.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we want to open up to you
the opportunity

00:41:13.158 --> 00:41:17.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to enter special forms of service
as soon as possible.

00:41:18.913 --> 00:41:20.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Reason number two:

00:41:20.915 --> 00:41:24.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our current and future needs
require more young brothers

00:41:24.461 --> 00:41:28.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to make themselves available
for expanded theocratic service.

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:29.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why?

00:41:29.883 --> 00:41:31.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Proverbs 20:29 says

00:41:31.885 --> 00:41:34.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that ‘the glory of young men
is their strength.’

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:40.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is a regular need for your help
to handle important assignments.

00:41:40.685 --> 00:41:42.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And reason number three:

00:41:42.687 --> 00:41:45.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We want you to benefit as soon as possible

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from additional theocratic training.

00:41:47.901 --> 00:41:50.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul said at Philippians 3:8:

00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:54.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘What is more, I do indeed also consider
all things to be loss

00:41:54.908 --> 00:41:57.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘on account of the excelling value

00:41:57.369 --> 00:42:00.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord.’

00:42:01.081 --> 00:42:05.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our heartfelt desire is
for as many of you young ones as possible

00:42:05.543 --> 00:42:09.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to experience the unique
and special training of excelling value

00:42:09.547 --> 00:42:13.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is available at Bethel
and on theocratic construction projects.

00:42:13.885 --> 00:42:17.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It will accelerate your training
in developing spiritual qualities

00:42:17.722 --> 00:42:21.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and equip you to handle

“and to address needs
at Bethel and in the field.

we encourage you to prayerfully consider

00:42:28.983 --> 00:42:31.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether you can make yourself available

00:42:31.236 --> 00:42:34.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy this special privilege of service.”

00:42:34.823 --> 00:42:36.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that exciting?

00:42:49.504 --> 00:42:52.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, truly, young ones,
we encourage you

00:42:52.048 --> 00:42:54.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take advantage of this opportunity.

00:42:54.717 --> 00:42:58.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Glorify Jehovah
by getting involved in Bethel work

00:42:58.638 --> 00:43:01.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in theocratic construction
as soon as possible.

00:43:03.935 --> 00:43:08.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you, especially you sisters,
might have noticed that some of our comments

00:43:08.273 --> 00:43:12.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
were weighted more toward encouraging
the young brothers to apply,

00:43:12.193 --> 00:43:14.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the reason for that
is because of the need

00:43:14.571 --> 00:43:18.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have for these brothers
to take the lead and direct the work

00:43:18.158 --> 00:43:20.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they grow and receive training.

00:43:20.493 --> 00:43:23.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we would be remiss
if we did not acknowledge

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:28.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
the hard work and self-sacrifice
of the young sisters in the organization.

00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:30.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact is, you’re doing it.

00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:33.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re there.
You are with us at Bethel.

00:43:33.089 --> 00:43:36.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are fully involved
in theocratic construction around the world.

00:43:36.259 --> 00:43:39.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of you are courageously accepting
foreign assignments.

00:43:39.387 --> 00:43:42.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we truly love you for your example

00:43:42.557 --> 00:43:44.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your life of self-sacrifice.

00:44:00.116 --> 00:44:02.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now a word to the parents:

00:44:03.411 --> 00:44:06.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that you parents love your children,

00:44:06.122 --> 00:44:10.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you want the very best future possible
for your young ones.

00:44:10.668 --> 00:44:12.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we encourage you

00:44:12.670 --> 00:44:16.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set goals of full-time service
in front of your children

00:44:16.049 --> 00:44:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help them to achieve these goals.

00:44:18.968 --> 00:44:21.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
And will you miss them
if they should be called to Bethel

00:44:21.930 --> 00:44:25.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if they go off
on a Kingdom Hall assignment somewhere?

00:44:25.058 --> 00:44:26.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course you will.

00:44:26.684 --> 00:44:31.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t hold them back
and insist that they stay home with you

00:44:31.189 --> 00:44:33.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
for fear of missing them.

00:44:33.483 --> 00:44:37.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may be depriving them
of the most fulfilling life.

00:44:37.862 --> 00:44:40.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, rather, can you be like Hannah?

00:44:40.698 --> 00:44:43.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please, to 1 Samuel chapter 1

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:49.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
—1 Samuel 1:28.

00:44:49.958 --> 00:44:52.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah blessed Hannah with a son.

00:44:52.544 --> 00:44:55.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what did she say?
What did she do?

00:44:55.255 --> 00:44:57.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Samuel 1:28, she says:

00:44:57.507 --> 00:45:01.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I, in turn, now lend him to Jehovah.

00:45:01.761 --> 00:45:05.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
For all his days, he is lent to Jehovah.”

00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:09.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you “lend” your son or daughter
to Jehovah?

00:45:11.020 --> 00:45:13.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say “lend”?

00:45:13.022 --> 00:45:15.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because Jehovah
will give them back to you.

00:45:15.942 --> 00:45:18.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,
you will have an eternity

00:45:18.319 --> 00:45:22.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
to spend with your family together
in Paradise,

00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:25.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
but right now we have a work to do.

00:45:25.702 --> 00:45:28.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we thank you for training your young ones

00:45:28.246 --> 00:45:30.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the lead in full-time service.

00:45:33.001 --> 00:45:36.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a comment
to our elders and circuit overseers:

00:45:36.963 --> 00:45:39.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can you brothers do
to help the young ones

00:45:39.716 --> 00:45:42.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the path to serving Jehovah full-time

00:45:42.552 --> 00:45:45.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Bethel and in theocratic construction?

00:45:45.221 --> 00:45:47.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, are you encouraging Bethel service?

00:45:47.849 --> 00:45:52.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you helping the young ones to learn
how to get involved in local projects

00:45:52.061 --> 00:45:55.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their Local Design/Construction Department?

00:45:55.064 --> 00:45:58.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know,
school counselors are charting a path

00:45:58.151 --> 00:46:00.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our young ones in school.

00:46:00.194 --> 00:46:02.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shouldn’t we be doing the same?

00:46:03.406 --> 00:46:05.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate the impact
that you brothers can have

00:46:05.742 --> 00:46:07.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the lives of these young ones,

00:46:07.744 --> 00:46:11.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
a brother who works with us at Warwick
told us his experience.

00:46:11.456 --> 00:46:13.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said that when he was a teenager,

00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:16.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wanted to go to Bethel,
but he hesitated

00:46:16.586 --> 00:46:19.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he wasn’t sure if he could do it.

00:46:19.213 --> 00:46:21.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he didn’t know
if there really was a need.

00:46:21.382 --> 00:46:25.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
But his circuit overseer saw his potential
and gave him a Bethel application

00:46:25.553 --> 00:46:29.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and persisted in encouraging him
until he could see the need.

00:46:29.766 --> 00:46:31.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he turned in his application.

00:46:31.768 --> 00:46:33.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now he’s been serving for some years.

00:46:33.770 --> 00:46:37.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s married now, and he and his wife
are making a fantastic contribution.

00:46:37.774 --> 00:46:41.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
But are there ones like that
in your congregation or in your circuit

00:46:41.527 --> 00:46:42.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
who may be just on the fence

00:46:42.987 --> 00:46:45.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would benefit from some encouragement?

00:46:45.990 --> 00:46:50.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can truly make a difference
in how these young ones use their lives.

00:46:53.122 --> 00:46:55.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally,
a comment to the current generation

00:46:55.958 --> 00:46:58.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is carrying the load of oversight

00:46:58.419 --> 00:47:01.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Bethel and in theocratic construction:

00:47:01.714 --> 00:47:05.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank you for your years of service,

00:47:05.134 --> 00:47:09.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to contemplate what Jehovah
has been able to accomplish with your help

00:47:09.138 --> 00:47:11.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
is just fantastic.

00:47:11.516 --> 00:47:15.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we thank you
for training the next generation

00:47:15.269 --> 00:47:17.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the work can continue

00:47:17.438 --> 00:47:20.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah can continue
to get his work done.

00:47:20.149 --> 00:47:22.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know that you desire
to continue in the work.

00:47:22.819 --> 00:47:24.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have a zeal for the work.

00:47:24.362 --> 00:47:28.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to feel productive
and have accomplishment and feel valued,

00:47:28.533 --> 00:47:31.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, that’s very much connected to our joy.

00:47:31.285 --> 00:47:32.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understand that.

00:47:32.328 --> 00:47:35.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we get older,
we know that there is a need

00:47:35.915 --> 00:47:39.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
to train the next generation
so that Jehovah’s work can continue.

00:47:39.627 --> 00:47:42.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that you love Jehovah

00:47:42.296 --> 00:47:46.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than you do your personal privileges.

00:47:46.801 --> 00:47:49.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, truly, we still want you involved.

00:47:49.429 --> 00:47:53.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
The young ones need your experience
and your advice,

00:47:53.141 --> 00:47:55.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
and young ones are wise to recognize

00:47:55.351 --> 00:47:58.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much they can benefit
from your wisdom.

00:47:58.938 --> 00:48:02.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we thank you for being ready
to hand the job to these ones

00:48:02.942 --> 00:48:05.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then help them to succeed.

00:48:08.072 --> 00:48:10.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, to conclude,
we’d like to just mention one more prophecy

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:13.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are seeing fulfilled before our eyes.

00:48:13.703 --> 00:48:16.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this case, it’s in the book of Psalms,

00:48:16.873 --> 00:48:19.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we invite you to turn to the 110th Psalm.

00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 110:3 says this:

00:48:26.716 --> 00:48:29.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your people will offer themselves willingly

00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:32.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the day of your military force. . . .

00:48:32.221 --> 00:48:36.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have your company of young men
just like dewdrops.”

00:48:36.768 --> 00:48:40.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as we’ve discussed,
Jehovah is speeding up the work.

00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:44.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so, therefore,
there is a need for more workers.

00:48:44.066 --> 00:48:47.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is willing to train you
and entrust you,

00:48:47.236 --> 00:48:49.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah’s organization
is making arrangements

00:48:49.906 --> 00:48:53.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
for you to get involved as early as possible.

00:48:53.242 --> 00:48:57.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this verse reassures us
that you young ones will respond.

00:48:57.663 --> 00:48:59.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, you are responding.

00:48:59.665 --> 00:49:02.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
This verse is being fulfilled.

00:49:02.418 --> 00:49:06.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
May you personally share
in the fulfillment of this verse

00:49:06.672 --> 00:49:10.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
by taking advantage of opportunities
to glorify Jehovah

00:49:10.426 --> 00:49:13.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Bethel and in theocratic construction.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Bethel and theocratic construction
are only part of the work.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does there continue to be a need
for more workers in the field?

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:38.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, please give your attention
to Brother Mark Sanderson,

00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will speak on the theme

00:49:39.455 --> 00:49:42.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Opportunities to Glorify
Jehovah in the Field.”

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:48.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was 140 years ago,

00:49:48.172 --> 00:49:50.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 1884,

00:49:50.508 --> 00:49:53.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Zion’s Watch Tower Tract Society

00:49:53.761 --> 00:49:56.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
was legally incorporated.

00:49:56.848 --> 00:49:59.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I know
there are many gray beards here,

00:49:59.267 --> 00:50:03.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I understand that none of you
were present on that occasion.

00:50:05.356 --> 00:50:07.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s reassuring.

00:50:08.693 --> 00:50:12.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was just as Zechariah 4:10 says.

00:50:12.196 --> 00:50:16.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a “day of small beginnings,”

00:50:16.951 --> 00:50:19.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
really just a handful.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:23.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what has Jehovah
accomplished in the field

00:50:23.249 --> 00:50:26.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the last 140 years?

00:50:26.752 --> 00:50:30.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, we have nearly nine million

00:50:30.047 --> 00:50:32.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are preaching
the good news of God’s Kingdom

00:50:32.842 --> 00:50:35.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
in some 240 lands

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:40.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with publications
in more than 1,000 languages.

00:50:40.224 --> 00:50:43.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, aren’t we moved to glorify Jehovah

00:50:43.561 --> 00:50:45.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what he has accomplished?

00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:01.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how did we get to this point,

00:51:01.662 --> 00:51:06.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what has been a major factor
in the global expansion

00:51:06.459 --> 00:51:09.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s organization
has experienced?

00:51:09.587 --> 00:51:14.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what opportunities
are open in the field for our young ones?

00:51:14.592 --> 00:51:16.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please watch.

00:51:18.137 --> 00:51:20.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think of a missionary,

00:51:20.222 --> 00:51:22.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps you think of someone older

00:51:22.516 --> 00:51:24.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
who has been preaching for many years.

00:51:25.937 --> 00:51:29.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course,
many were very young when they started.

00:51:31.275 --> 00:51:35.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, in the mid-to-late 1940’s,
30 percent

00:51:35.613 --> 00:51:40.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the missionaries sent from Gilead
were under 24 years of age.

00:51:40.201 --> 00:51:43.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were young, energetic, full of life,

00:51:43.788 --> 00:51:46.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
willing to accept assignments
around the world,

00:51:46.666 --> 00:51:49.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they accomplished incredible things.

00:51:49.752 --> 00:51:52.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, in 1943,

00:51:52.630 --> 00:51:54.632 line:10% position:50% align:center
we were preaching in 54 lands,

00:51:54.632 --> 00:51:56.467 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the number of publishers

00:51:56.467 --> 00:51:58.552 line:10% position:50% align:center
was still relatively small.

00:51:58.552 --> 00:52:01.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah blessed their hard work and zeal.

00:52:01.764 --> 00:52:06.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
In just five years, the number of publishers
worldwide nearly doubled.

00:52:06.727 --> 00:52:09.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
By 1953, it had doubled again,

00:52:09.730 --> 00:52:12.149 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the reach of Jehovah’s organization

00:52:12.149 --> 00:52:15.194 line:10% position:50% align:center
expanded to 143 lands.

00:52:16.612 --> 00:52:20.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
That 10-year burst of activity
laid the foundation

00:52:20.116 --> 00:52:22.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Jehovah’s organization

00:52:22.284 --> 00:52:24.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
to grow into what it has become today,

00:52:24.704 --> 00:52:26.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 8 million people

00:52:26.956 --> 00:52:29.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
spread across 239 lands,

00:52:29.417 --> 00:52:31.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
reaching billions with the truth.

00:52:34.046 --> 00:52:35.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young missionaries

00:52:35.715 --> 00:52:37.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
have directly contributed to the fulfillment
of Jesus’ words 

00:52:37.842 --> 00:52:42.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
by preaching the good news of the Kingdom

00:52:42.054 --> 00:52:44.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a witness to all the nations.”

00:52:44.724 --> 00:52:46.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
But over 80 years have passed.

00:52:48.644 --> 00:52:50.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you’re thinking,

00:52:50.688 --> 00:52:53.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is there still a need
for missionaries today?’

00:52:58.821 --> 00:53:00.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do the facts show?

00:53:00.823 --> 00:53:03.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see tremendous growth

00:53:03.451 --> 00:53:07.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
and potential for more growth
around the world.

00:53:07.329 --> 00:53:10.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has happened
just during the past service year?

00:53:10.875 --> 00:53:14.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mozambique had an all-time peak
in Memorial attendance

00:53:14.879 --> 00:53:17.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
of well over 400,000.

00:53:17.923 --> 00:53:22.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s more than four times
the number of publishers in that land.

00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:24.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Angola averaged

00:53:24.764 --> 00:53:28.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
over 900 new missionaries a month

00:53:28.184 --> 00:53:30.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
—excuse me, new publishers a month.

00:53:30.186 --> 00:53:32.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a lot.
Wow!

00:53:33.981 --> 00:53:36.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Congo branch averaged

00:53:36.317 --> 00:53:40.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 1,300 new publishers a month.

00:53:40.362 --> 00:53:43.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the Philippines, on average,

00:53:43.157 --> 00:53:48.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 1,000 were baptized every month.

00:53:48.704 --> 00:53:53.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, brothers and sisters, in these places
that are experiencing rapid growth,

00:53:53.084 --> 00:53:57.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a huge need for more missionaries.

00:53:57.296 --> 00:53:59.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there are also needs in other lands.

00:53:59.715 --> 00:54:03.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many countries have been blessed
to have longtime missionaries

00:54:03.886 --> 00:54:05.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have done excellent work,

00:54:05.930 --> 00:54:10.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
but many of those faithful ones
have now passed on.

00:54:10.768 --> 00:54:12.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others have had to leave their assignments

00:54:12.770 --> 00:54:17.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of having to care for aging relatives
or because of their own health challenges.

00:54:17.775 --> 00:54:19.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s the question,

00:54:19.819 --> 00:54:23.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there still a need for missionaries today?

00:54:23.114 --> 00:54:26.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer is absolutely yes.

00:54:26.867 --> 00:54:29.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a tremendous work to be accomplished

00:54:29.995 --> 00:54:32.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the world in missionary service.

00:54:32.665 --> 00:54:36.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
And enthusiastic and zealous young people

00:54:36.377 --> 00:54:40.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
are still being sent out every year
to serve as missionaries.

00:54:40.631 --> 00:54:43.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, recently the Service Committee

00:54:43.342 --> 00:54:47.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
sent 36 new missionaries to Madagascar

00:54:47.721 --> 00:54:49.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 10 to Latvia.

00:54:49.974 --> 00:54:52.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, how do
these young missionaries feel

00:54:52.643 --> 00:54:54.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
about their privilege of service?

00:54:54.812 --> 00:54:56.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch.

00:54:59.942 --> 00:55:01.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our main preaching need

00:55:01.527 --> 00:55:03.028 line:10% position:50% align:center
at the moment in Madagascar

00:55:03.028 --> 00:55:04.905 line:10% position:50% align:center
is the training of new ones.

00:55:04.905 --> 00:55:06.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have new publishers

00:55:06.824 --> 00:55:08.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are not even baptized yet

00:55:08.826 --> 00:55:10.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
having progressive Bible studies.

00:55:10.995 --> 00:55:15.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we were very happy to receive
new young missionaries being assigned.

00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:16.917 line:10% position:50% align:center
When our Branch Committee learned

00:55:16.917 --> 00:55:18.335 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we were going to get some

00:55:18.335 --> 00:55:20.004 line:10% position:50% align:center
new missionaries in Latvia,

00:55:20.004 --> 00:55:21.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were really thrilled.

00:55:21.547 --> 00:55:24.341 line:10% position:50% align:center
We were three years as special pioneers,

00:55:24.341 --> 00:55:26.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and later we received this letter.

00:55:26.302 --> 00:55:28.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was thinking: ‘Latvia?

00:55:28.304 --> 00:55:29.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you know about Latvia?’

00:55:29.722 --> 00:55:31.849 line:10% position:50% align:center
My legs were trembling,

00:55:31.849 --> 00:55:34.977 line:10% position:50% align:center
but then I said, “Oh, it’s exciting!”

00:55:35.477 --> 00:55:37.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
For me, it’s still like a dream,

00:55:37.396 --> 00:55:39.481 line:10% position:50% align:center
and sometimes I ask Franzi,

00:55:39.481 --> 00:55:41.650 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Is it really real?”

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:44.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was expecting to go maybe
somewhere in Africa,

00:55:44.737 --> 00:55:46.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they said: “No, no.

00:55:46.405 --> 00:55:48.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will have beautiful snow.”

00:55:48.908 --> 00:55:51.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve really felt these
new missionaries invigorating the field.

00:55:51.952 --> 00:55:54.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their enthusiasm
is really pushing the work forward.

00:55:55.581 --> 00:55:57.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now many publishers
are more active in service,

00:55:57.666 --> 00:56:00.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the pioneer spirit is increasing.

00:56:00.002 --> 00:56:02.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw Jehovah’s blessing in our assignment,

00:56:02.171 --> 00:56:04.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially by the children
in our congregation.

00:56:04.798 --> 00:56:06.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they hug you,
you feel like home

00:56:06.884 --> 00:56:08.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the language doesn’t matter anymore.

00:56:08.969 --> 00:56:11.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love my missionary assignment

00:56:11.138 --> 00:56:15.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it has opened my eyes
to something beautiful.

00:56:15.559 --> 00:56:18.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ministry is simply amazing.

00:56:18.729 --> 00:56:21.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being a missionary—
It’s something special.

00:56:21.357 --> 00:56:24.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
But on the other hand,
it’s quite a normal Christian life

00:56:24.568 --> 00:56:28.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
focused on preaching
and enjoying everyday life.

00:56:28.364 --> 00:56:32.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s OK to be afraid and to have doubts,

00:56:32.076 --> 00:56:34.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
but give Jehovah a chance.

00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:38.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being a missionary
is the biggest experience in my life.

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:41.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
My assignment strengthened my spirituality,

00:56:41.001 --> 00:56:44.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
because now I know
I’m not afraid of more difficult tasks.

00:56:44.088 --> 00:56:45.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:56:58.477 --> 00:57:01.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we need many more young people

00:57:01.855 --> 00:57:03.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take up missionary service.

00:57:03.941 --> 00:57:07.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that raises the question,
How do you become a missionary?

00:57:07.987 --> 00:57:10.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the first step
is to enter full-time service.

00:57:10.906 --> 00:57:14.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then after you’ve been
in full-time service for two years,

00:57:14.451 --> 00:57:16.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do you need to do?

00:57:16.453 --> 00:57:21.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
You need to apply
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:57:21.250 --> 00:57:25.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
SKE is the door to missionary service.

00:57:25.879 --> 00:57:30.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
You also need to have the spirit of Isaiah
when he said: “Here I am! Send me!”

00:57:30.759 --> 00:57:34.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be willing to go
wherever the organization might assign you.

00:57:34.638 --> 00:57:37.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
After you graduate SKE,

00:57:37.016 --> 00:57:40.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could receive an assignment
to serve as a temporary special pioneer

00:57:40.978 --> 00:57:42.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your home country

00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can gain experience.

00:57:44.982 --> 00:57:47.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you do well in that assignment,

00:57:47.484 --> 00:57:52.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could receive an assignment
to serve as a missionary in another country.

00:57:52.489 --> 00:57:56.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Missionary service is a thrilling opportunity

00:57:56.327 --> 00:57:59.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring the good news
to honesthearted people

00:57:59.580 --> 00:58:01.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
in another part of the world.

00:58:01.749 --> 00:58:03.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need young people

00:58:03.792 --> 00:58:08.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
who want to “go, . . . and make disciples
of people of all the nations.”

00:58:08.339 --> 00:58:12.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how old do you need to be

00:58:12.509 --> 00:58:17.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply for the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers?

00:58:19.808 --> 00:58:22.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re very pleased to announce today

00:58:22.603 --> 00:58:25.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Governing Body has decided

00:58:25.147 --> 00:58:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
that young brothers and sisters

00:58:27.483 --> 00:58:31.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
21 years of age or older

00:58:31.070 --> 00:58:34.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
may now apply to attend SKE.

00:58:34.239 --> 00:58:36.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that exciting and wonderful?

00:58:50.964 --> 00:58:53.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
But many of you young ones right now

00:58:53.384 --> 00:58:55.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
are serving where the need is greater,

00:58:55.427 --> 00:58:57.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even in another country.

00:58:57.763 --> 00:58:59.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s wonderful.

00:58:59.765 --> 00:59:02.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we encourage you now

00:59:02.684 --> 00:59:06.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply for the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:08.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, this will allow the organization

00:59:08.982 --> 00:59:13.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see where you could best be used
in the worldwide field.

00:59:13.987 --> 00:59:16.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young brothers and sisters,

00:59:16.073 --> 00:59:20.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
please seize this wonderful opportunity.

00:59:21.161 --> 00:59:24.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about those of us
who are a bit older?

00:59:24.748 --> 00:59:29.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do to help these young people?

00:59:30.129 --> 00:59:33.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s be generous in training them

00:59:33.048 --> 00:59:36.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in sharing with them our experience.

00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:39.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s help them to grow and encourage them

00:59:39.179 --> 00:59:42.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach out
for these wonderful opportunities

00:59:42.224 --> 00:59:44.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
to glorify Jehovah.

00:59:44.977 --> 00:59:47.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was just 19 years old,

00:59:47.938 --> 00:59:52.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
a brother invited me to attend
my very first annual meeting.

00:59:52.943 --> 00:59:55.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a special one,

00:59:55.154 --> 00:59:59.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
the 100th anniversary
of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society,

00:59:59.825 --> 01:00:02.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

01:00:03.078 --> 01:00:07.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so excited
I thought I’d died and went to heaven.

01:00:17.926 --> 01:00:20.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t believe that

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
that brother would invite me to attend
when I was so young,

01:00:24.141 --> 01:00:27.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the encouragement from that experience

01:00:27.227 --> 01:00:31.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
has stayed with me
right up until this very moment.

01:00:32.065 --> 01:00:35.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, what will you do?

01:00:35.402 --> 01:00:40.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will you do to encourage
a young person to glorify Jehovah?

01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:46.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, Jehovah will bless you
if you look for ways to do so.

01:00:47.539 --> 01:00:51.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the preaching work
is more urgent than ever before.

01:00:51.293 --> 01:00:54.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will you read with me
Romans chapter 10, please?

01:00:55.339 --> 01:00:59.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 10:13

01:00:59.968 --> 01:01:01.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it says:

01:01:01.386 --> 01:01:05.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For ‘everyone who calls
on the name of Jehovah will be saved.’

01:01:05.724 --> 01:01:10.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, how will they call on him
if they have not put faith in him?

01:01:10.604 --> 01:01:14.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How, in turn, will they put faith in him
about whom they have not heard?

01:01:14.942 --> 01:01:19.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How, in turn, will they hear
without someone to preach?

01:01:19.613 --> 01:01:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How, in turn, will they preach
unless they have been sent out?

01:01:24.326 --> 01:01:26.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as it is written:

01:01:26.328 --> 01:01:29.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘How beautiful are the feet of those

01:01:29.831 --> 01:01:33.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
who declare good news of good things!’”

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:36.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need young ones, as verse 15 says,

01:01:36.838 --> 01:01:39.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be “sent out” to preach the good news.

01:01:39.466 --> 01:01:43.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need young ones to serve as pioneers
and special pioneers and missionaries.

01:01:43.845 --> 01:01:46.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need them to apply

01:01:46.473 --> 01:01:49.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:01:49.351 --> 01:01:52.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah has accomplished an amazing work

01:01:52.396 --> 01:01:55.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
over these past 140 years.

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:59.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s blessed “the day of small beginnings.”

01:01:59.111 --> 01:02:04.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
But brothers and sisters,
the work is not over yet.

01:02:04.116 --> 01:02:06.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you agree?

01:02:17.045 --> 01:02:21.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are exciting opportunities
for our beautiful young people.

01:02:21.717 --> 01:02:24.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
So young ones, what will you do?

01:02:24.386 --> 01:02:29.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can now apply for Bethel
and construction service at age 18.

01:02:29.391 --> 01:02:34.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can apply for the School
for Kingdom Evangelizers at age 21.

01:02:34.229 --> 01:02:36.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
Put yourself in Jehovah’s hands.

01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make yourself available.

01:02:38.942 --> 01:02:41.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will never regret it.

01:02:41.194 --> 01:02:45.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may we as older ones
do everything in our power

01:02:45.407 --> 01:02:48.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage and train these young people.

01:02:48.577 --> 01:02:50.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, as Brother Lösch said,

01:02:50.579 --> 01:02:53.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s ‘keep polishing those mirrors.’

01:02:53.999 --> 01:02:57.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep looking for ways
to expand our ministry

01:02:57.377 --> 01:03:02.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to glorify our wonderful
and our amazing God, Jehovah.

01:03:12.059 --> 01:03:14.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a thrilling symposium!

01:03:14.019 --> 01:03:17.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re delighted to have
two new members of the Governing Body.

01:03:17.272 --> 01:03:21.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re delighted by the adjustments
to the age requirements for Bethel Service

01:03:21.526 --> 01:03:24.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:03:24.655 --> 01:03:26.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did those changes come

01:03:26.782 --> 01:03:29.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a bit of a surprise to you?

01:03:29.951 --> 01:03:34.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s sort of related
to the next talk on our program.

01:03:34.748 --> 01:03:37.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Geoffrey Jackson
will discuss the theme

01:03:37.376 --> 01:03:40.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t Be Surprised by Sudden Changes.”

01:03:40.587 --> 01:03:43.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Geoff, you have our attention.

01:03:46.718 --> 01:03:49.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m sure we all agree with this fact:

01:03:49.721 --> 01:03:53.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent years,
there have been a lot of changes.

01:03:54.518 --> 01:03:57.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even since the last annual meeting,

01:03:57.062 --> 01:04:00.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
there have been many changes.

01:04:00.315 --> 01:04:03.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them perhaps
are a little surprising

01:04:03.235 --> 01:04:05.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
or may seem to be sudden.

01:04:05.654 --> 01:04:07.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, you know, brothers and sisters,

01:04:07.823 --> 01:04:12.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we look back on
how these changes have come,

01:04:12.077 --> 01:04:15.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see that Jehovah
has gradually prepared us

01:04:15.163 --> 01:04:18.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each of these adjustments and changes.

01:04:18.333 --> 01:04:21.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s review
some of the recent changes we’ve had.

01:04:24.589 --> 01:04:26.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
What changes have we seen

01:04:26.591 --> 01:04:29.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to our understanding
of Bible teachings?

01:04:29.928 --> 01:04:32.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the 2021 annual meeting,

01:04:32.764 --> 01:04:37.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
we received an adjusted understanding
of John 5:29.

01:04:37.144 --> 01:04:40.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was explained
that the “resurrection of judgment”

01:04:40.397 --> 01:04:43.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be a judgment of condemnation.

01:04:43.692 --> 01:04:47.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, it will be more like
a period of probation.

01:04:48.572 --> 01:04:52.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “unrighteous” mentioned at Acts 24:15

01:04:52.159 --> 01:04:55.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have an opportunity
to gain everlasting life.

01:04:55.912 --> 01:04:59.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
But their names will not be written
in “the book of life”

01:04:59.082 --> 01:05:01.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the time of their resurrection.

01:05:02.169 --> 01:05:05.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
To have their names
eventually written in that book,

01:05:05.255 --> 01:05:08.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
these ones will need to respond positively

01:05:08.383 --> 01:05:10.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the great educational work

01:05:10.927 --> 01:05:13.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will take place
during the Thousand Year Reign.

01:05:14.347 --> 01:05:17.601 line:10% position:50% align:center
Then, at the annual meeting in 2023,

01:05:17.601 --> 01:05:20.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
we gained enhanced insight

01:05:20.103 --> 01:05:23.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
into what we do know and what we don’t know

01:05:23.565 --> 01:05:25.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
concerning Jehovah’s judgments.

01:05:26.485 --> 01:05:28.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned that the door of opportunity

01:05:28.612 --> 01:05:31.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
for people to take a stand for the Kingdom

01:05:31.281 --> 01:05:34.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not shut
when the great tribulation starts

01:05:34.075 --> 01:05:36.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the destruction of false religion.

01:05:36.411 --> 01:05:41.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that time, perhaps some
will be like the Egyptians in Moses’ day

01:05:41.082 --> 01:05:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
who took a last-minute stand

01:05:43.126 --> 01:05:45.879 line:10% position:50% align:center
and joined the Exodus of God’s people.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.924 line:10% position:50% align:center
At the same annual meeting,

01:05:48.924 --> 01:05:52.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
we adjusted our views
with regard to Jehovah’s judgments

01:05:52.344 --> 01:05:54.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who died in the Flood

01:05:54.095 --> 01:05:55.639 line:10% position:50% align:center
and those who were destroyed

01:05:55.639 --> 01:05:57.516 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Sodom and Gomorrah.

01:05:57.516 --> 01:05:59.518 line:10% position:50% align:center
Also at that annual meeting,

01:05:59.518 --> 01:06:02.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
an adjustment was made
regarding the reporting of our time

01:06:02.896 --> 01:06:04.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
and activity in our preaching work.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of focusing on reports,

01:06:07.317 --> 01:06:11.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
we try to make good use
of every opportunity to witness.

01:06:12.489 --> 01:06:14.282 line:10% position:50% align:center
Then we received

01:06:14.282 --> 01:06:17.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>2024 Governing Body Update #2.</i>

01:06:18.662 --> 01:06:22.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that update, we saw the need to adjust
how we interact with those

01:06:22.707 --> 01:06:26.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have committed serious sins
and have been removed from the congregation.

01:06:28.088 --> 01:06:30.090 line:10% position:50% align:center
What other major adjustments

01:06:30.090 --> 01:06:31.758 line:10% position:50% align:center
have we recently seen?

01:06:31.758 --> 01:06:33.218 line:10% position:50% align:center
In our preaching work,

01:06:33.218 --> 01:06:37.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
the emphasis now is
on starting Bible studies

01:06:37.055 --> 01:06:38.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and making disciples,

01:06:38.849 --> 01:06:41.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on distributing literature.

01:06:41.518 --> 01:06:46.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
To that end, the focus is
on starting meaningful conversations,

01:06:46.439 --> 01:06:49.484 line:10% position:50% align:center
not just on using memorized presentations.

01:06:50.485 --> 01:06:53.446 line:10% position:50% align:center
Were you surprised by these adjustments?

01:06:53.446 --> 01:06:55.323 line:10% position:50% align:center
Perhaps so.

01:06:55.323 --> 01:06:57.242 line:10% position:50% align:center
But as we look back,

01:06:57.242 --> 01:07:00.412 line:10% position:50% align:center
we see how one adjustment in understanding

01:07:00.412 --> 01:07:03.665 line:10% position:50% align:center
gradually helped us with the next adjustment.

01:07:05.792 --> 01:07:09.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it true that gradually
Jehovah has prepared us?

01:07:09.963 --> 01:07:14.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we look back on it, we see
how logical this training has been

01:07:14.384 --> 01:07:16.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to refine our understanding.

01:07:17.721 --> 01:07:22.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
But events in the world
likewise have changed.

01:07:22.267 --> 01:07:26.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true that sometimes in the world,
you have sudden changes

01:07:26.104 --> 01:07:28.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, the pandemic.

01:07:28.690 --> 01:07:33.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
But oftentimes,
change in the world is gradual.

01:07:34.070 --> 01:07:38.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it true
with regard to the view of morality,

01:07:38.658 --> 01:07:41.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
homosexuality, abortion,

01:07:41.703 --> 01:07:46.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
even what’s acceptable and not acceptable
with regard to conduct?

01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:50.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of that has happened
gradually in the world.

01:07:50.587 --> 01:07:53.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s not until you look back and see 

01:07:53.298 --> 01:07:57.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
how different the world is today
with regard to those matters

01:07:57.844 --> 01:08:00.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we see
that there have been a lot of changes.

01:08:01.848 --> 01:08:04.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this can be dangerous

01:08:04.059 --> 01:08:08.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
because as things gradually change,

01:08:08.355 --> 01:08:11.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might get used to gradual change

01:08:11.816 --> 01:08:16.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
and forget that there are
some sudden changes

01:08:16.237 --> 01:08:18.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
about to occur.

01:08:18.573 --> 01:08:20.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take our Bibles, please,

01:08:20.825 --> 01:08:25.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and if you turn with me
to the book of Luke chapter 21,

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:30.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is an example of sudden change.

01:08:30.460 --> 01:08:35.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Luke chapter 21, notice there in verse 34,

01:08:35.131 --> 01:08:37.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
the words of our Lord Jesus are recorded.

01:08:37.300 --> 01:08:40.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he said in verse 34:

01:08:40.512 --> 01:08:43.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But pay attention to yourselves

01:08:43.139 --> 01:08:45.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that your hearts never become weighed down

01:08:45.642 --> 01:08:50.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with overeating and heavy drinking
and anxieties of life,

01:08:50.355 --> 01:08:53.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and suddenly

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[suddenly]

01:08:55.944 --> 01:09:00.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that day be instantly

01:09:00.198 --> 01:09:02.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
[instantly] upon you.”

01:09:04.077 --> 01:09:07.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting to note
that Jesus had already said

01:09:07.622 --> 01:09:09.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this day he was referring to

01:09:09.666 --> 01:09:12.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
would occur at a time
that we don’t think is likely.

01:09:13.503 --> 01:09:18.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what lesson do we learn
from what Jesus said?

01:09:18.591 --> 01:09:20.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a warning
—isn’t it?—

01:09:20.635 --> 01:09:24.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can’t just sit back and think:
‘Well, things are gradually going to develop.

01:09:24.806 --> 01:09:26.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘We know which way it’s going.

01:09:26.808 --> 01:09:29.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And maybe it’s not
going to happen yet, you know.

01:09:29.644 --> 01:09:33.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve got a little bit more wiggle room there
with regard to the schedule.’

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:37.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you see, that’s dangerous thinking.

01:09:37.819 --> 01:09:42.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what we’re going to do
is consider two examples of areas

01:09:42.032 --> 01:09:46.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
where perhaps we could be
a little guilty with regard to that

01:09:47.412 --> 01:09:50.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, our view

01:09:50.373 --> 01:09:54.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to the number of anointed ones
remaining on the earth.

01:09:55.336 --> 01:09:58.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for many years, what did we think?

01:09:58.048 --> 01:10:03.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought, ‘Well, that number
will go down and down and down and down.’

01:10:03.678 --> 01:10:05.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I don’t know about you, but me I—

01:10:05.472 --> 01:10:07.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, when that report came out

01:10:07.348 --> 01:10:11.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just how many, how many, partakers?

01:10:11.186 --> 01:10:13.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what were we thinking?

01:10:13.730 --> 01:10:17.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, probably, you know,
maybe we didn’t say it, but we were thinking:

01:10:17.650 --> 01:10:21.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You know, the number will go
down, down, down, down.

01:10:21.029 --> 01:10:23.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And there’ll be just
a couple of old guys in wheelchairs

01:10:25.992 --> 01:10:28.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will get their reward.’

01:10:29.746 --> 01:10:34.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m exaggerating,
but that was sort of the feeling, wasn’t it?

01:10:34.584 --> 01:10:37.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now what have we seen in recent years?

01:10:38.671 --> 01:10:42.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those numbers have gone up and up.

01:10:43.676 --> 01:10:48.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
And not only that, younger brothers
have been appointed on the Governing Body.

01:10:48.598 --> 01:10:50.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I know what you all are thinking,

01:10:50.809 --> 01:10:53.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Two new ones—how old are they?’

01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:59.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know you’re not googling now,
but you will be.

01:11:01.194 --> 01:11:05.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you see, we need to be careful
about what we’re thinking

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:08.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
with regard to the number
of anointed ones left on earth.

01:11:08.993 --> 01:11:12.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, 19 years ago,
I was appointed on the Governing Body.

01:11:12.914 --> 01:11:14.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even I thought I was too young.

01:11:16.793 --> 01:11:19.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now they tell me I’m not so young anymore.

01:11:21.089 --> 01:11:22.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
But do we see the point?

01:11:22.799 --> 01:11:27.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does the Bible actually tell us
with regard to this?

01:11:27.762 --> 01:11:31.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it doesn’t say the number
would just dwindle down

01:11:31.224 --> 01:11:34.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just having a few older ones left.

01:11:34.269 --> 01:11:37.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, the great crowd of other sheep

01:11:37.647 --> 01:11:42.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be judged on the basis
of how they deal with Christ’s brothers.

01:11:42.527 --> 01:11:45.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that means
“the faithful and discreet slave”

01:11:45.697 --> 01:11:49.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as all the anointed
throughout the earth

01:11:49.033 --> 01:11:53.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue to be active in doing the work

01:11:53.037 --> 01:11:55.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wanting and needing your support

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:58.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
right up until the time

01:11:58.126 --> 01:12:01.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
that suddenly they will be reassigned.

01:12:02.964 --> 01:12:07.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t that what Matthew 24:31 says?

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:09.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be a gathering,
the final gathering,

01:12:09.971 --> 01:12:13.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the anointed
from all different parts of the earth.

01:12:13.057 --> 01:12:14.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for us to think:

01:12:14.934 --> 01:12:18.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, you know, there are some new ones
on the Governing Body.

01:12:18.188 --> 01:12:20.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘They don’t look too old.

01:12:20.064 --> 01:12:23.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we’ve got a little bit of extra time.’

01:12:23.401 --> 01:12:24.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

01:12:24.611 --> 01:12:29.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is making sure
that “the faithful and discreet slave”

01:12:29.073 --> 01:12:31.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
is continuing to work and is effective

01:12:31.951 --> 01:12:34.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
right up until that time of reassignment.

01:12:35.663 --> 01:12:37.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
So that’s one subject.

01:12:37.707 --> 01:12:40.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second subject we’d like to talk about

01:12:40.418 --> 01:12:44.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
is our view with regard
to the start of the great tribulation

01:12:44.756 --> 01:12:47.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the destruction of Babylon the Great.

01:12:48.468 --> 01:12:52.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we look through the Scriptures
in Revelation chapter 16,

01:12:52.597 --> 01:12:54.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does it tell us?

01:12:54.182 --> 01:12:56.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
That the waters would gradually dry up.

01:12:58.311 --> 01:13:03.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, churches are losing support
in some countries, for example, Europe.

01:13:03.942 --> 01:13:08.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t that long ago that most nations
in Europe were very religious.

01:13:09.447 --> 01:13:12.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now people
are turning their backs on religion.

01:13:14.452 --> 01:13:16.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, at the same time,

01:13:16.496 --> 01:13:20.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we look at Africa and South America,

01:13:20.541 --> 01:13:24.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
we see that religion
still has a strong influence.

01:13:24.963 --> 01:13:28.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now what could that little voice
in our mind be saying?

01:13:28.424 --> 01:13:30.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Well, yeah, we see it.

01:13:30.093 --> 01:13:35.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘It’s going in the right direction
but maybe not just yet.

01:13:35.098 --> 01:13:37.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve got a little bit more time left.’

01:13:38.518 --> 01:13:42.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, again, we need to remember
what the Scriptures tell us.

01:13:42.647 --> 01:13:45.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you turn with me this time, please,

01:13:45.608 --> 01:13:48.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Revelation chapter 17,

01:13:48.528 --> 01:13:50.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is one of the chapters

01:13:50.530 --> 01:13:54.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
that describes
the destruction of false religion,

01:13:54.617 --> 01:13:58.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in other words,
when the great tribulation starts.

01:13:58.079 --> 01:14:02.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s read Revelation 17:17

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:05.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
and note, please, what it tells us:

01:14:05.128 --> 01:14:10.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For God put it into their hearts
to carry out his thought,

01:14:10.133 --> 01:14:15.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“yes, to carry out their one thought
by giving their kingdom to the wild beast,

01:14:15.138 --> 01:14:18.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the words of God
will have been accomplished.”

01:14:19.392 --> 01:14:22.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is this “one thought”?

01:14:23.438 --> 01:14:27.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, up to now, we’ve said the “one thought”

01:14:27.025 --> 01:14:30.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
is their desire to turn on false religion.

01:14:30.778 --> 01:14:32.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can understand that

01:14:32.947 --> 01:14:37.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the context is talking
about the destruction of false religion.

01:14:38.703 --> 01:14:41.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you see, if you look back at that verse,

01:14:41.622 --> 01:14:43.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is the “one thought”?

01:14:44.625 --> 01:14:49.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now this means we have to adjust
our understanding—another change.

01:14:50.256 --> 01:14:52.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it say?

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:56.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “one thought” refers to the nations

01:14:56.262 --> 01:15:00.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
being willing to hand over power,
their political power,

01:15:00.641 --> 01:15:05.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the scarlet-colored
wild beast, the United Nations.

01:15:05.188 --> 01:15:09.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me repeat it because you’re in shock now
and you need to write this down.

01:15:09.650 --> 01:15:11.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

01:15:11.152 --> 01:15:15.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “one thought” refers to the nations

01:15:15.156 --> 01:15:19.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
being willing to hand over power
to the United Nations.

01:15:20.661 --> 01:15:22.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why is that exciting?

01:15:22.997 --> 01:15:27.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the fact that nations
will eventually turn on religion

01:15:27.377 --> 01:15:29.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
really isn’t that surprising, is it?

01:15:29.420 --> 01:15:31.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gradually, we’ve seen that happening,
and we say:

01:15:31.839 --> 01:15:34.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh, yes.
Yeah, we see which way it’s going.’

01:15:35.093 --> 01:15:40.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about nations
empowering the United Nations

01:15:40.014 --> 01:15:43.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
—handing over their personal political power—

01:15:43.393 --> 01:15:47.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
so the United Nations has more power,
or it has teeth, as it were?

01:15:47.814 --> 01:15:52.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the moment,
it’s like a toothless organization, isn’t it?

01:15:53.528 --> 01:15:55.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
That seems unbelievable.

01:15:55.571 --> 01:15:58.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
No nation does that.

01:15:58.449 --> 01:16:00.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is it that happens?

01:16:00.701 --> 01:16:03.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is an act of God.

01:16:03.996 --> 01:16:07.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah puts that “one thought”

01:16:07.125 --> 01:16:10.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the minds of the nations.

01:16:11.170 --> 01:16:15.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they will empower the United Nations

01:16:15.299 --> 01:16:18.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the United Nations
will be in a position

01:16:18.553 --> 01:16:22.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take action against false religion.

01:16:22.723 --> 01:16:25.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this adjustment in understanding

01:16:25.351 --> 01:16:27.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
also means that we have to adjust

01:16:27.645 --> 01:16:30.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
our understanding of verses 12 and 13.

01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:32.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you’re in Revelation 17,

01:16:32.608 --> 01:16:35.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
please, let’s look at verses 12 and 13:

01:16:36.737 --> 01:16:41.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The ten horns that you saw mean ten kings

01:16:41.033 --> 01:16:45.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who have not yet received a kingdom,

01:16:45.413 --> 01:16:49.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but they do receive authority as kings

01:16:49.500 --> 01:16:52.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for one hour with the wild beast.

01:16:52.962 --> 01:16:54.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
“These have one thought,

01:16:54.964 --> 01:16:59.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
so they give their power
and authority to the wild beast.”

01:17:00.595 --> 01:17:05.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
So up to now,
we’ve assumed these “ten kings,”

01:17:05.349 --> 01:17:10.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
which represent all the political powers
and governments in the world at the moment,

01:17:10.354 --> 01:17:14.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
did this during the last days by supporting,

01:17:14.734 --> 01:17:18.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
first of all, the League of Nations
and then the United Nations.

01:17:19.322 --> 01:17:22.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now what do we understand this to be,

01:17:22.116 --> 01:17:24.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing we understand verse 17?

01:17:24.994 --> 01:17:29.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there will come a time
when all political powers on earth,

01:17:29.916 --> 01:17:33.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
which includes many
who have never been part

01:17:33.461 --> 01:17:37.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the seven world powers,

01:17:37.381 --> 01:17:42.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
will see that they need
to collectively pool their power

01:17:42.386 --> 01:17:45.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving it to the United Nations

01:17:45.389 --> 01:17:48.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
to try to solve
some of the problems in the world.

01:17:48.768 --> 01:17:51.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they will rule, notice, what does it say?

01:17:51.354 --> 01:17:54.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For one hour”—just a short period of time.

01:17:55.358 --> 01:17:59.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this newly empowered United Nations,

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:04.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
from that time on,
will rule collectively for a short time,

01:18:04.158 --> 01:18:08.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it will enable them
to destroy false religion

01:18:08.746 --> 01:18:11.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fight against Jesus and Jehovah’s people.

01:18:11.666 --> 01:18:13.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, isn’t that exciting?

01:18:24.428 --> 01:18:29.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we’re back to our subject again,
you see, gradually things happen.

01:18:29.433 --> 01:18:32.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we might say, ‘Well, yes, gradually,
I see Babylon the Great

01:18:32.728 --> 01:18:37.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
is losing influence in some places
—maybe not yet—’

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
But don’t expect that you’ll see governments

01:18:41.112 --> 01:18:43.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
gradually wanting to give over power.

01:18:43.447 --> 01:18:45.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t want to do that.

01:18:45.449 --> 01:18:48.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes an act of God!

01:18:48.286 --> 01:18:51.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will “put it into their hearts.”

01:18:51.455 --> 01:18:54.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will occur with suddenness.

01:18:54.166 --> 01:18:58.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, then the great tribulation will start

01:18:58.629 --> 01:19:03.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a sudden change,
not something that happens gradually.

01:19:03.009 --> 01:19:05.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned in our discussion?

01:19:05.428 --> 01:19:09.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, yes, some things change gradually.

01:19:09.181 --> 01:19:13.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, brothers and sisters,
remember there are some sudden things

01:19:13.436 --> 01:19:15.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are about to occur.

01:19:15.688 --> 01:19:19.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s remember the two things as a reminder.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:22.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, the remaining anointed ones

01:19:22.570 --> 01:19:27.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
will suddenly be taken to heaven
while they are still very active.

01:19:28.618 --> 01:19:30.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second one,

01:19:30.286 --> 01:19:33.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will suddenly move the nations

01:19:33.122 --> 01:19:35.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give their political power

01:19:35.249 --> 01:19:37.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the United Nations.

01:19:37.668 --> 01:19:39.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the takeaway?

01:19:40.171 --> 01:19:42.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t be complacent.

01:19:42.381 --> 01:19:46.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t think,
‘Oh, this is going to gradually change.’

01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:50.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, some things won’t gradually change.

01:19:50.556 --> 01:19:54.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will occur suddenly as acts of God!

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:59.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be ready, and don’t be surprised
by sudden change!

01:20:14.121 --> 01:20:15.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Geoff.

01:20:15.247 --> 01:20:17.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve given us much to think about.

01:20:17.083 --> 01:20:20.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll probably have to watch that talk
a few times to get all the points.

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:23.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a faith-strengthening program!

01:20:23.964 --> 01:20:26.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second part of the annual meeting

01:20:26.050 --> 01:20:29.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be featured
as the broadcast for next month.

01:20:30.680 --> 01:20:34.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now it’s time for our video postcard.

01:20:34.475 --> 01:20:38.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s visit
our brothers and sisters in Italy.

01:20:40.314 --> 01:20:44.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a land of rich history,
vibrant culture,

01:20:44.735 --> 01:20:47.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spectacular natural beauty

01:20:47.113 --> 01:20:49.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
—from Lake Como and the Dolomites

01:20:49.699 --> 01:20:52.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the north to the islands of Sicily 

01:20:52.660 --> 01:20:54.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sardinia in the south.

01:20:54.995 --> 01:20:57.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christianity found an early foothold

01:20:57.957 --> 01:21:00.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Italy and spread rapidly.

01:21:00.710 --> 01:21:04.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s journeys took him to Syracuse;

01:21:04.255 --> 01:21:07.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rhegium, known as Reggio today;

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:12.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rome; and Puteoli, near Naples.

01:21:12.012 --> 01:21:14.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
The preaching work began

01:21:14.056 --> 01:21:17.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
in modern-day Italy in 1891

01:21:17.476 --> 01:21:22.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Brother C. T. Russell
visited the small town of Pinerolo.

01:21:22.523 --> 01:21:25.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses

01:21:25.317 --> 01:21:28.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
was formed here in 1908.

01:21:28.821 --> 01:21:33.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meetings were first held
at the homes of two sisters.

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:35.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as in the first century,

01:21:35.619 --> 01:21:38.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers in the 20th century

01:21:38.289 --> 01:21:41.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
faced stiff opposition.

01:21:41.167 --> 01:21:43.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Fascist government and the clergy

01:21:43.753 --> 01:21:48.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
suppressed the work of Jehovah’s Witnesses
for decades,

01:21:48.174 --> 01:21:50.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our brothers persevered.

01:21:50.885 --> 01:21:53.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in 1925,

01:21:53.262 --> 01:21:56.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers disguised their first assembly

01:21:56.515 --> 01:21:59.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a wedding in this hotel.

01:21:59.185 --> 01:22:02.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Remigio Cuminetti

01:22:02.271 --> 01:22:04.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sister Albina Protti

01:22:04.899 --> 01:22:08.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
were actually married during the assembly.

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:10.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, the Italy branch supports

01:22:10.780 --> 01:22:14.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 250,000 publishers

01:22:14.116 --> 01:22:18.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Italy and the tiny Republic of San Marino,

01:22:18.454 --> 01:22:21.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is bordered by Italy on all sides.

01:22:21.916 --> 01:22:24.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers preach in ancient villages

01:22:24.710 --> 01:22:27.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
like Alberobello,

01:22:27.046 --> 01:22:30.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
known for limestone dwellings called <i>trulli.</i>

01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they publicly witness in iconic cities,

01:22:34.011 --> 01:22:36.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Florence and Venice.

01:22:37.473 --> 01:22:41.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
To assist congregations
in Rome and Milan in the ministry,

01:22:41.227 --> 01:22:44.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
a special initiative in 2023

01:22:44.355 --> 01:22:46.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
encouraged neighboring congregations

01:22:46.565 --> 01:22:49.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach in those cities on the weekends.

01:22:49.485 --> 01:22:53.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost 13,000 publishers participated

01:22:53.405 --> 01:22:57.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 63 new Bible studies were started!

01:22:57.326 --> 01:23:00.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many refugees have come to Italy

01:23:00.287 --> 01:23:03.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Africa, Asia,

01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:05.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Eastern Europe.

01:23:05.167 --> 01:23:08.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help our brothers learn to preach
in a foreign language,

01:23:08.671 --> 01:23:12.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Italy branch organized 420 courses

01:23:12.591 --> 01:23:14.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 35 languages,

01:23:15.678 --> 01:23:19.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Amharic, Sinhalese,

01:23:19.056 --> 01:23:21.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twi, and Ukrainian.

01:23:21.934 --> 01:23:26.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, our postcard from Italy
would not be complete

01:23:26.063 --> 01:23:29.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
without talking about food,

01:23:29.275 --> 01:23:31.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
a delightful and important element

01:23:31.819 --> 01:23:34.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Italian culture and tradition.

01:23:34.321 --> 01:23:39.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with its many wines,
Italy is known for its regional cuisines,

01:23:39.451 --> 01:23:41.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
including pizzas,

01:23:41.662 --> 01:23:43.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
pastas, and cheeses,

01:23:43.622 --> 01:23:45.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Parmesan

01:23:45.875 --> 01:23:48.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
and handmade mozzarella.
