Welcome to this month’s broadcast.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are a few highlights

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what we’ll enjoy on the program.

00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:11.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if changing circumstances in the family

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:14.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
begin pushing mates apart emotionally?

00:00:14.764 --> 00:00:17.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This dramatization of Shaan and Kiara

00:00:17.801 --> 00:00:21.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may provide some timely guidance.

00:00:21.204 --> 00:00:23.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, the story of Grace Li

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be an encouragement to any who have faced

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
severe emotional challenges
for taking a stand for the truth.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll see the effect
that her actions had on those around her.

00:00:34.884 --> 00:00:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this month’s music video

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:39.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will reassure us of the love, kindness,

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:44.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and support we enjoy as Jehovah’s people.

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:49.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All that and more on this February 2019 edition

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:51.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting!

00:01:10.253 --> 00:01:11.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme of this program

00:01:11.588 --> 00:01:13.556 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is taken from the second part

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:15.592 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of Romans 12:10:

00:01:15.592 --> 00:01:17.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor to one another,

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:19.829 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
take the lead.”

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is honor?

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:25.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Hebrew Scriptures,
the term translated “honor”

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:27.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
literally means “heaviness.”

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:29.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we honor someone,

00:01:29.973 --> 00:01:32.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re acknowledging that he’s weighty

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:34.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that he amounts to something.

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Greek Scriptures,
the word is related

00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:39.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to setting a price on something,

00:01:39.282 --> 00:01:44.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meaning that the one we honor
is esteemed or has value.

00:01:44.287 --> 00:01:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whom should we honor?

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:50.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, Jehovah is worthy of honor.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 4:11 says this

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:58.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gives us the reason
for giving glory and honor to Jehovah.

00:01:58.802 --> 00:02:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says because he “created all things.”

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:07.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is responsible
for us having life in the first place.

00:02:08.845 --> 00:02:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we give him honor?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many ways:

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:15.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We honor him by doing his will

00:02:15.218 --> 00:02:17.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—obeying his laws and principles.

00:02:17.754 --> 00:02:21.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We honor him
by extolling his qualities and promises

00:02:21.758 --> 00:02:25.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—telling others
about these gifts from God.

00:02:25.128 --> 00:02:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show him honor
by contributing financially

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the worldwide educational work

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:35.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’s directing
through his Son and holy spirit.

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:39.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And just as Revelation chapter 4 said

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:42.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah being worthy of the honor,

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:45.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 5:12

00:02:45.415 --> 00:02:47.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
says that his Son, Christ Jesus,

00:02:47.817 --> 00:02:50.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is worthy of the same.

00:02:50.987 --> 00:02:53.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 12 says of Jesus:

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:55.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They were saying with a loud voice:

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:57.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The Lamb who was slaughtered

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:01.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘is worthy to receive
the power and riches and wisdom

00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:05.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strength and honor
and glory and blessing.’”

00:03:06.035 --> 00:03:09.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we show honor to Jesus?

00:03:09.038 --> 00:03:12.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way is acknowledged
in the verse we just read.

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was “slaughtered”
like a sacrificial lamb

00:03:15.178 --> 00:03:18.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we might have the hope
of everlasting life.

00:03:18.882 --> 00:03:22.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We highly esteem,
and value, that sacrifice.

00:03:22.418 --> 00:03:25.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We honor Jesus
by recognizing his role

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as an immortal
“King of kings” in the heavens.

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:31.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And another
very practical way to honor Jesus

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:35.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to strive to imitate
his life and personality

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:38.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the model for us to follow closely.

00:03:38.968 --> 00:03:41.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we take the lead in showing honor,

00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:44.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who else will we view
as highly valued

00:03:44.107 --> 00:03:47.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to be treated with esteem?

00:03:47.277 --> 00:03:50.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 6:1, 2 says

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that children ‘honor their father and mother’
when they’re obedient to them.

00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:57.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 15:4-6

00:03:57.253 --> 00:03:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes it clear that adult children

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
honor their parents and grandparents

00:04:01.891 --> 00:04:06.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by giving material assistance
to them as needed.

00:04:06.763 --> 00:04:09.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Timothy 5:17

00:04:09.132 --> 00:04:12.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
urges us to give elders “double honor”

00:04:12.168 --> 00:04:14.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their hard work in our behalf.

00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 13:1, 7

00:04:17.774 --> 00:04:19.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even extends
the matter of showing honor

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:24.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to governmental rulers
and others in authority.

00:04:24.781 --> 00:04:27.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Peter 2:17

00:04:27.517 --> 00:04:30.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
broadens the meaning
of honor even further saying:

00:04:30.954 --> 00:04:33.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Honor men of all sorts.”

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to being kind
and respectful to people in general,

00:04:38.294 --> 00:04:40.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also honor them
by being willing

00:04:40.563 --> 00:04:44.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to spend time
sharing the good news with them.

00:04:44.233 --> 00:04:47.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:22-25

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:50.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appeals to wives
to honor their husbands

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:53.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by having Christlike subjection for them.

00:04:53.943 --> 00:04:58.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands are to honor their wives
by showing them love

00:04:58.081 --> 00:05:02.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and treating them
just as Jesus treated the congregation.

00:05:02.618 --> 00:05:06.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about our theme text
for this discussion?

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:10.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who was Paul addressing
in Romans chapter 12 when he said:

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor to one another,
take the lead”?

00:05:14.797 --> 00:05:19.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who are
the “one another” in that verse?

00:05:19.335 --> 00:05:23.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at Romans 1:7 with me.

00:05:24.674 --> 00:05:29.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul says he’s writing
“to all those who are in Rome

00:05:29.012 --> 00:05:32.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as God’s beloved ones,
called to be holy ones.”

00:05:33.016 --> 00:05:35.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of us
in the Christian congregation

00:05:35.985 --> 00:05:38.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are to have honor for each other.

00:05:39.722 --> 00:05:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to spend
the balance of my time

00:05:42.492 --> 00:05:45.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discussing two
of the many opportunities

00:05:45.561 --> 00:05:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to show honor

00:05:47.997 --> 00:05:51.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they’re the last two
that I just referenced):

00:05:51.234 --> 00:05:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, marriage mates
showing honor to each other,

00:05:55.638 --> 00:05:59.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and second, showing honor
to one another in our congregations.

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Marriages in general today
are seriously lacking in honor.

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:08.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Marriage mates
often demean one another

00:06:08.818 --> 00:06:13.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with harsh words
and disrespectful attitudes.

00:06:13.056 --> 00:06:16.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some in the world resort
to physical violence,

00:06:16.025 --> 00:06:19.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as if that somehow
makes the abusive one right

00:06:19.028 --> 00:06:21.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his view of whatever the issue is.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:26.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And infidelity on the part
of one or both mates is so common

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:29.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it doesn’t even
raise eyebrows anymore.

00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this is a gross
lack of honor in marriage.

00:06:35.812 --> 00:06:37.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about marriages

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those professing
to be Jehovah’s Witnesses?

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re blessed
with so many marriages

00:06:43.486 --> 00:06:46.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are wholesome and honorable.

00:06:46.522 --> 00:06:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, none are perfect.

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:52.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how blessed we are
to have the truth

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:57.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have learned to be
more and more Christlike with each other.

00:06:57.133 --> 00:07:00.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve learned to shed things
that we heard when we were growing up.

00:07:02.004 --> 00:07:05.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the matter
of honoring our marriage mate

00:07:05.975 --> 00:07:08.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
needs to be discussed.

00:07:08.144 --> 00:07:10.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While relatively few of our marriages

00:07:10.947 --> 00:07:13.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
end up with some kind
of physical violence

00:07:13.216 --> 00:07:16.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and relatively few
end up in divorce,

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:21.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what about having honor
in the marriage?

00:07:21.357 --> 00:07:23.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After living together
as husband and wife

00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many months
or for years or even for decades,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
familiarity can cause us

00:07:29.565 --> 00:07:32.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to treat each other
with less respect or honor

00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:35.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than when we were courting.

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:37.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That isn’t right.

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:40.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It isn’t Christlike.

00:07:40.643 --> 00:07:43.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with our inherited imperfection,

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:46.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may succumb
to dishonorable words and behavior

00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:48.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the one
that we promised to treasure

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:52.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“until death do us part.”

00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:56.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we get a grip
on this trait and minimize the times

00:07:56.325 --> 00:08:00.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we have
a clash of spirit and words?

00:08:00.763 --> 00:08:03.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, let’s consider

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:07.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the two basic responsibilities
assigned to marriage mates.

00:08:07.637 --> 00:08:09.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the foundation

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:14.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can then build on to improve.

00:08:14.177 --> 00:08:17.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The role of the husband
is clearly stated

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:20.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 11:3.

00:08:20.816 --> 00:08:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while some wives in society
may bristle at this thought,

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:29.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wives serving Jehovah
are to embrace this thought.

00:08:29.559 --> 00:08:32.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the arrangement of God.

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:36.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 11:3 says:

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:40.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I want you to know
that the head of every man is the Christ;

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:43.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in turn, the head
of a woman is the man;

00:08:43.206 --> 00:08:46.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in turn, the head of the Christ is God.”

00:08:46.943 --> 00:08:51.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Word says
that “the head of a woman is the man.”

00:08:51.681 --> 00:08:54.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the head of the woman

00:08:54.517 --> 00:08:57.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not to be a domineering man,

00:08:57.086 --> 00:09:01.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not an abusive man
—verbally or physically.

00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is to imitate his head.

00:09:03.359 --> 00:09:05.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And who is that?

00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:07.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did the first part
of the verse say?

00:09:07.697 --> 00:09:12.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The head
of every man is the Christ.”

00:09:12.101 --> 00:09:15.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Ephesians chapter 5

00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:19.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
strikes this fine balance
between being a head of the wife

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:22.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and being
a loving head like the Christ.

00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:26.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:22, 23 says:

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:31.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let wives be in subjection
to their husbands as to the Lord,

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:34.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[But what of the disposition
of the husband?]

00:09:34.390 --> 00:09:37.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because a husband
is head of his wife

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:40.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“just as the Christ
is head of the congregation,

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he being a savior of this body.”

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:48.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That verse says it all.

00:09:48.804 --> 00:09:52.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 33 of the same chapter says this:

00:09:52.575 --> 00:09:57.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Each one of you
must love his wife as he does himself;

00:09:57.246 --> 00:09:59.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on the other hand,

00:09:59.248 --> 00:10:04.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wife should have
deep respect for her husband.”

00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:07.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s nowhere in God’s Word

00:10:07.156 --> 00:10:11.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that says that if one mate
pushes the other mate’s button

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:13.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—emotionally—
that it cancels

00:10:13.729 --> 00:10:17.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the offended mate’s obligation
to be Christlike.

00:10:17.566 --> 00:10:21.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem is that
when one mate is offended or hurt,

00:10:21.804 --> 00:10:26.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s so easy to roll the eyes in disgust

00:10:26.275 --> 00:10:29.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to lash back with a verbal insult.

00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then the other mate fires back
with another harsh, cutting remark.

00:10:34.216 --> 00:10:37.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like wind on a forest fire.

00:10:37.453 --> 00:10:41.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tempers blaze,
and the evening goes up in smoke.

00:10:41.857 --> 00:10:44.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not at all Christlike.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:49.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no honor shown
in such a conflagration.

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:53.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has to stop sooner rather than later.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:11:00.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The January 15, 2015,
issue of The Watchtower said this:

00:11:00.643 --> 00:11:05.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember that marriage
is not a competition

00:11:05.314 --> 00:11:08.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to find out who is stronger,
who can shout louder,

00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:11.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or who can think
of the most cutting remark.

00:11:11.854 --> 00:11:16.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“True, we all have flaws,
and sometimes we upset others.

00:11:16.292 --> 00:11:19.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But there is never a justifiable reason

00:11:19.862 --> 00:11:22.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for either a husband or a wife

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:25.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to use sarcastic and demeaning speech,

00:11:25.134 --> 00:11:30.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or worse, to shove or hit each other.”

00:11:30.406 --> 00:11:33.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we change the atmosphere?

00:11:33.609 --> 00:11:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Someone needs to put out the fire

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:40.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the water of God’s Word.

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:43.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Romans 12:10b, again:

00:11:43.185 --> 00:11:47.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor
to one another, take the lead.”

00:11:49.091 --> 00:11:51.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the mates must take the lead

00:11:51.994 --> 00:11:55.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if at the time
they’re apologizing for their own behavior

00:11:55.564 --> 00:12:00.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by acknowledging that they
didn’t respond in a Christlike way saying,

00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:02.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Forgive me.”

00:12:03.439 --> 00:12:07.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That same issue
of The Watchtower cited two scriptures:

00:12:07.476 --> 00:12:10.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one for the husband
and one for the wife.

00:12:10.846 --> 00:12:15.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll first read Proverbs 17:27.

00:12:16.652 --> 00:12:19.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, listen to this

00:12:19.288 --> 00:12:22.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and apply it prior to a rift

00:12:22.024 --> 00:12:24.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even during the conflict.

00:12:24.794 --> 00:12:27.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 17:27:

00:12:27.396 --> 00:12:31.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A man of knowledge
restrains his words,

00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:35.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a discerning man will remain calm.”

00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:39.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, does that describe us?

00:12:41.310 --> 00:12:43.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now wives,

00:12:43.312 --> 00:12:47.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please locate Proverbs 31:26.

00:12:49.552 --> 00:12:54.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this describe your speech
even when some altercation occurs?

00:12:55.024 --> 00:12:57.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 31:26:

00:12:57.426 --> 00:12:59.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She opens her mouth in wisdom;

00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:03.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the law of kindness is on her tongue.”

00:13:03.899 --> 00:13:08.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually after a misunderstanding
and rash words have been said,

00:13:08.437 --> 00:13:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we feel miserable and upset.

00:13:11.407 --> 00:13:16.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We often chastise ourselves
for adding fuel to the fire.

00:13:16.145 --> 00:13:20.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How much better
to train ourselves to restrain our words

00:13:20.182 --> 00:13:22.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remain calm and to speak

00:13:22.785 --> 00:13:26.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in wisdom and with kindness of tongue.

00:13:27.656 --> 00:13:32.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meet Emil and Firuca Gârbovan
from Romania.

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:35.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re good examples
of how the power of God’s Word

00:13:35.364 --> 00:13:38.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can mold and change
the attitudes of marriage mates

00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:41.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are willing to be guided by it.

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:48.210 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was in 1983 when I met Firuca.

00:13:49.578 --> 00:13:52.248 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I already had two little girls.

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.250 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One was seven years old,

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:56.252 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the other one was three.

00:13:56.252 --> 00:13:58.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I accepted to study the Bible.

00:13:58.487 --> 00:14:00.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband worked

00:14:00.256 --> 00:14:02.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a warrant officer for the police,

00:14:02.391 --> 00:14:05.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so at the beginning,
I studied in secret.

00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:08.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I decided to tell him the truth.

00:14:08.998 --> 00:14:11.300 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I found out

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:13.936 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that my wife was studying the Bible

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in order to become

00:14:15.070 --> 00:14:17.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:14:17.072 --> 00:14:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became very sad.

00:14:19.208 --> 00:14:21.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I realized that our marriage

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:24.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our family was in danger

00:14:24.213 --> 00:14:26.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I only knew bad things

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:28.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:14:31.153 --> 00:14:35.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He threatened
he would divorce me, and he did.

00:14:36.959 --> 00:14:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The divorce was
a very difficult time in my life

00:14:40.162 --> 00:14:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I was seven months pregnant
with our third daughter.

00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:50.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Following the divorce, my husband
was given the house and custody

00:14:50.706 --> 00:14:53.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our two daughters.

00:14:53.042 --> 00:14:55.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to leave the house,

00:14:55.678 --> 00:15:00.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I stayed for almost a year
with two families of our brothers.

00:15:03.319 --> 00:15:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw Jehovah’s love toward me,

00:15:06.355 --> 00:15:09.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I loved Jehovah very much,

00:15:09.258 --> 00:15:13.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I loved my husband too.

00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, as I was walking

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and holding the little girl’s hand,

00:15:20.102 --> 00:15:23.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw Firuca’s husband walking toward me.

00:15:23.772 --> 00:15:25.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My heart stopped,

00:15:25.975 --> 00:15:28.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I said to myself,

00:15:28.477 --> 00:15:31.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He is going to hit me!’

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Emil was a gentleman.

00:15:33.682 --> 00:15:36.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he took the little girl in his arms,

00:15:36.885 --> 00:15:39.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talked to her for a few minutes,

00:15:39.521 --> 00:15:43.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he put her back down and left.

00:15:43.626 --> 00:15:47.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I saw him leaving, I thanked Jehovah

00:15:47.696 --> 00:15:50.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he didn’t beat me.

00:15:51.333 --> 00:15:55.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1990, I looked for my wife

00:15:55.004 --> 00:15:58.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I told her
that I would like to remarry her

00:15:58.173 --> 00:16:00.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reunite our family.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, after a while, she agreed

00:16:03.712 --> 00:16:07.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and step-by-step I started to study.

00:16:07.983 --> 00:16:10.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2003, I became

00:16:10.719 --> 00:16:13.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:16:13.155 --> 00:16:16.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I am very happy that I made this change,

00:16:16.325 --> 00:16:19.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I regret that I didn’t do it sooner.

00:16:22.264 --> 00:16:24.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I personally saw

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the truth can change a person’s life,

00:16:27.202 --> 00:16:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in my own family.

00:16:31.373 --> 00:16:33.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Currently, I serve as an elder.

00:16:33.976 --> 00:16:37.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 2010, I became a regular pioneer.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I see Emil conduct

00:16:40.716 --> 00:16:43.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible study next to me,

00:16:43.786 --> 00:16:47.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel like kneeling rather than standing

00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:51.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to thank Jehovah.

00:16:52.027 --> 00:16:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So to married couples
who love Jehovah we repeat:

00:16:56.432 --> 00:17:00.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor . . . , take the lead.”

00:17:00.002 --> 00:17:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principles just discussed
can also be applied

00:17:03.138 --> 00:17:06.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when showing honor
to others in the congregation.

00:17:06.475 --> 00:17:09.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the husband and wife
that we just discussed,

00:17:09.545 --> 00:17:13.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us should be improving
in imitating Jesus

00:17:13.549 --> 00:17:17.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in ‘following his steps closely’
in all of our interactions

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:19.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with fellow believers
in the congregation.

00:17:21.023 --> 00:17:23.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we show honor
to one another?

00:17:23.525 --> 00:17:25.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One way is well described

00:17:25.594 --> 00:17:30.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 10:23, 24.

00:17:30.099 --> 00:17:33.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show honor
when we put the other person’s feelings

00:17:33.902 --> 00:17:36.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and needs ahead of our own.

00:17:36.572 --> 00:17:40.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 10:23, 24:

00:17:40.242 --> 00:17:43.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are lawful,

00:17:43.011 --> 00:17:45.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but not all things are advantageous.

00:17:45.547 --> 00:17:49.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“All things are lawful,
but not all things build up.

00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:53.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let each one keep seeking,
not his own advantage,

00:17:53.489 --> 00:17:56.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:17:56.658 --> 00:18:00.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show honor
when we suppress our own rights.

00:18:00.662 --> 00:18:05.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What we do or say might be lawful,
but is it advantageous?

00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:07.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will it build up?

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:11.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 24, then, concisely says it:

00:18:11.073 --> 00:18:14.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep seeking,
not [our] own advantage [or right],

00:18:14.943 --> 00:18:17.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:18:18.547 --> 00:18:22.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We show honor to others
when we do good deeds for them.

00:18:22.351 --> 00:18:25.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Possibly, it’s even a humble task

00:18:25.454 --> 00:18:28.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an elderly publisher needs done.

00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be offering to clean the house,

00:18:30.292 --> 00:18:33.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take them to the store,
or fill some other need.

00:18:34.329 --> 00:18:37.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The principle is at Luke 22:26:

00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:40.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You, though,
are not to be that way.

00:18:40.469 --> 00:18:42.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let the one
who is the greatest among you

00:18:42.971 --> 00:18:44.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“become as the youngest,

00:18:44.973 --> 00:18:49.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the one taking the lead
as the one ministering.”

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:53.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, I cited 1 Timothy 5:17,

00:18:53.248 --> 00:18:56.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we’re urged
to give elders “double honor”

00:18:56.285 --> 00:18:58.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of their hard work in our behalf.

00:18:58.921 --> 00:19:02.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re also part
of our congregation and deserve honor.

00:19:03.692 --> 00:19:05.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our August program last year,

00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:09.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lett helped us consider
much of what is involved.

00:19:09.498 --> 00:19:12.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ll recall that his subject was

00:19:12.334 --> 00:19:15.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Appreciating Our ‘Gifts in Men.’”

00:19:15.904 --> 00:19:18.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We minister to or honor others

00:19:18.607 --> 00:19:20.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we readily forgive them

00:19:20.609 --> 00:19:24.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they’ve embarrassed us
or hurt our feelings.

00:19:24.580 --> 00:19:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Overall, Jehovah’s people do quite well

00:19:27.816 --> 00:19:30.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in honoring one another 
in the congregation.

00:19:30.552 --> 00:19:32.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But here is the question:

00:19:32.688 --> 00:19:35.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we improving in this aspect

00:19:35.958 --> 00:19:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our Christian personality?

00:19:38.827 --> 00:19:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our theme scripture,

00:19:40.863 --> 00:19:44.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul didn’t just say
to honor one another.

00:19:44.533 --> 00:19:47.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said to “widen out” or reach out

00:19:47.636 --> 00:19:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this aspect of our Christian life.

00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:54.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His words were to “take the lead.”

00:19:54.676 --> 00:19:58.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Paul had just said
to show honor to each other,

00:19:58.413 --> 00:20:00.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would be like a teacher

00:20:00.415 --> 00:20:04.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
urging a group
of literate students to learn to read.

00:20:04.152 --> 00:20:08.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If they’re literate,
they don’t need to learn to read.

00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what might the teacher
be urging them to do?

00:20:12.194 --> 00:20:16.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He might encourage them
to read better, or to improve.

00:20:17.933 --> 00:20:21.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Love is the identifying mark
of Christ’s disciples.

00:20:21.603 --> 00:20:25.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So honor is something
we’ve learned to show.

00:20:25.741 --> 00:20:28.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, like the teacher,

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:32.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul is urging us
to improve in this area.

00:20:32.114 --> 00:20:36.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said take the lead
in showing honor.

00:20:36.018 --> 00:20:38.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The footnote says
this could be rendered

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking the “initiative”
in showing honor.

00:20:43.191 --> 00:20:44.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of waiting

00:20:44.393 --> 00:20:47.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for some obvious reason
to do good for others

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:50.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to commend someone,
to check on a shut-in—

00:20:50.365 --> 00:20:53.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
look for opportunities
to take the initiative

00:20:53.735 --> 00:20:57.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show honor in the family
and in our congregations.

00:20:58.707 --> 00:21:03.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, “in showing honor . . . ,
 take the lead”!

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, changing circumstances

00:21:08.884 --> 00:21:12.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can make it challenging to show honor.

00:21:12.087 --> 00:21:15.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this dramatization,
note how the husband and wife

00:21:15.891 --> 00:21:19.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
adjusted to a change while learning new ways

00:21:19.094 --> 00:21:23.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to continue showing
love and honor to each other.

00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:30.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Kiara,

00:21:30.238 --> 00:21:35.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s my husband, Shaan.

00:21:39.848 --> 00:21:42.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our son Akil moved out recently

00:21:42.784 --> 00:21:45.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help where the need is greater.

00:21:45.554 --> 00:21:49.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t realize
just how much he made us laugh.

00:21:50.926 --> 00:21:53.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I miss that.

00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:59.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just more quiet now.

00:21:59.701 --> 00:22:02.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But more than that,

00:22:02.471 --> 00:22:05.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt we were growing apart.

00:22:21.623 --> 00:22:23.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I tried talking to him.

00:22:24.726 --> 00:22:26.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It didn’t go well.

00:22:45.313 --> 00:22:47.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ever since Akil left,

00:22:47.549 --> 00:22:50.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
things have been off
between Kiara and I.

00:23:35.530 --> 00:23:37.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She is so serious now.

00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:41.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wish she would just lighten up

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:43.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and laugh more,

00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:46.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like when Akil was still here.

00:23:47.876 --> 00:23:50.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As much as I hated to admit it,

00:23:50.879 --> 00:23:54.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it felt like we were growing apart.

00:23:58.186 --> 00:24:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even Akil noticed.

00:24:00.422 --> 00:24:04.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyway, can I ask you guys a question?

00:24:04.292 --> 00:24:06.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you both doing OK?

00:24:06.895 --> 00:24:08.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you don’t look OK.

00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:10.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we’re OK.
OK?

00:24:10.932 --> 00:24:12.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re doing wonderful, right?

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we’re doing good.

00:24:13.034 --> 00:24:13.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is good.

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:15.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah.

00:24:19.741 --> 00:24:22.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weren’t fooling anyone

00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:25.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—except maybe ourselves.

00:24:27.149 --> 00:24:29.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for the first time,

00:24:29.417 --> 00:24:31.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we both revealed to each other

00:24:31.553 --> 00:24:34.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just how we had been really feeling.

00:24:36.591 --> 00:24:39.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew we were headed down
a dangerous path.

00:24:39.794 --> 00:24:43.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to do something
—fast.

00:24:47.302 --> 00:24:49.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read aloud the scripture

00:24:49.437 --> 00:24:52.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Romans 12:10:

00:24:52.874 --> 00:24:57.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In showing honor to one another,
take the lead.”

00:24:58.446 --> 00:25:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thought about Abraham and Sarah.

00:25:01.783 --> 00:25:04.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t perfect,

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:08.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they worked hard
to show honor to each other

00:25:08.790 --> 00:25:12.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by listening and by caring.

00:25:20.268 --> 00:25:24.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told Kiara, “I know I can do better.”

00:25:24.606 --> 00:25:26.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I wanted to

00:25:26.875 --> 00:25:31.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I love her so much.

00:25:31.146 --> 00:25:35.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told Shaan,
“Let’s both try to do better.”

00:25:39.821 --> 00:25:41.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we did.

00:26:24.032 --> 00:26:27.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few months later,
we decided to pioneer together.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it seemed we had
a lot to talk about.

00:26:33.541 --> 00:26:36.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt like I was seeing 
a whole new side of Kiara.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Abraham and Sarah,
our marriage wasn’t perfect.

00:26:43.518 --> 00:26:45.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are going to be stressful times.

00:26:46.855 --> 00:26:50.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But by working hard
to apply Bible principles,

00:26:50.425 --> 00:26:52.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we got through that rough patch

00:26:52.861 --> 00:26:57.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it drew us even closer together.

00:26:59.334 --> 00:27:03.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 13:4, 7 tell us:

00:27:03.938 --> 00:27:07.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Love is patient and kind”
and “bears all things,

00:27:07.676 --> 00:27:12.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
believes all things,
hopes all things, endures all things.”

00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:16.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our dramatization helped us
to see how love can adapt

00:27:16.184 --> 00:27:19.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to changing needs and circumstances.

00:27:19.087 --> 00:27:22.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But wouldn’t it be nice
to talk with some real-life examples

00:27:22.424 --> 00:27:25.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who have developed such skills?

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we have a special treat.

00:27:28.863 --> 00:27:33.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A longtime faithful couple
has joined us in the studio

00:27:33.435 --> 00:27:35.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—William and Angela Samuelson,

00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:39.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who serve at Patterson Bethel
in the United States.

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:42.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, of course,
we’ve known each other for decades,

00:27:42.677 --> 00:27:45.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I know you as Bill and Angie,

00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that’s the way I’ll refer to you.

00:27:47.749 --> 00:27:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So nice that you
could be here and be interviewed.

00:27:51.353 --> 00:27:54.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s helped you both
maintain a happy marriage?

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we work as a team,
so we always check

00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:01.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with each other
before making decisions,

00:28:01.963 --> 00:28:05.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in areas
where we wouldn’t necessarily have to

00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it would be OK to go ahead.

00:28:07.302 --> 00:28:08.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just out of respect,

00:28:08.636 --> 00:28:12.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we talk with each other
about any decisions that we make.

00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:16.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, you know, Brother Morris,
we’ve been married 60 years now,

00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:20.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’ve never really had
a real serious argument.

00:28:20.482 --> 00:28:24.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had some disagreements
but nothing ever serious.

00:28:24.619 --> 00:28:29.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And whenever we have
those kind of words, why, we never use

00:28:29.424 --> 00:28:34.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demeaning language or say
derogatory things about each other,

00:28:34.095 --> 00:28:36.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that makes me very happy.

00:28:36.698 --> 00:28:38.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, that’s commendable.

00:28:38.333 --> 00:28:42.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early in our marriage,
there was one occasion

00:28:42.036 --> 00:28:44.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Angie was upset
with me about something

00:28:44.072 --> 00:28:46.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it could’ve been anything—

00:28:46.074 --> 00:28:50.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the conversation,
it obviously showed in her tone of voice.

00:28:50.478 --> 00:28:54.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I explained to her
that she could say anything she wanted

00:28:54.349 --> 00:28:57.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as she smiled
when she said it.

00:28:57.452 --> 00:29:01.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, she tried,
and we both had a good laugh.

00:29:01.089 --> 00:29:04.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s very hard
to stay mad when you’re smiling.

00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:06.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Smiling—very, very good advice.

00:29:06.694 --> 00:29:08.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about in the congregation?

00:29:08.229 --> 00:29:12.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have you been able
to show each other honor there?

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we have assignments

00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:18.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the platform,
either of us, we work together.

00:29:18.973 --> 00:29:22.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angie is much better

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:25.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with grammar
and pronunciation than I am,

00:29:25.447 --> 00:29:27.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so I’ll check
with her to make sure

00:29:27.782 --> 00:29:31.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m saying things
as correctly as possible.

00:29:31.019 --> 00:29:33.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she checks with me

00:29:33.054 --> 00:29:35.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on prophetic significance, for example,

00:29:35.924 --> 00:29:40.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or theocratic understanding
or procedure and timing.

00:29:40.895 --> 00:29:44.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, and something
that’s very important

00:29:44.065 --> 00:29:48.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when we do check
with each other, we’re not thin-skinned

00:29:48.069 --> 00:29:51.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the advice
that we want to give each other.

00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:53.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll call it advice.

00:29:53.842 --> 00:29:56.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that makes life a lot easier.

00:29:56.478 --> 00:29:58.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t get angry
because we’ve been told

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to improve on something.

00:30:01.115 --> 00:30:02.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s excellent.

00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:04.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You also spent a long time

00:30:04.285 --> 00:30:06.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the traveling work
before coming to Bethel.

00:30:06.988 --> 00:30:10.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew you in the traveling work
—early ’70’s and then later

00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:13.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were down South
and you were assigned down there.

00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:16.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you learn
about showing honor

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:18.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in that avenue of service?

00:30:18.967 --> 00:30:20.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you say,
we were in the traveling work

00:30:20.969 --> 00:30:23.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 33 years, just over.

00:30:23.505 --> 00:30:27.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for most of those years,
we would have other assignments.

00:30:27.408 --> 00:30:29.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would be working with the district

00:30:29.744 --> 00:30:32.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—now regional—
convention organization

00:30:32.347 --> 00:30:34.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other assignments,

00:30:34.382 --> 00:30:36.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it meant
that Angie would be alone

00:30:36.651 --> 00:30:38.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregation.

00:30:38.653 --> 00:30:40.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She never complained;

00:30:40.655 --> 00:30:45.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor did she become unduly inquisitive
about my assignment,

00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:48.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which sometimes would’ve been confidential.

00:30:48.496 --> 00:30:51.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we had
an unexpected move that came up,

00:30:51.399 --> 00:30:54.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a change of assignment somewhere,

00:30:54.402 --> 00:30:56.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angie would just pack
and be ready to go.

00:30:56.838 --> 00:31:01.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right.
That was my job—packing.

00:31:01.809 --> 00:31:04.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the field ministry, Brother Morris,

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:06.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would usually be
in separate car groups

00:31:06.414 --> 00:31:09.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Bill would work with the brothers
and I would work with the sisters.

00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:12.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I really appreciated the fact

00:31:12.153 --> 00:31:15.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he always made sure
I had a safe driver.

00:31:15.189 --> 00:31:17.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It worked out most of the time.

00:31:17.325 --> 00:31:22.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we had a territory
that was a little scary,

00:31:22.163 --> 00:31:25.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why, he made sure
that we were safe in the territory.

00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I appreciated that very much.

00:31:27.869 --> 00:31:29.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one congregation,

00:31:29.871 --> 00:31:33.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(you know, things
don’t always go the way we plan)

00:31:33.675 --> 00:31:36.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brother scheduling the meals

00:31:36.311 --> 00:31:39.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had scheduled two families

00:31:39.314 --> 00:31:41.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the same noon meal for us.

00:31:41.449 --> 00:31:44.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The one sister was deaf;

00:31:44.252 --> 00:31:47.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she had always had
the traveling brother on a certain day;

00:31:47.822 --> 00:31:51.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she didn’t hear
when she was told it wouldn’t be that day.

00:31:51.025 --> 00:31:53.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she had gone ahead
and prepared a meal.

00:31:53.628 --> 00:31:56.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,
we had been assigned to another home,

00:31:56.864 --> 00:31:59.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they served us a full course

00:31:59.334 --> 00:32:01.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—or courses—
of an Italian meal.

00:32:01.803 --> 00:32:03.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we were eating, we found out

00:32:03.972 --> 00:32:06.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the other sister was waiting for us.

00:32:06.074 --> 00:32:08.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She would’ve been highly offended
if somebody didn’t come.

00:32:08.943 --> 00:32:11.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I went to the Kingdom Hall

00:32:11.045 --> 00:32:13.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and handled the meeting
for field service after the meal,

00:32:13.948 --> 00:32:16.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Angie went to the sister.

00:32:16.117 --> 00:32:20.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sister would probably
still be mad at me if Angie hadn’t gone.

00:32:20.154 --> 00:32:23.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Boy, was I sleepy
that afternoon after two big meals.

00:32:23.825 --> 00:32:27.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I bet.
Well, you handled that very Christlike.

00:32:27.695 --> 00:32:32.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as we mentioned,
your current assignment is here at Bethel.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How have you navigated
the unique challenges

00:32:34.802 --> 00:32:39.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this form of service
while still honoring one another?

00:32:39.674 --> 00:32:42.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, as you know,
we work in different departments,

00:32:42.744 --> 00:32:45.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we respect that some things

00:32:45.613 --> 00:32:48.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are confidential to that department.

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:52.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we don’t make
the work of our department

00:32:52.053 --> 00:32:54.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a major part of our conversation.

00:32:54.055 --> 00:32:56.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could have an energy problem

00:32:56.891 --> 00:32:59.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the end of the day after working all day,

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:02.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so Bill is very considerate
about accepting too many social invitations.

00:33:02.997 --> 00:33:04.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that nice?

00:33:04.132 --> 00:33:06.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we respect
each other’s limitations

00:33:06.834 --> 00:33:08.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to physical

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:11.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just energy in general.

00:33:11.639 --> 00:33:15.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s certainly honoring each other.

00:33:15.076 --> 00:33:17.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Bill and Angie,

00:33:17.111 --> 00:33:19.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those were practical
and encouraging comments.

00:33:19.981 --> 00:33:21.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really thank you so much

00:33:21.983 --> 00:33:25.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for taking the time
and allowing us to interview you,

00:33:25.186 --> 00:33:28.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we really appreciate
your good example all these decades.

00:33:28.890 --> 00:33:29.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, thank you.

00:33:29.691 --> 00:33:30.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:37.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While the Samuelsons
are a wonderful example to try to imitate,

00:33:37.265 --> 00:33:39.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that many marriages

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may have a more difficult start,
or in some cases,

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:46.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mates may not share
the same spiritual values.

00:33:46.908 --> 00:33:51.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can be done if we find this
to be true in our case?

00:33:51.245 --> 00:33:54.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how sister Grace Li

00:33:54.148 --> 00:33:59.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from Great Britain dealt
with these challenges in her marriage.

00:33:59.887 --> 00:34:04.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born in Hong Kong in 1952.

00:34:04.358 --> 00:34:07.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was just over 14 years of age,

00:34:07.829 --> 00:34:10.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother sat me down and said,

00:34:10.264 --> 00:34:13.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look, there’s a marriage maker,

00:34:13.468 --> 00:34:15.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the gentleman has agreed

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:18.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take you as his wife.”

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:20.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was absolutely petrified!

00:34:20.508 --> 00:34:22.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had never met him before.

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was actually

00:34:24.512 --> 00:34:27.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a 20-year difference
between our ages,

00:34:27.048 --> 00:34:30.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was willing to go through with it
because I love my mum.

00:34:30.184 --> 00:34:34.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted her to be able 
to have a chance of happiness.

00:34:34.956 --> 00:34:38.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to England, 
and not long after that,

00:34:38.226 --> 00:34:42.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we started our first 
Chinese take-away in that little town.

00:34:42.797 --> 00:34:46.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had to work very hard
seven days a week

00:34:46.134 --> 00:34:48.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help my husband 
run the business.

00:34:53.674 --> 00:34:57.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was the only Chinese woman 
in the entire town.

00:34:57.378 --> 00:34:59.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had nowhere 
to ask for help

00:34:59.413 --> 00:35:02.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or advice,
so I had a really bad time.

00:35:04.552 --> 00:35:06.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my second daughter was born,

00:35:06.854 --> 00:35:09.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one night
she just stopped breathing.

00:35:09.557 --> 00:35:12.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And a few minutes later, 
the nurse came out and said,

00:35:12.660 --> 00:35:15.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God wanted a flower for his garden,

00:35:15.429 --> 00:35:17.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that’s 
where your daughter has gone.”

00:35:17.665 --> 00:35:20.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So at that moment in time, 
I was very angry.

00:35:20.401 --> 00:35:24.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt sad and sorrow and lonely.

00:35:24.505 --> 00:35:27.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I had horrible guilt:

00:35:27.074 --> 00:35:29.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s my fault.

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:33.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or it’s God’s; it’s his fault.”

00:35:33.181 --> 00:35:35.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I stopped praying to God.

00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:40.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, there was one very kind lady

00:35:40.688 --> 00:35:43.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who came and knocked on my door.

00:35:43.191 --> 00:35:45.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, eventually,

00:35:45.259 --> 00:35:49.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one day, the ladies stopped
and had a conversation,

00:35:49.163 --> 00:35:51.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the conversation led

00:35:51.265 --> 00:35:53.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to why people die

00:35:53.534 --> 00:35:55.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what happens
when they’re dead.

00:35:55.469 --> 00:35:57.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Knowing it’s nobody’s fault

00:35:57.572 --> 00:35:59.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it’s just our imperfection—

00:35:59.574 --> 00:36:01.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found it a great relief.

00:36:01.576 --> 00:36:03.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God did not punish me for that.

00:36:03.611 --> 00:36:07.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And from then on,
I started a Bible study with her.

00:36:08.249 --> 00:36:11.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But my study 
was progressing very slow.

00:36:11.085 --> 00:36:14.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By that time, I had six children.

00:36:14.288 --> 00:36:17.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also had to work full-time.

00:36:17.758 --> 00:36:20.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also,
the lady didn’t speak Chinese,

00:36:20.795 --> 00:36:24.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my English was no better
than her Chinese either.

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:31.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since I dedicated my life to Jehovah,

00:36:31.105 --> 00:36:32.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s not been easy.

00:36:33.174 --> 00:36:35.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As far as my husband was concerned,

00:36:35.209 --> 00:36:38.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wife should be concentrating

00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:40.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on looking after the family
and the business

00:36:40.882 --> 00:36:43.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and shouldn’t be wasting time
on religions like that.

00:36:43.985 --> 00:36:47.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mum, as well,
was very much against me

00:36:47.154 --> 00:36:49.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:36:52.293 --> 00:36:54.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband shouted at me.

00:36:54.295 --> 00:36:56.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often he gave me a hard time
because I wanted to take

00:36:56.564 --> 00:36:59.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all my children to the meetings.

00:37:01.435 --> 00:37:04.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day,
he wanted me to choose

00:37:04.872 --> 00:37:07.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between him or Jehovah.

00:37:07.942 --> 00:37:09.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I prayed to Jehovah.

00:37:09.210 --> 00:37:11.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Jehovah, now is the time

00:37:11.012 --> 00:37:13.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need your holy spirit to help me.”

00:37:13.347 --> 00:37:15.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I said, 
“My husband is a good man,

00:37:15.783 --> 00:37:18.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he deserves to know why

00:37:18.819 --> 00:37:21.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I chose this life.”

00:37:21.856 --> 00:37:24.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just felt so calm,

00:37:24.058 --> 00:37:26.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I turned around
and asked my husband:

00:37:26.227 --> 00:37:29.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What do you think of me 
since I became a Witness?

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:33.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Am I a better wife,
or am I getting worse?”

00:37:33.501 --> 00:37:37.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So my husband said:
“Oh, OK then.

00:37:37.972 --> 00:37:42.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that is the case,
go serve your God, Jehovah.”

00:37:43.077 --> 00:37:45.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before my mother died,

00:37:45.212 --> 00:37:47.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother actually prayed to Jehovah

00:37:47.915 --> 00:37:51.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to thank him and to say

00:37:51.919 --> 00:37:55.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that since I became
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:37:55.523 --> 00:37:57.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I became a better daughter.

00:37:57.525 --> 00:38:00.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember, one day,

00:38:00.494 --> 00:38:03.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one of my Bible students
came to my house,

00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:06.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she was crying

00:38:06.667 --> 00:38:08.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because she suffered
persecution from her husband.

00:38:08.869 --> 00:38:12.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And my husband
was sitting next to me,

00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he turned around and said,

00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:17.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You just have to persevere,

00:38:17.545 --> 00:38:21.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because my wife went through 
the same experience,

00:38:21.415 --> 00:38:24.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and look where she is now.”

00:38:24.251 --> 00:38:26.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the last ten years,
my husband has come

00:38:26.253 --> 00:38:29.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all the meetings with me.

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing my children happy
is the most important thing for me.

00:38:33.661 --> 00:38:37.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they are happy
not only for a short time

00:38:37.698 --> 00:38:39.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they also have a happy future.

00:38:39.867 --> 00:38:42.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My life now—I’m no longer lonely;

00:38:42.903 --> 00:38:45.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m no longer a fatherless child,

00:38:45.439 --> 00:38:48.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I know Jehovah cares for me.

00:38:48.075 --> 00:38:50.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helped a little woman like me,

00:38:50.378 --> 00:38:53.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I’m sure Jehovah will help anybody

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:55.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose heart is toward him.

00:38:56.283 --> 00:38:58.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Li’s example helps us to see

00:38:58.886 --> 00:39:01.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even in spiritually divided homes,

00:39:01.689 --> 00:39:04.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applying Bible principles in our life

00:39:04.225 --> 00:39:07.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can often soften the heart
of our mate toward the truth.

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:10.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having seen some beautiful examples

00:39:10.364 --> 00:39:12.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of showing honor within our marriage,

00:39:12.466 --> 00:39:14.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s now look at ways of showing honor

00:39:14.735 --> 00:39:17.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to one another in the congregation.

00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:21.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
what if we’re serving in a foreign territory

00:39:21.175 --> 00:39:23.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the customs and culture

00:39:23.177 --> 00:39:26.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are quite different
from what we’re accustomed to?

00:39:26.147 --> 00:39:29.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is just one of many challenges often faced

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:33.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by ones involved
in the international construction work.

00:39:33.087 --> 00:39:35.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have they found to be helpful

00:39:35.189 --> 00:39:37.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when adapting to new environments?

00:41:39.446 --> 00:41:42.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice the beautiful thought

00:41:42.249 --> 00:41:45.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that every culture has its own strong points

00:41:45.619 --> 00:41:49.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can learn from and apply in our lives?

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:51.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an excellent way to cultivate

00:41:51.392 --> 00:41:55.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an attitude of viewing others as superior!

00:41:55.563 --> 00:41:58.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about ones outside the congregation?

00:41:58.999 --> 00:42:01.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we show honor to them as well?

00:42:01.502 --> 00:42:03.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course.

00:42:03.504 --> 00:42:05.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:10 tells us:

00:42:05.739 --> 00:42:08.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As long as we have the opportunity,

00:42:08.209 --> 00:42:11.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let us work what is good toward all.”

00:42:11.212 --> 00:42:13.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The best way we can do this is

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by helping them cultivate
and satisfy their spiritual needs.

00:42:18.619 --> 00:42:22.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We now visit a town in the state
of Oregon in the United States

00:42:22.423 --> 00:42:27.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the congregations
had a unique opportunity to do just this.

00:42:28.062 --> 00:42:30.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An exciting event took place

00:42:30.764 --> 00:42:33.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2017 across the United States.

00:42:33.701 --> 00:42:35.336 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
August 21, 2017,

00:42:35.336 --> 00:42:37.071 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has been on a lot of people’s calendars

00:42:37.071 --> 00:42:39.473 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for a long time because of the total eclipse.

00:42:39.473 --> 00:42:42.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah’s Witnesses,
we are constantly on the lookout

00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:46.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for events where we can support
community outreach.

00:42:46.146 --> 00:42:48.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters

00:42:48.282 --> 00:42:50.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepared well in advance
to give a Bible education

00:42:50.317 --> 00:42:52.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the many travelers.

00:42:52.953 --> 00:42:55.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What convinced us
that this was an opportunity

00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:58.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give a great witness
was that we did a little research,

00:42:58.058 --> 00:43:01.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we noticed the hotel bookings.

00:43:01.161 --> 00:43:03.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The town was packed,

00:43:03.063 --> 00:43:05.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we could tell
that this was going to be a big event.

00:43:05.132 --> 00:43:07.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to do something.

00:43:07.401 --> 00:43:09.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to be in a position to share

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:12.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the wonderful things from the Bible with them.

00:43:12.406 --> 00:43:14.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to take a global approach.

00:43:14.041 --> 00:43:16.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had to identify
all the resources in Bend

00:43:16.477 --> 00:43:18.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not just do it
by individual congregation.

00:43:19.179 --> 00:43:23.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in our campaign we decided
to feature three primary tools:

00:43:23.384 --> 00:43:27.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
first, What Does the Bible Really Teach?
because many people wonder;

00:43:27.187 --> 00:43:31.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
second, Was Life Created?
because with an eclipse event,

00:43:31.292 --> 00:43:35.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people are thinking about the universe,
and it’s a good opportunity

00:43:35.162 --> 00:43:36.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to talk about our Creator;

00:43:36.630 --> 00:43:38.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and third,

00:43:38.299 --> 00:43:40.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
jw.org,

00:43:40.134 --> 00:43:42.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since we expect a lot of visitors
from all over the world,

00:43:42.936 --> 00:43:44.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can reach them in their language.

00:43:44.772 --> 00:43:48.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 200 brothers and sisters
attended two seminars

00:43:48.976 --> 00:43:53.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put on by local brothers to help prepare
individuals for the massive campaign.

00:43:54.214 --> 00:43:58.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had examples
of what not to do and what to do

00:43:58.652 --> 00:44:02.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to benefit
as many people as possible.

00:44:02.656 --> 00:44:04.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had an interview;

00:44:04.958 --> 00:44:09.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had demonstrations on how to speak
to people in different languages.

00:44:10.297 --> 00:44:14.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re expecting people
from many different parts of the world.

00:44:14.068 --> 00:44:16.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s actually an opportunity

00:44:16.303 --> 00:44:18.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be like a missionary
in our own hometown.

00:44:19.973 --> 00:44:22.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the estimates
that we have heard are conservative estimates

00:44:22.810 --> 00:44:24.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of probably 200,000 visitors.

00:44:24.878 --> 00:44:26.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be more than that.

00:44:27.448 --> 00:44:30.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The local congregations
made themselves available

00:44:30.284 --> 00:44:32.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work with city officials

00:44:32.353 --> 00:44:35.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare the parks
for the large influx of people.

00:44:35.556 --> 00:44:38.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many of Jehovah’s Witnesses
have volunteered

00:44:38.492 --> 00:44:40.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help with all kinds of things.

00:44:40.994 --> 00:44:44.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are really small communities
that are having a very large influx of people.

00:44:44.765 --> 00:44:46.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of that extra effort

00:44:46.767 --> 00:44:49.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help in kind of preparing and cleaning up

00:44:49.536 --> 00:44:52.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is much appreciated.

00:44:52.239 --> 00:44:54.308 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We have been working with Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:44:54.308 --> 00:44:56.844 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for a period of years here at Smith Rock.

00:44:56.844 --> 00:44:59.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a good experience
for our staff and our volunteers,

00:44:59.747 --> 00:45:02.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we want to accommodate that
in any way we can.

00:45:02.216 --> 00:45:05.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s been a lot of good things
happening with cart witnessing.

00:45:05.352 --> 00:45:09.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the friends had a nice experience
with an Arabic-speaking man,

00:45:09.656 --> 00:45:12.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she said the seminar 
is what helped her to be prepared.

00:45:13.293 --> 00:45:15.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She knew how to work the app,

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:17.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how to find the video in the language,

00:45:17.331 --> 00:45:20.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she already
had it downloaded and ready to go.

00:45:20.300 --> 00:45:23.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul spoke about his ministry.

00:45:23.337 --> 00:45:26.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “Woe is me
if I did not declare the good news!”

00:45:26.407 --> 00:45:30.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we don’t want to look back
and wish we would’ve done more.

00:45:31.645 --> 00:45:33.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trying it for the first time can be scary.

00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:34.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can be nerve-racking,

00:45:34.214 --> 00:45:36.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s not so scary after you get started.

00:45:37.785 --> 00:45:41.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s really been fun
is what we are calling roving.

00:45:41.488 --> 00:45:44.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We go into an area
where there are a lot of people,

00:45:44.625 --> 00:45:46.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we just start conversations.

00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t carry any literature.

00:45:48.796 --> 00:45:50.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just have our device

00:45:50.497 --> 00:45:53.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the jw.org contact card.

00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:56.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, hopefully,
if the opportunity presents itself,

00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may share with them a video

00:45:59.339 --> 00:46:01.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or tell them
we’re Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:46:01.642 --> 00:46:03.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just been a paradise for them

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a preaching paradise—
all these visitors coming in.

00:46:05.612 --> 00:46:08.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may not see the results

00:46:08.148 --> 00:46:10.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the seed that was planted
when they took a look at our cart,

00:46:10.984 --> 00:46:13.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah knows

00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:17.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the angels know
and can make that grow.

00:46:17.291 --> 00:46:19.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This endeavor
has really helped me to appreciate

00:46:19.893 --> 00:46:23.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the need to be alert
to ways to expand our ministry.

00:46:23.997 --> 00:46:27.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most communities have a calendar of events.

00:46:27.468 --> 00:46:29.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have we thought about looking at it

00:46:29.703 --> 00:46:32.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then making plans to give a witness

00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by having our literature carts out?

00:46:35.209 --> 00:46:38.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, really, events like this,
they have a bigger impact

00:46:38.479 --> 00:46:42.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on us as Jehovah’s Witnesses
because we have an opportunity to talk.

00:46:42.182 --> 00:46:44.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We get excited about our work.

00:46:44.284 --> 00:46:46.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all working together shoulder to shoulder.

00:46:46.553 --> 00:46:48.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really builds our faith.

00:46:48.555 --> 00:46:53.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, a scripture
that stood out to me was 1 Chronicles 28:20,

00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:57.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where it says:
“Be courageous . . . and go to work.”

00:46:57.231 --> 00:47:01.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped me to realize
that I just need to take the initiative and try.

00:47:01.768 --> 00:47:04.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what we all need to do,

00:47:04.004 --> 00:47:07.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then let Jehovah
decide how things turn out.

00:47:07.474 --> 00:47:10.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will no doubt bless your efforts

00:47:10.210 --> 00:47:12.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you show an interest in others.

00:47:14.748 --> 00:47:18.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The interest we show
in others is most noteworthy

00:47:18.085 --> 00:47:20.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within the bounds of our own brotherhood.

00:47:20.521 --> 00:47:23.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians 6:10, which we quoted earlier,

00:47:23.590 --> 00:47:25.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ends its thought
about working “good toward all,”

00:47:25.959 --> 00:47:27.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
saying that we should do this

00:47:27.961 --> 00:47:31.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“especially toward those
related to us in the faith.”

00:47:31.732 --> 00:47:35.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our music video entitled
You Can Count on Me

00:47:35.702 --> 00:47:40.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides a touching example
of how this “good” can be shown.

00:47:49.249 --> 00:47:57.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Time and circumstance
Don’t always work in our favor.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:05.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What might have been
if we just had the chance

00:48:05.165 --> 00:48:10.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is something
we may never know.

00:48:12.072 --> 00:48:21.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God looks down and sees;
He knows us better than we do.

00:48:22.883 --> 00:48:28.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He sees what we are
and what more we could be.

00:48:28.622 --> 00:48:33.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s all in the way
that we go.

00:48:35.228 --> 00:48:46.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He values all of us,
No matter what talent or gift we possess.

00:48:46.506 --> 00:48:57.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wants each one of us
To be as caring as he is.

00:48:57.351 --> 00:49:02.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’re my friend
’cause you’re always there

00:49:02.522 --> 00:49:06.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through our ups and downs
and through all we’ve shared.

00:49:06.426 --> 00:49:11.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m there 
When you need someone,

00:49:11.598 --> 00:49:15.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things
are hard to bear.

00:49:15.102 --> 00:49:22.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be the friend you need.
You can count on me.

00:49:28.715 --> 00:49:37.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We weep with those who weep,
Sharing the things that we’re feeling.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:45.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometimes our tears
may be all that can speak,

00:49:45.799 --> 00:49:57.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Troubles can bring us down.

Jehovah can lift us
and carry us through.

00:50:03.116 --> 00:50:13.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all can do the same
And help each other as friends do.

00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:19.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’re my friend
’cause you’re always there

00:50:19.766 --> 00:50:23.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through our ups and downs
and through all we’ve shared.

00:50:23.904 --> 00:50:28.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m there
When you need someone,

00:50:28.008 --> 00:50:31.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things
are hard to bear.

00:50:31.978 --> 00:50:40.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be the friend you need.
You can count on me.

Through our ups and downs

00:51:07.848 --> 00:51:12.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’m there

00:51:12.018 --> 00:51:16.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when things
are hard to bear.

00:51:16.022 --> 00:51:29.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll be the friend you need.
You can count on me.

We conclude this month’s program
by traveling to Indonesia.

00:51:36.676 --> 00:51:39.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Composed of more than 17,000 islands,

00:51:39.813 --> 00:51:42.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it consists of hundreds of distinct native,

00:51:42.783 --> 00:51:45.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ethnic, and linguistic groups,

00:51:45.152 --> 00:51:47.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the largest being the Javanese.

00:51:47.721 --> 00:51:49.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s visit the city of Malang,

00:51:49.723 --> 00:51:52.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which has some 370 publishers

00:51:52.626 --> 00:51:54.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 9 congregations.

00:51:54.628 --> 00:51:56.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The territory here is productive,

00:51:56.797 --> 00:52:00.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many who are open to the Bible’s message.

00:52:00.133 --> 00:52:04.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The largest challenge
our brothers face here is economic hardship.

00:52:04.771 --> 00:52:08.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not easy to provide even basic necessities,

00:52:08.141 --> 00:52:12.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so many people in the territory work long hours.

00:52:12.078 --> 00:52:14.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, the pioneers

00:52:14.114 --> 00:52:16.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have found an ingenious way to make a living

00:52:16.783 --> 00:52:19.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making milk, juice, and cakes from soybeans.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:23.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A typical day will have them up at 3:00 a.m.

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:25.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
making fresh soy products

00:52:25.192 --> 00:52:29.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then selling them
on the street in the morning.

00:52:29.029 --> 00:52:32.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the afternoon they preach
and go to the market that evening

00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:35.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to buy fresh ingredients
for the next day’s work.

00:52:36.603 --> 00:52:39.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While the brothers in Malang
have not yet been able to obtain a permit

00:52:39.773 --> 00:52:43.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an official Kingdom Hall,
they often meet in private homes.

00:52:43.743 --> 00:52:45.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although it can be cramped and hot,

00:52:45.846 --> 00:52:49.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attendance is
nearly always well over 100 percent.

00:52:49.616 --> 00:52:51.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers in Malang

00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:54.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their warm love and greetings

00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:56.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our entire global brotherhood.

00:52:57.490 --> 00:52:59.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting

00:52:59.492 --> 00:53:03.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the world headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
