00:02.352 --> 00:05.889
Our worldwide brotherhood 
is truly special. 


00:05.888 --> 00:08.090
When our brothers are in need, 


00:08.090 --> 00:10.760
we want to help 
in whatever way possible. 


00:10.760 --> 00:13.963
It also brings us great joy 
to be with our brothers


00:13.963 --> 00:16.700
—whether at the meetings, 
in the field service, 


00:16.700 --> 00:18.702
or on other occasions. 


00:18.702 --> 00:22.372
We love our brothers 
and enjoy spending time with them. 


00:22.372 --> 00:25.775
At the same time, 
because we are all imperfect, 


00:25.775 --> 00:28.778
our love and unity will be tested. 


00:28.778 --> 00:31.046
We may have our feelings hurt, 


00:31.047 --> 00:34.984
or we may hurt
the feelings of others.


00:34.983 --> 00:37.453
That brings me to the theme 
I would like to discuss 


00:37.453 --> 00:39.855
with you 
in this month’s program, 


00:39.855 --> 00:43.000
“Settling Differences 
Brings Jehovah’s Favor.” 


00:44.660 --> 00:47.530
It is based on Matthew 6:14. 


00:47.530 --> 00:50.067
Let’s read 
this important verse together. 


00:50.067 --> 00:53.404
Right after teaching 
his disciples how to pray, 


00:53.403 --> 00:57.000
Jesus says in verse 14: 


00:58.975 --> 01:02.045
“For if you forgive 
men their trespasses, 


01:02.045 --> 01:05.215
your heavenly Father 
will also forgive you.”


01:05.215 --> 01:08.485
To what extent do Jesus’ words 
affect how Jehovah 


01:08.485 --> 01:12.022
views what we do each day 
in our worship to him? 


01:12.022 --> 01:14.024
Consider this: 


01:14.023 --> 01:16.691
You’re concluding 
your day in prayer. 


01:16.692 --> 01:20.230
You pray for Jehovah’s name 
to be sanctified. 


01:20.230 --> 01:22.765
You pray 
for his Kingdom to come. 


01:22.765 --> 01:25.235
You ask that he bless 
the Governing Body 


01:25.235 --> 01:27.370
and the brothers taking the lead. 


01:27.370 --> 01:29.705
You share with him 
a few matters 


01:29.705 --> 01:31.707
of personal concern. 


01:31.707 --> 01:33.710
And then you say: “Jehovah, 


01:33.710 --> 01:35.712
“I know I am imperfect, 


01:35.712 --> 01:37.914
“and I sin against you often. 


01:37.913 --> 01:40.450
“Please forgive me 
for my sins. 


01:40.450 --> 01:42.452
“Let me stand before you 


01:42.452 --> 01:45.000
in a clean 
and approved state.”


01:46.923 --> 01:48.925
Now the question is, 


01:48.925 --> 01:51.000
Has Jehovah heard 
your heartfelt request? 


01:52.995 --> 01:55.132
Will he forgive you? 


01:55.132 --> 01:57.467
Well, what did Jesus say? 


01:57.467 --> 02:00.204
Look again at verse 14: 


02:00.203 --> 02:03.540
“For if you forgive 
men their trespasses, 


02:03.540 --> 02:07.177
your heavenly Father 
will also forgive you.”


02:07.177 --> 02:11.047
Did you notice 
Jesus’ use of the word “if”? 


02:11.047 --> 02:14.650
That tells us that forgiveness 
is not automatic. 


02:14.650 --> 02:17.120
It comes with a condition, or price. 


02:17.120 --> 02:18.788
What price? 


02:18.788 --> 02:22.591
According to Jesus, 
‘if we forgive others,’ 


02:22.592 --> 02:24.594
the condition has been met; 


02:24.593 --> 02:26.996
the price has been paid. 


02:26.997 --> 02:29.465
What will Jehovah do for us? 


02:29.465 --> 02:33.000
Jesus said: 
“[He] will also forgive you.” 


02:34.337 --> 02:37.207
Really, though, 
is it fair or reasonable 


02:37.207 --> 02:39.209
for Jehovah to say to us, 


02:39.208 --> 02:41.210
‘Only if you forgive others, 


02:41.210 --> 02:44.413
then I will also forgive you’? 


02:44.413 --> 02:48.350
Well, suppose you 
get very sick and lose your job. 


02:48.350 --> 02:51.687
You’re unable 
to pay rent for many months. 


02:51.687 --> 02:54.157
Your situation is desperate. 


02:54.157 --> 02:57.560
You have very few,
if any, options. 


02:57.560 --> 03:00.000
You worry about your wife 
and your children. 


03:01.163 --> 03:03.365
Say you go to the owner 
of the house and ask 


03:03.365 --> 03:07.537
if he would give you time 
to get back on your feet. 


03:07.537 --> 03:10.674
Once you get better 
and are able to work again, 


03:10.673 --> 03:12.741
you will do everything 
within your power 


03:12.742 --> 03:15.144
to pay him what you owe.


03:15.143 --> 03:17.680
He tells you not to worry. 


03:17.680 --> 03:20.350
He understands your situation. 


03:20.350 --> 03:22.352
He will cancel your debt, 


03:22.352 --> 03:24.620
and you do not have 
to pay him any rent 


03:24.620 --> 03:26.755
until your situation improves. 


03:26.755 --> 03:29.892
In fact, he’ll cover 
your monthly expenses 


03:29.892 --> 03:33.362
until you are able 
to care for your family. 


03:33.362 --> 03:36.699
How would you feel 
about what he has done, 


03:36.698 --> 03:40.000
and would this affect 
how you treat others?


03:41.303 --> 03:43.873
Well, because of our sinful nature, 


03:43.873 --> 03:46.141
we are all in debt to Jehovah


03:46.142 --> 03:48.210
—deserving of death. 


03:48.210 --> 03:51.013
We are unable 
to cover our expenses. 


03:51.013 --> 03:53.583
But when we go 
to Jehovah in prayer 


03:53.583 --> 03:55.785
and beg for his help, 


03:55.785 --> 03:58.722
in his great mercy and kindness, 


03:58.722 --> 04:00.724
he tells us not to worry. 


04:00.723 --> 04:04.000
He has given the life 
of his Son to pay our debt. 


04:05.127 --> 04:07.897
And on the basis of that sacrifice, 


04:07.897 --> 04:10.700
He is willing to cover our expenses


04:10.700 --> 04:12.802
—the sins we commit daily—


04:12.802 --> 04:16.205
and to extend forgiveness 
to us until we are able 


04:16.205 --> 04:18.207
to get back on our feet, 


04:18.207 --> 04:21.000
when we reach perfection 
in the new world.


04:22.612 --> 04:25.482
So think again about those 
simple yet powerful words 


04:25.482 --> 04:28.652
of Jesus at Matthew 6:14: 


04:28.652 --> 04:32.122
“For if you forgive 
men their trespasses, 


04:32.122 --> 04:35.257
your heavenly Father 
will also forgive you.” 


04:35.257 --> 04:37.327
Is that fair? 


04:37.327 --> 04:39.395
Is that reasonable? 


04:39.395 --> 04:41.397
Is it realistic? 


04:41.397 --> 04:43.399
Without a doubt! 


04:43.398 --> 04:45.635
In fact, settling differences, 


04:45.635 --> 04:47.670
or forgiving others freely, 


04:47.670 --> 04:50.005
is one of the best ways to imitate 


04:50.005 --> 04:54.000
Jehovah’s compassionate 
and merciful nature.


04:55.110 --> 04:58.000
What can help us 
to settle differences quickly? 


04:59.282 --> 05:01.617
The first thing 
we should do is to try 


05:01.617 --> 05:04.087
and let love cover 
over the wrong. 


05:04.087 --> 05:07.390
Can I just forgive and forget? 


05:07.390 --> 05:09.658
If we are able to do so, 


05:09.658 --> 05:11.860
this is a beautiful way to maintain 


05:11.860 --> 05:14.000
the congregation’s peace and unity. 


05:15.598 --> 05:18.333
But if we’re struggling 
to forget the wrong, 


05:18.333 --> 05:21.270
there are two scriptures 
that are especially helpful 


05:21.270 --> 05:23.873
in this matter 
of settling differences. 


05:23.873 --> 05:27.210
They are Matthew 5:23, 24 


05:27.210 --> 05:31.000
and Matthew 18:15-17.


05:32.282 --> 05:34.350
Keep in mind that these texts 


05:34.350 --> 05:37.287
are not referring 
to the same scenarios, 


05:37.287 --> 05:39.289
nor are they to be applied 


05:39.288 --> 05:41.656
in the exact same way. 


05:41.657 --> 05:43.659
Matthew chapter 5 


05:43.658 --> 05:45.795
has a broader application 


05:45.795 --> 05:47.797
and can be used to bring peace 


05:47.797 --> 05:49.799
in most situations. 


05:49.798 --> 05:52.000
Matthew chapter 18 


05:52.000 --> 05:54.637
has a more limited application 


05:54.637 --> 05:57.574
and applies to specific situations 


05:57.573 --> 06:00.000
that are more serious in nature.


06:01.543 --> 06:03.678
Now let’s consider the first text, 


06:03.678 --> 06:07.015
Matthew 5:23, 24: 


06:07.015 --> 06:10.285
“If, then, 
you are bringing your gift to the altar 


06:10.285 --> 06:13.957
“and there you remember that 
your brother has something against you, 


06:13.957 --> 06:18.094
“leave your gift there 
in front of the altar, and go away. 


06:18.093 --> 06:20.830
“First make your peace 
with your brother, 


06:20.830 --> 06:24.067
and then come back 
and offer your gift.”


06:24.067 --> 06:27.337
To truly capture 
what these two brief verses mean 


06:27.337 --> 06:29.372
for you and me today, 


06:29.372 --> 06:32.109
we have to understand 
what Jesus’ words meant 


06:32.108 --> 06:35.411
to his first-century Jewish listeners. 


06:35.412 --> 06:38.882
Picture the scene in your mind 
as we transport ourselves 


06:38.882 --> 06:42.685
into the city of Jerusalem 
some 2,000 years ago. 


06:42.685 --> 06:45.955
It is during one 
of the annual festivals. 


06:45.955 --> 06:49.492
There are tens of thousands 
of people in the city. 


06:49.492 --> 06:53.229
You are there to make your sacrifice
—a beautiful lamb. 


06:53.228 --> 06:55.230
The best one you have. 


06:55.230 --> 06:57.967
It’s clean and unblemished.


06:57.967 --> 07:00.837
You take the lamb 
through a series of courts 


07:00.837 --> 07:03.172
all the way 
to the Court of Priests. 


07:03.172 --> 07:06.175
It has taken you 
most of the day to get there. 


07:06.175 --> 07:09.578
Now you’re ready 
to put your hands on that animal 


07:09.578 --> 07:12.046
and offer a prayer for forgiveness, 


07:12.047 --> 07:14.050
and then you remember something. 


07:14.050 --> 07:15.383
What? 


07:15.383 --> 07:18.253
Verse 23 reads: 


07:18.253 --> 07:21.456
“If, then, you are bringing 
your gift to the altar 


07:21.457 --> 07:23.525
“and there you remember 
that your brother 


07:23.525 --> 07:25.895
has something against you,”


07:25.895 --> 07:28.197
Now you think: 
‘My brother 


07:28.197 --> 07:30.467
‘does have 
something against me! 


07:30.467 --> 07:32.469
‘The last time I saw him, 


07:32.468 --> 07:34.670
‘he greeted 
everybody else but me. 


07:34.670 --> 07:37.407
‘He was upset. 
But what is it? 


07:37.407 --> 07:39.809
‘I don’t remember 
doing anything. 


07:39.808 --> 07:41.810
‘He is so sensitive! 


07:41.810 --> 07:44.000
He’s always upset 
with something.’


07:46.215 --> 07:48.483
Did Jesus 
have all of that in mind 


07:48.483 --> 07:51.086
when he said 
what he did in verse 23? 


07:51.087 --> 07:52.355
No! 


07:52.355 --> 07:54.357
He did not go into detail 


07:54.357 --> 07:57.160
about what 
that “something” might be. 


07:57.160 --> 08:00.062
He doesn’t say 
who is right or wrong. 


08:00.062 --> 08:02.064
He doesn’t make a comment 


08:02.063 --> 08:04.233
about whether
someone is too sensitive, 


08:04.233 --> 08:07.170
always getting upset, 
never satisfied, 


08:07.170 --> 08:09.172
difficult to get along with. 


08:09.172 --> 08:10.574
Why not? 


08:10.573 --> 08:13.708
Because the reason 
behind the “something” 


08:13.708 --> 08:16.311
is not the important thing.


08:16.312 --> 08:18.849
What is the important thing? 


08:18.848 --> 08:22.116
That the peace 
has been disturbed. 


08:22.117 --> 08:25.387
There is a difference 
that needs to be settled. 


08:25.387 --> 08:27.857
The lack of peace 
between brothers 


08:27.857 --> 08:30.527
could affect their relationship 
with Jehovah. 


08:30.527 --> 08:32.795
That is important! 


08:32.795 --> 08:35.463
So what should be done?


08:35.463 --> 08:38.566
We see the answer in verse 24: 


08:38.567 --> 08:40.570
“Leave your gift there 


08:40.570 --> 08:43.438
“in front of the altar, 
and go away. 


08:43.438 --> 08:46.175
“First make your peace 
with your brother, 


08:46.175 --> 08:49.245
and then come back 
and offer your gift.”


08:49.245 --> 08:51.747
That animal sacrifice 
is important too. 


08:51.747 --> 08:53.815
There’s no doubt about that. 


08:53.815 --> 08:56.518
It represents worship to Jehovah


08:56.518 --> 08:59.521
—like going to the meetings, 
in the field service, 


08:59.522 --> 09:01.657
sharing in family worship. 


09:01.657 --> 09:03.659
But according to Jesus, 


09:03.658 --> 09:05.861
what is more important? 


09:05.862 --> 09:09.132
It is settling the difference


09:09.132 --> 09:12.269
—making peace 
with our brother first. 


09:12.268 --> 09:15.470
Then we will be 
in an acceptable position 


09:15.470 --> 09:19.208
to offer our gift 
of worship to Jehovah. 


09:19.208 --> 09:23.000
Yes, settling differences 
will bring Jehovah’s favor.


09:24.280 --> 09:28.417
But when can we apply
the principle of Matthew 5? 


09:28.417 --> 09:31.687
Whenever there is 
a difference to be settled. 


09:31.687 --> 09:35.090
Perhaps our brother 
misunderstood what we said or did. 


09:35.090 --> 09:37.493
Or maybe he didn’t misunderstand


09:37.493 --> 09:40.830
—maybe we did give him 
a valid reason to be hurt. 


09:40.830 --> 09:42.832
Regardless, we notice 


09:42.832 --> 09:45.500
that he has something against us. 


09:45.500 --> 09:49.038
In that case, we make peace. 


09:49.038 --> 09:52.173
We can also use 
the principles of this text 


09:52.173 --> 09:54.643
when we are hurt
or have something 


09:54.643 --> 09:56.645
against our brother. 


09:56.645 --> 09:58.780
We can take the initiative ourselves 


09:58.780 --> 10:00.850
to settle misunderstandings, 


10:00.850 --> 10:02.852
to resolve differences, 


10:02.852 --> 10:04.887
and to make peace 
with our brother. 


10:04.887 --> 10:08.000
Again, Jehovah blesses 
such a spirit.


10:10.292 --> 10:14.164
Now, open your Bible 
to Matthew chapter 18. 


10:14.163 --> 10:16.231
We mentioned earlier that it has 


10:16.232 --> 10:18.434
a more limited application. 


10:18.433 --> 10:20.435
How so? 


10:20.435 --> 10:23.005
Notice verse 15: 


10:23.005 --> 10:26.875
“Moreover, 
if your brother commits a sin, 


10:26.875 --> 10:30.545
“go and reveal his fault 
between you and him alone. 


10:30.545 --> 10:34.383
If he listens to you, 
you have gained your brother.”


10:34.383 --> 10:38.386
Here Jesus says, 
“if your brother commits a sin.” 


10:38.387 --> 10:40.790
That is much different
 than just having 


10:40.790 --> 10:42.858
“something against [us].” 


10:42.858 --> 10:46.795
We are talking about a situation 
that is much more serious. 


10:46.795 --> 10:48.797
What situation? 


10:48.797 --> 10:51.734
The revised 
Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will book, 


10:51.733 --> 10:53.768
page 136, explains 


10:53.768 --> 10:57.506
that it “involves financial 
or property matters, 


10:57.507 --> 10:59.842
“such as failing to repay a loan 


10:59.842 --> 11:01.877
“or committing fraud. 


11:01.877 --> 11:04.480
“Or the offense 
might be slander, 


11:04.480 --> 11:07.000
which seriously affects 
someone’s reputation.” 


11:08.483 --> 11:10.920
Of course, 
they are sins that could be resolved


11:10.920 --> 11:13.055
between the individuals concerned 


11:13.055 --> 11:15.257
but are also serious enough 


11:15.257 --> 11:19.000
to merit expulsion 
from the congregation if not settled.


11:20.295 --> 11:23.232
Before we start applying 
Matthew 18:15, 


11:23.232 --> 11:26.435
we should first consider 
whether it is really necessary 


11:26.435 --> 11:28.437
to pursue the matter. 


11:28.437 --> 11:31.107
Could we simply 
forgive the individual 


11:31.107 --> 11:33.709
for what was done 
or even take the loss 


11:33.708 --> 11:36.245
if it were a financial matter? 


11:36.245 --> 11:39.548
That is a personal decision.


11:39.548 --> 11:42.016
If we decide to pursue the matter, 


11:42.017 --> 11:44.019
what do we do? 


11:44.018 --> 11:47.021
Jesus helps us in verse 15, 
when he says 


11:47.022 --> 11:49.024
that we reveal his fault 


11:49.023 --> 11:51.560
between the two of us alone. 


11:51.560 --> 11:54.297
We do not discuss 
the matter with others, 


11:54.297 --> 11:57.299
attempting to get them 
to side with us. 


11:57.298 --> 11:59.301
We do not go 
straight to the elders 


11:59.302 --> 12:02.505
and try to get them 
to solve the problem for us. 


12:02.505 --> 12:06.242
No, we try to resolve
the matter between us. 


12:06.242 --> 12:09.445
And since our goal 
is to settle the difference, 


12:09.445 --> 12:12.147
maintain our relationship 
with Jehovah, 


12:12.147 --> 12:14.617
and help our brother do the same, 


12:14.617 --> 12:17.820
we make repeated efforts 
to speak with him 


12:17.820 --> 12:21.057
when our initial efforts 
are unsuccessful. 


12:21.057 --> 12:23.859
Keep in mind 
that Jesus did not say: 


12:23.858 --> 12:26.000
“Go only once 
and reveal his fault.”


12:28.997 --> 12:31.467
When applying this first step, 
make it clear 


12:31.467 --> 12:34.404
that your motive 
is to ‘gain your brother.’ 


12:34.403 --> 12:37.005
Also, it would be helpful 
to clearly state 


12:37.005 --> 12:40.275
that you are applying 
the first step in settling differences 


12:40.275 --> 12:43.712
as outlined by Jesus 
at Matthew 18:15. 


12:43.712 --> 12:47.315
Of course, 
this would be stated in a kindly, 


12:47.315 --> 12:49.318
nonthreatening manner 


12:49.318 --> 12:51.920
but still in a way 
to show the seriousness 


12:51.920 --> 12:54.000
of getting the matter settled.


12:55.223 --> 12:57.225
What if the first step 


12:57.225 --> 13:00.000
in gaining your brother
is unsuccessful? 


13:01.230 --> 13:04.333
Notice verse 16 explains step 2: 


13:04.333 --> 13:06.801
“But if he does not listen, 


13:06.802 --> 13:09.070
“take along with you 
one or two more, 


13:09.070 --> 13:12.808
“so that on the testimony 
of two or three witnesses 


13:12.808 --> 13:15.811
every matter 
may be established.”


13:15.812 --> 13:19.182
Yes, we talk with him 
in the company of one or two more. 


13:19.182 --> 13:21.917
Would that be our best friends? 


13:21.917 --> 13:23.052
No. 


13:23.052 --> 13:25.720
The whole purpose 
is to ‘gain our brother.’ 


13:25.720 --> 13:28.257
Teaming up with two 
of our best friends 


13:28.257 --> 13:30.392
could alienate our brother. 


13:30.392 --> 13:32.795
Instead, it makes sense 


13:32.795 --> 13:36.132
that we would choose 
other mature Christians. 


13:36.132 --> 13:39.134
How would mature Christians 
be helpful? 


13:39.133 --> 13:42.336
Well, are we 
misunderstanding things? 


13:42.337 --> 13:45.607
Could they help him 
to reason about the matter? 


13:45.607 --> 13:48.477
Could a solution be found? 


13:48.477 --> 13:51.880
Having spiritually
mature witnesses there 


13:51.880 --> 13:54.350
may help to resolve the matter. 


13:54.350 --> 13:56.885
Generally, applying steps 1 


13:56.885 --> 13:59.087
and 2 will result 
in gaining your brother 


13:59.087 --> 14:02.000
and preserving the peace 
of the congregation.


14:03.825 --> 14:07.095
If he does not respond 
to these repeated efforts 


14:07.095 --> 14:09.665
to help him, then what? 


14:09.665 --> 14:12.000
You have a decision to make. 


14:13.168 --> 14:15.570
Are you willing 
to forgive your brother, 


14:15.570 --> 14:19.000
even take a loss 
if a financial matter is involved? 


14:20.208 --> 14:23.045
If you choose 
to pursue the matter further, 


14:23.045 --> 14:25.180
listen to Jesus’ words recorded 


14:25.180 --> 14:27.182
at verse 17: 


14:27.182 --> 14:30.085
“If he does not listen to them, 


14:30.085 --> 14:32.153
“speak to the congregation. 


14:32.153 --> 14:35.490
“If he does not listen 
even to the congregation, 


14:35.490 --> 14:38.827
“let him be to you 
just as a man of the nations 


14:38.827 --> 14:41.164
and as a tax collector.”


14:41.163 --> 14:44.031
At this point, 
the body of elders 


14:44.032 --> 14:47.435
representing the congregation 
will get involved. 


14:47.435 --> 14:50.572
They will review 
the facts of the case and determine 


14:50.572 --> 14:53.642
if a judicial committee 
should be appointed. 


14:53.642 --> 14:57.445
Happily, though, 
these situations are rare, 


14:57.445 --> 14:59.982
and matters 
are often resolved peacefully 


14:59.982 --> 15:02.000
before reaching 
such a serious point.


15:04.052 --> 15:07.990
Think back again 
to that heartfelt prayer to Jehovah. 


15:07.990 --> 15:11.793
Has Jehovah heard 
our sincere requests? 


15:11.793 --> 15:13.995
Will he forgive? 


15:13.995 --> 15:15.998
Well, at this moment, 


15:15.998 --> 15:19.335
if you realize there is a difference 
with your brother 


15:19.335 --> 15:21.337
that needs to be settled, 


15:21.337 --> 15:23.639
pray to Jehovah about the matter. 


15:23.638 --> 15:25.640
Ask him to help you see 


15:25.640 --> 15:28.843
beyond the emotion 
and make peace. 


15:28.843 --> 15:32.000
Do not let any more time go by!


15:34.015 --> 15:37.418
Once we have followed 
the simple steps outlined by Jesus 


15:37.418 --> 15:39.421
and have forgiven others, 


15:39.422 --> 15:41.624
the condition has been met; 


15:41.623 --> 15:44.025
the price has been paid. 


15:44.025 --> 15:46.428
Then what will Jehovah 
do for us? 


15:46.428 --> 15:48.430
Jesus said: 


15:48.430 --> 15:50.832
‘He will also forgive us.’ 


15:50.832 --> 15:54.169
As a result, 
we will gain the peace of mind 


15:54.168 --> 15:56.705
that comes with a clean conscience, 


15:56.705 --> 16:00.308
knowing that we have 
Jehovah’s favor and blessing. 


16:00.308 --> 16:03.678
We can then 
make a valuable contribution 


16:03.678 --> 16:06.548
to the beautiful, 
united brotherhood 


16:06.548 --> 16:20.680
that we are privileged 
to be a part of.
