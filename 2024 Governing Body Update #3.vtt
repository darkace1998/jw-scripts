00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:04.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to our update!

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.652 line:10% position:50% align:center
In this program, we’ll consider

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:08.612 line:10% position:50% align:center
Bible principles that guide us

00:00:08.612 --> 00:00:10.072 line:10% position:50% align:center
when making decisions

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.241 line:10% position:50% align:center
about dress and grooming.

00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:14.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, here are a few updates

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:18.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our relief work
following recent disasters.

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:21.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
In southeast Africa, several countries

00:00:21.458 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
—including Malawi,
Mozambique, and Zimbabwe—

00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
are facing serious drought.

00:00:27.923 --> 00:00:29.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Zimbabwe branch estimates

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:33.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
that some 13,500 publishers in that land

00:00:33.804 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
need basic assistance to survive.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, some of our brothers in Malawi

00:00:40.102 --> 00:00:42.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
experienced flooding
that damaged their homes

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:45.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
and destroyed
their remaining food supplies.

00:00:45.983 --> 00:00:47.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the end of April,

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:51.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Gage Fleegle
visited Malawi and Zimbabwe

00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:53.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
to encourage the brothers and sisters.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
To provide relief
from these recent disasters,

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body has sent funds

00:01:00.122 --> 00:01:02.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that our brothers
may receive essential food items

00:01:02.875 --> 00:01:07.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as maize, beans,
dried fish, and cooking oil.

00:01:08.589 --> 00:01:10.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Japan, you’ll recall

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:14.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there was a magnitude
7.6 earthquake in January.

00:01:15.137 --> 00:01:19.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
It damaged over 600 of our brothers’ homes
and destroyed 8.

00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
And 13 Kingdom Halls were damaged.

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:27.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since then, the government has worked
to repair the local infrastructure.

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:30.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
The branch office is working hard

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:33.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help our brothers
to repair and rebuild their homes.

00:01:35.407 --> 00:01:38.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
On April 3, Taiwan experienced

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:41.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
its strongest earthquake in over 25 years.

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
It triggered tsunami warnings
in Japan and the Philippines.

00:01:46.418 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re glad that none of our brothers
were killed or severely injured.

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:54.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
And none of their homes had major damage.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
But 20 Kingdom Halls

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:59.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Amis-language
remote translation office

00:01:59.348 --> 00:02:01.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
sustained minor damage.

00:02:01.475 --> 00:02:03.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
The repair work is under way.

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the hardships
caused by these disasters,

00:02:08.023 --> 00:02:10.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters
are quick to volunteer

00:02:10.985 --> 00:02:13.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
to assist with relief work.

00:02:13.487 --> 00:02:16.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we thank all of you for your prayers

00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:20.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as your generous donations
that make this relief work possible.

00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:27.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very soon, something exciting
is being released on Video on Demand.

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:31.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a video about a Bible manuscript

00:02:31.005 --> 00:02:34.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people thought had been destroyed.

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:38.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
The manuscript is an English translation
of the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah’s name
occurs over 200 times.

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:45.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch a preview of the video entitled

00:02:45.436 --> 00:02:48.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>A Lost Bible Translation Rediscovered.</i>

00:02:50.983 --> 00:02:53.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Translation in the 18th century

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:55.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the center of political

00:02:55.446 --> 00:02:57.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
and theological dispute.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:02.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a time when you could not state
what you think too openly.

00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:06.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truth seeking of the kind that he followed

00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:11.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not something
that was welcomed by the authorities.

00:03:12.713 --> 00:03:15.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you believe that the Bible
is a collection of sacred writings,

00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:17.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
you are not going to be very happy

00:03:17.926 --> 00:03:20.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
if there are some very obvious errors
in the translations.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Taking it for granted
—that was not what we were here to do.

00:03:24.767 --> 00:03:27.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were here to ask questions.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:31.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was a translation undertaken

00:03:31.273 --> 00:03:34.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
by real scholars
who knew their Hebrew and Greek.

00:03:35.611 --> 00:03:37.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had always assumed

00:03:37.821 --> 00:03:39.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this translation
had been lost at that point.

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:44.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s absolutely fascinating,

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:46.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it needs bringing to a wider audience.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:50.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re sure you’ll enjoy watching

00:03:50.751 --> 00:03:54.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
the full-length video
about this fascinating discovery!

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, we’ve had updates
about dress and grooming.

00:04:01.553 --> 00:04:05.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve talked about beards for brothers,
slacks for sisters,

00:04:05.307 --> 00:04:08.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the use of jackets and ties for brothers.

00:04:08.685 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re thankful that Jehovah
trusts us in these matters.

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:16.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some questions come up.

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:19.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, Do these adjustments
about dress and grooming

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:23.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
mean that we
are lowering our standards?

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:25.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our worship of Jehovah
deserves our deep respect and honor.

00:04:29.998 --> 00:04:33.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
These adjustments should not dilute
the depth of our appreciation

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
for serving Jehovah.

00:04:36.171 --> 00:04:41.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
More so, it’s a recognition
that styles change over time

00:04:41.176 --> 00:04:45.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that what’s considered acceptable,
dignified dress for certain occasions

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
also changes over time.

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:50.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
do you remember these images

00:04:50.727 --> 00:04:54.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the <i>2023 Governing Body Update #8?</i>

00:04:54.606 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wouldn’t expect that we would still dress

00:04:57.025 --> 00:04:59.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
as people did in Bible times;

00:04:59.403 --> 00:05:01.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor would we expect that we would still dress

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
the same as people did 100 years ago.

00:05:04.825 --> 00:05:07.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Times change.

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:10.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s considered respectable
and dignified dress and grooming

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
changes over time.

00:05:13.375 --> 00:05:17.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
The adjustments announced
in recent updates acknowledge that.

00:05:19.464 --> 00:05:23.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another question that arises
with this new direction is,

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:27.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we make sure
that we still dignify Jehovah and his worship

00:05:27.931 --> 00:05:32.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to beards,
slacks, and not wearing ties?

00:05:33.395 --> 00:05:35.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
As is the case with all dress and grooming,

00:05:35.981 --> 00:05:38.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are a variety of styles.

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider three principles
from God’s Word.

00:05:42.863 --> 00:05:46.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know these principles,
and you love Jehovah.

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:49.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that they are important to you.

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:52.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s see how these verses can guide us

00:05:52.998 --> 00:05:56.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
when making decisions
about our dress and grooming.

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s consider 1 Timothy 2:9, 10.

00:06:02.132 --> 00:06:06.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reads: “Likewise, the women
should adorn themselves

00:06:06.386 --> 00:06:08.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in appropriate dress,

00:06:08.263 --> 00:06:11.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with modesty and soundness of mind,

00:06:11.225 --> 00:06:14.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not with styles of hair braiding
and gold or pearls

00:06:14.436 --> 00:06:16.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or very expensive clothing,

00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:20.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in the way that is proper
for women professing devotion to God,

00:06:20.692 --> 00:06:22.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
namely, through good works.”

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:25.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
From what we read in these verses,

00:06:25.572 --> 00:06:28.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
what should characterize
our dress and grooming?

00:06:29.493 --> 00:06:33.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world may choose clothing
simply based on what’s most comfortable.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:37.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as Christians,
we have other things to consider.

00:06:37.417 --> 00:06:40.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
We ‘profess devotion to God’!

00:06:40.587 --> 00:06:42.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Christian men and women,

00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:46.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want our dress and grooming
to glorify Jehovah.

00:06:46.551 --> 00:06:49.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we choose styles that are appropriate,

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
modest, and that reflect soundness of mind

00:06:53.058 --> 00:06:56.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
—especially when we go to the Kingdom Hall
or in the ministry.

00:06:57.896 --> 00:07:00.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do these terms mean?

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:04.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider some
of the study notes on these verses.

00:07:04.278 --> 00:07:06.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the term “appropriate,”

00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:09.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
the study note explains it this way:

00:07:09.032 --> 00:07:11.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or ‘respectable.’

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In this context, the Greek word used

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:18.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“suggests dress that would be considered
honorable and proper.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:23.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such attire would be suitable for one
who professes to be a minister of God.”

00:07:24.965 --> 00:07:28.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our clothes are revealing or tight,

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:33.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
would that be appropriate,
honorable, or proper?

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:36.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would that be suitable to wear
when worshipping Jehovah?

00:07:36.601 --> 00:07:40.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’d agree
that it would not be appropriate.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that we need
to carefully evaluate what we will wear,

00:07:44.484 --> 00:07:47.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we are worshipping Jehovah.

00:07:48.363 --> 00:07:50.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our clothes are casual,

00:07:50.407 --> 00:07:52.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
would that be appropriate for us to wear

00:07:52.701 --> 00:07:55.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
when worshipping Jehovah
at the meetings or when in the ministry?

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:57.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, no.

00:07:57.205 --> 00:07:59.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
That wouldn’t be appropriate.

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:01.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, I’m sure you would agree

00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:05.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
that what’s considered appropriate
also depends on the occasion.

00:08:05.922 --> 00:08:08.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, there are clothes
that are appropriate

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
for when we go to the beach or on a picnic.

00:08:11.762 --> 00:08:15.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are clothes that are appropriate
for when we attend a wedding.

00:08:15.724 --> 00:08:18.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are also clothes
that are appropriate

00:08:18.393 --> 00:08:22.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
for when we go to worship
at the Kingdom Hall or in the ministry.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:25.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:08:25.275 --> 00:08:28.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although styles change over time,

00:08:28.236 --> 00:08:32.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s good for us to recognize
that there are different levels of dress

00:08:32.532 --> 00:08:35.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
that should be decided
based on the occasion.

00:08:36.244 --> 00:08:38.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s an idea
that we all want to keep in mind.

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:42.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the next study note.

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:46.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it mean to dress “with modesty”?

00:08:46.797 --> 00:08:48.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note says:

00:08:48.423 --> 00:08:52.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In this context, modesty includes
taking into consideration

00:08:52.886 --> 00:08:54.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one’s own conscience

00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:58.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as well as the feelings
or opinions of others.

00:08:58.266 --> 00:09:00.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A modest Christian
would avoid adornment

00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:02.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is considered indecent,

00:09:02.479 --> 00:09:04.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that draws undue attention,

00:09:04.731 --> 00:09:08.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that is likely to offend
or stumble others.”

00:09:08.235 --> 00:09:10.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when making decisions,

00:09:10.278 --> 00:09:12.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
we consider
how others would be affected

00:09:12.864 --> 00:09:16.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our brothers and sisters
as well as the community.

00:09:16.910 --> 00:09:19.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we would not be
displaying modesty

00:09:19.371 --> 00:09:23.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
if our style of dress or grooming
was viewed as odd or extreme.

00:09:24.543 --> 00:09:27.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t want to draw
undue attention to ourselves

00:09:27.712 --> 00:09:32.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
or distract others
by the way we dress or groom ourselves.

00:09:32.008 --> 00:09:35.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want all attention to go to Jehovah

00:09:35.303 --> 00:09:37.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Kingdom message we proclaim.

00:09:39.349 --> 00:09:41.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the next study note.

00:09:41.476 --> 00:09:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does the term
“soundness of mind” mean?

00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:46.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note says

00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:51.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
it refers to “good judgment; sensibleness.”

00:09:52.028 --> 00:09:56.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
This quality helps us
to avoid appearing sloppy or untidy.

00:09:56.992 --> 00:09:59.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate, imagine you were invited

00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:02.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a formal reception
with government officials.

00:10:02.581 --> 00:10:04.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you dress?

00:10:04.624 --> 00:10:08.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you wear your pajamas
or something you would wear to the beach?

00:10:08.253 --> 00:10:10.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Definitely not!

00:10:10.005 --> 00:10:12.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would want to dress in a way
that showed respect

00:10:12.924 --> 00:10:15.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the occasion and for those present.

00:10:16.678 --> 00:10:20.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
How much more so
when we worship Jehovah at the meetings

00:10:20.807 --> 00:10:23.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when we share in the ministry!

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:27.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a second Bible principle.

00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:31.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found at 2 Corinthians 6:3, 4:

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In no way are we giving
any cause for stumbling,

00:10:35.947 --> 00:10:39.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that no fault may be found
with our ministry;

00:10:39.367 --> 00:10:44.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
but in every way
we recommend ourselves as God’s ministers.”

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:48.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good for us to analyze
how our dress and grooming

00:10:48.043 --> 00:10:50.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
will affect the way others view our ministry

00:10:50.754 --> 00:10:52.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the God we worship.

00:10:52.881 --> 00:10:56.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, people
may form an opinion of the truth

00:10:56.092 --> 00:10:59.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
—good or bad—
based on our appearance.

00:11:00.847 --> 00:11:04.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can ask ourselves:
‘In this part of the territory,

00:11:04.559 --> 00:11:07.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘would the neighbors view me
as one of “God’s ministers”

00:11:07.604 --> 00:11:11.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘if I dress or groom myself this way?

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:14.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Would they “see the distinction”
between Jehovah’s people

00:11:14.653 --> 00:11:16.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who do not serve God?’

00:11:18.865 --> 00:11:21.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the third principle we’ll consider?

00:11:21.993 --> 00:11:25.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s 1 John 2:15-17:

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:30.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not love either the world
or the things in the world.

00:11:30.669 --> 00:11:35.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If anyone loves the world,
the love of the Father is not in him;

00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:37.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because everything in the world

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the desire of the flesh
and the desire of the eyes

00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:42.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the showy display
of one’s means of life—

00:11:42.472 --> 00:11:46.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not originate with the Father,
but originates with the world.

00:11:46.601 --> 00:11:51.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, the world is passing away
and so is its desire,

00:11:51.064 --> 00:11:55.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the one
who does the will of God remains forever.”

00:11:55.485 --> 00:11:58.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
From these verses, we’re reminded
that our dress and grooming

00:11:58.947 --> 00:12:02.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
should not reflect a love of the world.

00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:04.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
Styles change over the years,

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there are a wide variety of styles

00:12:06.496 --> 00:12:09.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are not offensive to most people.

00:12:09.416 --> 00:12:11.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our publications have often stated

00:12:11.418 --> 00:12:14.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we ‘should not be the first
to adopt a new style

00:12:14.754 --> 00:12:17.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the last to abandon an old one.’

00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:20.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we all know
that there are many styles

00:12:20.802 --> 00:12:23.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would never want to adopt,

00:12:23.138 --> 00:12:25.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially those that are immodest,

00:12:25.599 --> 00:12:28.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
sensual, careless, or sloppy.

00:12:30.103 --> 00:12:32.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to be honest, we need to consider

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just the style of the garment

00:12:34.608 --> 00:12:38.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also whether that garment fits
in a modest way.

00:12:38.987 --> 00:12:42.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never want
to show disrespect for Jehovah

00:12:42.073 --> 00:12:44.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
or his righteous standards.

00:12:46.202 --> 00:12:48.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve considered three Bible principles

00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:52.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help us make good decisions
about our dress.

00:12:52.959 --> 00:12:56.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, these same principles
apply to hairstyles, beards,

00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to all the ways
we dress and groom ourselves.

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:04.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
They help us to determine
the length and style of our hair.

00:13:04.429 --> 00:13:07.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers use them to determine
how to groom their beards

00:13:07.557 --> 00:13:10.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they look sharp and well cared for.

00:13:11.728 --> 00:13:14.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aren’t we grateful that Jehovah

00:13:14.356 --> 00:13:17.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
has given us these principles in his Word?

00:13:17.525 --> 00:13:21.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so good to review them
in view of the recent adjustments.

00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:26.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
What else should we do
with these reminders?

00:13:26.159 --> 00:13:28.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pray about them.

00:13:28.203 --> 00:13:32.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask Jehovah to help you see
if any changes are needed.

00:13:32.874 --> 00:13:36.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask a spiritually mature friend
for honest comments.

00:13:36.836 --> 00:13:40.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
And family heads,
show your love for your wife and children

00:13:40.715 --> 00:13:44.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
by helping them to apply these principles.

00:13:45.428 --> 00:13:50.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
we love and respect you very much.

00:13:50.809 --> 00:13:53.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
