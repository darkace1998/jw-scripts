WEBVTT

00:00:01.021 --> 00:00:03.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know what the future holds.

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:08.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible prophecy clearly indicates
that we are living in “the last days.”

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
We understand what events

00:00:09.697 --> 00:00:11.156 line:10% position:50% align:center
will lead to Armageddon

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.576 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the arrival of God’s new world.

00:00:14.577 --> 00:00:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we do not know the exact events

00:00:17.997 --> 00:00:21.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ll experience personally.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you might wonder:

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will I experience a natural disaster?

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And if so, what kind of disaster?

00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How will persecution affect me?

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:35.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will I end up in prison?

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:39.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I get older, who will care for me?’

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:43.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever asked yourself
similar questions?

00:00:43.772 --> 00:00:48.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has this uncertainty
made you anxious or fearful?

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:53.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such feelings can make it hard
to think clearly.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these feelings can go away

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:59.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we realize that we are well-prepared.

00:01:01.081 --> 00:01:02.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:07.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you remember the feature drama
from the 2023 convention,

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:10.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Commit Your Way to Jehovah”?</i>

00:01:10.007 --> 00:01:14.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
It illustrated how following
the organization’s direction

00:01:14.386 --> 00:01:18.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
saved lives during times of political unrest.

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is there anything else we can do

00:01:24.188 --> 00:01:27.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be fully equipped for tomorrow?

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:28.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:01:28.817 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
we are preparing ourselves every day.

00:01:33.447 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s review what we’re already doing

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:40.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why we really have no reason
to be fearful or anxious.

00:01:42.706 --> 00:01:44.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Peter wrote his letters

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:48.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
during times of trials and instability.

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters of the first century

00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:56.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
knew they were living in the last days
of the Jewish system of things.

00:01:57.096 --> 00:02:01.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on Jesus’ warning,
they expected personal challenges.

00:02:01.767 --> 00:02:05.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, they did not know
exactly when and how

00:02:05.646 --> 00:02:07.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
these events would affect them.

00:02:09.525 --> 00:02:14.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was impossible for them
to plan for every possibility.

00:02:16.448 --> 00:02:19.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Peter, who was getting older,

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have wondered
how he and other elderly ones

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be cared for later in life.

00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:29.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
He may have perceived
that aging and declining health

00:02:29.628 --> 00:02:32.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
could create uncertainty and fear in some.

00:02:34.174 --> 00:02:38.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t that sound a lot like the situation
we’re in today?

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did the apostle Peter
recommend in view of future uncertainties?

00:02:46.228 --> 00:02:50.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Peter 1:13, he said:

00:02:50.065 --> 00:02:53.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So brace up your minds for activity;

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:57.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“keep your senses completely;

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:01.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“set your hope on the undeserved kindness

00:03:01.952 --> 00:03:05.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be brought to you
at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”

00:03:06.957 --> 00:03:11.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
So did Peter tell the brothers and sisters
to stockpile money or supplies?

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:12.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:18.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
He encouraged them to strengthen
their faith and trust in Jehovah.

00:03:19.303 --> 00:03:22.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are no uncertainties for Jehovah.

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:27.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had promised to protect the Christians
in the first century,

00:03:27.186 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would provide salvation.

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:33.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 13,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
what are the three things Peter
encouraged Christians to do?

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) “Brace up your minds for activity,”

00:03:43.994 --> 00:03:47.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) “keep your senses completely,”

00:03:48.916 --> 00:03:53.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) “set your hope
on the undeserved kindness.”

00:03:53.587 --> 00:03:55.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at each point and see

00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:59.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
what helps us to be
fully equipped for tomorrow.

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:06.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Peter tells us
to ‘brace up our minds for activity.’

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brace up” means to be ready for activity.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:12.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of activity?

00:04:13.941 --> 00:04:16.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among other forms of activity,

00:04:16.193 --> 00:04:19.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what Peter wrote
a little later in his letter

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:22.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 2:9:

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:25.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You should declare abroad
the excellencies’ of the One

00:04:25.744 --> 00:04:29.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
who called you out of darkness
into his wonderful light.” 

00:04:30.541 --> 00:04:34.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first century,
Christians were active in telling others

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:37.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
the good news about Jesus Christ.

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do the same today.

00:04:40.092 --> 00:04:41.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re active in the ministry,

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:45.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
sharing the good news
that Jesus is King in heaven,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we speak about the hope for all.

00:04:49.977 --> 00:04:54.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how does sharing
in this activity prepare us

00:04:54.273 --> 00:04:56.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the uncertainties of tomorrow?

00:04:58.318 --> 00:05:01.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talking to others
about our hope for the future

00:05:01.488 --> 00:05:04.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthens our own conviction and faith.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
This ministry keeps us focused,

00:05:08.078 --> 00:05:11.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we see the positive changes
in those we teach.

00:05:12.708 --> 00:05:16.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing in this activity
deepens our gratitude

00:05:16.587 --> 00:05:19.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being part of Jehovah’s family.

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:24.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has this gratitude motivated you
to be active in the ministry?

00:05:25.804 --> 00:05:30.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe your circumstances
even allow you to share in full-time service.

00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:34.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
By being active,

00:05:34.104 --> 00:05:37.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
you show Jehovah that his Kingdom

00:05:37.274 --> 00:05:40.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the most important thing in your life.

00:05:41.111 --> 00:05:43.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah promises

00:05:43.113 --> 00:05:46.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
to care for those who put his Kingdom first.

00:05:46.867 --> 00:05:49.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are in his protective hands;

00:05:49.536 --> 00:05:54.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is no need to be anxious or fearful.

00:05:54.374 --> 00:05:57.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, being active in the ministry

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:02.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the first step toward
being prepared for tomorrow.

00:06:04.468 --> 00:06:06.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, the apostle Peter tells us

00:06:06.887 --> 00:06:10.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘keep our senses completely.’

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means being balanced in our thinking.

00:06:15.062 --> 00:06:19.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, we are able
to evaluate matters properly,

00:06:19.191 --> 00:06:21.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
come to the right conclusions,

00:06:21.652 --> 00:06:24.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make good decisions.

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:26.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t this what we want?

00:06:27.407 --> 00:06:31.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we make good decisions,
especially when we face

00:06:31.286 --> 00:06:33.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
unexpected events in our life?

00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:40.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
Developing Christian qualities
helps us keep our senses.

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:44.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
Peter mentions one important quality

00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:46.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Peter 2:9:

00:06:46.176 --> 00:06:50.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, then, Jehovah knows how to rescue people

00:06:50.138 --> 00:06:52.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
of godly devotion out of trial.”

00:06:53.517 --> 00:06:56.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what quality can help us to keep

00:06:56.395 --> 00:06:59.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
our senses completely
and make good decisions?

00:06:59.815 --> 00:07:01.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s godly devotion.

00:07:01.984 --> 00:07:06.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means being loyal to Jehovah
and doing what he asks.

00:07:06.405 --> 00:07:08.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this not what we promised to do

00:07:08.615 --> 00:07:11.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we dedicated our lives to him
and got baptized?

00:07:12.744 --> 00:07:15.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and since then,

00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:18.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve made many decisions
to follow his directions,

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:21.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
which often come through his organization.

00:07:22.713 --> 00:07:26.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some changes were easy;
others were hard,

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:30.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we did not fully understand
the direction or agree with it.

00:07:32.264 --> 00:07:36.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of a time when you made
a difficult change for Jehovah?

00:07:37.561 --> 00:07:39.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you later see how

00:07:39.563 --> 00:07:43.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
following his direction led to good results?

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:47.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your love for Jehovah and your deep devotion

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:50.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
to him helped you to make wise decisions.

00:07:51.825 --> 00:07:53.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:07:54.703 --> 00:07:57.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing what Jehovah asks us today

00:07:57.914 --> 00:08:00.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only brings good results now

00:08:00.917 --> 00:08:04.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also prepares us for tomorrow.

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:08.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
It ensures that when
we’re faced with a critical situation,

00:08:08.925 --> 00:08:12.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will naturally follow
Jehovah’s directions.

00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:16.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t this the best way
to prepare for the future?

00:08:16.767 --> 00:08:21.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
you may remember Sister Margaret Wyrick,

00:08:21.021 --> 00:08:23.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had to flee from wildfires.

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:26.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
She learned from Jehovah’s organization

00:08:26.068 --> 00:08:30.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
how important it is to obey
those directing traffic.

00:08:30.197 --> 00:08:33.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although she wanted to drive a different way,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
she followed directions and was safe.

00:08:37.662 --> 00:08:41.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her godly devotion was evident.

00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:43.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what prepared her for the future

00:08:43.543 --> 00:08:46.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ultimately saved her life.

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Peter said we must ‘keep our senses.’

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:53.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:57.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
By cultivating qualities like godly devotion.

00:08:57.349 --> 00:09:00.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
This allows us to make good decisions

00:09:00.352 --> 00:09:02.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experience Jehovah’s care.

00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the third point
that Peter mentioned at 1 Peter 1:13?

00:09:10.404 --> 00:09:13.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tells us to ‘set our hope

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the undeserved kindness.’

00:09:15.826 --> 00:09:18.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Peter trying to say?

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:21.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can these two elements,

00:09:21.415 --> 00:09:24.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
hope and undeserved kindness,

00:09:24.793 --> 00:09:27.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to prepare for tomorrow?

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:32.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we are reminded
of the stabilizing effect

00:09:32.259 --> 00:09:34.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
that hope can have on us.

00:09:34.719 --> 00:09:37.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hope is compared to an anchor

00:09:37.013 --> 00:09:39.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
that keeps a ship secure during a storm.

00:09:41.685 --> 00:09:43.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we become anxious about what

00:09:43.895 --> 00:09:47.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might have to endure tomorrow

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:52.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
(persecution, disaster, or health issues),

00:09:52.195 --> 00:09:55.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t we feel like we’re in a storm?

00:09:56.283 --> 00:09:58.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without hope,

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might easily lose our balance.

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:07.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter encourages us here
to see beyond the uncertainties

00:10:07.252 --> 00:10:10.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and focus on what is certain,

00:10:10.755 --> 00:10:14.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
solid, and secure.

00:10:14.009 --> 00:10:17.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hope, our view of future blessings,

00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:19.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
stabilizes us.

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:24.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that Peter
made a connection between

00:10:24.686 --> 00:10:27.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
hope and undeserved kindness?

00:10:28.482 --> 00:10:32.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hope that we have is a gift from Jehovah,

00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:36.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus’ resurrection
is the basis for our hope.

00:10:37.449 --> 00:10:39.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more we reflect on this,

00:10:39.951 --> 00:10:43.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
the stronger our gratitude and hope become.

00:10:44.706 --> 00:10:49.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
This grateful attitude
influences our daily life.

00:10:49.252 --> 00:10:50.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:10:51.505 --> 00:10:54.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, notice the mindset

00:10:54.424 --> 00:10:57.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter mentioned at 1 Peter 2:11:

00:10:59.095 --> 00:11:03.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Beloved, I urge you as foreigners
and temporary residents

00:11:03.934 --> 00:11:07.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to keep abstaining from fleshly desires,

00:11:07.354 --> 00:11:09.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
which wage war against you.”

00:11:10.524 --> 00:11:14.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our daily choices show that we do not belong

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:18.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this world or seek its protection.

00:11:18.031 --> 00:11:20.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are residents of God’s Kingdom.

00:11:22.118 --> 00:11:25.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter reminds us to be different.

00:11:26.081 --> 00:11:27.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:31.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are different because of our view
of material things.

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:36.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Materialism, a fleshly desire,
has affected people around us,

00:11:36.258 --> 00:11:40.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many would sacrifice everything
for material things.

00:11:42.472 --> 00:11:43.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:48.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people are overly concerned
about their financial future.

00:11:49.604 --> 00:11:53.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it’s the course of wisdom
to do some planning,

00:11:54.401 --> 00:11:57.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
excessive worry
about material needs later in life

00:11:57.821 --> 00:12:01.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
may cause some
to put undue pressure on children

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:06.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other family members
to pursue a secular career.

00:12:07.872 --> 00:12:10.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is common in some cultures,

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:13.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it can affect us if we’re not careful.

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:19.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might feel pressured to imitate others.

00:12:19.134 --> 00:12:23.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this could even affect
our friendship with Jehovah

00:12:23.471 --> 00:12:27.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what others in our family can do for him.

00:12:29.352 --> 00:12:31.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following interview,

00:12:31.354 --> 00:12:34.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how parents living in such a culture

00:12:34.941 --> 00:12:37.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
chose to prepare for the future.

00:12:40.572 --> 00:12:42.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hong Kong is an international city,

00:12:43.783 --> 00:12:46.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is known
for having high property prices.

00:12:47.829 --> 00:12:49.623 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was a teacher,

00:12:49.623 --> 00:12:51.333 line:10% position:50% align:center
and as a teacher,

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:54.002 line:10% position:50% align:center
I advised my students to study hard

00:12:55.003 --> 00:12:57.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
and choose majors that could help them

00:12:57.213 --> 00:13:01.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
find a job with a higher income
and a stable future.

00:13:03.261 --> 00:13:05.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I learned the truth,

00:13:05.263 --> 00:13:08.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also hoped that our children
could have a better future

00:13:08.391 --> 00:13:11.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
by getting a good job when they grew up.

00:13:11.227 --> 00:13:14.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way,
they could also support us financially.

00:13:16.566 --> 00:13:18.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being Christian parents in the truth,

00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:21.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
we didn’t want them
to neglect their studies in school

00:13:21.696 --> 00:13:24.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we also wanted them to know
about the Bible.

00:13:25.533 --> 00:13:29.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we started studying the Bible
with them and took them to meetings

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped them to preach to others.

00:13:33.166 --> 00:13:37.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since they were young,
I emphasized the blessings from God

00:13:37.087 --> 00:13:39.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we should always give thanks to him.

00:13:39.798 --> 00:13:41.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when one of my sons told me,

00:13:41.966 --> 00:13:46.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dad, I want to pioneer,” I was thrilled,
and I said, “You should do it!”

00:13:47.722 --> 00:13:51.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when I heard that he wanted to pioneer
and work part-time,

00:13:51.935 --> 00:13:55.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worried about how
that would affect our income.

00:13:55.522 --> 00:13:57.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we never had a problem.

00:13:57.982 --> 00:14:01.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really saw how Jehovah blessed us.

00:14:01.736 --> 00:14:05.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
The amount of money that we earned
was more than enough, and I felt cared for

00:14:05.573 --> 00:14:08.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provided for by Jehovah.

00:14:08.743 --> 00:14:13.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
When my eldest son told me
that he wanted to stop his current studies

00:14:13.415 --> 00:14:16.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start learning a construction trade,
I was disappointed.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought that even students
who didn’t do well

00:14:19.212 --> 00:14:21.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
could do that job and that that type of work 

00:14:21.339 --> 00:14:24.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be physically harder for him.

00:14:24.092 --> 00:14:27.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he explained to us
that being a construction worker

00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:30.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be useful now
and forever in the new world.

00:14:30.515 --> 00:14:33.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
I eventually respected his decision.

00:14:35.478 --> 00:14:39.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
We taught our children to put Jehovah first,
but when it came

00:14:39.357 --> 00:14:41.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
to putting it into practice,

00:14:41.735 --> 00:14:44.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed to respect
the decision made by my son.

00:14:47.198 --> 00:14:49.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to make it possible
for our whole family to pioneer,

00:14:50.785 --> 00:14:53.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
we needed to simplify our lives.

00:14:53.204 --> 00:14:57.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
During family worship,
we discussed ways to reduce expenses

00:14:57.041 --> 00:15:00.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that everyone in the family
was on the same page.

00:15:00.044 --> 00:15:03.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that we did not lack anything

00:15:03.047 --> 00:15:06.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the whole family
could all share the burden of our expenses.

00:15:09.387 --> 00:15:13.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our children are now all grown up,
and they willingly serve Jehovah.

00:15:14.225 --> 00:15:17.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am so grateful to Jehovah
because they have come

00:15:17.812 --> 00:15:20.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love him with their whole heart.

00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:23.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are all so happy!

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:27.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am thankful to Jehovah every time

00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:30.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see the smiling faces of my family.

00:15:31.159 --> 00:15:33.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have clearly felt

00:15:33.369 --> 00:15:35.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
always takes care of his servants.

00:15:37.207 --> 00:15:41.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like it says at Matthew 6:33,

00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:43.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we ‘keep seeking first God’s Kingdom

00:15:43.963 --> 00:15:48.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his righteousness,’
Jehovah will take care of us.

00:15:48.426 --> 00:15:51.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if our prayers
are according to God’s will

00:15:51.346 --> 00:15:53.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we try our best,

00:15:53.681 --> 00:15:56.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will undoubtedly bless our efforts.

00:15:56.768 --> 00:15:59.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, I have strong faith

00:15:59.813 --> 00:16:02.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hope for our future ahead.

00:16:05.026 --> 00:16:08.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being different can be challenging,

00:16:08.488 --> 00:16:11.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
but wasn’t it encouraging
to see how this couple

00:16:11.032 --> 00:16:14.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
resisted cultural expectations and pressure?

00:16:15.954 --> 00:16:19.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, they agreed
with their children’s desire

00:16:19.374 --> 00:16:22.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue goals in Jehovah’s service,

00:16:22.836 --> 00:16:24.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they supported them.

00:16:26.047 --> 00:16:29.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strengthening our friendship with Jehovah

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:32.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the best preparation for tomorrow.

00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whether Jehovah ultimately uses children

00:16:35.682 --> 00:16:38.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
to care for their parents

00:16:38.142 --> 00:16:40.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
or provides help in another way,

00:16:42.272 --> 00:16:46.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will stick to his promise
to care for us.

00:16:49.153 --> 00:16:52.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be fully equipped for tomorrow,

00:16:52.782 --> 00:16:56.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
we set our hope with gratitude on our God

00:16:57.745 --> 00:16:59.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the God we trust.

00:17:00.081 --> 00:17:01.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this discussion,

00:17:02.208 --> 00:17:05.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you find that you are already
doing these things?

00:17:05.795 --> 00:17:07.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely so.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:09.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore,

00:17:09.924 --> 00:17:14.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not have any reason
to be overly anxious or fearful

00:17:14.512 --> 00:17:18.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
about future trials or other uncertainties.

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:23.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
We face the future with confidence

00:17:23.855 --> 00:17:27.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we are fully equipped for tomorrow.
