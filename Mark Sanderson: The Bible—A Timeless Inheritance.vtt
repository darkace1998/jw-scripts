Imagine you just learned

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:06.527 line:10% position:50% align:center
that you had received an amazing inheritance

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:08.279 line:10% position:50% align:center
—something very special

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
that had been in your family for many years.

00:00:11.073 --> 00:00:13.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the gift is very valuable.

00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:15.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel?

00:00:15.703 --> 00:00:19.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Actually, all of us
—everyone listening to this program—

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
have received such an inheritance.

00:00:22.501 --> 00:00:24.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s something that’s been passed down

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:29.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
from generation to generation
for thousands of years.

00:00:29.008 --> 00:00:30.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:33.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s God’s Word, the Bible.

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through this precious gift,
we feel Jehovah’s love.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what ways?

00:00:40.644 --> 00:00:43.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider three:

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel it when we learn how Jehovah

00:00:45.608 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
has preserved his Word
for thousands of years

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we’d have it today,

00:00:51.822 --> 00:00:54.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
we feel it in the message it conveys

00:00:54.491 --> 00:00:57.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
from our loving heavenly Father,

00:00:57.411 --> 00:01:01.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we feel it when we see
how our lives are improved

00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:04.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we apply its teachings.

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:06.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about the first:

00:01:07.421 --> 00:01:12.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love is felt
in the way that he preserved his Word.

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:15.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible was written so long ago

00:01:15.721 --> 00:01:19.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
on perishable materials,
and yet we have it today.

00:01:20.684 --> 00:01:25.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have it on our phones and tablets,
and we have printed copies.

00:01:25.898 --> 00:01:28.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider what a miracle it is

00:01:28.525 --> 00:01:31.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah had the Bible written down,

00:01:31.654 --> 00:01:34.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
hand copied for centuries,

00:01:34.156 --> 00:01:38.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet it was
accurately preserved until our day.

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
How was the Bible written?

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:43.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a miraculous way.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:47.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 3:16 clearly states:

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:53.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All Scripture
is inspired of God and beneficial.”

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:58.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah used his holy spirit
to convey his thoughts

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:02.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the minds and hearts of faithful men.

00:02:02.726 --> 00:02:05.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some 40 writers were used.

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:08.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sixteen hundred years passed

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:11.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the Bible was completed

00:02:11.026 --> 00:02:14.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
in about the year 98 C.E.

00:02:14.154 --> 00:02:18.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s more than 1,900 years ago.

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how is it that we have the Bible today?

00:02:22.496 --> 00:02:25.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
It had to be hand copied.

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the centuries,
scribes made copies of the text.

00:02:29.837 --> 00:02:32.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, the Masoretes

00:02:32.506 --> 00:02:36.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a group of meticulous
Jewish scholars and copyists—

00:02:36.844 --> 00:02:40.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
literally counted the number of words

00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:42.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even the number of letters.

00:02:42.975 --> 00:02:44.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
To make sure that they
copied the text accurately.

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:52.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted no errors to be introduced.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thankfully, many ancient Bible manuscripts

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
have survived until today

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:03.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
—perhaps some 6,000 manuscripts
of the Hebrew Scriptures

00:03:03.162 --> 00:03:06.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some 5,000
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:10.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the 15th century,

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:14.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible had been hand copied
for hundreds of years.

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now that was about to change.

00:03:17.718 --> 00:03:19.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me show you what happened,

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:23.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
using a few examples
from our Bible collection

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Warwick, New York.

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:29.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is what’s often called a Paris Bible.

00:03:29.605 --> 00:03:34.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was completed in France
during the latter part of the 13th century,

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, somewhere between
the years 1250 and 1300.

00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:43.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a complete Bible copied by hand.

00:03:43.744 --> 00:03:46.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at how beautiful it is!

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:49.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the work involved

00:03:49.041 --> 00:03:51.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a scribe sitting at a table

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:54.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
day after day carefully copying

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:57.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that someone could have a Bible like this.

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:02.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, few people
would ever have been able to own

00:04:02.012 --> 00:04:05.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
a precious hand-copied Bible like this one.

00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:09.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah had something better in mind.

00:04:09.311 --> 00:04:11.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in the 15th century,

00:04:11.897 --> 00:04:16.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
a man named Johannes Gutenberg
came up with an amazing idea.

00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
In about the year 1455,

00:04:20.322 --> 00:04:23.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gutenberg produced the first printed Bible.

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:27.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
He printed only about 180 copies.

00:04:28.413 --> 00:04:30.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
That doesn’t sound like a lot today, does it?

00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:32.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember:

00:04:32.626 --> 00:04:37.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Up until that time,
every Bible had been hand copied.

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:40.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this was something truly amazing!

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an original page

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
from one of those 180 Bibles
printed by Gutenberg.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

00:04:50.686 --> 00:04:54.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this was just the beginning.

00:04:54.022 --> 00:04:55.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time,

00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:59.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Gutenberg’s invention would allow
for thousands of copies of the Bible

00:04:59.778 --> 00:05:03.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be printed
in a relatively short period of time.

00:05:03.991 --> 00:05:05.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the years that followed,

00:05:05.826 --> 00:05:10.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
printing presses gradually
were set up in various cities in Europe.

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were they able to produce?

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:16.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1475,

00:05:16.378 --> 00:05:21.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bernhard Richel produced
this Bible in Basel, Switzerland.

00:05:21.717 --> 00:05:23.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at the size of it.

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:26.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at the beautiful printing.

00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:31.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s amazing what those early printers
were able to produce!

00:05:31.977 --> 00:05:34.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the Bible was now being printed,

00:05:34.688 --> 00:05:36.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was still a problem.

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:38.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was it?

00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:43.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Few people would ever
have been able to afford a Bible like this.

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though it was printed,
it was still very expensive.

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:52.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Bible was probably produced for a church

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:55.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
or for someone who was very wealthy.

00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:58.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
But less than 20 years later,

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
there was another exciting development.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the <i>Biblia Integra,</i>

00:06:04.801 --> 00:06:07.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
often called the Poor Man’s Bible.

00:06:07.638 --> 00:06:12.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was printed
in Switzerland in the year 1491.

00:06:12.559 --> 00:06:14.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you notice about it?

00:06:14.728 --> 00:06:17.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very small.

00:06:17.022 --> 00:06:21.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s thought to be the first
small-size printed Bible.

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:25.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man who produced this Bible
had a new idea.

00:06:25.322 --> 00:06:29.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
He produced this Bible
to appeal to common churchgoers.

00:06:29.534 --> 00:06:33.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t a Bible for a library or a church.

00:06:33.538 --> 00:06:37.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was for personal use,
something that a person could own

00:06:37.626 --> 00:06:40.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and carry with him and read at anytime.

00:06:41.964 --> 00:06:45.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why was this development so important?

00:06:45.342 --> 00:06:47.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because in the next few decades,

00:06:47.761 --> 00:06:49.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible would be translated

00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:51.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the original languages

00:06:51.848 --> 00:06:55.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
and printed in the vernacular,
or common languages,

00:06:55.477 --> 00:06:57.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
of people across Europe.

00:06:57.771 --> 00:06:59.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the first time,

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:04.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would be possible for people
to have a personal copy of the Bible

00:07:04.403 --> 00:07:06.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their own language.

00:07:07.239 --> 00:07:11.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
These significant developments
in Bible production

00:07:11.243 --> 00:07:13.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
give us reason to believe

00:07:13.078 --> 00:07:17.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our loving Father,
Jehovah, was involved.

00:07:17.165 --> 00:07:19.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
He not only had preserved the Bible

00:07:19.793 --> 00:07:23.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now he was ensuring that his gift

00:07:23.672 --> 00:07:26.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be made available to all people.

00:07:27.718 --> 00:07:30.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s return to the studio.

00:07:32.139 --> 00:07:35.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
God’s enemies did not want people

00:07:35.559 --> 00:07:38.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have Jehovah’s precious gift.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:43.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, it’s not surprising
that many people have actively worked

00:07:43.108 --> 00:07:46.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prevent others from having the Bible.

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:49.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
One scholar, Albert Barnes,
described it this way:

00:07:50.532 --> 00:07:55.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No book has excited
so much opposition as this;

00:07:55.287 --> 00:07:58.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but it has survived every attack

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:02.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which power, talent,
and eloquence have ever made on it.

00:08:02.544 --> 00:08:05.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No army ever survived

00:08:05.297 --> 00:08:07.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
so many battles as the Bible.”

00:08:09.217 --> 00:08:12.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humans alone could never
have preserved the Bible

00:08:12.721 --> 00:08:15.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the face of such strong opposition.

00:08:15.682 --> 00:08:19.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a miracle that we have it today.

00:08:19.561 --> 00:08:23.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, we feel the love of Jehovah

00:08:23.523 --> 00:08:26.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we see how he’s preserved the Bible

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:29.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made this precious gift available to all.

00:08:30.947 --> 00:08:35.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible’s message is a second way
that we feel Jehovah’s love.

00:08:36.328 --> 00:08:40.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible teaches us things
that we cannot learn anywhere else.

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, without the Bible,

00:08:42.626 --> 00:08:45.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could understand that there is a Creator

00:08:45.504 --> 00:08:49.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we could learn about his qualities
from the things he’s made.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the Bible teaches us so much more.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:55.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
In it,

00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:58.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah tells us his own personal name,

00:08:58.058 --> 00:09:01.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
the purpose of life,
and what the future holds.

00:09:03.063 --> 00:09:05.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are things
that we’d expect a loving Father

00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:09.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share with his beloved children.

00:09:09.111 --> 00:09:12.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what’s more, Jehovah invites us

00:09:12.447 --> 00:09:15.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have a close relationship with him.

00:09:15.992 --> 00:09:19.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a tender and loving Father!

00:09:20.163 --> 00:09:23.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
The practical guidance for life
that the Bible contains

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:28.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a third way that we feel Jehovah’s love.

00:09:28.046 --> 00:09:31.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a book
from the Creator that instructs us

00:09:31.049 --> 00:09:34.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to live a happy and satisfying life.

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:38.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s like our owner’s manual
from the Creator himself.

00:09:38.723 --> 00:09:42.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how much we need it!

00:09:42.227 --> 00:09:45.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus saw how much people
needed that guidance.

00:09:45.897 --> 00:09:48.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 9:36 says:

00:09:49.609 --> 00:09:53.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On seeing the crowds, he felt pity for them,

00:09:53.572 --> 00:09:56.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because they were skinned and thrown about

00:09:56.241 --> 00:09:58.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
like sheep without a shepherd.”

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:01.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true today also.

00:10:01.204 --> 00:10:04.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are so confused and lost.

00:10:04.624 --> 00:10:06.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t know what to do.

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:11.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re often guided simply
by their own thinking and desires.

00:10:11.339 --> 00:10:16.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
people end up in awful situations.

00:10:16.178 --> 00:10:18.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need reliable guidance

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show us what’s right and what’s wrong

00:10:21.558 --> 00:10:24.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to help us find the way to happiness.

00:10:24.728 --> 00:10:28.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah has provided all of that

00:10:28.064 --> 00:10:31.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his precious gift, the Bible.

00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:33.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 15:4 says:

00:10:34.488 --> 00:10:37.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all the things
that were written beforehand

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:40.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were written for our instruction,

00:10:40.076 --> 00:10:42.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that through our endurance

00:10:42.454 --> 00:10:45.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and through the comfort from the Scriptures

00:10:45.081 --> 00:10:46.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might have hope.”

00:10:47.584 --> 00:10:50.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even as our circumstances change,

00:10:50.253 --> 00:10:53.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible continues
to be our manual for life.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether young or old, single or married,

00:10:56.968 --> 00:11:00.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
the guidance in God’s Word always applies.

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
It always works.

00:11:02.766 --> 00:11:05.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we reflect on all the ways

00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:08.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible is a unique gift,

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do we see or feel?

00:11:11.775 --> 00:11:14.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
We feel the tremendous love

00:11:14.528 --> 00:11:18.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has for us
in giving us this gift.

00:11:18.907 --> 00:11:23.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s made sure that all
the information we need is inside it.

00:11:23.537 --> 00:11:27.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he helps us to apply it in our life.

00:11:27.290 --> 00:11:29.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
With what result?

00:11:29.292 --> 00:11:33.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 3:16, 17 says:

00:11:34.422 --> 00:11:37.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All Scripture is inspired of God

00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:41.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,

00:11:41.346 --> 00:11:43.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for setting things straight,

00:11:43.431 --> 00:11:46.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for disciplining in righteousness,

00:11:46.309 --> 00:11:49.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the man of God
may be fully competent,

00:11:49.854 --> 00:11:54.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:11:55.485 --> 00:11:58.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
What have we learned
in this brief discussion?

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:03.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything about the Bible
reflects Jehovah’s love

00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:06.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the miraculous way he preserved it,

00:12:06.788 --> 00:12:10.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
its message from a loving Father,

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its practical guidance on how to live.

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:16.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inheriting a precious gift

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:19.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not guarantee
that we will appreciate it.

00:12:19.968 --> 00:12:22.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, simply having a Bible

00:12:22.929 --> 00:12:25.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not mean that we’ll benefit from it.

00:12:25.724 --> 00:12:27.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
To benefit,

00:12:27.142 --> 00:12:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to read his Word,
the manual for life, every day.

00:12:33.106 --> 00:12:35.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read and study the Bible,

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:38.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
we feel the great love of its Author,

00:12:38.903 --> 00:12:42.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
our wonderful God, Jehovah.

00:12:42.032 --> 00:12:44.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the more we feel his love,

00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:48.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more we’re moved to do
what he wants us to do.

00:12:48.538 --> 00:12:52.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes helping others
to receive and benefit

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
from this precious gift.

00:12:54.628 --> 00:12:56.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this way,

00:12:56.129 --> 00:13:00.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can help as many
as possible to experience

00:13:00.342 --> 00:13:02.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
—yes, to really feel—

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:05.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
the love of God through the Bible.
