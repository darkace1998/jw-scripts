00:01.350 --> 00:04.220
Welcome to JW Broadcasting!


00:04.220 --> 00:07.657
Here is what we can look forward to 
on the program this month. 


00:07.657 --> 00:11.862
Why do we need to be quick 
to address problems when they arise? 


00:11.862 --> 00:14.830
We will highlight the benefits.


00:14.830 --> 00:20.837
And our music video will encourage us 
to reach out to expand our ministry.


00:20.837 --> 00:24.274
We will also find out how our brothers 
and sisters reached out to the visitors 


00:24.273 --> 00:28.545
that came to the Olympic Games 
in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, last year.


00:28.545 --> 00:33.000
This is the September program
of JW Broadcasting!


00:50.733 --> 00:53.670
The theme selected 
for my comments this month 


00:53.670 --> 00:56.907
is “Punctuality—A Godly Quality.” 


00:56.907 --> 00:59.709
You might remember the opening paragraph 


00:59.708 --> 01:04.646
in a 1990 Watchtower article 
on the subject of punctuality. 


01:04.647 --> 01:07.650
It said that an elder’s closest friends 


01:07.650 --> 01:10.387
jokingly called him Armageddon. 


01:10.387 --> 01:11.687
Why? 


01:11.687 --> 01:16.692
They replied: “We know he’s coming, 
but only God knows when!” 


01:16.692 --> 01:19.695
The elder had a problem with punctuality.


01:19.695 --> 01:24.300
Punctuality has nothing 
in common with procrastination. 


01:24.300 --> 01:26.302
To procrastinate means 


01:26.302 --> 01:30.107
“to intentionally put off 
the doing of something 


01:30.107 --> 01:32.142
that should be done.” 


01:32.142 --> 01:36.179
The saying, 
“Tomorrow is the busiest day of the year” 


01:36.178 --> 01:40.616
reflects the human tendency 
to procrastinate.


01:40.617 --> 01:43.419
How appropriate then 
is the inspired encouragement 


01:43.418 --> 01:46.255
concerning the present
—today. 


01:46.255 --> 01:48.525
Galatians 6:10 says: 


01:48.525 --> 01:51.862
“As long as we have the opportunity, 


01:51.862 --> 01:54.997
let us work what is good toward all.” 


01:54.997 --> 01:57.167
“As long as we have the opportunity” 


01:57.167 --> 02:00.570
does not sound like procrastination to me. 


02:00.570 --> 02:05.508
No, the Bible encourages just the opposite
—punctuality. 


02:05.508 --> 02:08.243
Punctuality refers to the characteristic 


02:08.243 --> 02:11.080
of being prompt in keeping appointments. 


02:11.080 --> 02:13.783
Punctuality is a godly quality. 


02:13.783 --> 02:17.686
In fact, Matthew 6:33 


02:17.687 --> 02:21.324
prioritizes our pursuit of Kingdom interests. 


02:21.323 --> 02:22.691
It says: 


02:22.692 --> 02:26.964
“Keep on, then, seeking first 
the Kingdom and his righteousness, 


02:26.963 --> 02:30.566
and all these other things 
will be added to you.” 


02:30.567 --> 02:34.404
It said to ‘seek the Kingdom first,’ 


02:34.403 --> 02:39.408
not second, not third or fourth
—first. 


02:39.408 --> 02:42.745
When we put the Kingdom first in our life, 


02:42.745 --> 02:45.080
we do not put it off 


02:45.080 --> 02:48.000
in favor of some trivial pursuit.


02:49.085 --> 02:51.653
If it is time for a Christian meeting, 


02:51.653 --> 02:55.090
we are there well before it starts. 


02:55.090 --> 02:58.193
Perhaps you have heard some say: 


02:58.193 --> 03:00.996
“At least I made it to the meeting. 


03:00.997 --> 03:03.399
Better late than never!” 


03:03.398 --> 03:07.803
But the godly way is: 
“Better never late!” 


03:07.803 --> 03:09.871
Jehovah is a punctual God. 


03:09.872 --> 03:12.175
He sets the example for us. 


03:12.175 --> 03:17.180
When Jehovah decided to destroy 
the ungodly world in a deluge, 


03:17.180 --> 03:21.350
he said to Noah at Genesis 6:14: 


03:21.350 --> 03:24.487
“Make for yourself an ark.” 


03:24.487 --> 03:26.489
Then, at Genesis 7:4, 


03:26.488 --> 03:31.060
Jehovah told Noah 
to enter into the ark and informed him: 


03:31.060 --> 03:33.830
“For in just seven days, 


03:33.830 --> 03:38.333
I will make it rain on the earth 
for 40 days and 40 nights.” 


03:38.333 --> 03:40.336
What happened? 


03:40.337 --> 03:42.539
A “better late than never” attitude? 


03:42.538 --> 03:46.341
No, that is not acceptable to Jehovah. 


03:46.342 --> 03:49.745
Instead, Genesis 7:10 says: 


03:49.745 --> 03:52.648
“And seven days later 


03:52.648 --> 03:55.518
the floodwaters came upon the earth.” 


03:55.518 --> 03:57.520
Right on time. 


03:57.520 --> 04:00.790
Punctuality is a godly quality.


04:00.790 --> 04:04.460
By means of a prophecy in Daniel chapter 9, 


04:04.460 --> 04:07.630
Jehovah indicated 
hundreds of years in advance 


04:07.630 --> 04:12.002
when Jesus would fulfill 
his role as Messiah and Savior. 


04:12.002 --> 04:15.305
When did Jesus present 
himself for that role? 


04:15.305 --> 04:17.373
“Better late than never?” 


04:17.373 --> 04:22.345
No, precisely on time in 29 C.E., 


04:22.345 --> 04:25.213
Jesus was anointed as Christ. 


04:25.213 --> 04:28.718
In fact, Romans 5:6 says: 


04:28.718 --> 04:31.553
“Christ died for ungodly men 


04:31.553 --> 04:34.290
at the appointed time.” 


04:34.290 --> 04:37.060
Jehovah is punctual.


04:37.060 --> 04:39.062
What about in our time? 


04:39.062 --> 04:41.564
The Bible tells us to keep in expectation 


04:41.563 --> 04:44.333
of Jehovah’s future day of judgment. 


04:44.333 --> 04:46.335
When will it happen? 


04:46.335 --> 04:51.240
Well, to us it may seem that it has delayed. 


04:51.240 --> 04:53.943
But what do we know about Jehovah? 


04:53.943 --> 04:55.945
He is punctual. 


04:55.945 --> 05:01.817
And so it is that Habakkuk 2:3 tells us: 


05:01.817 --> 05:06.322
“For the vision 
is yet for its appointed time, 


05:06.322 --> 05:09.359
“and it is rushing toward its end, 


05:09.358 --> 05:11.593
“and it will not lie. 


05:11.593 --> 05:15.931
“Even if it should delay, 
keep in expectation of it! 


05:15.932 --> 05:19.035
“For it will without fail come true. 


05:19.035 --> 05:21.803
It will not be late!” 


05:21.803 --> 05:24.840
Punctuality is Jehovah’s way. 


05:24.840 --> 05:27.743
Unlike the elder cited earlier, 


05:27.743 --> 05:31.213
this Armageddon will be on time.


05:31.213 --> 05:34.783
The apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians chapter 14 


05:34.783 --> 05:37.820
was specifically discussing what happens 


05:37.820 --> 05:39.888
at Christian gatherings. 


05:39.888 --> 05:41.956
In verse 26, he said: 


05:41.957 --> 05:43.960
“When you come together, . . . 


05:43.960 --> 05:47.563
Let all things take place for building up.” 


05:47.563 --> 05:51.166
Then, at 1 Corinthians 14:40, 


05:51.167 --> 05:53.302
he concludes by saying: 


05:53.302 --> 05:57.174
“But let all things take place decently 


05:57.173 --> 05:59.541
and by arrangement.” 


05:59.542 --> 06:01.010
Look at the words again. 


06:01.010 --> 06:03.045
When speaking about Christian meetings, 


06:03.045 --> 06:06.748
he said: 
‘Let things take place decently.’ 


06:06.748 --> 06:10.018
In Greek, 
it literally means “well-behavedly.” 


06:10.018 --> 06:15.156
Paul also used a Greek word 
translated here “by arrangement.” 


06:15.157 --> 06:20.095
The literal meaning of the Greek word 
is “according to order.” 


06:20.095 --> 06:25.100
If we are to be well-behaved, 
according to order at our meetings, 


06:25.100 --> 06:28.337
what would be one aspect of that? 


06:28.337 --> 06:30.574
Being punctual
—on time—


06:30.573 --> 06:32.575
for the start of the meeting.


06:32.575 --> 06:36.212
While the lack of punctuality 
affects all cultures 


06:36.212 --> 06:38.280
to one degree or another, 


06:38.280 --> 06:40.348
it is true that some cultures 


06:40.348 --> 06:43.953
are more punctual 
than others as a whole. 


06:43.953 --> 06:48.356
A missionary reported 
that in one town where he served, 


06:48.357 --> 06:52.060
his wife would be 
the only person in the audience 


06:52.060 --> 06:56.565
when he announced the opening song 
at the beginning of the meeting. 


06:56.565 --> 06:59.535
But when he announced the closing song, 


06:59.535 --> 07:02.638
70 people would be there. 


07:02.638 --> 07:06.441
On the other hand, 
in a Western European country, 


07:06.442 --> 07:08.979
about a thousand people were asked: 


07:08.978 --> 07:13.481
“If you were invited 
to dinner at 7:00 p.m., 


07:13.482 --> 07:17.487
“should you arrive 
five or ten minutes early, 


07:17.487 --> 07:21.590
or five or ten minutes late, 
or exactly on time?” 


07:21.590 --> 07:23.592
The majority responded 


07:23.592 --> 07:27.730
that “courtesy requires 
scrupulous respect for the host 


07:27.730 --> 07:31.567
and arriving at the exact minute.” 


07:31.567 --> 07:36.439
Each culture would likely think 
that the other is extreme. 


07:36.438 --> 07:41.543
However, being punctual is more 
than a matter of regional preference. 


07:41.543 --> 07:43.611
It is a godly quality 


07:43.612 --> 07:46.749
that true Christians of every culture 


07:46.748 --> 07:48.750
want to cultivate. 


07:48.750 --> 07:52.822
Punctuality must become a habit
—a way of life. 


07:52.822 --> 07:55.825
It is similar to some countries 


07:55.825 --> 08:00.328
that do not have 
a habit of good hygiene, or cleanliness. 


08:00.328 --> 08:04.700
That may be true, 
but it is expected that Jehovah’s people 


08:04.700 --> 08:09.672
in those lands will excel 
in good hygiene and clean habits. 


08:09.672 --> 08:13.442
In the same way, 
no matter what our background, 


08:13.442 --> 08:15.645
culture, or upbringing, 


08:15.645 --> 08:19.515
it is expected 
that we as imitators of our God 


08:19.515 --> 08:24.520
will develop 
the godly habit of being punctual.


08:24.520 --> 08:27.223
What helps us to be punctual? 


08:27.223 --> 08:30.191
The Bible encourages advance planning. 


08:30.192 --> 08:32.729
Proverbs 21:5 says: 


08:32.728 --> 08:36.731
“The plans of the diligent 
surely lead to success, 


08:36.732 --> 08:41.570
but all who are hasty 
surely head for poverty.” 


08:41.570 --> 08:44.173
So being punctual is not just a matter 


08:44.173 --> 08:49.078
of hastily fulfilling 
an obligation or an appointment. 


08:49.078 --> 08:54.083
It involves thinking in advance 
about our responsibilities. 


08:54.083 --> 08:56.718
Yes, planning to be prepared for them 


08:56.718 --> 09:00.455
and to be prompt in carrying them out.


09:00.455 --> 09:02.958
Well, what are some activities 


09:02.958 --> 09:07.396
that we would want 
to be punctual in fulfilling? 


09:07.397 --> 09:10.767
It can be the everyday things in life, 


09:10.767 --> 09:15.672
such as arriving at work 
or at school on time; 


09:15.672 --> 09:21.877
being punctual for appointments, 
such as a visit to the doctor or dentist; 


09:21.877 --> 09:27.617
arriving at the designated time 
when invited to another’s home for a meal. 


09:27.617 --> 09:32.000
What is our habit like 
when it comes to these areas of life?


09:33.022 --> 09:35.190
Even more important is punctuality 


09:35.190 --> 09:38.693
when attending 
our Christian meetings and assemblies. 


09:38.693 --> 09:40.696
This means being present 


09:40.697 --> 09:44.300
before the opening song and prayer. 


09:44.300 --> 09:47.837
The apostle Paul quoted from Psalm 22 


09:47.837 --> 09:50.874
when he wrote Hebrews 2:12. 


09:50.873 --> 09:53.408
Of Jesus he said: 


09:53.408 --> 09:56.245
“I will declare your name to my brothers; 


09:56.245 --> 10:01.017
in the midst of the congregation 
I will praise you with song.” 


10:01.017 --> 10:03.819
If that was true of Jesus, 


10:03.818 --> 10:08.023
it is a great incentive 
for us to participate 


10:08.023 --> 10:12.226
in singing the first song 
with our congregation. 


10:12.227 --> 10:15.899
And the opening prayer 
is important for us. 


10:15.898 --> 10:19.501
In ancient times, 
Jehovah called the temple 


10:19.502 --> 10:21.837
his “house of prayer.” 


10:21.837 --> 10:24.074
It’s true that the opening prayer 


10:24.073 --> 10:28.543
requests Jehovah’s guidance 
and holy spirit on the program, 


10:28.543 --> 10:31.213
however, it also prepares 


10:31.213 --> 10:33.915
our minds and hearts 


10:33.915 --> 10:37.653
to receive the information to be considered. 


10:37.653 --> 10:40.890
Of course, there may be times when one 


10:40.890 --> 10:43.525
is unavoidably late in arriving at a meeting. 


10:43.525 --> 10:46.095
Public transportation may be delayed 


10:46.095 --> 10:49.232
or our car may break down. 


10:49.232 --> 10:52.935
That’s understandable on occasion. 


10:52.935 --> 10:55.000
But what is our habit? 


10:56.372 --> 10:59.742
In the past, 
it was suggested that we consider 


10:59.742 --> 11:03.779
arriving 15 or 20 minutes 
before a meeting started. 


11:03.778 --> 11:06.315
One brother with six siblings 


11:06.315 --> 11:10.252
said his father made a goal 
of being at the Kingdom Hall 


11:10.252 --> 11:13.955
20 minutes before the program began. 


11:13.955 --> 11:16.858
That certainly took advance planning. 


11:16.858 --> 11:21.663
His father’s byline 
for meeting attendance was: 


11:21.663 --> 11:24.700
“If you’re 5 minutes early, 


11:24.700 --> 11:27.870
then your 15 minutes late.” 


11:27.870 --> 11:30.940
In most cases, the whole family arrived 


11:30.940 --> 11:35.043
20 minutes before the meeting 


11:35.043 --> 11:37.946
for wholesome association.


11:37.947 --> 11:40.115
Another opportunity for punctuality 


11:40.115 --> 11:43.552
is arriving on time 
for a meeting for service. 


11:43.552 --> 11:45.889
This is challenging for some. 


11:45.888 --> 11:48.890
However, with a little advanced planning, 


11:48.890 --> 11:50.927
we can be successful. 


11:50.927 --> 11:53.562
Punctuality is particularly important 


11:53.562 --> 11:58.500
since the actual meeting 
is only about ten minutes long. 


11:58.500 --> 12:02.337
If we’re late, 
not only is it disruptive 


12:02.337 --> 12:05.307
but it could force 
the one taking the lead 


12:05.307 --> 12:09.000
to redo the arrangements 
made for the group. 


12:10.278 --> 12:12.448
And speaking of our ministry, 


12:12.448 --> 12:16.518
what is an opportunity 
to be punctual every month? 


12:16.518 --> 12:18.553
Yes, you guessed it, 


12:18.553 --> 12:22.858
turning in our field service report 
at the end of the month. 


12:22.858 --> 12:26.000
Do you have a way 
of reminding yourself of this?


12:27.362 --> 12:30.800
In some lands, 
it is almost as if it is a custom 


12:30.800 --> 12:34.237
for the start 
of a wedding talk to be delayed. 


12:34.237 --> 12:39.275
Often this is because 
of mistakenly gauging how much time 


12:39.275 --> 12:43.045
the bride needs 
to get dressed and made up 


12:43.045 --> 12:45.882
for her grand appearance. 


12:45.882 --> 12:49.219
However, 
being considerate of those invited 


12:49.218 --> 12:53.821
should move those involved 
to allow extra time 


12:53.822 --> 12:57.025
to complete the task of preparation. 


12:57.025 --> 13:01.330
A 1990 Watchtower 
commented on being punctual 


13:01.330 --> 13:03.998
in starting a wedding. 


13:03.998 --> 13:07.001
The very next sentence stated: 


13:07.002 --> 13:11.107
“You may like to have your egg boiled 


13:11.107 --> 13:13.442
for just so many minutes.” 


13:13.442 --> 13:17.614
I am not sure exactly how 
that applies to a wedding, 


13:17.613 --> 13:21.750
but I think we get the point, 
don’t we? 


13:21.750 --> 13:26.688
We should have calculated 
the timing in advance 


13:26.688 --> 13:31.593
so that the ceremony begins on time.


13:31.593 --> 13:35.196
Do we have yet another example 
of being punctual, 


13:35.197 --> 13:38.067
not procrastinating? 


13:38.067 --> 13:40.735
How about when there is a difference 


13:40.735 --> 13:43.505
between you and a fellow believer 


13:43.505 --> 13:45.908
or a family member? 


13:45.908 --> 13:50.345
Of course, if it is simply a minor issue 


13:50.345 --> 13:52.347
because of imperfection, 


13:52.347 --> 13:57.954
often the best thing to do 
is forgive and forget. 


13:57.953 --> 14:00.755
But if it was more serious 


14:00.755 --> 14:04.193
or we cannot simply let it go, 


14:04.193 --> 14:06.295
what should we do? 


14:06.295 --> 14:10.332
We need to settle the matter 
and restore the peace. 


14:10.332 --> 14:12.935
When should we take this step? 


14:12.935 --> 14:15.237
Do not procrastinate. 


14:15.237 --> 14:20.977
If we do, 
the problem may fester and get worse. 


14:20.977 --> 14:24.112
What kind of a priority 
did Jesus establish 


14:24.112 --> 14:27.349
for restoring peace 
between fellow believers? 


14:27.348 --> 14:31.553
At Matthew 5:23, 24, 


14:31.553 --> 14:35.356
note his clear indication of punctuality: 


14:35.357 --> 14:39.295
“If, then, you are bringing 
your gift to the altar 


14:39.295 --> 14:43.132
“and there you remember
that your brother has something against you,


14:43.132 --> 14:47.302
“leave your gift there in front 
of the altar, and go away. 


14:47.302 --> 14:50.405
“First make your peace with your brother, 


14:50.405 --> 14:52.942
and then come back and offer your gift.” 


14:52.942 --> 14:55.810
Did you pick up on the timing 


14:55.810 --> 15:00.015
that Jesus recommended for reconciliation? 


15:00.015 --> 15:02.017
He said: 


15:02.017 --> 15:06.789
“[First] First make your peace 
with your brother.” 


15:06.788 --> 15:11.260
It is a high priority 
and should be treated as such. 


15:11.260 --> 15:14.697
But remember 
the scripture we shared earlier, 


15:14.697 --> 15:16.932
Proverbs 21:5? 


15:16.932 --> 15:20.235
This principle should be implemented. 


15:20.235 --> 15:23.138
The last part of the verse 


15:23.138 --> 15:26.241
warns us not to be “hasty.” 


15:26.242 --> 15:31.114
Hasty is not synonymous with punctuality. 


15:31.113 --> 15:34.516
Instead, 
the first part of the verse indicates 


15:34.517 --> 15:39.422
we should prepare or plan the visit first. 


15:39.422 --> 15:43.059
Then follow through without procrastinating. 


15:43.058 --> 15:48.763
It said this approach will “lead to success.” 


15:48.763 --> 15:52.233
What is the success we are seeking? 


15:52.233 --> 15:56.805
Jesus did not say to justify our position 


15:56.805 --> 15:59.408
or to point out the flaw 


15:59.408 --> 16:02.811
in the other person’s words or actions. 


16:02.812 --> 16:06.082
No, he said you would be successful 


16:06.082 --> 16:10.419
if you 
“make your peace with your brother.”


16:10.418 --> 16:13.255
Punctuality is a godly quality 


16:13.255 --> 16:16.625
that we should strive to cultivate. 


16:16.625 --> 16:19.762
Another aspect of punctuality 


16:19.762 --> 16:22.630
is ending an assignment on time. 


16:22.630 --> 16:24.833
In the interest of punctuality, 


16:24.833 --> 16:28.736
let’s move on 
to the next segment of our program.


16:28.737 --> 16:30.739
Thank you, Brother Herd. 


16:30.738 --> 16:34.343
You are teaching by example
—we appreciate that! 


16:34.343 --> 16:36.745
And—
On the subject of punctuality, 


16:36.745 --> 16:38.747
we wanted to share an example 


16:38.747 --> 16:41.684
of how ingrained a problem can become 


16:41.683 --> 16:43.685
if we let it fester. 


16:43.685 --> 16:45.853
Meet Brother Peter Zak. 


16:45.853 --> 16:48.023
As he relates his story, 


16:48.023 --> 16:50.525
look for ways punctuality, 


16:50.525 --> 16:53.062
or promptly addressing matters, 


16:53.062 --> 16:55.264
could have helped him to minimize 


16:55.263 --> 16:58.000
the effects of the problem.


17:00.202 --> 17:04.105
I was born in Poland, 
and when I was about five years old, 


17:04.105 --> 17:06.542
my family immigrated to Canada.


17:06.542 --> 17:10.012
I feel that from a young age 
I really loved Jehovah. 


17:10.012 --> 17:12.214
I had a good relationship with him. 


17:12.213 --> 17:16.000
I enjoyed going in field service; 
I enjoyed the congregation.


17:17.452 --> 17:22.290
But like all youths, 
I had my distractions, you could say. 


17:22.290 --> 17:25.560
And for me, in particular, 
it was video games.


17:25.560 --> 17:29.665
I remember in the beginning 
even my parents would set some rules. 


17:29.665 --> 17:32.033
But as I kept progressing 
in that game 


17:32.033 --> 17:34.201
and I started participating 
in tournaments,


17:34.202 --> 17:36.539
I started getting recognized 
and admired. 


17:36.538 --> 17:39.000
It started becoming a temptation.


17:41.843 --> 17:44.846
People would go to download 
my previously played games 


17:44.847 --> 17:47.415
to study my techniques 
and my strategies. 


17:47.415 --> 17:49.685
I was interviewed by different websites. 


17:49.685 --> 17:51.720
People wanted to be on my team. 


17:51.720 --> 17:55.000
I could see that this world 
was slowly dragging me in.


17:56.558 --> 18:00.795
For example, there was 
a huge tournament that I participated in. 


18:00.795 --> 18:04.365
I finished very well
—received many prizes. 


18:04.365 --> 18:07.068
And then after that tournament, 
there was another tournament, 


18:07.068 --> 18:10.338
even bigger, with huge prizes
—cash prizes—


18:10.338 --> 18:12.373
a competition for all the best players 
in the world. 


18:12.373 --> 18:15.376
At this time, also, 
the website was growing. 


18:15.377 --> 18:18.214
We were just sponsored to produce
our own tournament  


18:18.213 --> 18:20.248
with cash prizes for the players. 


18:20.248 --> 18:23.418
So I really thought that this would be 
an opportunity for me 


18:23.418 --> 18:26.421
to maybe have a career 
and maybe to support myself 


18:26.422 --> 18:28.724
in the future 
if I wanted to pioneer. 


18:28.723 --> 18:31.000
And I thought 
that this was a realistic goal.


18:32.460 --> 18:37.032
But as the website also kept progressing 
and as I got more involved with it, 


18:37.032 --> 18:39.434
I realized that what I was exposed to 


18:39.433 --> 18:43.938
was very, very, dangerous
—very harmful. 


18:43.938 --> 18:48.000
They were immoral, 
wicked, improper things.


18:50.112 --> 18:52.949
I was going to the meetings, 
and I was going in service; 


18:52.948 --> 18:56.151
but at the same time, all my other time 
was spent on this video game. 


18:56.152 --> 18:59.555
But it was only slowly, 
over time, I started realizing 


18:59.555 --> 19:03.125
that it was having 
a very negative effect on my spirituality.


19:03.125 --> 19:05.960
I noticed that when I was in service, 


19:05.960 --> 19:08.263
I would think only about the video game. 


19:08.263 --> 19:12.333
When the service was over, 
I would rush home to play the video game. 


19:12.333 --> 19:14.268
Even at meetings— 
I would attend all my meetings, 


19:14.268 --> 19:16.605
but I would sit there 
and nothing was coming in. 


19:16.605 --> 19:19.440
I went there in person, 
but my mind wasn’t there. 


19:19.440 --> 19:22.000
So that also started bothering me.


19:23.578 --> 19:27.248
And at this time, 
my older brothers


19:27.248 --> 19:29.918
—who were always 
a good example to me—


19:29.918 --> 19:32.486
they quit playing games. 


19:32.487 --> 19:35.224
They were making improvement 
in the congregation; 


19:35.223 --> 19:37.791
they were having privileges, 


19:37.792 --> 19:40.095
working hard for the brothers 
and sisters in our congregation. 


19:40.095 --> 19:42.097
I could see they were so happy. 


19:42.097 --> 19:45.167
They had the real joy 
and satisfaction. 


19:45.167 --> 19:48.170
But for me, I didn’t; 


19:48.170 --> 19:51.172
I was always feeling empty inside. 


19:51.172 --> 19:53.009
I needed to change.


19:53.008 --> 19:56.411
And I remember, in particular, 
one day at the back of the Kingdom Hall, 


19:56.412 --> 19:58.980
the brother—an elder—who studied 
with me and my two brothers 


19:58.980 --> 20:00.748
approached me; 


20:00.748 --> 20:03.751
and he very reasonably talked to me 


20:03.752 --> 20:06.989
about my future.


20:06.988 --> 20:10.158
He also helped me see 
my brothers 


20:10.158 --> 20:12.226
and how they stopped, 
and they were so happy. 


20:12.227 --> 20:14.229
And I could see the difference. 


20:14.228 --> 20:16.731
I was serving 
two masters at the same time, 


20:16.732 --> 20:19.000
but I was really losing out 
with Jehovah.


20:24.873 --> 20:29.010
So I knew I had 
to make drastic changes in my life. 


20:29.010 --> 20:33.782
Up until then, I did try a few times 
to stop playing video games. 


20:33.782 --> 20:36.585
And it worked for a couple of days, 
but I got right back into it. 


20:36.585 --> 20:40.000
I lacked self-control.


20:43.425 --> 20:46.695
So I realized that for me— 
If I wanted to stop this, 


20:46.695 --> 20:50.198
I needed to make 
a complete stop of everything. 


20:50.198 --> 20:52.100
So I prayed about it. 


20:52.100 --> 20:54.002
I asked Jehovah 
for help and for strength 


20:54.002 --> 20:56.739
to give me the courage 
to take this action. 


20:56.738 --> 21:00.241
We took down the website, 
deleted the games, 


21:00.242 --> 21:02.777
stopped playing the games, 
and just made 


21:02.777 --> 21:05.214
a clean sweep—clean stop. 


21:05.213 --> 21:07.715
And I knew I needed that.


21:07.715 --> 21:10.000
Right after, 
I felt like a load was lifted.


21:14.790 --> 21:17.158
I had all this time 
now I could spend, 


21:17.158 --> 21:19.393
and I was spending it 
more in the ministry 


21:19.393 --> 21:21.161
and in the congregation. 


21:21.162 --> 21:23.499
So, soon after, 
I started auxiliary pioneering 


21:23.498 --> 21:25.233
and then regular pioneering. 


21:25.233 --> 21:27.301
I started doing a lot more 
in the congregation. 


21:27.302 --> 21:29.304
I could see how happy I was. 


21:29.303 --> 21:31.306
It was bringing me real joy


21:31.307 --> 21:33.309
—satisfaction.


21:33.308 --> 21:35.910
So I remember 
after pioneering for a few years, 


21:35.910 --> 21:38.147
I started learning a foreign language. 


21:38.147 --> 21:40.249
It was challenging, 
but it was exciting. 


21:40.248 --> 21:44.051
I moved to another city
to expand my ministry; 


21:44.052 --> 21:46.120
then I moved to another country. 


21:46.120 --> 21:48.590
And I remember just studying 
with people 


21:48.590 --> 21:51.760
as a need-greater 
and just seeing them 


21:51.760 --> 21:54.763
progress and seeing how they 
made changes in their lives 


21:54.763 --> 21:58.000
and how they started 
having a relationship with Jehovah. 


21:58.000 --> 22:00.902
And that I was being used 
to help them to get to that point 


22:00.902 --> 22:03.000
was such an amazing feeling.


22:06.642 --> 22:09.144
Now I have the privilege 
of serving at Bethel. 


22:09.143 --> 22:11.580
And I can see 
Jehovah’s hand in my life, 


22:11.580 --> 22:15.000
and also I’m able 
to give every day to him.


22:28.297 --> 22:31.299
This is the joy that I was looking for. 


22:31.298 --> 22:35.470
So I would definitely 
encourage all young ones 


22:35.470 --> 22:38.340
to really test out Jehovah. 


22:38.340 --> 22:40.275
It’s like Ecclesiastes 12:1, 


22:40.275 --> 22:42.277
my favorite scripture growing up. 


22:42.277 --> 22:45.147
Just give to Jehovah; 
test him out; give him your everything. 


22:45.147 --> 22:48.150
And you will see 
that you’ll have no regrets. 


22:48.150 --> 22:52.000
You’ll have true satisfaction 
from serving him.


22:56.525 --> 22:58.860
When should Peter 
have considered limiting 


22:58.860 --> 23:01.497
his preoccupation 
with video games? 


23:01.497 --> 23:04.834
Video and computer games 
in themselves are not wrong 


23:04.833 --> 23:07.335
unless they are 
about things Jehovah hates. 


23:07.335 --> 23:11.005
But did you notice that Peter 
explained that there was a point 


23:11.005 --> 23:13.642
when the games 
became a temptation? 


23:13.642 --> 23:18.314
That is, the games were no longer 
merely occasional entertainment 


23:18.313 --> 23:21.048
but started to become 
the center of his life. 


23:21.048 --> 23:24.585
That was the warning 
for him to sit down 


23:24.585 --> 23:29.290
and review how much time and effort 
he should be spending on video games. 


23:29.290 --> 23:31.292
But he didn’t. 


23:31.292 --> 23:33.462
He did not address the matter promptly. 


23:33.462 --> 23:38.234
As a result, 
he later had to admit that all he thought of, 


23:38.233 --> 23:42.603
even at the meetings or in the ministry, 
was video games. 


23:42.603 --> 23:44.605
Despite the mistake, 


23:44.605 --> 23:48.877
Peter wisely applied 
the words of Matthew 5:30: 


23:48.877 --> 23:52.314
“Also, if your right hand 
is making you stumble, 


23:52.313 --> 23:54.983
cut it off 
and throw it away from you.” 


23:54.983 --> 23:59.921
While he did not need to literally cut off 
his mouse-clicking right hand, 


23:59.922 --> 24:04.000
he got rid of anything that caused 
the temptation in the first place.


24:05.860 --> 24:09.297
If you are a parent, 
you have a responsibility 


24:09.297 --> 24:13.435
to help your children 
address any concerns that may arise. 


24:13.435 --> 24:15.570
You need to know 
what they are doing, 


24:15.570 --> 24:20.000
and then lovingly guide them 
based on Biblical principles. 


24:21.408 --> 24:24.745
Acting promptly when you 
sense a problem is building up 


24:24.745 --> 24:28.115
is equally important 
in other aspects of life. 


24:28.115 --> 24:34.000
This dramatization highlights 
how we can do so when married.


24:41.128 --> 24:45.000
We do have good friends 
in our congregation, 


24:46.702 --> 24:49.000
but there is so much work!


24:59.413 --> 25:02.000
Why is Jessica so upset? 


25:03.518 --> 25:08.490
OK, maybe I should’ve asked 
before turning down that dinner invite, 


25:08.490 --> 25:11.727
but she knows how busy I am. 


25:11.727 --> 25:14.864
I’ve got elder’s meetings, work, 


25:14.863 --> 25:17.000
pioneering. 


25:20.535 --> 25:24.000
But she just says 
we never do anything fun anymore.


25:30.578 --> 25:33.515
Maybe she’s right. 


25:33.515 --> 25:37.000
Sometimes even when we’re together, 


25:38.118 --> 25:42.000
we’re not really together.


25:58.240 --> 26:02.000
Our lives are filled 
with spiritual activities 


26:08.717 --> 26:13.000
but our family worship 
hasn’t exactly been regular.


26:24.298 --> 26:26.835
Maybe I fooled myself 
into thinking 


26:26.835 --> 26:29.537
that because we’re busy 
doing things for Jehovah,


26:29.537 --> 26:33.000
it’s OK to skip it sometimes.


26:42.583 --> 26:46.000
We argued again tonight 


26:47.788 --> 26:50.558
and then went to bed angry


26:50.558 --> 26:54.000
—something we said we’d never do.


27:14.983 --> 27:18.986
The next morning 
I told Jessica how sorry I was, 


27:18.987 --> 27:22.190
and she admitted 
that she felt bad too. 


27:22.190 --> 27:25.360
We decided to research 
Ephesians chapter 4 


27:25.360 --> 27:27.362
that night for family worship. 


27:27.362 --> 27:29.364
One article mentioned: 


27:29.363 --> 27:33.033
“How sad it would be 
if marriage mates spoke to each other 


27:33.033 --> 27:35.503
with less respect than . . . 
total strangers!”


27:35.503 --> 27:39.740
That really struck us. 


27:39.740 --> 27:43.000
Then we read 
Ephesians 4:31, 32: 


27:44.712 --> 27:48.182
“Put away from yourselves 
every kind of malicious bitterness, 


27:48.182 --> 27:51.652
“anger, wrath, screaming, 
and abusive speech, 


27:51.652 --> 27:53.789
“as well as everything injurious. 


27:53.788 --> 27:56.891
“But become kind to one another, 


27:56.892 --> 28:00.429
“tenderly compassionate, 
freely forgiving one another 


28:00.428 --> 28:04.000
just as God also by Christ 
freely forgave you.”


28:05.900 --> 28:09.570
We both promised to work 
on making our words and tone 


28:09.570 --> 28:12.000
more loving and kind. 


28:13.040 --> 28:17.012
We also studied the Bible accounts
of Aquila and Priscilla, 


28:17.012 --> 28:19.214
who were a beautiful example 
of what it means 


28:19.213 --> 28:21.883
for a married couple 
to be “one flesh.” 


28:21.883 --> 28:25.586
They were together at home, 
at work, 


28:25.587 --> 28:28.000
and in the ministry.


28:37.432 --> 28:42.000
That’s when we realized 
we needed to draw closer as a couple.


28:51.112 --> 28:54.000
Since then, 
we do as much as we can together.


29:03.625 --> 29:06.000
We’re still busy 
in spiritual activities, 


29:08.262 --> 29:12.000
but they’re never an excuse 
to neglect our relationship.


29:14.835 --> 29:19.573
And now we aren’t just marriage mates; 


29:19.573 --> 29:23.000
we’re once again best friends.


29:25.513 --> 29:30.016
As this dramatization 
and the example of Peter Zak showed, 


29:30.017 --> 29:33.354
whenever you sense a problem, 
address it! 


29:33.353 --> 29:35.390
Do not procrastinate. 


29:35.390 --> 29:37.158
Be punctual.


29:37.158 --> 29:39.826
At times, 
world events may highlight 


29:39.827 --> 29:41.864
the importance of being punctual. 


29:41.863 --> 29:45.333
In May of last year, 
a wildfire overtook 


29:45.333 --> 29:49.303
the Canadian city of Fort McMurray, 
in the province of Alberta. 


29:49.303 --> 29:53.006
The brothers and sisters 
there benefited from promptly 


29:53.007 --> 29:55.677
following the direction 
they had received 


29:55.677 --> 29:58.000
from their local congregations.


30:06.187 --> 30:08.524
There was a local needs part, 


30:08.523 --> 30:10.558
and we try to do it every year, 


30:10.558 --> 30:12.726
and this year 
it was at the perfect time 


30:12.727 --> 30:14.829
because the next week 
we had the fire. 


30:14.828 --> 30:16.865
And when the brother 
was reviewing, 


30:16.865 --> 30:19.633
he was saying it was 
a high fire-hazard year, 


30:19.633 --> 30:21.168
so be prepared. 


30:21.168 --> 30:23.538
And it was nice 
that the brothers were so obedient 


30:23.538 --> 30:26.000
and took that to heart and were ready.


30:27.708 --> 30:30.178
It happened so quickly, 


30:30.178 --> 30:32.980
from being fine and safe 
to ‘We got to get out of here.’


30:32.980 --> 30:35.983
We started to hear 
the municipality saying 


30:35.983 --> 30:37.818
there are mandatory evacuations 


30:37.818 --> 30:39.820
for different neighborhoods. 


30:39.820 --> 30:43.190
So within noon, two o’clock, four o’clock, 


30:43.190 --> 30:46.060
90,000 people are in motion.


30:46.060 --> 30:48.462
When you were standing outside, 
you could hear the helicopters going, 


30:48.462 --> 30:49.764
the sirens going. 


30:49.763 --> 30:51.900
The smoke was so thick and intense.


30:51.900 --> 30:54.435
Both the left and the right 
were all in flames; 


30:54.435 --> 30:57.272
it was totally in flames. 


30:57.272 --> 30:59.774
Ugh, it was chaotic.


30:59.773 --> 31:01.976
People running to their cars, 
seeing and looking 


31:01.977 --> 31:04.212
at the big cloud of smoke 
approaching them 


31:04.212 --> 31:07.849
and just the fright in their eyes.


31:07.848 --> 31:09.850
It just came to mind: 


31:09.850 --> 31:12.020
During the local needs, 
the brothers said, 


31:12.020 --> 31:14.622
“If in case of an emergency, 
you have to follow directions. 


31:14.622 --> 31:16.857
“Listen to the local authorities 


31:16.857 --> 31:19.000
and listen to your local elders.”


31:20.762 --> 31:23.497
Each elder 
for the field service groups 


31:23.497 --> 31:27.069
had to care 
for a small amount of people.


31:27.068 --> 31:29.036
I was calling 
all the brothers and sisters 


31:29.037 --> 31:31.739
that I could to find out 


31:31.738 --> 31:33.675
where they were and if they were safe.


31:33.675 --> 31:36.177
Every group overseer knew exactly 


31:36.177 --> 31:38.980
where everybody in his group 
was at all times.


31:38.980 --> 31:41.917
One brother came 
to help my wife and the kids 


31:41.917 --> 31:44.885
to evacuate while I was at work. 


31:44.885 --> 31:48.022
So I felt very indebted 
to this brother


31:48.022 --> 31:51.492
—that he acted in my behalf 
to get my family to a safe place.


31:51.492 --> 31:56.000
To see the brothers OK and calm, 
it makes me calm.


31:59.267 --> 32:01.269
It’s all gone, 


32:01.268 --> 32:04.071
and it went away overnight. 


32:04.072 --> 32:07.775
If we are to put 
our trust in such things— 


32:07.775 --> 32:10.000
Where are they now?


32:12.680 --> 32:15.517
Although we’ve lost all this, 


32:15.517 --> 32:19.000
our relationship with Jehovah
—we haven’t lost that.


32:22.890 --> 32:25.092
We can’t salvage nothing .


32:25.092 --> 32:26.160
Yeah.


32:26.160 --> 32:29.497
Everything is gone.
Gone—everything is gone. 


32:29.497 --> 32:31.932
Yeah, this is our basement. 


32:31.932 --> 32:36.104
People are always asking us, like, 
“Did you lose your home?” 


32:36.103 --> 32:37.938
And we’re like, “Yeah, we did.”


32:37.938 --> 32:41.000
Seeing how quickly things can go, 
how things can disappear, 


32:43.043 --> 32:47.215
it helps you appreciate the things 
that are most important. 


32:47.215 --> 32:49.850
And not only 
do we have our own lives


32:49.850 --> 32:51.952
but we still have 
our brothers and sisters 


32:51.952 --> 32:54.000
there with us.


32:56.390 --> 32:58.392
When we escaped 


32:58.392 --> 33:01.195
and moved to Edmonton, 


33:01.195 --> 33:04.965
which is about 
a four-and-a-half-hour drive from here, 


33:04.965 --> 33:07.335
the friends opened their homes to us 


33:07.335 --> 33:09.370
in the middle of the night
—2:30 a.m.—


33:09.370 --> 33:10.505
and welcomed us. 


33:10.505 --> 33:12.907
They gave us food; 
they gave us clothing; 


33:12.907 --> 33:15.777
they gave us a place to stay. 


33:15.777 --> 33:17.945
That kind of hospitality 
really touched our heart. 


33:17.945 --> 33:20.000
We realized that we 
hadn’t missed anything.


33:32.093 --> 33:34.328
Some of the friends, 
we haven’t seen them 


33:34.328 --> 33:36.563
since the disaster occurred 


33:36.563 --> 33:38.700
and to meet the friends again


33:38.700 --> 33:41.468
—you know, about a month 
and a half after the disaster—


33:41.468 --> 33:44.000
at the convention 
was really, really encouraging.


33:45.440 --> 33:47.908
We see brothers that are working 
with different departments 


33:47.908 --> 33:51.111
here at the convention 
and also with the disaster relief committee 


33:51.112 --> 33:53.147
who have no home to go back to. 


33:53.147 --> 33:55.049
Yet, they’re so concerned 
about someone else 


33:55.048 --> 33:58.000
that they don’t even think about 
what they’ve really lost.


33:59.453 --> 34:02.056
Although we’ve lost 
everything materially, 


34:02.057 --> 34:05.259
we have everything spiritually. 


34:05.258 --> 34:08.028
What is gone is gone. 


34:08.028 --> 34:12.000
What is important is our lives 
and our relationship with Jehovah.


34:31.685 --> 34:34.788
The local needs part 
proved very helpful 


34:34.788 --> 34:37.291
for our brothers and sisters 
in Fort McMurray. 


34:37.292 --> 34:40.895
The part included direction 
about having a “go bag” 


34:40.895 --> 34:44.298
and keeping the gas tanks 
of their vehicles full. 


34:44.298 --> 34:46.833
Because of the distance 
to the nearest town 


34:46.833 --> 34:49.403
and the heavy traffic 
during the evacuation, 


34:49.403 --> 34:53.673
having a full tank of gas 
proved to be very timely advice. 


34:53.673 --> 34:55.810
Instead of procrastinating, 


34:55.810 --> 34:59.347
our brothers and sisters 
in Alberta followed the direction, 


34:59.347 --> 35:01.782
to their benefit.


35:01.782 --> 35:05.787
Although our circumstances 
may not be as extreme, 


35:05.787 --> 35:09.690
we all experience 
challenging situations every now and then. 


35:09.690 --> 35:13.160
The need to be punctual always applies. 


35:13.160 --> 35:15.162
For example, 


35:15.162 --> 35:18.099
there is no need to wait 
for perfect circumstances 


35:18.098 --> 35:20.568
before expanding our ministry. 


35:20.568 --> 35:23.336
For some, 
expanding our ministry 


35:23.337 --> 35:27.175
could mean taking the leap 
into full-time service. 


35:27.175 --> 35:29.743
Two families did just that 


35:29.743 --> 35:34.000
in this music video 
entitled Let’s Take the Leap.


35:45.392 --> 35:52.234
To serve full-time,
That’s been our goal.


35:52.233 --> 35:58.671
It opens up
More ways to serve whole-souled.


35:58.672 --> 36:05.145
So if not now
And if not here,


36:05.145 --> 36:11.618
This chance might slip away
And disappear.


36:11.618 --> 36:17.991
Let’s take the leap;
Let’s not hold back.


36:17.992 --> 36:24.465
Let’s not give in to doubt;
Let’s not miss out.


36:24.465 --> 36:30.972
We’ll go in faith,
Not looking back, not behind.


36:30.972 --> 36:40.000
Let’s look ahead
With peace of mind.


36:50.558 --> 36:56.396
Jehovah knows;
Jehovah sees.


36:56.397 --> 37:03.137
Before we ask,
He knows the needs of each.


37:03.137 --> 37:09.577
Though it might seem
Beyond our reach,


37:09.577 --> 37:15.884
Let’s put our trust in him
And take the leap.


37:15.883 --> 37:22.256
Let’s take the leap;
Let’s not hold back.


37:22.257 --> 37:28.829
Let’s not give in to doubt;
Let’s not miss out.


37:28.828 --> 37:35.501
We’ll go in faith,
Not looking back, not behind.


37:35.502 --> 37:46.000
Let’s look ahead
With peace of mind.


37:48.215 --> 37:54.422
So let’s go through
This open door.


37:54.422 --> 38:01.129
Things left behind
Will be replaced and more,


38:01.128 --> 38:08.235
Not only now
But all that God has in store—


38:08.235 --> 38:13.907
The life to come
Forevermore.


38:13.907 --> 38:19.814
Let’s take the leap;
Let’s not hold back.


38:19.813 --> 38:26.786
Let’s not give in to doubt;
Let’s not miss out.


38:26.787 --> 38:33.327
We’ll go in faith,
Not looking back and not behind.


38:33.327 --> 38:44.000
Let’s look ahead
With peace of mind.


38:46.240 --> 38:52.547
Let’s take the leap;
Let’s not hold back.


38:52.547 --> 38:59.020
Let’s not give in to doubt;
Let’s not miss out.


38:59.020 --> 39:05.625
We’ll go in faith,
Not looking back and not behind.


39:05.625 --> 39:17.000
Let’s look ahead
With peace of mind.


39:24.645 --> 39:31.000
Let’s take the leap.


39:34.322 --> 39:37.425
Expanding our ministry 
in whatever form 


39:37.425 --> 39:41.028
can bring us great joy 
as servants of Jehovah. 


39:41.028 --> 39:43.063
Even if your circumstances today 


39:43.063 --> 39:45.766
do not allow you 
to enter the full-time service, 


39:45.767 --> 39:48.819
there is plenty to do.


39:48.818 --> 39:52.590
Our brothers and sisters in Brazil 
experienced an opportunity 


39:52.590 --> 39:55.292
to make special efforts 
in their preaching work 


39:55.292 --> 39:59.197
when the Olympic 
and Paralympic Games were held there 


39:59.197 --> 40:02.467
in August and September of 2016. 


40:02.467 --> 40:05.302
Close to 15,000 athletes 


40:05.302 --> 40:08.139
from approximately 205 countries 


40:08.138 --> 40:12.000
were present along with many visitors.


40:20.283 --> 40:22.420
More than one million tourists 


40:22.420 --> 40:24.955
were present at the Olympic Games 
in Rio de Janeiro, 


40:24.955 --> 40:29.000
and among them 
were around 410,000 foreigners. 


40:30.795 --> 40:33.297
In an effort to teach 
these ones about the Bible, 


40:33.297 --> 40:38.000
Jehovah’s Witnesses engaged 
in a special public witnessing campaign.


40:39.970 --> 40:44.442
To reach as many people as possible, 
we set up 268 carts, 


40:44.442 --> 40:46.444
not only where the games were held 


40:46.443 --> 40:49.011
but also throughout the city 
of Rio de Janeiro. 


40:49.012 --> 40:51.049
That way, we were able to reach people 


40:51.048 --> 40:54.218
from even faraway islands like Vanuatu, 


40:54.218 --> 40:57.053
which is one of the islands of the Pacific. 


40:57.053 --> 41:00.000
Delegates from that island picked up 
publications from our witnessing carts.


41:10.200 --> 41:12.770
We made efforts to put the stands and carts 


41:12.770 --> 41:15.000
as close as possible to the places 
where the brothers would work. 


41:16.973 --> 41:20.878
Thanks to Jehovah, we were able 
to get a strategic location near the entrance 


41:20.878 --> 41:25.000
to the arenas, 
which we didn’t think would be possible.


41:27.985 --> 41:30.855
We planned to have 1,500 volunteers, 


41:30.855 --> 41:33.557
but we got 4,000 volunteers. 


41:33.557 --> 41:35.559
We asked for help from other cities, 


41:35.558 --> 41:38.000
other states, and also 
from foreign-language congregations. 


41:39.663 --> 41:43.000
So for us, 
this was beyond our expectations.


41:45.568 --> 41:47.838
During the Olympics, 
more than one million people 


41:47.838 --> 41:49.840
passed through the harbor here. 


41:49.840 --> 41:52.208
And thanks to Jehovah, 
we were able to set up 


41:52.208 --> 41:55.111
more than 40 carts 
in the immediate harbor area 


41:55.112 --> 41:58.382
and placed almost 
20,000 pieces of literature. 


41:58.382 --> 42:00.750
To refill the carts, we used a quadricycle 


42:00.750 --> 42:03.587
that picked up the publications 
at the support hub 


42:03.587 --> 42:09.494
and took them to the brothers 
at the carts.


42:09.493 --> 42:11.561
The media provided extensive coverage 


42:11.562 --> 42:14.865
with more than 26,000 
press professionals involved, 


42:14.865 --> 42:16.867
and security was also reinforced 


42:16.867 --> 42:19.770
with more than 22,000 military personnel. 


42:19.770 --> 42:23.000
The work of our brothers 
certainly did not go unnoticed.


42:27.110 --> 42:30.347
We were at the cart 
when suddenly a police car 


42:30.347 --> 42:32.482
full of officers stopped in front of us. 


42:32.482 --> 42:35.920
I was worried they were going 
to ask us questions or make us leave. 


42:35.920 --> 42:39.088
But then they got out of the car 
and came towards us. 


42:39.088 --> 42:41.425
And one of them 
picked up the Bible Teach book, 


42:41.425 --> 42:44.828
and without saying anything to us, 
he told the others: 


42:44.828 --> 42:47.565
“Didn’t I tell you 
I was going to find them here? 


42:47.565 --> 42:50.667
“You can take these publications; 
they’re free. 


42:50.667 --> 42:53.000
These books will teach you 
amazing things!”


43:00.510 --> 43:03.313
This campaign helped 
to overcome prejudices, 


43:03.313 --> 43:06.216
both with the authorities 
and people in general, 


43:06.217 --> 43:09.554
because they were able to see 
the international scope of our work. 


43:09.553 --> 43:12.856
And this became especially clear 
when it came to the officials 


43:12.857 --> 43:15.059
because they allowed 
the brothers to put the carts 


43:15.058 --> 43:16.926
as close as possible to the arenas 


43:16.927 --> 43:19.000
where the games were being held.


43:20.663 --> 43:24.768
In all, more than 85,000 publications 


43:24.768 --> 43:28.000
in more than ten languages 
were distributed by means of the 268 carts 


43:29.138 --> 43:31.541
scattered throughout the city. 


43:31.542 --> 43:34.345
Over a year of planning 
went into preparing for this event, 


43:34.345 --> 43:37.715
and it produced excellent results. 


43:37.715 --> 43:39.583
Our international preaching work 
was made known 


43:39.583 --> 43:41.685
to thousands present at the Olympic Games, 


43:41.685 --> 43:43.687
and most important, 


43:43.687 --> 43:48.000
it gave a great shout of praise 
to our God, Jehovah.


43:56.300 --> 43:58.635
We wanted to share a portrayal of life 


43:58.635 --> 44:01.572
as a Witness back in the early 1900’s. 


44:01.572 --> 44:04.207
This unique dramatization 


44:04.207 --> 44:07.110
about the endurance needed 
as a Kingdom proclaimer 


44:07.110 --> 44:11.582
was previously shown to delegates 
at some international conventions 


44:11.582 --> 44:14.552
held in one city in 2014. 


44:14.552 --> 44:16.887
This is a gift video that we received. 


44:16.887 --> 44:19.000
The title is 
Knock! Knock!


50:30.293 --> 50:32.328
Where are the dead? 


50:32.328 --> 50:36.131
Would you wish that question 
answered according to man’s theory 


50:36.132 --> 50:38.802
or to have the answer 
as pointed out in the Bible? 


50:38.802 --> 50:42.939
You will say that man’s answer 
would be only a guess. 


50:42.938 --> 50:46.810
And yet there is no truth 
more clearly taught in the Bible 


50:46.810 --> 50:49.747
than that of the resurrection of the dead.


50:49.747 --> 50:52.449
If the dead are to live again, 


50:52.448 --> 50:54.483
then they must be resurrected, 


50:54.483 --> 50:57.953
and God has provided 
that there shall be a resurrection.


50:57.953 --> 51:01.323
The resurrection of Jesus Christ 
is a guarantee 


51:01.323 --> 51:04.895
that all who have died 
must be awakened out of death 


51:04.895 --> 51:07.000
and given a knowledge of the truth.


51:08.165 --> 51:11.000
All mankind were born in sin, 


51:11.000 --> 51:13.103
and the death of the perfect man Jesus 


51:13.103 --> 51:16.105
provided the purchase price 
for the right of man to live again, 


51:16.105 --> 51:20.910
and in due time Jesus 
will awaken them out of death. 


51:20.910 --> 51:25.000
All of the dead in God’s due time 
shall be awakened out of death.


51:26.415 --> 51:28.885
“And God shall wipe away 
all tears from their eyes; 


51:28.885 --> 51:30.853
“and there shall be no more death, 


51:30.853 --> 51:33.790
“neither sorrow, nor crying, 
neither shall there be any more pain: 


51:33.790 --> 51:37.927
for the former things are passed away.”


51:37.927 --> 51:41.264
The resurrection 
will bring boundless joy to those  


51:41.263 --> 51:43.800
who obey God under Christ’s Kingdom. 


51:43.800 --> 51:47.137
The obedient ones on earth 
during the reign of Christ 


51:47.137 --> 51:52.000
will be given everlasting life on the earth 
in complete happiness and joy. 


51:53.543 --> 51:56.646
Jehovah’s way is always right and true. 


51:56.647 --> 51:59.000
Learn that way and live.


52:04.087 --> 52:08.057
The word “resurrection” 
means “a standing up again” to life. 


52:08.057 --> 52:10.360
If, as claimed by the clergy, 


52:10.360 --> 52:13.697
the dead are alive in purgatory 
or some other place, 


52:13.697 --> 52:16.500
then it follows 
that there could be no resurrection; 


52:16.500 --> 52:20.000
and yet there is no truth more clearly taught 
in the Bible than that of the . . .


53:05.865 --> 53:09.802
The brother was blessed 
for his perseverance in the ministry. 


53:09.802 --> 53:13.874
His attitude showed 
that he felt the urgency of the message. 


53:13.873 --> 53:17.076
As God’s people, 
we do not procrastinate. 


53:17.077 --> 53:21.732
Instead, we are prompt; 
we are punctual! 


53:21.732 --> 53:25.302
Yes, being punctual is a godly quality.


53:25.302 --> 53:28.305
We would like to conclude 
the broadcast with greetings 


53:28.305 --> 53:30.307
from Uganda


53:30.307 --> 53:34.000
—specifically the town of Fort Portal, 
in western Uganda. 


53:35.478 --> 53:39.148
The 120 publishers there preach 
to almost 60,000 people 


53:39.148 --> 53:41.150
who live in Fort Portal. 


53:41.150 --> 53:46.055
They conduct 
approximately 300 Bible studies. 


53:46.055 --> 53:51.527
There are two congregations
—one English and one Rutoro—


53:51.527 --> 53:53.564
and also two rural groups 


53:53.563 --> 53:58.801
some 60 kilometers, 
or approximately 37 miles, away. 


53:58.802 --> 54:01.304
Brothers are taking turns 
visiting the two groups 


54:01.303 --> 54:04.000
and supporting them 
in the field ministry.


54:05.520 --> 54:07.522
In the past, 
the main challenge 


54:07.522 --> 54:10.914
was the lack of literature 
in the Rutoro language. 


54:10.913 --> 54:13.983
However, 
thanks to increased translation efforts, 


54:13.983 --> 54:17.786
the number of publishers 
has increased dramatically. 


54:17.787 --> 54:22.809
As a result, a Rutoro congregation 
was formed in 2014. 


54:22.808 --> 54:27.596
Next, a remote translation office 
was established in 2015. 


54:27.597 --> 54:29.802
And as of February of this year, 


54:29.802 --> 54:34.000
the publishers receive the study edition 
of The Watchtower in Rutoro. 


54:35.238 --> 54:39.708
We love our brothers and sisters 
in Fort Portal very much. 


54:39.708 --> 54:43.000
And they send their love 
to all of God’s people worldwide. 


54:44.613 --> 54:46.783
This is JW Broadcasting 


54:46.783 --> 54:58.128
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
