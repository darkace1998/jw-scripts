Jehovah designed marriage

00:00:02.619 --> 00:00:05.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a beautiful and rewarding relationship

00:00:05.522 --> 00:00:07.524 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
between a husband and a wife.

00:00:07.524 --> 00:00:08.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When a husband and wife

00:00:08.992 --> 00:00:10.727 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
fulfill their God-given roles

00:00:10.727 --> 00:00:12.262 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and they treat each other

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:13.997 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with love and respect,

00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their marriage is a wonderful
and intimate friendship.

00:00:17.567 --> 00:00:20.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A marriage that has good patterns

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shaped by Jehovah’s principles

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:26.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looks like this well-balanced family circle.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if a married couple over time

00:00:28.511 --> 00:00:32.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has set bad patterns
in how they deal with each other,

00:00:32.182 --> 00:00:34.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is often the result.

00:00:34.184 --> 00:00:37.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life is going to be a bit rough for them.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider what Jehovah says

00:00:39.522 --> 00:00:41.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the roles of husband and wife

00:00:41.524 --> 00:00:44.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then discuss how love and respect

00:00:44.861 --> 00:00:47.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are real keys to a happy marriage.

00:00:47.764 --> 00:00:50.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what roles did Jehovah give

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the man and woman in marriage?

00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:56.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah places the husband
as head of the family.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:00:59.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:23 says:

00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:02.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A husband is head of his wife.”

00:01:02.645 --> 00:01:06.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that means that the husband
makes final decisions for the family.

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:09.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And his decisions
will reflect his love for his wife,

00:01:09.786 --> 00:01:13.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his children,
and his understanding of their spiritual,

00:01:13.223 --> 00:01:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
physical, and emotional needs.

00:01:15.925 --> 00:01:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 11:3,

00:01:19.195 --> 00:01:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we get a sense, though, of how Jehovah feels
about the husband’s role.

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:26.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read this together,
I want you to imagine

00:01:26.236 --> 00:01:30.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah saying to husbands:
‘Yes, you’re head of the family.’

00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I want you to know that the head

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of every man is the Christ;

00:01:35.612 --> 00:01:38.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in turn, the head of a woman is the man.”

00:01:39.382 --> 00:01:42.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sounds a lot like a father-in-law
speaking to the groom:

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:44.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You can marry my daughter,

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:49.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you’d better treat her good
because you’re responsible to me.”

00:01:49.626 --> 00:01:53.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah is giving
a very clear message for husbands.

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:57.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will hold you accountable to him

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:59.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for how you treat your wife.

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s something for us husbands
to think about, isn’t it?

00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:05.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what about the role of a wife?

00:02:05.308 --> 00:02:09.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah assigned wives
as a beloved partner to her husband.

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as partners,
they can discuss important family matters

00:02:12.982 --> 00:02:16.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work together
to make their marriage a success.

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:20.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah placed the woman
under the headship of the man,

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:24.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as such,
her role is to be in subjection to him.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ephesians 5:22,

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:33.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it says: “Let wives be in subjection
to their husbands as to the Lord.”

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Subjection
—said a certain way, it almost sounds bad:

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:40.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have to be in subjection!”

00:02:40.043 --> 00:02:44.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is the subjection of a Christian wife
to a Christian husband a bad thing?

00:02:44.547 --> 00:02:46.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:02:46.382 --> 00:02:49.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, subjection as described in the Bible

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:51.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not about being subservient;

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:54.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s about her role in the marriage.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re partners,
each with a beautiful role to fulfill.

00:02:58.428 --> 00:03:01.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could illustrate it
with watching a couple ice skating.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As they move gracefully across the ice,
do you think to yourself,

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How come they never
let her hold him over her head?’

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.

00:03:12.642 --> 00:03:14.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look at him; you look at her.

00:03:14.644 --> 00:03:17.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s obvious
who should hold who over their head.

00:03:18.581 --> 00:03:23.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, just as we admire and respect
a woman’s role as an ice skating partner,

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:25.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a husband deeply loves and appreciates

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:28.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his wife’s role as his partner

00:03:28.124 --> 00:03:32.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they work gracefully together
to make their marriage a success.

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:37.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now that we’ve briefly reviewed
the roles for husbands and wives,

00:03:37.133 --> 00:03:40.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s read together
a key Scriptural principle

00:03:40.803 --> 00:03:43.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Ephesians 5:33

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:48.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that shows how Jehovah
wants husbands and wives

00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:50.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fulfill their roles in marriage.

00:03:50.813 --> 00:03:54.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:33:

00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:59.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Each one of you must love his wife
as he does himself;

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the other hand, the wife should have
deep respect for her husband.”

00:04:05.228 --> 00:04:07.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the obvious message in this scripture

00:04:07.397 --> 00:04:10.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that husbands should love their wives

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:13.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wives should respect their husbands.

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:16.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, there’s another way
to look at this scripture

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and learn something about husbands and wives.

00:04:19.742 --> 00:04:23.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God is telling us
what each mate needs.

00:04:23.579 --> 00:04:28.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men need respect, and women need love.

00:04:28.151 --> 00:04:31.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this is not to say
that men don’t need love

00:04:31.454 --> 00:04:34.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and women don’t need to be respected.

00:04:34.157 --> 00:04:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, it does mean that men

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:39.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tend to emphasize respect and status

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and women often emphasize

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
intimacy, connection, and love.

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:49.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This perfect principle
can help us to understand

00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:54.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why our husband or wife
may act or feel a certain way.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this difference in emphasis
affects many areas of married life.

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider three examples

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:06.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how this powerful Scriptural principle
of love and respect

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can give us insight
into how a husband and wife

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:12.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talk to each other,

00:05:12.362 --> 00:05:14.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they solve problems,

00:05:14.297 --> 00:05:16.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they act in the company of others.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:18.901 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider our first example:

00:05:18.901 --> 00:05:20.937 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how they talk to each other.

00:05:20.937 --> 00:05:23.172 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, since a wife’s emphasis

00:05:23.172 --> 00:05:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is on being loved,

00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:28.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
her conversations often stress friendship

00:05:28.478 --> 00:05:30.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and connection when she talks to her husband.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s eager to share
the details of her life with him

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in this way become closer to him.

00:05:36.652 --> 00:05:41.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She wants him, in turn, to share with her
the details of his day and life.

00:05:41.624 --> 00:05:44.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, your wife

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feels loved when you learn
to communicate with her

00:05:47.697 --> 00:05:51.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a way that tells her
you truly care about her.

00:05:52.368 --> 00:05:56.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She places great emphasis
on conversation and sharing her life with you

00:05:56.906 --> 00:06:00.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and likewise you sharing your life with her.

00:06:00.743 --> 00:06:03.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, a wife

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells her husband about something

00:06:05.648 --> 00:06:07.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that happened to her that day.

00:06:07.683 --> 00:06:10.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He grows impatient
with the story and interrupts

00:06:10.787 --> 00:06:14.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or changes the subject
or offers a quick solution.

00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:16.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does she feel?

00:06:16.893 --> 00:06:19.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why can’t he listen to the whole story?

00:06:19.429 --> 00:06:22.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has he lost interest in me?’

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:25.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s important that husbands give their wives

00:06:25.835 --> 00:06:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their full attention as they speak.

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:30.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a long day at work,

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:33.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his mind may be focused on events
that happened to him that day.

00:06:33.776 --> 00:06:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he may without realizing it

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:39.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel that the events
or conversation of his wife

00:06:39.916 --> 00:06:42.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
aren’t on important subjects.

00:06:42.318 --> 00:06:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he may be inclined
to play down the events in her life

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:47.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as unimportant, or trivial,

00:06:47.957 --> 00:06:51.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while events he talks
about are substantial and important

00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:53.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they happened to him.

00:06:53.596 --> 00:06:57.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, such a feeling over time
can truly discourage a wife.

00:06:57.733 --> 00:07:01.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A husband’s disinterest in her stories

00:07:01.137 --> 00:07:05.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and events of her life
feels a lot like disinterest in her.

00:07:07.176 --> 00:07:11.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The advice of Proverbs 20:5
is good for husbands.

00:07:12.014 --> 00:07:16.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “The thoughts of a man’s
[or we could say in this case, woman’s] heart

00:07:16.953 --> 00:07:19.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“are like deep waters,

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:22.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the discerning man draws them out.”

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:26.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s great advice for husbands.

00:07:26.496 --> 00:07:27.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, when you draw

00:07:27.897 --> 00:07:31.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your wife out,
let her speak from her heart.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:33.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s an indication of great love

00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:35.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and affection for your dear wife.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:40.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Men, on the other hand,
often view conversation differently.

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:43.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A husband comes home,
and his wife asks, “How was your day?”

00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:46.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “It was OK.
Nothing special.”

00:07:46.849 --> 00:07:50.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later that night
when they’re with a group of friends,

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:52.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he tells a story about what happened at work.

00:07:52.788 --> 00:07:54.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she wonders,

00:07:54.524 --> 00:07:58.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, why didn’t he tell me that
when I asked about his day?’

00:07:58.728 --> 00:08:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since a man’s emphasis is on respect,

00:08:02.465 --> 00:08:05.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they often use conversation

00:08:05.201 --> 00:08:08.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to establish respect and status with others.

00:08:08.237 --> 00:08:11.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A husband may feel
that his wife already respects him,

00:08:11.407 --> 00:08:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so there’s no need to tell her the story.

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:18.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wives, you can encourage your husband
to share his life with you

00:08:18.948 --> 00:08:21.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by being interested
in his work and activities.

00:08:21.551 --> 00:08:23.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you tell him, “Don’t talk to me

00:08:23.686 --> 00:08:26.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about all that work stuff with me,” he won’t

00:08:26.956 --> 00:08:31.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’ll cut yourself off
from a part of his life.

00:08:31.027 --> 00:08:34.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Show him that you’re proud
of what he does to support the family.

00:08:34.363 --> 00:08:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be interested in what happened to him,

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:40.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he feels about things,
or challenges that he overcame.

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:43.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While you may not find
his work all that interesting,

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:46.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember, it is important to him.

00:08:47.510 --> 00:08:49.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider our second example:

00:08:49.478 --> 00:08:51.514 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how they solve problems.

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I want you to imagine a husband and wife.

00:08:54.584 --> 00:08:56.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re in a car,
they’re looking for an address,

00:08:56.586 --> 00:08:58.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re lost.

00:08:58.588 --> 00:09:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the wife suggests
that they ask someone for directions.

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s thinking, ‘Why won’t he ask?’

00:09:06.195 --> 00:09:10.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s thinking,
‘Why can’t she just let me find it?’

00:09:10.399 --> 00:09:14.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see,
since the man’s emphasis is on respect,

00:09:14.403 --> 00:09:17.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s trying to avoid
looking lost to a stranger.

00:09:17.607 --> 00:09:21.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The act of asking someone else for directions

00:09:21.544 --> 00:09:25.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may make him feel
like he’s in a lower position.

00:09:25.281 --> 00:09:28.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finding their way is a challenge to him,

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:31.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants to show his wife
that he can find it on his own.

00:09:31.587 --> 00:09:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the woman,
such an idea may not come to mind.

00:09:35.124 --> 00:09:38.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She may view it as a simple interchange
between them and a stranger.

00:09:38.594 --> 00:09:41.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They get help and directions,
and they find out where they’re going.

00:09:42.932 --> 00:09:46.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 1 Corinthians 7:33,
Jehovah tells us:

00:09:47.703 --> 00:09:49.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But the married man is anxious . . . ,

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:53.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how he may gain the approval of his wife.”

00:09:53.676 --> 00:09:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wives, your husband is anxious
to have your approval and respect.

00:09:58.247 --> 00:10:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on balance, husbands have to be careful

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:05.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that an emphasis on respect
doesn’t become unreasonable.

00:10:05.288 --> 00:10:09.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It won’t hurt us
to ask for directions or help at times.

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:12.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, a wife needs to be careful

00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:15.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she doesn’t show impatience
by her words or tone

00:10:15.998 --> 00:10:19.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as her husband
works his way through a problem.

00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:22.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A wife who clearly understands
her husband’s desire

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to solve problems for the family

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:28.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will understand his actions
and will do her part to support him,

00:10:28.844 --> 00:10:31.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even in the little things around the home.

00:10:31.647 --> 00:10:34.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this support in the little areas of life

00:10:34.483 --> 00:10:37.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
builds his confidence in her support

00:10:37.486 --> 00:10:39.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and can be a major factor

00:10:39.522 --> 00:10:42.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whether a husband
takes the lead in larger matters.

00:10:43.926 --> 00:10:45.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our third and final example:

00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:48.964 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how they act in front of others.

00:10:49.999 --> 00:10:53.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever seen a couple
where one of them is telling a story

00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other
is constantly correcting the details?

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:00.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the husband
is trying to give some direction

00:11:00.843 --> 00:11:04.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the wife corrects
or challenges the direction?

00:11:04.146 --> 00:11:07.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the husband is telling others
some unflattering story

00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:10.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that hurts his wife’s feelings?

00:11:10.353 --> 00:11:13.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can Ephesians 5:33

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help a wife in these situations?

00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:20.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, since a husband’s emphasis
is on respect,

00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:22.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’ll be much more sensitive

00:11:22.698 --> 00:11:25.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to comments his wife may make
in front of others.

00:11:26.335 --> 00:11:29.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can hurt a husband deeply

00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:32.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when his wife openly challenges him
in front of others.

00:11:33.342 --> 00:11:36.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 31:12

00:11:36.412 --> 00:11:38.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has this advice for wives:

00:11:39.415 --> 00:11:42.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“She rewards him with good, not bad,

00:11:42.418 --> 00:11:44.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the days of her life.”

00:11:45.388 --> 00:11:48.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when in public or when others are around

00:11:48.357 --> 00:11:50.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—even close family and children—

00:11:50.426 --> 00:11:54.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try not to openly disagree
with him, correct him,

00:11:54.163 --> 00:11:56.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or attempt to take over what he’s doing.

00:11:56.665 --> 00:11:59.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How you speak to your husband
in front of others

00:11:59.769 --> 00:12:03.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a great way
to show your deep respect for him.

00:12:03.839 --> 00:12:08.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also builds respect for him in others,
including any children in the family.

00:12:10.379 --> 00:12:12.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, how can Ephesians 5:33

00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:16.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help a husband act in front of others?

00:12:16.218 --> 00:12:19.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when in public,
husbands will want to act

00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:23.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the husband at Proverbs 31:28.

00:12:24.326 --> 00:12:28.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “Her husband
rises up and praises her.”

00:12:29.365 --> 00:12:32.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s common today for husbands to make fun of

00:12:32.635 --> 00:12:35.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even say demeaning things
about their wives.

00:12:35.771 --> 00:12:38.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But since a wife places so much emphasis

00:12:38.441 --> 00:12:40.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on connection and friendship,

00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:43.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she can really be hurt
when demeaning remarks are said

00:12:43.813 --> 00:12:46.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get a laugh; it makes her feel awful.

00:12:47.783 --> 00:12:51.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands, your wife
considers you her best friend,

00:12:51.086 --> 00:12:53.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the one she shares everything with.

00:12:53.289 --> 00:12:57.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you break that trust,
she feels unloved and hurt.

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:01.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the best time
to bring matters to each other’s attention

00:13:01.964 --> 00:13:05.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is when you’re in private or, if needed,
when you can talk in such a way

00:13:05.935 --> 00:13:08.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that others cannot hear what’s being said.

00:13:09.972 --> 00:13:14.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, a wife
shows deep respect for her husband

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:16.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the husband shows his love for his wife.

00:13:18.814 --> 00:13:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in review,
we’ve considered just three situations

00:13:22.918 --> 00:13:25.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the principle of love and respect

00:13:25.521 --> 00:13:27.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help us to have a successful marriage:

00:13:29.258 --> 00:13:31.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how a husband and wife talk to each other,

00:13:31.794 --> 00:13:33.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how they solve problems,

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:36.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they act in the company of others.

00:13:37.633 --> 00:13:39.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A good marriage is hard work.

00:13:39.802 --> 00:13:42.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is your marriage?

00:13:42.304 --> 00:13:45.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you say
that you’ve developed good patterns

00:13:45.508 --> 00:13:48.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bad patterns in dealing with each other?

00:13:48.577 --> 00:13:51.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When was the last time you talked as a couple

00:13:51.347 --> 00:13:54.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about love and respect for each other?

00:13:55.651 --> 00:14:00.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s perfect advice at Ephesians 5:33

00:14:00.022 --> 00:14:04.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help the marriage
of two imperfect people.

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:06.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In just a few words in this verse,

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:08.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is sharing with us a key principle

00:14:08.797 --> 00:14:10.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how he designed marriage.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:15.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s telling us
what each needs and places emphasis on.

00:14:15.304 --> 00:14:19.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Husbands put emphasis on being respected,

00:14:19.542 --> 00:14:22.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wives put emphasis on being loved.

00:14:22.745 --> 00:14:25.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this principle forms a key part

00:14:25.848 --> 00:14:28.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the divine pattern for marriage.

00:14:28.784 --> 00:14:33.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you want your marriage
to operate as Jehovah designed,

00:14:33.756 --> 00:14:38.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then work hard to apply his perfect principle

00:14:38.394 --> 00:14:41.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of love and respect in your marriage.
