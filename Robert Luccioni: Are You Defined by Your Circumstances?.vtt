00:01.117 --> 00:04.087
There are many exciting things happening


00:04.087 --> 00:06.155
in Jehovah’s organization.


00:06.155 --> 00:08.692
Why, month after month, we read articles,


00:08.692 --> 00:12.129
watch videos, and hear personal experiences


00:12.128 --> 00:15.765
about our brothers and sisters 
who are doing more for Jehovah. 


00:15.765 --> 00:19.168
They are serving where 
the need is greater or reaching out 


00:19.168 --> 00:21.771
for the School for Kingdom Evangelizers. 


00:21.772 --> 00:25.075
They are working 
on construction, renovation, 


00:25.075 --> 00:29.145
maintenance of Kingdom Halls, 
or other theocratic projects. 


00:29.145 --> 00:32.382
No doubt, 
many of you watching this program 


00:32.382 --> 00:34.584
are excitedly looking forward 


00:34.583 --> 00:37.786
to expanding your ministry 
in one of these areas. 


00:37.787 --> 00:40.690
We encourage you to do so. 


00:40.690 --> 00:44.560
You can be assured 
that you will receive much fulfillment 


00:44.560 --> 00:47.830
and many blessings from Jehovah.


00:47.830 --> 00:49.832
On the other hand,  


00:49.832 --> 00:52.269
there are others 
who are watching this program


00:52.268 --> 00:55.838
who may feel discouraged 
because their circumstances 


00:55.838 --> 01:00.476
may seem to limit 
their being as involved as they would like. 


01:00.477 --> 01:03.079
What are some of these circumstances? 


01:03.078 --> 01:06.081
These may include our age, our health, 


01:06.082 --> 01:10.487
our economic situation, 
or our physical limitations. 


01:10.487 --> 01:14.090
For some of us, 
perhaps our upbringing 


01:14.090 --> 01:17.127
or past errors 
we have made in our life 


01:17.127 --> 01:20.397
may cause us to feel 
that we are limited 


01:20.397 --> 01:23.299
as to what we can do 
for Jehovah. 


01:23.298 --> 01:26.668
As we know well, 
focusing on our limitations 


01:26.668 --> 01:29.605
can affect our joy, 
causing discouragement. 


01:29.605 --> 01:31.775
What can we do?


01:31.775 --> 01:36.078
There are many examples 
in the Scriptures of men and women 


01:36.078 --> 01:38.915
who had circumstances 
beyond their control 


01:38.915 --> 01:42.752
that seemed to limit how much 
they could do for Jehovah. 


01:42.752 --> 01:47.424
Others had to deal with the effects 
of their upbringing and family life 


01:47.423 --> 01:50.593
or with serious errors they made. 


01:50.593 --> 01:53.596
Did they allow themselves to be limited 


01:53.597 --> 01:56.632
by their circumstances or their past? 


01:56.632 --> 01:59.002
How did Jehovah feel about them? 


01:59.002 --> 02:02.272
How does Jehovah feel about us? 


02:02.272 --> 02:06.409
That is what we are going to discuss 
in this month’s broadcast, 


02:06.408 --> 02:07.810
which has the theme 


02:07.810 --> 02:11.815
“Are You Defined by Your Circumstances?” 


02:11.815 --> 02:13.983
Let’s start by looking at some 


02:13.983 --> 02:17.586
who could have let 
their circumstances limit them.


02:17.587 --> 02:22.325
Consider first the example 
of Joseph in the book of Genesis. 


02:22.325 --> 02:25.162
Now, Joseph faced injustice at its worst. 


02:25.162 --> 02:28.330
His situation was especially hurtful 


02:28.330 --> 02:32.068
since it was initially brought on by those 
who should have been closest to him


02:32.068 --> 02:34.070
—his family! 


02:34.070 --> 02:37.173
As a slave in Egypt 
and later as a prisoner, 


02:37.173 --> 02:40.710
Joseph was indeed limited 
in what he could do. 


02:40.710 --> 02:44.047
How might Joseph have reacted? 


02:44.047 --> 02:47.050
Well, 
Joseph could have become so preoccupied 


02:47.050 --> 02:49.185
with what he could not do 


02:49.185 --> 02:52.188
that he lost sight of what he could do.


02:52.188 --> 02:55.291
Did Joseph let his circumstances 


02:55.292 --> 02:57.494
paralyze his life? 


02:57.493 --> 02:59.095
No! 


02:59.095 --> 03:01.932
He chose to make 
the best of his situation. 


03:01.932 --> 03:04.000
In fact, 
note what Joseph did 


03:04.000 --> 03:06.502
while serving as a slave 
in Potiphar’s house 


03:06.502 --> 03:11.274
if we turn together 
to Genesis 39:4: 


03:11.273 --> 03:14.776
“Joseph kept finding favor in his eyes, 


03:14.777 --> 03:17.614
“and he became his personal attendant. 


03:17.613 --> 03:20.048
“So he appointed him over his house, 


03:20.048 --> 03:23.586
and he put him 
in charge of all that was his.” 


03:23.587 --> 03:26.189
Joseph worked diligently 


03:26.188 --> 03:29.358
within the limitations 
of his circumstances. 


03:29.358 --> 03:31.626
He took a similar approach while in prison. 


03:31.627 --> 03:34.697
Joseph focused on what he could do 


03:34.697 --> 03:38.500
despite suffering the effects of injustice.


03:38.500 --> 03:41.837
As a second example, 
consider Hezekiah. 


03:41.837 --> 03:44.874
Hezekiah is one 
who might easily have felt 


03:44.873 --> 03:48.110
that he was defined by his upbringing. 


03:48.110 --> 03:52.848
Look at the terrible example 
that was set by his father, Ahaz, 


03:52.848 --> 03:56.920
as recorded in 2 Kings chapter 16. 


03:56.920 --> 03:59.555
Second Kings chapter 16, 


03:59.555 --> 04:03.627
and notice what verse 3 says about Ahaz: 


04:03.627 --> 04:08.197
“Instead, he walked in the way 
of the kings of Israel, 


04:08.197 --> 04:12.369
“and he even made his own son 
pass through the fire, 


04:12.368 --> 04:15.805
“following the detestable practices 
of the nations 


04:15.805 --> 04:19.742
that Jehovah had driven out 
from before the Israelites.” 


04:19.742 --> 04:23.614
Hezekiah’s father did detestable things 


04:23.613 --> 04:25.748
in opposition to Jehovah. 


04:25.748 --> 04:27.750
But Hezekiah showed 


04:27.750 --> 04:29.852
that he was not the helpless victim 


04:29.852 --> 04:31.887
of a poor parental example. 


04:31.887 --> 04:33.890
What did he do? 


04:33.890 --> 04:37.760
Well, turn in your Bibles 
to 2 Kings chapter 18 


04:37.760 --> 04:39.962
and notice verse 3, 


04:39.962 --> 04:42.199
what it says about Hezekiah: 


04:42.198 --> 04:46.335
“He kept doing what was right
in Jehovah’s eyes,


04:46.335 --> 04:50.138
just as David his forefather
had done.”


04:50.138 --> 04:52.841
Verse 5 says of Hezekiah: 


04:52.842 --> 04:56.912
“There was no one like him 
among all the kings of Judah.” 


04:56.912 --> 04:59.215
He became fully involved in true worship. 


04:59.215 --> 05:02.085
Verses 6 and 7 say that Hezekiah 


05:02.085 --> 05:07.923
‘held fast to Jehovah, 
and Jehovah proved to be with him.’


05:07.923 --> 05:12.328
How encouraging 
Hezekiah’s example is for us! 


05:12.328 --> 05:14.763
We can choose to be loyal to Jehovah 


05:14.763 --> 05:17.000
and do much in our worship of Jehovah, 


05:17.000 --> 05:19.735
even if we did not grow up in a family 


05:19.735 --> 05:21.737
that served Jehovah fully. 


05:21.737 --> 05:25.875
We are not helpless victims 
of our environment. 


05:25.875 --> 05:30.145
Hezekiah’s example 
reassures us that our past 


05:30.145 --> 05:33.315
does not have to control our future.


05:33.315 --> 05:37.453
As a third example, 
consider the apostle Paul. 


05:37.453 --> 05:39.921
He did not let his own past mistakes 


05:39.922 --> 05:43.359
involving religious prejudice and violence 


05:43.358 --> 05:46.328
stop him from giving his all to Jehovah. 


05:46.328 --> 05:49.998
How did Paul feel about his past? 


05:49.998 --> 05:55.638
Well, let’s read together 
at 1 Corinthians 15:9: 


05:55.638 --> 05:59.441
“For I am the least of the apostles, 


05:59.442 --> 06:02.645
“and I am not worthy 
of being called an apostle, 


06:02.645 --> 06:06.682
because I persecuted 
the congregation of God.” 


06:06.682 --> 06:09.652
“I am the least of the apostles.” 


06:09.652 --> 06:13.857
Later, when writing to the Ephesians 
as recorded at Ephesians 3:8, 


06:13.857 --> 06:18.060
he calls himself 
“less than the least of all holy ones.” 


06:18.060 --> 06:21.630
Finally, at 1 Timothy 1:15, 


06:21.630 --> 06:25.635
he now calls himself 
the “foremost” of all sinners. 


06:25.635 --> 06:29.238
Yes, 
Paul’s prior treatment of the congregation 


06:29.238 --> 06:31.506
weighed heavily upon him.


06:31.507 --> 06:35.277
Could Paul have reasoned 
that he was damaged? 


06:35.277 --> 06:37.547
Could he have reasoned that his past 


06:37.547 --> 06:40.115
limited what he could do for Jehovah? 


06:40.115 --> 06:43.452
He could have, 
but Paul did not do that. 


06:43.452 --> 06:46.322
He poured himself out 
for the congregation. 


06:46.322 --> 06:49.492
Why, Paul was privileged to write 
more books and letters 


06:49.492 --> 06:52.027
in the Christian Greek Scriptures 
than anyone else. 


06:52.027 --> 06:55.632
He demonstrated 
an outstanding zeal for the ministry. 


06:55.632 --> 06:59.135
Paul did not let his conduct in the past 


06:59.135 --> 07:03.005
dictate what he could do for Jehovah.


07:03.005 --> 07:05.542
And there are many other examples as well. 


07:05.542 --> 07:10.112
For example, 
are we in a difficult economic situation? 


07:10.112 --> 07:12.749
The account in 2 Corinthians chapter 8


07:12.748 --> 07:14.916
tells us about the Macedonians.


07:14.917 --> 07:18.287
Paul says that they were in deep poverty. 


07:18.287 --> 07:21.224
Yet they begged to have a financial share


07:21.223 --> 07:23.258
in the relief work.


07:23.258 --> 07:25.595
Are we older in years? 


07:25.595 --> 07:27.597
We may think of Anna. 


07:27.597 --> 07:31.000
The account at Luke 2:36-38


07:31.000 --> 07:33.937
tells us that she was 84 years old 


07:33.937 --> 07:35.939
and that her husband had died


07:35.938 --> 07:38.373
after just seven years of marriage.


07:38.373 --> 07:40.743
Yet, 
“she was never missing from the temple.” 


07:40.743 --> 07:44.946
She rendered
‘sacred service day and night.’


07:44.947 --> 07:48.000
What lessons do we learn 
from these accounts? 


07:49.485 --> 07:53.388
Our dear brothers and sisters
in Bible times were just like us.


07:53.388 --> 07:57.293
Many were in circumstances
that they would not have chosen.


07:57.293 --> 08:00.563
Yet,
they did not let their circumstances


08:00.563 --> 08:03.565
or their past define them. 


08:03.565 --> 08:06.402
They joyfully did what they could 


08:06.402 --> 08:09.105
within the limits of their situation. 


08:09.105 --> 08:11.507
And these are just a few examples. 


08:11.507 --> 08:14.044
There are many others in the Bible. 


08:14.043 --> 08:17.246
Why not make it a personal study project 


08:17.247 --> 08:19.249
to research faithful ones 


08:19.248 --> 08:22.251
who were in circumstances 
similar to yours? 


08:22.252 --> 08:25.755
How did they stay involved 
in Jehovah’s work? 


08:25.755 --> 08:30.000
We are sure 
that you will be greatly encouraged.


08:33.997 --> 08:36.665
Now, 
we’ve considered examples of those 


08:36.665 --> 08:40.002
who did not let 
their circumstances hinder them 


08:40.002 --> 08:42.339
from giving their all to Jehovah. 


08:42.338 --> 08:44.573
But another question is: 


08:44.573 --> 08:48.643
How does Jehovah 
view his faithful servants 


08:48.643 --> 08:50.980
despite their limitations?


08:50.980 --> 08:54.483
Now, I’ve often thought 
about the example of John the Baptizer. 


08:54.483 --> 08:59.188
As we know, he was arrested 
shortly after Jesus started his ministry. 


08:59.188 --> 09:01.190
John could have felt 


09:01.190 --> 09:05.427
that he was no longer of use 
to Jehovah or the work. 


09:05.427 --> 09:09.332
Yet, as recorded at Matthew 11:11, 


09:09.332 --> 09:11.500
Jesus said about John: 


09:11.500 --> 09:13.768
“Among those born of women, 


09:13.768 --> 09:18.440
there has not been raised up 
anyone greater than John the Baptist.” 


09:18.440 --> 09:20.677
Jehovah’s and Jesus’ view of John 


09:20.677 --> 09:23.279
was not based 
on the man’s circumstances 


09:23.278 --> 09:25.413
of being in prison. 


09:25.413 --> 09:29.485
Their view of John was based on
who he was on the inside


09:29.485 --> 09:32.255
and on his relationship with Jehovah. 


09:32.255 --> 09:35.858
Jehovah did not focus on the limitations. 


09:35.858 --> 09:39.128
In Jehovah’s eyes, 
John was great. 


09:39.128 --> 09:42.931
He was still a faithful servant 
doing the best that he could, 


09:42.932 --> 09:46.202
and that was all that really mattered.


09:46.202 --> 09:49.039
Another example 
that may come to your mind 


09:49.038 --> 09:51.073
is that of King David. 


09:51.073 --> 09:55.076
As we know, 
King David committed serious sins. 


09:55.077 --> 09:57.580
Yet, 
David repented for his sins, 


09:57.580 --> 10:01.483
and there is no record
that he repeated them.


10:01.483 --> 10:04.353
How did Jehovah view him? 


10:04.353 --> 10:07.690
Did Jehovah see David as damaged, 


10:07.690 --> 10:11.693
as a man who would always be
limited in serving him?


10:11.693 --> 10:16.131
Notice Jehovah’s words 
directed to King Jeroboam 


10:16.132 --> 10:20.369
at 1 Kings 14:8:


10:20.368 --> 10:24.706
“But you have not become 
like my servant David, 


10:24.707 --> 10:26.709
“who kept my commandments 


10:26.708 --> 10:29.578
“and who walked after me 
with all his heart, 


10:29.578 --> 10:32.748
doing only what was right in my eyes.” 


10:32.748 --> 10:35.616
Jehovah viewed David 
as a special servant. 


10:35.617 --> 10:38.120
He says that he 
“kept my commandments.” 


10:38.120 --> 10:41.023
He did 
“what was right in my eyes.” 


10:41.023 --> 10:44.460
That’s what Jehovah remembered.


10:44.460 --> 10:47.028
How encouraging that is for us! 


10:47.028 --> 10:49.631
If we have repented 
of our past mistakes 


10:49.632 --> 10:53.169
and set matters straight 
to the best of our circumstances, 


10:53.168 --> 10:58.206
we too can be assured 
that Jehovah loves us dearly. 


10:58.207 --> 11:03.912
He appreciates whatever we can do 
in our worship of him. 


11:03.912 --> 11:05.915
So, what’s the point? 


11:05.915 --> 11:09.985
Well, our past 
or our present circumstances 


11:09.985 --> 11:13.988
do not define our value before Jehovah. 


11:13.988 --> 11:17.225
Our Father loves us for who we are, 


11:17.225 --> 11:19.228
and he values our efforts 


11:19.228 --> 11:22.731
as we do the best 
that we can to serve him.


11:22.732 --> 11:25.802
Why do you think it is important 


11:25.802 --> 11:29.572
that we strive to see ourselves 
as Jehovah does? 


11:29.572 --> 11:34.444
Because we can weaken, 
discourage, or limit ourselves 


11:34.443 --> 11:39.448
if we see ourselves only 
in the framework of our circumstances. 


11:39.448 --> 11:43.451
May we work hard not to do that. 


11:43.452 --> 11:45.855
What does Jehovah see 


11:45.855 --> 11:49.592
when he looks 
at his faithful servants today? 


11:49.592 --> 11:54.597
Well, turn, please, 
to 1 Samuel 16:7. 


11:54.597 --> 11:57.165
And the setting is 
that Samuel was about to go 


11:57.165 --> 11:59.168
to anoint the next king of Israel; 


11:59.168 --> 12:02.605
and he goes to the house of Jesse; 
and Jesse lines up all of his sons, 


12:02.605 --> 12:05.107
except for David,
who is still out in the field; 


12:05.107 --> 12:08.844
and Samuel walks in 
and he sees Eliab. 


12:08.843 --> 12:11.346
And based on what he sees, 


12:11.347 --> 12:14.084
Samuel concludes that this surely must be 


12:14.083 --> 12:16.151
the next king of Israel. 


12:16.152 --> 12:18.854
Yet, note what Jehovah saw. 


12:18.853 --> 12:23.858
Please read with me 1 Samuel 16:7: 


12:23.858 --> 12:26.861
“But Jehovah said to Samuel: 


12:26.862 --> 12:31.400
“‘Do not pay attention 
to his appearance and how tall he is, 


12:31.400 --> 12:33.702
“‘for I have rejected him. 


12:33.702 --> 12:38.440
“‘For the way man sees
is not the way God sees,


12:38.440 --> 12:41.977
“‘because mere man sees
what appears to the eyes,


12:41.977 --> 12:45.247
but Jehovah sees into the heart.’”


12:45.247 --> 12:48.384
That’s the way Jehovah sees. 


12:48.383 --> 12:51.386
He does not look 
at our outward appearance and our abilities; 


12:51.387 --> 12:53.255
he sees into our hearts. 


12:53.255 --> 12:54.757
He sees what we would be doing 


12:54.757 --> 12:57.494
if all of the limitations 
were lifted off of us. 


12:57.493 --> 12:59.995
Why, just the fact 
that we keep going, 


12:59.995 --> 13:03.298
that we keep putting 
one foot in front of the other, 


13:03.298 --> 13:06.468
endears us to Jehovah. 


13:06.468 --> 13:09.305
We understand the truth 
of that statement, 


13:09.305 --> 13:11.307
and we all may agree 


13:11.307 --> 13:14.310
that this is how 
Jehovah views his people. 


13:14.310 --> 13:19.013
However, we may have 
a hard time convincing ourselves 


13:19.013 --> 13:22.416
if this really applies to me. 


13:22.417 --> 13:26.522
Have you ever wondered: 
‘Does Jehovah really see me? 


13:26.522 --> 13:28.624
‘Does he see what’s in my heart 


13:28.623 --> 13:32.193
and value my desire to do more for him?’ 


13:32.193 --> 13:34.196
The answer is yes. 


13:34.197 --> 13:39.067
In fact, Jehovah has already seen 
what is in your heart.


13:39.067 --> 13:41.404
Think about this: 


13:41.403 --> 13:44.606
Why are you watching this program? 


13:44.607 --> 13:47.442
Why do you care about spiritual things? 


13:47.442 --> 13:50.379
Why are you, perhaps, 
the only one in your family 


13:50.378 --> 13:53.315
who is a dedicated, 
baptized servant of Jehovah? 


13:53.315 --> 13:56.885
Or why are you, perhaps, 
the only one at your place of employment 


13:56.885 --> 14:00.890
or the only one near where you live 
who’s serving Jehovah? 


14:00.890 --> 14:03.492
Is it because you are 
so much more studious 


14:03.492 --> 14:05.794
or smarter than everyone else? 


14:05.793 --> 14:07.796
No! 


14:07.797 --> 14:10.900
Haggai 2:7 tells us 


14:10.900 --> 14:14.168
that Jehovah 
“will shake all the nations, 


14:14.168 --> 14:17.973
and the precious things 
of all the nations will come in.” 


14:17.973 --> 14:21.510
John 6:44 says 


14:21.510 --> 14:24.780
that ‘no man can come to Jesus 


14:24.780 --> 14:28.383
unless the Father draws him.’ 


14:28.383 --> 14:32.788
Jeremiah 31:3, Jehovah says: 


14:32.788 --> 14:36.525
“I have loved you with an everlasting love. 


14:36.525 --> 14:39.862
That is why I have drawn you.”


14:39.862 --> 14:43.765
So again, why are you serving Jehovah? 


14:43.765 --> 14:45.767
Because Jehovah loves you. 


14:45.767 --> 14:47.770
Jehovah drew you. 


14:47.770 --> 14:49.405
As he was shaking the nations, 


14:49.405 --> 14:53.042
he looked down into your heart 
and he saw something very precious 


14:53.042 --> 14:55.210
and he drew you to him. 


14:55.210 --> 14:57.780
He said, 
“I want to draw this person to my Son. 


14:57.780 --> 15:00.082
“I want to draw this person to me. 


15:00.082 --> 15:03.519
I love this person.” 


15:03.518 --> 15:05.720
Jehovah drew you, 


15:05.720 --> 15:08.457
not because you have
perfect circumstances,


15:08.457 --> 15:12.127
but because of your heart
and because he loves you.


15:12.127 --> 15:17.000
He greatly appreciates 
that his servants give their best to him.


15:20.802 --> 15:25.274
Remember, 
not the way man sees is the way God sees


15:25.273 --> 15:27.843
—Jehovah sees what the heart is. 


15:27.843 --> 15:32.180
May we work hard
to see ourselves as Jehovah does


15:32.180 --> 15:35.783
and be determined to never give up. 


15:35.783 --> 15:40.188
May we never forget that it is
the privilege of bearing Jehovah’s name,


15:40.188 --> 15:42.256
having a relationship with him, 


15:42.257 --> 15:45.427
and our love for Jehovah that defines us. 


15:45.427 --> 15:49.832
Jehovah is happy 
if we give the best that we can. 


15:49.832 --> 15:52.100
So may we do our part


15:52.100 --> 15:55.603
by not limiting ourselves 
due to our circumstances,


15:55.603 --> 15:59.608
but always look for ways 
to give our best to Jehovah.


15:59.608 --> 16:02.176
You beautiful older ones, 


16:02.177 --> 16:04.380
even those with severe health problems, 


16:04.380 --> 16:07.650
can do much to help 
in the great work that’s taking place today. 


16:07.650 --> 16:09.985
Now, you may wonder 
what can you do. 


16:09.985 --> 16:11.987
You can pray for your brothers and sisters. 


16:11.987 --> 16:13.655
We need your prayers. 


16:13.655 --> 16:15.223
Pray for the Governing Body. 


16:15.223 --> 16:17.091
Pray for those who are taking the lead. 


16:17.092 --> 16:19.662
Pray for the elders in your congregations. 


16:19.662 --> 16:23.065
Pray for those who 
are going through difficult times. 


16:23.065 --> 16:26.735
Do such prayers help 
the work of the organization? 


16:26.735 --> 16:28.737
Absolutely! 


16:28.737 --> 16:31.640
James 5:16 tells us 


16:31.640 --> 16:34.242
that ‘a righteous person’s supplication 


16:34.242 --> 16:36.979
has a powerful effect.’ 


16:36.978 --> 16:41.416
No matter who we are 
and whatever our situation in life, 


16:41.417 --> 16:46.422
may we find joy 
in giving what we can for Jehovah. 


16:46.422 --> 16:50.525
And may each one of us 
rejoice at the privilege we have 


16:50.525 --> 17:01.922
of being part of what Jehovah 
is accomplishing in these last days.
