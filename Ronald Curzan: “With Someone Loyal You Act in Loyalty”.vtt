00:01.918 --> 00:06.155
This month’s theme is taken 
from David’s poetic song to Jehovah 


00:06.155 --> 00:09.225
at Psalm 18:25, which states: 


00:09.225 --> 00:12.995
“With someone loyal you act in loyalty.”


00:12.995 --> 00:15.432
The Hebrew term “act in loyalty” 


00:15.432 --> 00:17.867
reminds us 
of God’s loyal love


00:17.867 --> 00:20.304
—that is love motivated 
by commitment, 


00:20.303 --> 00:24.340
integrity, loyalty, 
and deep attachment. 


00:24.340 --> 00:27.610
So loyalty is more 
than just a feeling; 


00:27.610 --> 00:30.513
it is active; 
it’s rooted in love. 


00:30.513 --> 00:33.148
How comforting it is 
to know that Jehovah 


00:33.148 --> 00:37.486
lovingly attaches himself 
to those who are loyal to him!


00:37.487 --> 00:40.190
But what motivated David 
to write the words 


00:40.190 --> 00:42.258
at Psalm 18:25? 


00:42.258 --> 00:45.195
The superscription reveals 
that it was composed 


00:45.195 --> 00:49.065
after “Jehovah rescued him 
from the hand of all his enemies 


00:49.065 --> 00:51.200
and from the hand of Saul.” 


00:51.200 --> 00:54.870
Think of the great joy 
and relief he must have felt 


00:54.870 --> 00:57.907
after experiencing firsthand 
Jehovah’s loyal love 


00:57.907 --> 01:00.277
and mighty saving acts.


01:00.277 --> 01:02.679
However, throughout his life, 


01:02.678 --> 01:06.381
David experienced 
disloyalty at its worst: 


01:06.382 --> 01:10.120
from his king, Saul; 
from his wife Michal; 


01:10.120 --> 01:15.092
from his trusted counselor Ahithophel; 
and from his son Absalom. 


01:15.092 --> 01:19.829
He felt the deep hurt of betrayal 
by those he trusted and loved most.


01:19.828 --> 01:22.931
Loyalty is a choice. 


01:22.932 --> 01:26.369
What do we find when we look back 
at David’s life? 


01:26.368 --> 01:30.406
David chose to stay loyal to God. 


01:30.407 --> 01:33.375
From a humble shepherd boy 
caring for his sheep 


01:33.375 --> 01:36.145
to a valiant king 
caring for the nation, 


01:36.145 --> 01:38.715
he proved 
to be someone loyal, 


01:38.715 --> 01:41.683
a man agreeable 
to Jehovah’s heart.


01:41.683 --> 01:45.388
But it can be a real test 
to maintain loyalty to God 


01:45.388 --> 01:47.556
when we face injustices. 


01:47.557 --> 01:51.627
Imagine the desperate situation 
that David and his mighty warriors 


01:51.627 --> 01:53.897
experienced when they 
were fugitives, 


01:53.897 --> 01:57.967
forced to hide in the wilderness, 
often low on provisions. 


01:57.967 --> 02:01.972
They saw firsthand 
King Saul’s jealous rage. 


02:01.972 --> 02:05.442
But what choice did David make 
when urged by his men 


02:05.442 --> 02:08.745
to seize the opportunity 
to take Saul’s life? 


02:08.745 --> 02:11.380
Notice what David told his men 


02:11.380 --> 02:15.752
at 1 Samuel 24:6: 


02:15.752 --> 02:18.489
“It is unthinkable 
from Jehovah’s standpoint 


02:18.488 --> 02:21.090
“that I should do 
such a thing to my lord, 


02:21.090 --> 02:24.827
“the anointed of Jehovah, 
by lifting my hand against him, 


02:24.827 --> 02:28.865
for he is the anointed of Jehovah.”


02:28.865 --> 02:32.368
David knew that if he remained loyal, 


02:32.368 --> 02:35.036
Jehovah would remain loyal to him


02:35.037 --> 02:37.240
—He would show him loyal love. 


02:37.240 --> 02:39.875
He humbly put aside 
his personal feelings 


02:39.875 --> 02:42.812
and viewed matters 
from Jehovah’s perspective. 


02:42.812 --> 02:47.000
He chose to wait patiently 
for Jehovah to “act in loyalty.”


02:48.450 --> 02:52.388
We’ll soon be facing 
life-changing events foretold in the Bible 


02:52.388 --> 02:56.893
that will test our loyalty 
to Jehovah and his organization. 


02:56.893 --> 03:00.530
So now is the time 
to strengthen our loyalty! 


03:00.530 --> 03:05.302
As we do, we can be sure 
that Jehovah knows our circumstances


03:05.302 --> 03:08.170
—perhaps injustices 
we have experienced—


03:08.170 --> 03:11.440
and will reward our loyal service. 


03:11.440 --> 03:14.710
So ask yourself, ‘What loyal actions 


03:14.710 --> 03:18.280
will motivate Jehovah to be loyal to me?’ 


03:18.280 --> 03:21.050
Let’s consider three areas. 


03:21.050 --> 03:25.755
First, we can be loyal 
to Jehovah by defending him.


03:25.755 --> 03:28.658
But Jehovah is 
the Sovereign of the universe. 


03:28.658 --> 03:30.893
How can we come to his defense? 


03:30.893 --> 03:35.431
We can learn how 
from the fine example of Elihu! 


03:35.432 --> 03:39.002
In the book of Job, 
Elihu listened patiently as Job 


03:39.002 --> 03:41.104
and his three false comforters spoke. 


03:41.103 --> 03:43.271
Notice Elihu’s reaction 


03:43.272 --> 03:47.077
at Job 32:2, 3: 


03:47.077 --> 03:50.079
“His anger blazed against Job 


03:50.078 --> 03:53.650
“for trying to prove himself 
right rather than God. 


03:53.650 --> 03:56.953
“He was also very angry 
with Job’s three companions 


03:56.953 --> 03:59.421
“because they could not find an answer 


03:59.422 --> 04:02.892
but had declared God wicked.”


04:02.892 --> 04:07.597
A fire of righteous indignation 
was burning inside young Elihu. 


04:07.597 --> 04:11.067
In Job 36:2, 3, 


04:11.067 --> 04:14.470
he loyally comes 
to Jehovah’s defense saying: 


04:14.470 --> 04:18.507
“Be patient with me 
a little longer while I explain, 


04:18.507 --> 04:21.744
“for I still have words 
to speak on God’s behalf. 


04:21.743 --> 04:25.146
“I will speak comprehensively 
about what I know, 


04:25.147 --> 04:28.919
and I will ascribe 
righteousness to my Maker.”


04:28.918 --> 04:31.853
Elihu courageously proved loyal 


04:31.853 --> 04:36.358
by praising, 
and, yes, defending God. 


04:36.358 --> 04:39.761
Why do we need to come 
to Jehovah’s defense today? 


04:39.762 --> 04:44.200
Because our loving heavenly Father
is blasphemed in so many ways. 


04:44.200 --> 04:47.103
False religions claim 
that he’s part of a Trinity 


04:47.103 --> 04:50.606
and that he torments people 
eternally in burning hell. 


04:50.607 --> 04:54.077
Others say that he 
does not exist or if he does, 


04:54.077 --> 04:56.145
he doesn’t really care about us. 


04:56.145 --> 05:00.048
We know that such lies 
come from Satan the Devil. 


05:00.048 --> 05:02.218
We demonstrate our loyalty 


05:02.218 --> 05:05.321
by speaking in defense of Jehovah, 


05:05.322 --> 05:08.457
thereby proving 
Satan the liar that he is. 


05:08.457 --> 05:11.027
We boldly and zealously proclaim 


05:11.027 --> 05:13.830
that he does exist 
as the almighty God; 


05:13.830 --> 05:17.267
and that he is 
wise, just, and loving, 


05:17.267 --> 05:19.902
and that he will soon 
bring an end to all evil 


05:19.902 --> 05:23.205
and reward his loyal ones 
with eternal life. 


05:23.205 --> 05:26.508
Jehovah could make 
the stones cry out in defense, 


05:26.508 --> 05:30.480
yet he honors his loyal Witnesses
—you and me—


05:30.480 --> 05:33.582
with this fine privilege.


05:33.582 --> 05:37.154
Second, we can be loyal 
to Jehovah by being loyal 


05:37.153 --> 05:41.523
to “the faithful and discreet slave,” 
the Governing Body. 


05:41.523 --> 05:44.426
Jehovah and Jesus are using 
“the faithful and discreet slave” 


05:44.427 --> 05:49.099
to feed us spiritually, 
so we owe our loyalty to that slave. 


05:49.098 --> 05:51.100
But some may say, 


05:51.100 --> 05:54.137
‘Isn’t the Governing Body 
made up of imperfect men?’ 


05:54.137 --> 05:56.139
Yes, it is. 


05:56.138 --> 05:59.875
The last perfect person to walk 
the earth was Jesus himself. 


05:59.875 --> 06:04.647
There is no perfect person 
or organization on the globe. 


06:04.647 --> 06:07.350
But as a long-time faithful brother 
used to say, 


06:07.350 --> 06:11.153
“This is the best imperfect organization 
on earth.” 


06:11.153 --> 06:14.223
Jesus didn’t say 
the slave would be infallible. 


06:14.223 --> 06:18.060
He said it would be 
faithful and discreet. 


06:18.060 --> 06:21.497
The way we listen to 
and obey the faithful slave 


06:21.497 --> 06:25.835
has a direct bearing on the strength 
of our friendship with God. 


06:25.835 --> 06:29.872
In fact, it means our very life.


06:29.872 --> 06:32.275
But what if the Governing Body 


06:32.275 --> 06:35.310
serves some spiritual food 
that is not to our liking? 


06:35.310 --> 06:38.347
Or what if we do not fully understand 


06:38.347 --> 06:42.185
or agree with a clarification of a belief? 


06:42.185 --> 06:46.322
On one occasion, Jesus’ followers, 
including the apostle Peter, 


06:46.322 --> 06:48.624
were confronted 
with a new teaching. 


06:48.623 --> 06:50.893
How did most react? 


06:50.893 --> 06:55.498
Notice John 6:60, it states: 


06:55.498 --> 06:58.968
“When they heard this, 
many of his disciples said: 


06:58.968 --> 07:01.736
‘This speech is shocking;
who can listen to it?’”


07:01.737 --> 07:03.739
The result? 


07:03.738 --> 07:05.941
Continuing in verse 66: 


07:05.942 --> 07:08.812
“Because of this, 
many of his disciples 


07:08.812 --> 07:13.415
went off to the things behind 
and would no longer walk with him.”


07:13.415 --> 07:17.320
But how did Peter respond 
when Jesus asked them, 


07:17.320 --> 07:19.522
‘Are you too stumbled?’ 


07:19.522 --> 07:21.957
At John 6:68, we read: 


07:21.957 --> 07:24.327
“Simon Peter answered him: 


07:24.327 --> 07:27.062
‘Lord, whom shall we go away to? 


07:27.062 --> 07:30.767
You have sayings of everlasting life.’”


07:30.767 --> 07:32.969
What loyalty! 


07:32.968 --> 07:36.138
Peter’s loyalty 
was based on solid evidence 


07:36.138 --> 07:38.506
that Jesus was the Messiah. 


07:38.507 --> 07:41.710
His loyalty 
was evidence of his faith. 


07:41.710 --> 07:46.615
That is the kind of loyalty 
we want to imitate today. 


07:46.615 --> 07:51.087
There are times we must wait on 
Jehovah to clarify matters. 


07:51.087 --> 07:55.859
In the meantime, 
may we prove ourselves loyal like Peter 


07:55.858 --> 07:59.095
and follow closely 
the lead of the faithful slave, 


07:59.095 --> 08:04.000
who closely follow 
in the footsteps of their Master, Jesus.


08:04.000 --> 08:08.570
At times, though, we receive 
counsel that touches us personally. 


08:08.570 --> 08:12.875
For instance, on JW Broadcasting 
we’ve received loving reminders 


08:12.875 --> 08:16.012
from members of the Governing Body 
to be forgiving, 


08:16.012 --> 08:18.714
to honor Jehovah 
with our valuable things, 


08:18.713 --> 08:21.650
and to remain spiritually alert. 


08:21.650 --> 08:24.520
Through The Watchtower 
and at Christian meetings, 


08:24.520 --> 08:27.290
we’re reminded to be careful 
about our dress and grooming, 


08:27.290 --> 08:30.927
to choose good associates 
and wholesome entertainment, 


08:30.927 --> 08:33.529
and to remain morally clean. 


08:33.528 --> 08:36.965
Are we quick to respond 
and make needed adjustments 


08:36.965 --> 08:41.000
or do we find ourselves wanting 
to defend our personal rights? 


08:42.805 --> 08:45.107
A situation 
in the apostle Paul’s life 


08:45.107 --> 08:47.944
tested his loyalty 
to theocratic direction. 


08:47.943 --> 08:51.146
It’s found in Acts chapter 21. 


08:51.147 --> 08:55.050
As you recall, 
Paul arrived in Jerusalem in 56 C.E. 


08:55.050 --> 08:57.553
after a very successful missionary tour. 


08:57.553 --> 09:01.090
You can imagine his excitement 
as he related in detail 


09:01.090 --> 09:04.693
“the things God did among 
the nations through his ministry.” 


09:04.693 --> 09:07.930
After hearing 
Paul’s extraordinary account, 


09:07.930 --> 09:10.098
the older men revealed to Paul 


09:10.098 --> 09:14.136
a problem in Judea 
that involved him personally. 


09:14.137 --> 09:19.675
Read what they said 
at Acts 21:21: 


09:19.675 --> 09:23.278
“But they [the Jewish believers] 
have heard it rumored about you 


09:23.278 --> 09:25.280
“that you have been teaching 
all the Jews 


09:25.280 --> 09:29.052
“among the nations 
an apostasy from Moses, 


09:29.052 --> 09:31.920
“telling them 
not to circumcise their children


09:31.920 --> 09:35.592
or to follow the customary practices.”


09:35.592 --> 09:39.062
Well, perhaps Paul thought, 
‘Me, an apostate? 


09:39.062 --> 09:41.630
‘Really? 
How can they say such a thing? 


09:41.630 --> 09:44.133
‘I just finished 
my third missionary tour, 


09:44.133 --> 09:46.768
and look how 
Jehovah blessed the work!’ 


09:46.768 --> 09:51.140
Nevertheless, the older men 
gave Paul very clear direction 


09:51.140 --> 09:54.477
at Acts 21:23, 24 


09:54.477 --> 09:56.645
that he likely did not anticipate, 


09:56.645 --> 09:58.647
and there it reads: 


09:58.647 --> 10:00.717
“So do what we tell you: 


10:00.717 --> 10:03.987
“We have four men who have put 
themselves under a vow. 


10:03.987 --> 10:06.422
“Take these men with you 
and cleanse yourself 


10:06.422 --> 10:10.059
“ceremonially together with them 
and take care of their expenses, 


10:10.058 --> 10:12.060
“so that they may have 
their heads shaved. 


10:12.060 --> 10:14.230
“Then everyone will know 
that there is nothing


10:14.230 --> 10:16.432
“to the rumors 
they were told about you,


10:16.432 --> 10:21.304
but that you are walking orderly 
and you are also keeping the Law.”


10:21.303 --> 10:24.006
Was this the time 
for Paul to question 


10:24.007 --> 10:26.742
their decision 
or demand his rights? 


10:26.742 --> 10:28.777
He could have reasoned: 


10:28.777 --> 10:31.047
‘Didn’t you read my letter 
to the Galatians, 


10:31.047 --> 10:34.617
‘where it says the Law was nailed 
to the torture stake with Jesus? 


10:34.617 --> 10:36.619
‘I did nothing wrong! 


10:36.618 --> 10:38.988
‘Why do I have to put on 
this pretense 


10:38.988 --> 10:41.323
just because a few 
are overly sensitive?’ 


10:41.323 --> 10:43.325
No. 


10:43.325 --> 10:45.527
He humbly did 
as they requested, 


10:45.527 --> 10:48.064
although it 
nearly cost him his life. 


10:48.063 --> 10:50.866
Yes, it meant swallowing his pride, 


10:50.867 --> 10:52.969
but Paul knew 
there were bigger issues 


10:52.968 --> 10:55.270
involved than his personal rights. 


10:55.270 --> 10:59.108
He was considerate 
of the consciences of others. 


10:59.108 --> 11:01.143
But more importantly, 


11:01.143 --> 11:05.681
he showed his loyalty to Jehovah 
and to the governing body. 


11:05.682 --> 11:09.485
Do we see 
the bigger issue in our life? 


11:09.485 --> 11:12.622
Let us be determined 
to be humble,


11:12.622 --> 11:15.692
flexible, 
and obedient like Paul, 


11:15.692 --> 11:18.760
and thereby 
prove ourselves faithful 


11:18.760 --> 11:21.000
to “the faithful and discreet slave.”


11:22.998 --> 11:25.768
Third, we can be loyal to Jehovah 


11:25.768 --> 11:27.870
by being loyal to the elders. 


11:27.870 --> 11:32.073
We’ve discussed loyalty to Jehovah himself 
and to the faithful slave,


11:32.073 --> 11:34.243
but what about direction 
we receive 


11:34.243 --> 11:37.145
from the elders 
in our congregation? 


11:37.145 --> 11:39.315
We listen 
to our elders give talks 


11:39.315 --> 11:41.350
and comments 
at the meetings each week, 


11:41.350 --> 11:43.352
we work with them 
in the ministry, 


11:43.352 --> 11:45.354
and we associate 
with them. 


11:45.353 --> 11:48.256
This regular contact 
gives us more opportunities 


11:48.257 --> 11:51.960
to see their imperfections 
and flaws. 


11:51.960 --> 11:55.163
We could begin to focus 
on their weaknesses, 


11:55.163 --> 11:58.800
weakening our trust 
in God’s arrangement. 


11:58.800 --> 12:01.337
For example, if you zoom in 


12:01.337 --> 12:03.739
on any of our pictures 
in our magazines, 


12:03.738 --> 12:07.241
all you’ll see are colored spots or pixels. 


12:07.242 --> 12:09.245
But when you zoom out, 


12:09.245 --> 12:12.448
you see a beautiful photo or painting. 


12:12.448 --> 12:15.583
Similarly, when looking at our elders, 


12:15.583 --> 12:19.121
don’t zoom in on their imperfections
—the spots of ink—


12:19.122 --> 12:22.324
rather, see the big picture.


12:22.323 --> 12:24.993
Why, then, is it so important 


12:24.993 --> 12:28.430
to strengthen our loyalty 
to our hard-working, loving shepherds? 


12:28.430 --> 12:30.532
Because these “gifts in men” 


12:30.532 --> 12:33.535
are an expression 
of Jehovah’s loyal love 


12:33.535 --> 12:36.305
as they loyally lead, feed, 


12:36.305 --> 12:38.807
and protect 
his precious sheep. 


12:38.807 --> 12:42.077
As the great tribulation nears, 
our survival will depend 


12:42.077 --> 12:44.647
on our readiness 
to respond to their direction, 


12:44.647 --> 12:47.950
as they follow 
the Governing Body’s direction. 


12:47.950 --> 12:50.652
Our loyalty is not to men, 


12:50.652 --> 12:52.655
but to Jehovah’s arrangement 


12:52.655 --> 12:55.623
made up of imperfect, 
but loyal men.


12:55.623 --> 12:58.693
That is a lesson 
that Korah, Dathan, 


12:58.693 --> 13:01.496
and Abiram refused to learn. 


13:01.497 --> 13:05.034
In this clip from the video 
Respect Jehovah’s Authority, 


13:05.033 --> 13:08.303
listen to Korah’s defiant attitude 
toward Moses 


13:08.303 --> 13:10.940
as taken 
from Numbers chapter 16.


13:10.940 --> 13:13.000
There’s Moses.


13:18.380 --> 13:21.017
That is enough of you 


13:21.017 --> 13:24.687
because the whole assembly 
are all of them holy 


13:24.687 --> 13:27.000
and Jehovah is in their midst. 


13:28.557 --> 13:34.062
Why, then, should you lift yourselves up 
above the congregation of Jehovah?


13:34.062 --> 13:38.667
Korah and the others 
made great pretenses of loyalty to God, 


13:38.667 --> 13:41.170
but completely ignored the fact 


13:41.170 --> 13:45.842
that Jehovah directly appointed 
Moses and Aaron. 


13:45.842 --> 13:49.044
Who, then, were 
they really murmuring against? 


13:49.043 --> 13:53.115
Notice Numbers 26:9: 


13:53.115 --> 13:57.085
“This Dathan and Abiram 
were chosen ones of the assembly 


13:57.085 --> 14:00.355
“who fought against Moses 
and Aaron along with Korah’s group 


14:00.355 --> 14:05.293
when they fought against Jehovah.”


14:05.293 --> 14:09.398
While focusing on the man Moses 
and his imperfections, 


14:09.398 --> 14:14.203
they did not really see that it was Jehovah 
who was directing the nation. 


14:14.203 --> 14:17.740
They were actually fighting 
against Jehovah. 


14:17.740 --> 14:21.910
Their disloyalty to God’s appointed men
cost them their lives. 


14:21.910 --> 14:24.980
But Korah’s sons 
made a different choice. 


14:24.980 --> 14:29.652
In this next clip, notice an attitude 
far different from their father’s.


14:29.652 --> 14:32.655
My father and his companions


14:32.655 --> 14:35.892
actually rebelled 
against Jehovah’s authority.


14:35.892 --> 14:39.362
Their envy, pride, 
and ambition led to rebellion, 


14:39.362 --> 14:42.832
and in the end they brought 
dishonor upon themselves. 


14:42.832 --> 14:47.670
My father sought glory, 
but his glory was short-lived. 


14:47.670 --> 14:52.507
I’m glad, though, that my brothers 
and I took the right side of the issue.


14:52.507 --> 14:55.077
It must have been hard though.


14:55.077 --> 14:57.680
Yes, it was. 


14:57.680 --> 15:00.815
But that helps us to understand 
how important it is 


15:00.815 --> 15:04.152
that we do not allow 
friendships or family 


15:04.152 --> 15:07.355
to take priority 
over our relationship with Jehovah 


15:07.355 --> 15:09.592
and our obedience to him.


15:09.592 --> 15:12.494
That’s what Father 
has always told me.


15:12.493 --> 15:14.863
Mmm, yes. 


15:14.863 --> 15:18.400
Ultimately, successful direction 
for us humans 


15:18.400 --> 15:20.435
comes from Jehovah. 


15:20.435 --> 15:24.707
We should completely trust 
in his choices of appointed ones. 


15:24.707 --> 15:28.877
You see, respect for those 
whom Jehovah has appointed 


15:28.877 --> 15:32.000
shows respect 
for Jehovah’s authority.


15:33.482 --> 15:35.884
The loyalty displayed by Korah’s sons 


15:35.883 --> 15:40.221
moved Jehovah to act 
in loyalty by sparing their lives. 


15:40.222 --> 15:43.625
What fine examples 
for us to imitate! 


15:43.625 --> 15:46.995
May we never find ourselves 
fighting against Jehovah 


15:46.995 --> 15:49.163
by murmuring 
or complaining against those 


15:49.163 --> 15:52.668
who he has appointed 
to lead his people today. 


15:52.668 --> 15:55.503
To see more 
of the good and the bad examples 


15:55.503 --> 15:57.571
of loyalty 
among the Israelites, 


15:57.572 --> 16:01.844
we encourage you to watch the entire 
Respect Jehovah’s Authority video 


16:01.843 --> 16:03.878
on JW Broadcasting.


16:03.878 --> 16:08.316
In review, how can we show 
our loyalty to Jehovah? 


16:08.317 --> 16:12.855
First, by coming to his defense 
as his Witnesses.


16:12.855 --> 16:15.857
Second, by maintaining our loyal support 


16:15.857 --> 16:18.227
of “the faithful and discreet slave.”


16:18.227 --> 16:22.865
And third, by loyally following direction 
from the appointed elders.


16:22.865 --> 16:27.335
As you imitate faithful examples 
like the sons of Korah, 


16:27.335 --> 16:29.738
like David, Peter, and Paul, 


16:29.738 --> 16:33.108
you will prove to be someone 
Jehovah views as loyal


16:33.108 --> 16:49.375
—worthy of receiving 
his acts of loyalty forever.
