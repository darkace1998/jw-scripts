Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:06.623 --> 00:00:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my friend and cohost, Izak Marais.

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:15.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Izak, what’s in store
for this month’s program?

00:00:15.498 --> 00:00:17.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Lösch.

00:00:17.534 --> 00:00:20.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month we’ll examine the many ways

00:00:20.437 --> 00:00:24.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah assures us that he is with us.

00:00:24.207 --> 00:00:27.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our music video for this month shows how,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the moment
that we start to take steps

00:00:30.013 --> 00:00:32.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward dedication and baptism,

00:00:32.282 --> 00:00:34.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah draws close to us.

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:37.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is also with us in the ministry.

00:00:37.987 --> 00:00:40.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this report, we’ll see how he blessed

00:00:40.523 --> 00:00:43.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a special preaching effort in Europe.

00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:48.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is with us
as we meet challenges of daily life,

00:00:48.798 --> 00:00:52.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as our Sister Reeta and her children learned.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That sounds exciting!

00:00:55.905 --> 00:00:57.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s get started.

00:00:57.907 --> 00:01:02.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the November 2019 edition
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.866 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Millions have benefited

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:24.501 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from the animated series

00:01:24.501 --> 00:01:26.402 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i><i> </i>

00:01:26.402 --> 00:01:29.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and many other Bible-based videos.

00:01:29.339 --> 00:01:33.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you enjoyed
getting to know Caleb and Sophia?

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:35.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’ve watched a video,

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:37.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perhaps you’ve wondered:

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How does the Governing Body know
that the video will turn out exactly right?

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:47.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can they see and hear
the video before it exists?’

00:01:47.023 --> 00:01:50.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go behind the scenes
and see how this works.

00:01:55.465 --> 00:01:57.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Animated videos,

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:01.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like those in the series
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend,</i><i> </i>

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been helping young ones
draw closer to their heavenly Father

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for several years now.

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:08.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look, Mom, I’m rejoicing in the hope!

00:02:08.912 --> 00:02:10.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Wee!

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But did you know

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what you see on the screen

00:02:18.755 --> 00:02:21.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might last just a few short minutes

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:26.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it may involve weeks of work

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by a virtual army of volunteers?

00:02:31.267 --> 00:02:35.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With so much time and expense
involved in making an animated video,

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a lot of careful planning
is required to avoid waste

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to keep
the process running smoothly.

00:02:42.545 --> 00:02:45.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look at how the effective use

00:02:45.448 --> 00:02:49.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of preproduction tools
help all of these brothers and sisters

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
work together to take a video

00:02:51.554 --> 00:02:54.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from initial concept to final production.

00:02:54.791 --> 00:02:59.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Under the direction of the Teaching Committee
of the Governing Body,

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:02.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the work begins
long before the artists even get started.

00:03:03.366 --> 00:03:07.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They provide direction
on the theme that needs to be taught.

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Members of the animation team collaborate

00:03:10.707 --> 00:03:14.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop the featured characters
as well as plot structure,

00:03:14.477 --> 00:03:18.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they work closely
with writers and storyboard artists

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:22.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop the approved idea
into a story line.

00:03:23.953 --> 00:03:25.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once a complete script is ready,

00:03:25.755 --> 00:03:28.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the whole team
gathers together for a table read.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:34.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the first time the team
hears the whole script being read aloud.

00:03:34.297 --> 00:03:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dialogue is meant to be heard.

00:03:36.332 --> 00:03:38.301 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So when we read it aloud at the table read,

00:03:38.301 --> 00:03:39.669 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we pick up on things

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:41.437 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we didn’t see in the written script.

00:03:41.437 --> 00:03:43.006 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re able to tighten the story

00:03:43.006 --> 00:03:44.741 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and make it as clear as possible.

00:03:44.741 --> 00:03:49.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The script is reviewed
by the research team for accuracy.

00:03:49.245 --> 00:03:52.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then it’s revised, polished, and submitted

00:03:52.348 --> 00:03:54.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Teaching Committee for approval.

00:03:54.517 --> 00:03:57.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With an approved script in hand,

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the director then works with an artist

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start turning words into pictures

00:04:04.294 --> 00:04:06.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—visualizing each scene on a storyboard.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First come the rough boards,

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:12.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
showing what will be included in each shot.

00:04:12.435 --> 00:04:15.071 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to the animation world, really,

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:16.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
everything you see on screen

00:04:16.806 --> 00:04:19.042 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
has to be designed and created

00:04:19.042 --> 00:04:20.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the characters,

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:21.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the furniture,

00:04:21.878 --> 00:04:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the props, the environment

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:25.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are all created by a designer.

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The storyboard really helps us

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:30.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
figure out exactly what we need to create

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we’re not creating
too much or too little.

00:04:35.024 --> 00:04:37.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once approved by the director,

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the storyboard artist
cleans up each of the boards.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preliminary recordings of dialogue, music,

00:04:45.835 --> 00:04:50.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sound effects are added.

00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are then used by the director

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:57.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and compositor to create an animatic.

00:04:57.046 --> 00:05:01.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An animatic
is a rough draft of the entire video.

00:05:01.918 --> 00:05:04.487 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The animatic is very important for us.

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:06.489 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
That way the director

00:05:06.489 --> 00:05:08.858 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and, more importantly, the Teaching Committee

00:05:08.858 --> 00:05:11.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can see the entire video
before we are actually making it.

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:15.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with that they can review it
and give us the proper direction.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:18.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The finished animatic is submitted

00:05:18.568 --> 00:05:20.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the Teaching Committee for review.

00:05:20.603 --> 00:05:23.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Based on direction from the committee,

00:05:23.106 --> 00:05:27.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the team makes sure
that the teaching points come across clearly

00:05:27.577 --> 00:05:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the finished product
is true to the spirit

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:34.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and intent
of the approved concept for the video.

00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:39.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, using the approved
animatic as a blueprint,

00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
full production begins.

00:05:45.395 --> 00:05:49.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, everything in animation
can be very time-consuming.

00:05:50.933 --> 00:05:53.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An animator working full-time here at Bethel

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may be able to produce
four to six seconds of animation in one week,

00:05:58.808 --> 00:06:01.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that doesn’t even include other aspects

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:03.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are very important, such as modeling,

00:06:03.446 --> 00:06:07.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rigging, lighting,
compositing, and many others.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:10.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the examples shown here,

00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:13.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can see
just how closely the final version

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the video <i>Make Jehovah Happy</i><i> </i>
follows the animatic.

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preproduction tools
such as storyboards and animatics

00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do more than save
the organization time and money.

00:06:28.304 --> 00:06:30.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They enable the Teaching Committee

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carefully evaluate
every project along the way

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:37.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the initial approved concept

00:06:37.313 --> 00:06:39.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the final product

00:06:39.182 --> 00:06:41.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to keep providing videos

00:06:41.584 --> 00:06:45.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that help all of us
honor our Friend, Jehovah.

00:06:50.359 --> 00:06:53.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it amazing to see all the work

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:56.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that goes into our videos?

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:58.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah provides for his people

00:06:58.534 --> 00:07:02.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just what they need at the right time.

00:07:02.271 --> 00:07:06.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, he is with his people.

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:07.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Lösch,

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:10.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know you have some thoughts on this.

00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:12.381 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to talk

00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:14.784 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about a very common expression

00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:16.185 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible.

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:17.887 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The expression is:

00:07:17.887 --> 00:07:20.056 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“I am with you.”

00:07:20.957 --> 00:07:25.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thirteen times it’s attributed
to a statement from Jehovah.

00:07:25.862 --> 00:07:29.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three times it’s something that Jesus said

00:07:29.298 --> 00:07:32.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to one or more of his disciples.

00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, there are dozens of other times

00:07:35.705 --> 00:07:40.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the same sentiment
is expressed using similar wording.

00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:45.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Few things in the world
equal the joy humans experience

00:07:45.915 --> 00:07:48.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the birth of a child.

00:07:48.117 --> 00:07:50.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As children grow up,

00:07:50.453 --> 00:07:53.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are sometimes exposed to situations

00:07:53.523 --> 00:07:55.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that tend to cause nervousness

00:07:55.525 --> 00:07:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even fear.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a parent may occasionally feel compelled

00:08:00.796 --> 00:08:02.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reassure a child:

00:08:02.798 --> 00:08:06.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have no fear; I am with you.”

00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:12.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves his servants
as if they were his children.

00:08:12.275 --> 00:08:15.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, at John 13:1,

00:08:15.745 --> 00:08:19.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ feelings for his disciples
are well expressed.

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:21.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says:

00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:25.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus, having loved his own
who were in the world,

00:08:25.855 --> 00:08:29.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loved them to the end.”

00:08:29.258 --> 00:08:31.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we face fears,

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:34.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trials, or causes for anxiety,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:38.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both our heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus,

00:08:38.401 --> 00:08:42.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reassuringly say, “I am with you.”

00:08:43.306 --> 00:08:46.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the righteous man Noah.

00:08:46.042 --> 00:08:48.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 6:9 says

00:08:48.044 --> 00:08:51.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “Noah walked with the true God.”

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt that Jehovah was with Noah.

00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:59.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He preserved him
and his family through the Flood.

00:08:59.889 --> 00:09:04.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afterward,
Jehovah further proved he was with Noah.

00:09:04.894 --> 00:09:07.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Genesis chapter 9, Jehovah said:

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:10.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I am now establishing my covenant with you:

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Never again will all flesh be destroyed

00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:16.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the waters of a flood.’

00:09:16.472 --> 00:09:19.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah could have made that determination

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:23.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and promised himself
that he wouldn’t do that again,

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:26.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead, he reached out to Noah

00:09:26.515 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reassured him that he was with him

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:35.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making the rainbow covenant
with Noah and his offspring.

00:09:36.859 --> 00:09:39.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Using similar terminology,

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah indicated
that he was with Abraham,

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:44.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,

00:09:44.734 --> 00:09:48.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses, Joshua, and Gideon.

00:09:48.104 --> 00:09:52.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were all individuals
whom Jehovah was pleased with,

00:09:52.541 --> 00:09:56.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he reassured them that he was with them.

00:09:57.747 --> 00:10:00.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about for a group of people?

00:10:00.116 --> 00:10:03.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Jehovah moved to feel the same way

00:10:03.085 --> 00:10:07.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward a large crowd
of his servants collectively?

00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find with me Exodus 6:6, 7.

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:20.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole nation of Israel

00:10:20.102 --> 00:10:22.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was experiencing severe trials

00:10:22.505 --> 00:10:25.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suffering as slaves in Egypt.

00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:30.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Jehovah’s reassurance
to the vast number of people.

00:10:30.646 --> 00:10:33.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verses 6 and 7 state:

00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:37.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, say to the Israelites:

00:10:37.353 --> 00:10:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am Jehovah,

00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:43.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I will bring you out
from under the burdens of the Egyptians

00:10:43.292 --> 00:10:46.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and rescue you from their slavery,

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:50.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I will reclaim you
with an outstretched arm

00:10:50.132 --> 00:10:52.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and with great judgments.

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will take you in as my people,
and I will be your God,

00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:59.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and you will certainly know
that I am Jehovah your God

00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is bringing you out
from under the burdens of Egypt.’”

00:11:03.546 --> 00:11:08.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that great, mixed group of people
would follow his leadings,

00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:12.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said he’d ‘take them in’
and he ‘would be their God.’

00:11:12.154 --> 00:11:14.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was he saying?

00:11:14.156 --> 00:11:16.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was reassuring them:

00:11:16.559 --> 00:11:19.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will be with you,”

00:11:19.362 --> 00:11:21.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was.

00:11:21.364 --> 00:11:24.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For forty years in the wilderness,
he was with them

00:11:24.934 --> 00:11:28.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—feeding them, providing water for them,

00:11:28.003 --> 00:11:32.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ensuring that their clothes
and sandals would not wear out,

00:11:32.475 --> 00:11:36.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protecting them
from poisonous snakes, and so forth.

00:11:36.979 --> 00:11:39.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later, when entering the land of promise,

00:11:39.982 --> 00:11:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he protected them during enemy warfare.

00:11:44.687 --> 00:11:48.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promised to be with and to support

00:11:48.691 --> 00:11:50.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the kings of Israel

00:11:50.726 --> 00:11:54.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as they heeded
his commandments and direction.

00:11:55.297 --> 00:11:57.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Solomon was told:

00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:02.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah [your] God . . .
will not desert you or abandon you,

00:12:02.405 --> 00:12:04.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will be with you.”

00:12:06.008 --> 00:12:08.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Asa was informed:

00:12:08.544 --> 00:12:13.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is with you
as long as you remain with him.”

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:18.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When faced with overwhelming enemy forces,

00:12:18.888 --> 00:12:21.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Jehoshaphat was told:

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:25.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Tomorrow go out against them,
and Jehovah will be with you.”

00:12:27.496 --> 00:12:31.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also proved to be
with the many prophets

00:12:31.133 --> 00:12:33.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he sent out in his name.

00:12:33.202 --> 00:12:35.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just one example is Jeremiah.

00:12:36.038 --> 00:12:40.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine if you had Jeremiah’s assignment.

00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:42.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suppose you had been directed to deliver

00:12:42.845 --> 00:12:46.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a scathing denunciation and judgment

00:12:46.048 --> 00:12:50.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against wicked kings,
corrupt priests, and false prophets.

00:12:50.319 --> 00:12:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you feel?

00:12:52.321 --> 00:12:54.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
underqualified?

00:12:54.323 --> 00:12:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you feel like a little child

00:12:56.559 --> 00:13:00.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
challenging a whole group of evil grown-ups?

00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:05.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Jeremiah felt
as he expressed himself

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:10.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 1:6:

00:13:11.674 --> 00:13:15.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I said: ‘Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!

00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:20.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know how to speak,
for I am just a boy.’”

00:13:20.916 --> 00:13:25.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were Jehovah’s reassuring words
in reply?

00:13:25.421 --> 00:13:27.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 1:8, 9:

00:13:27.756 --> 00:13:29.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not be afraid

00:13:29.658 --> 00:13:34.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because of their appearance,
for “I am with you to save you,”

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:35.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah.’

00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:39.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jehovah stretched out his hand
and touched my mouth.

00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:44.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah said to me: 
‘I have put my words in your mouth.’”

00:13:44.974 --> 00:13:49.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah put the words
that you were to say “in your mouth,”

00:13:49.678 --> 00:13:53.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d no longer feel
like a little child, would you?

00:13:53.983 --> 00:13:58.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t think of Jeremiah
as being an incredible superman;

00:13:58.954 --> 00:14:01.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was a human like us.

00:14:01.524 --> 00:14:06.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s of interest that though Jeremiah
lived in another time and place,

00:14:06.529 --> 00:14:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he faced situations similar to those we face.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We interact with different types of people

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:18.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our daily life,
at work, and at school.

00:14:18.707 --> 00:14:21.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them can be intimidating.

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:23.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Jeremiah,

00:14:23.612 --> 00:14:28.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has commissioned us
to go to strangers and preach.

00:14:28.617 --> 00:14:31.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We share the good news of the Kingdom.

00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:36.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are interested;
others are just plain apathetic.

00:14:36.825 --> 00:14:40.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times, we may come
across someone who is angry

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:43.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may even be threatening.

00:14:43.632 --> 00:14:48.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the time to remember Jeremiah.

00:14:48.270 --> 00:14:50.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though initially timid,

00:14:50.673 --> 00:14:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he courageously faced

00:14:52.875 --> 00:14:57.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the challenge of an intimidating response.

00:14:57.012 --> 00:15:00.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he rally to the occasion?

00:15:00.382 --> 00:15:04.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was because Jehovah had reassured him:

00:15:04.019 --> 00:15:07.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am with you.”

00:15:07.323 --> 00:15:11.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“I have put my words in your mouth.”

00:15:13.495 --> 00:15:17.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah do something similar for us?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:15:18.934 --> 00:15:22.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long after Jeremiah
and the other faithful ones

00:15:22.404 --> 00:15:26.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are recorded
in the Hebrew Scriptures came and went,

00:15:26.575 --> 00:15:29.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has proved to be
with true Christians,

00:15:29.945 --> 00:15:32.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both past and present.

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:37.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find with me John chapter 8.

00:15:40.723 --> 00:15:42.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of Jesus.

00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:45.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true he was a perfect man,

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:47.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but did Jehovah leave him all alone?

00:15:47.997 --> 00:15:52.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 8:16,
what did Jesus himself say?

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:58.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And yet even if I do judge,
my judgment is truthful,

00:15:58.207 --> 00:16:00.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because I am not alone,

00:16:00.209 --> 00:16:03.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the Father who sent me is with me.”

00:16:03.746 --> 00:16:08.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might be thinking
of that intimidating person in the ministry.

00:16:08.584 --> 00:16:13.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if you are facing the person
without a fellow Witness standing beside you,

00:16:13.589 --> 00:16:17.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you really all alone?

00:16:17.526 --> 00:16:21.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew that at the most stressful

00:16:21.096 --> 00:16:23.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and emotionally draining time

00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:25.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during his human life,

00:16:25.668 --> 00:16:29.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his disciples would leave him all alone.

00:16:29.438 --> 00:16:32.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was he really alone?

00:16:32.574 --> 00:16:35.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the inspired account

00:16:35.711 --> 00:16:37.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 16:32.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:41.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, these are Jesus’ own words:

00:16:41.517 --> 00:16:44.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! The hour is coming,
indeed, it has come,

00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:48.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when each one of you
will be scattered to his own house

00:16:48.824 --> 00:16:51.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will leave me alone.

00:16:51.226 --> 00:16:53.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I am not alone,

00:16:53.662 --> 00:16:56.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Father is with me.”

00:16:56.965 --> 00:17:01.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was not alone
during his most anxious moments.

00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:04.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with him.

00:17:04.239 --> 00:17:06.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think you are alone

00:17:06.775 --> 00:17:10.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standing at the door
of an irritated householder,

00:17:10.045 --> 00:17:12.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think again.

00:17:12.114 --> 00:17:14.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:17:14.283 --> 00:17:16.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have more with you

00:17:16.351 --> 00:17:19.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than if you had your whole congregation

00:17:19.521 --> 00:17:23.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standing in the person’s front yard.

00:17:24.259 --> 00:17:26.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why did Jesus share

00:17:26.929 --> 00:17:30.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this precious insight with us?

00:17:30.032 --> 00:17:32.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the next verse.

00:17:32.334 --> 00:17:36.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus explains his reason
for saying what he did.

00:17:36.405 --> 00:17:39.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 16:33:

00:17:39.408 --> 00:17:41.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have said these things to you

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that by means of me you may have peace.

00:17:45.013 --> 00:17:47.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the world you will have tribulation,

00:17:47.983 --> 00:17:49.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but take courage!

00:17:49.985 --> 00:17:52.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have conquered the world.”

00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:55.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Jesus for addressing

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:59.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fears and concerns when giving a witness.

00:17:59.061 --> 00:18:01.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of trembling with fear,

00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:05.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he shared his confidence in Jehovah’s support

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:08.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we “may have peace.”

00:18:08.170 --> 00:18:11.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He acknowledged
that we would face tribulation,

00:18:11.740 --> 00:18:14.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he said
that we could look at his example

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:18.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have courage
to deal with the tribulation.

00:18:18.247 --> 00:18:20.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:18:20.249 --> 00:18:22.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said in verse 32

00:18:22.451 --> 00:18:25.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was
because ‘the Father was with him.’

00:18:26.789 --> 00:18:30.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall that Jehovah told Jeremiah:

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:33.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have put my words in your mouth?”

00:18:33.495 --> 00:18:36.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can Jehovah do the same for us

00:18:36.565 --> 00:18:40.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are opposed by unbelievers?

00:18:40.803 --> 00:18:45.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Christian Greek Scriptures
answer with a resounding yes!

00:18:46.775 --> 00:18:49.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along with the reading

00:18:49.011 --> 00:18:52.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the book of Mark chapter 13,

00:18:53.916 --> 00:18:58.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and please notice
that the setting Jesus describes

00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:01.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in the ministry,
preaching the good news.

00:19:02.591 --> 00:19:05.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve had a good morning in service,

00:19:05.694 --> 00:19:08.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then you take one more door.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The person is irate
and even calls the police.

00:19:12.701 --> 00:19:14.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should you do?

00:19:14.903 --> 00:19:19.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you say when the police arrive?

00:19:19.107 --> 00:19:22.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to be overly concerned.

00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:24.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:19:24.479 --> 00:19:27.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because similar to Jeremiah,

00:19:27.115 --> 00:19:31.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will, in effect,
put His words in your mouth.

00:19:31.987 --> 00:19:36.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark 13:10, 11 says:

00:19:36.625 --> 00:19:41.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, in all the nations,
the good news has to be preached first.

00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:46.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And when they are taking you
to hand you over,

00:19:46.235 --> 00:19:50.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not be anxious beforehand
about what to say;

00:19:50.472 --> 00:19:54.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whatever is given you
in that hour, say this,

00:19:54.343 --> 00:19:58.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you are not the ones speaking,

00:19:58.247 --> 00:20:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the holy spirit is.”

00:20:00.849 --> 00:20:03.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By this, do we mean that Jehovah

00:20:03.685 --> 00:20:08.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will miraculously put words
in your mouth for you to say?

00:20:09.491 --> 00:20:11.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:20:11.493 --> 00:20:13.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice verse 11 said

00:20:13.595 --> 00:20:18.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the holy spirit” is the one speaking?

00:20:18.533 --> 00:20:23.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been taught the basis
for your faith from the Scriptures,

00:20:23.438 --> 00:20:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you know the reason
that you teach the Bible’s message.

00:20:27.876 --> 00:20:31.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s all stored in your mind.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:34.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the holy spirit’s role

00:20:34.516 --> 00:20:37.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are in an intimidating situation

00:20:37.786 --> 00:20:40.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when sharing the good news?

00:20:41.423 --> 00:20:44.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:20:44.026 --> 00:20:47.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He uses his holy spirit
to bring to the surface

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:52.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of those precious gems
that might be buried in your mind.

00:20:52.668 --> 00:20:56.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be amazed at what you remember

00:20:56.438 --> 00:20:59.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when put under pressure by the authorities

00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:03.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even by outright opposers.

00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:06.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, Jehovah is with you.

00:21:07.316 --> 00:21:12.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add to the fact that Jesus is with you
in the disciple-making work.

00:21:13.956 --> 00:21:18.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s be reminded
of this very encouraging thought

00:21:18.961 --> 00:21:23.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 28:19, 20.

00:21:23.665 --> 00:21:26.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was discussing our commission

00:21:26.735 --> 00:21:29.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach, teach, and make disciples.

00:21:29.604 --> 00:21:33.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how does he conclude
the Bible book of Matthew?

00:21:33.475 --> 00:21:38.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Matthew 28:19, 20:

00:21:39.481 --> 00:21:44.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, therefore, and make disciples
of people of all the nations,

00:21:44.486 --> 00:21:47.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:21:47.522 --> 00:21:50.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and of the Son and of the holy spirit,

00:21:50.459 --> 00:21:55.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“teaching them to observe
all the things I have commanded you.

00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:58.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And look!
I am with you all the days

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the conclusion
of the system of things.”

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:05.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that he is with us now

00:22:05.774 --> 00:22:09.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are making disciples
and teaching people the truth.

00:22:09.978 --> 00:22:14.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he promises
he’ll support us in this important work

00:22:14.983 --> 00:22:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the end
of this wicked system of things.

00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:23.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As prophesied, during this time
of the conclusion of the system,

00:22:23.859 --> 00:22:28.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are being persecuted
in different areas of the world.

00:22:28.764 --> 00:22:32.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the Scriptures show,
Satan and his angels

00:22:32.701 --> 00:22:36.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are “misleading the entire inhabited earth.”

00:22:36.338 --> 00:22:40.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, Jehovah’s people
have been persecuted in Russia.

00:22:40.842 --> 00:22:42.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But will the persecution

00:22:42.878 --> 00:22:45.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
succeed in eliminating

00:22:45.247 --> 00:22:48.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true worship in that area of the world?

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:22:49.851 --> 00:22:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:22:51.353 --> 00:22:55.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because Jehovah is with them.

00:22:55.157 --> 00:22:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and Jesus promised: “I am with you.”

00:23:00.562 --> 00:23:03.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia did not learn from the past.

00:23:03.198 --> 00:23:05.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will prove to be the same for them

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:09.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it was for Nazi Germany under Hitler.

00:23:09.304 --> 00:23:11.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hitler thought his regime

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could eradicate
true worship and God’s people

00:23:14.643 --> 00:23:16.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from areas under their control.

00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:19.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they made a big mistake.

00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:23.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While it is true
that they murdered some 2,000 brothers,

00:23:23.585 --> 00:23:27.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the end, their scheme ended up in failure.

00:23:27.422 --> 00:23:28.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:23:28.723 --> 00:23:33.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because God was with us, not with them.

00:23:34.963 --> 00:23:37.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God with us”

00:23:37.032 --> 00:23:40.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those words have decorated national emblems

00:23:40.502 --> 00:23:43.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the uniforms of soldiers of Prussia

00:23:43.738 --> 00:23:46.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Czarist Russian Empire.

00:23:46.441 --> 00:23:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These words were also
on the belts of German troops

00:23:50.412 --> 00:23:55.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they marched into Belgium
in the year 1914 of our Common Era.

00:23:55.417 --> 00:23:57.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they had it wrong!

00:23:57.752 --> 00:24:02.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah
was with us, not with them.

00:24:02.757 --> 00:24:05.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s with all of us now.

00:24:05.961 --> 00:24:08.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be with us during Armageddon.

00:24:08.663 --> 00:24:11.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be with us after Armageddon.

00:24:11.299 --> 00:24:15.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be with us at the end
of the Thousand Year Reign of Christ.

00:24:15.837 --> 00:24:20.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be with mankind
at the end of 100,000 years.

00:24:20.842 --> 00:24:25.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be with humans
at the end of 100 million years

00:24:25.013 --> 00:24:30.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the end of 100 million years
times 100 million years.

00:24:30.585 --> 00:24:34.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will be with mankind <i>forever,</i>

00:24:34.289 --> 00:24:36.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so will Jesus!

00:24:36.291 --> 00:24:38.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are both on record as saying:

00:24:38.693 --> 00:24:41.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am with you”!

00:24:42.297 --> 00:24:46.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you very much, Brother Lösch.

00:24:46.001 --> 00:24:49.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Jehovah is with his people everywhere.

00:24:49.638 --> 00:24:52.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to see examples of this next.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First is the experience
of Adam and Nancy Solomon.

00:24:55.911 --> 00:24:57.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they came into the truth,

00:24:57.913 --> 00:25:01.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they faced bitter opposition
from their families.

00:25:01.316 --> 00:25:06.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Jehovah was with them
during this stressful time.

00:25:08.123 --> 00:25:12.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family are Hungarian Jews.

00:25:12.527 --> 00:25:16.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of them were killed
in concentration camps.

00:25:16.464 --> 00:25:21.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something
that the Holocaust took from me

00:25:21.069 --> 00:25:23.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it took the concept of family.

00:25:23.538 --> 00:25:25.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed explanations.

00:25:25.373 --> 00:25:28.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to know why my family was murdered.

00:25:28.043 --> 00:25:32.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It made me really search
at a very young age to see

00:25:32.881 --> 00:25:36.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if there was a real religion out there.

00:25:36.851 --> 00:25:39.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just a secular thing to be Jewish;

00:25:39.688 --> 00:25:42.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was a cultural thing.

00:25:42.023 --> 00:25:45.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A friend of mine came up to me and said:

00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:48.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have to tell you something.

00:25:48.396 --> 00:25:52.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I got this book
from one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:25:52.167 --> 00:25:55.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the most beautiful book
I have ever read.”

00:25:55.670 --> 00:25:58.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Oh, I’ll read it.”

00:25:58.173 --> 00:26:01.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it couldn’t have been a week later

00:26:01.209 --> 00:26:04.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I got a knock on my door, and there were

00:26:04.846 --> 00:26:09.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
two young women at the door
who started to talk to me about the Bible.

00:26:11.419 --> 00:26:15.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once I started having a study
on a regular basis with Carolyn,

00:26:15.624 --> 00:26:17.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I enjoyed it more and more.

00:26:17.626 --> 00:26:21.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day my father was home.

00:26:21.129 --> 00:26:23.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He just screamed at them

00:26:23.732 --> 00:26:25.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and basically threw them out of the house.

00:26:25.934 --> 00:26:28.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It just progressed after that.

00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:31.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was just no peace at any time

00:26:31.306 --> 00:26:33.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a lot of tears.

00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:35.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I just couldn’t understand

00:26:35.543 --> 00:26:38.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why they weren’t even asking me:

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:41.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, what is it
that you like about this religion?

00:26:41.116 --> 00:26:42.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who are these people?

00:26:42.284 --> 00:26:44.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let us talk to—”
No, nothing.

00:26:44.419 --> 00:26:47.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very, very hard.

00:26:47.756 --> 00:26:50.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after my baptism,

00:26:50.425 --> 00:26:53.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my mother came up to me, and she said:

00:26:53.762 --> 00:26:56.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Your father and I are going out for the day.

00:26:56.164 --> 00:26:59.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You better not be here when we get home.”

00:26:59.434 --> 00:27:01.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was 17 years old.

00:27:01.403 --> 00:27:03.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know where I was going to go.

00:27:03.405 --> 00:27:05.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t know what I was going to do.

00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I trusted in Jehovah.

00:27:07.809 --> 00:27:10.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I picked up the phone,
and I called my Carolyn.

00:27:11.746 --> 00:27:15.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In what seemed like minutes,
there were brothers and sisters at the house.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:20.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were putting my things into this truck
and bringing it over to Carolyn’s house.

00:27:20.422 --> 00:27:22.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said, “You can live with me.”

00:27:25.327 --> 00:27:27.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before I was baptized,
I would drive back and forth 

00:27:27.796 --> 00:27:30.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to school with a friend of mine.

00:27:30.365 --> 00:27:33.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Little by little,
I was telling him what I was learning.

00:27:33.435 --> 00:27:36.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said: “You know,
I want to meet these people. 

00:27:36.237 --> 00:27:37.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have some questions.”

00:27:37.706 --> 00:27:38.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had questions. 

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked them:
“Why do we die?, 

00:27:40.308 --> 00:27:42.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why do we grow old?,”
and so forth and so on.

00:27:42.644 --> 00:27:45.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they went right to the Bible,

00:27:45.013 --> 00:27:48.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I left the house after that,

00:27:48.149 --> 00:27:50.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “This is the truth!”

00:27:50.352 --> 00:27:54.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Growing up in my house,
going to church every Sunday

00:27:54.222 --> 00:27:56.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was something that you had to do.

00:27:56.558 --> 00:28:00.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when I became a teenager,
then religion became less in my life,

00:28:00.195 --> 00:28:01.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and basketball became more.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being a young man, you’d watch sports

00:28:04.532 --> 00:28:06.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you’d see
that sports players made a lot of money.

00:28:06.868 --> 00:28:08.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My teachers would tell my parents:

00:28:08.903 --> 00:28:10.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He’s going to be a good basketball player.

00:28:10.405 --> 00:28:11.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Take care of him.

00:28:11.506 --> 00:28:12.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He could be worth, you know,

00:28:12.907 --> 00:28:15.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several hundred thousand dollars
by the time he graduates.”

00:28:15.810 --> 00:28:20.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I received over 125 scholarships.

00:28:20.148 --> 00:28:22.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now you’re talking about a free education

00:28:22.484 --> 00:28:24.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just because you can play basketball.

00:28:26.054 --> 00:28:29.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I realized, you know,
at an early age that playing 

00:28:29.524 --> 00:28:31.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
professional basketball could mean a lot,

00:28:31.726 --> 00:28:34.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only for me but for my family.

00:28:34.662 --> 00:28:38.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as far as God was concerned,
I had a little interest in God

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(like I would ask my mom questions),

00:28:40.201 --> 00:28:44.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it wasn’t until Nancy
brought me to the Witnesses

00:28:44.038 --> 00:28:46.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that really something just kicked in.

00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was studying,

00:28:48.009 --> 00:28:50.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my mom was downstairs in the basement.

00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:52.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard her crying,
and I said, “What’s wrong?”

00:28:52.213 --> 00:28:56.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And she said, “I know you’re going to become
one of those Jehovah’s Witnesses.”

00:28:56.217 --> 00:28:58.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So realizing in my mind

00:28:58.953 --> 00:29:01.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I’m not going to become
a basketball player

00:29:01.022 --> 00:29:02.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that I’m going to become
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:29:02.724 --> 00:29:04.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because that’s more important

00:29:04.726 --> 00:29:07.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that affected me many, many times.

00:29:08.363 --> 00:29:10.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When others found out

00:29:10.565 --> 00:29:12.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I was going to become
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 

00:29:12.567 --> 00:29:14.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people shied away.

00:29:14.135 --> 00:29:16.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People try to use you when they think

00:29:16.404 --> 00:29:18.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can give them something
or you’re going to be somebody big.

00:29:18.973 --> 00:29:21.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By going the direction
of serving Jehovah completely,

00:29:21.976 --> 00:29:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you lost all the worldly people
that you thought were your friends.

00:29:25.814 --> 00:29:28.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so that was

00:29:28.283 --> 00:29:31.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in one summer that I started
the study with Brother Crespo,

00:29:31.486 --> 00:29:34.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in six months, I was baptized.

00:29:34.456 --> 00:29:39.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we decided to get married.

00:29:39.327 --> 00:29:41.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture that says

00:29:41.396 --> 00:29:44.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘even if my own father
and my mother would abandon me,’

00:29:44.666 --> 00:29:47.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that even ‘Jehovah would take me in,’

00:29:47.135 --> 00:29:50.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it proved to be true in so many ways.

00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:54.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once you become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:29:54.075 --> 00:29:57.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re part of a family
that will do anything for you.

00:29:57.512 --> 00:29:59.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had adversity over the years,

00:29:59.681 --> 00:30:02.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah never said
everything was going to be perfect.

00:30:02.517 --> 00:30:05.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What he says is
that when you face these problems,

00:30:05.253 --> 00:30:07.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will not face them alone.

00:30:07.155 --> 00:30:11.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah has never let us down
when it comes to that.

00:30:12.727 --> 00:30:16.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When their families
and friends abandoned them,

00:30:16.564 --> 00:30:21.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did you notice how Jehovah
continued to be with Adam and Nancy?

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:26.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their spiritual family
immediately stepped in to support them.

00:30:26.875 --> 00:30:29.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appreciated what Nancy said:

00:30:29.344 --> 00:30:33.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Jehovah never said
everything will be perfect.

00:30:33.214 --> 00:30:36.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘He said that when you face problems,

00:30:36.184 --> 00:30:38.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will not face them alone.’

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She and Adam never felt alone.

00:30:43.725 --> 00:30:48.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Often, we ask Jehovah
to be with us when we need something

00:30:48.263 --> 00:30:52.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a spiritual need or a material need.

00:30:52.100 --> 00:30:55.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as we’ll see in this next experience,

00:30:55.069 --> 00:30:58.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before we know that we have a need,

00:30:58.473 --> 00:31:01.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah already knows what we need.

00:31:04.646 --> 00:31:06.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Reeta.

00:31:06.714 --> 00:31:10.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My son is Jackson,
and my daughter is Sherina.

00:31:10.451 --> 00:31:13.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just the three of us.

00:31:13.121 --> 00:31:16.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been working
on a tea estate as a tea picker.

00:31:16.758 --> 00:31:19.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, I prayed to God very hard.

00:31:19.928 --> 00:31:21.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said,

00:31:21.396 --> 00:31:24.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please help me to learn about the Bible.”

00:31:24.999 --> 00:31:28.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Within two days,
Jehovah’s Witnesses came

00:31:28.236 --> 00:31:31.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and knocked on my door,
and I agreed to study the Bible.

00:31:31.839 --> 00:31:33.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe it.

00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:38.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only prayed yesterday,
asking God to help me to study the Bible.

00:31:38.513 --> 00:31:41.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our meetings begin at 4:45 p.m.,

00:31:41.849 --> 00:31:45.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to get ready by 12 o’clock

00:31:45.019 --> 00:31:46.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to attend the meetings.

00:31:46.854 --> 00:31:49.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we prepare our bags
on Wednesday night.

00:31:52.493 --> 00:31:55.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I carry two big bags
on my shoulders

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and walk for three
and a half kilometers (2 mi)

00:31:57.198 --> 00:31:59.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get to the meetings on time.

00:32:01.536 --> 00:32:04.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We love seeing our brothers.

00:32:04.205 --> 00:32:06.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s why we always
go to the meetings early.

00:32:12.714 --> 00:32:17.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have been pioneering now
for a year and six months.

00:32:21.456 --> 00:32:25.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no greater happiness
than what comes from pioneering.

00:32:27.362 --> 00:32:30.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a onetime opportunity.

00:32:30.398 --> 00:32:35.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is why we decided that we should
give the best that we can to Jehovah.

00:32:38.439 --> 00:32:41.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I am so happy to be serving this way.

00:32:43.678 --> 00:32:48.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One time, I was not paid at all.

00:32:48.449 --> 00:32:51.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t even have a rupee.

00:32:54.956 --> 00:32:59.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that day, my children and I ate well.

00:32:59.994 --> 00:33:03.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after eating,
we were very worried

00:33:03.698 --> 00:33:06.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what we were going
to do the following day.

00:33:06.234 --> 00:33:10.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that night,
I said a prayer with the kids

00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:12.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we read the Bible.

00:33:15.977 --> 00:33:18.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said,

00:33:18.312 --> 00:33:20.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry about tomorrow.’

00:33:20.348 --> 00:33:23.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I trusted that somehow

00:33:23.451 --> 00:33:26.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah would give us what we needed.

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was 10:30 at night.

00:33:28.923 --> 00:33:33.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was fast asleep, and the phone rang.

00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:36.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Usually no one calls this late,

00:33:36.497 --> 00:33:39.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I wondered,
‘Who could be calling me this late?’

00:33:42.503 --> 00:33:46.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I picked up the phone,
and it was a brother on the line.

00:33:46.974 --> 00:33:51.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “Sister,
go to your bookshelf

00:33:51.145 --> 00:33:53.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take the Greatest Man book.”

00:33:57.752 --> 00:34:01.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he asked me to turn to a page.

00:34:01.189 --> 00:34:02.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I turned to that page,

00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:06.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were 10,000 rupees (about $55, U.S.)
between those pages.

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:08.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could not believe our eyes.

00:34:08.563 --> 00:34:12.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was exactly what we needed
for that month’s expenses.

00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:15.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few days earlier,
he and his wife had visited us

00:34:15.603 --> 00:34:18.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and secretly left the money
in the book before leaving.

00:34:18.406 --> 00:34:21.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I thanked Jehovah in prayer with the kids.

00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:25.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah already knew exactly what we needed

00:34:25.079 --> 00:34:26.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even before we realized it.

00:34:35.923 --> 00:34:40.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, every night I open the doors,

00:34:40.094 --> 00:34:44.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
go outside, and look up at the night sky.

00:34:44.732 --> 00:34:47.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I look up, I see many stars.

00:34:47.268 --> 00:34:50.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I daily meditate about his wisdom,

00:34:50.438 --> 00:34:54.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his power,
what amazing things he is able to do.

00:34:57.545 --> 00:35:00.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This earth, this universe

00:35:00.114 --> 00:35:04.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
 —how amazingly well he cares for them!

00:35:04.185 --> 00:35:07.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He takes care of the smallest thing.

00:35:07.255 --> 00:35:11.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I completely rely on Jehovah,

00:35:11.926 --> 00:35:16.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then I remember
that Jehovah has the ability

00:35:16.864 --> 00:35:20.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help us with his holy spirit.

00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:23.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s such a loving Father.

00:35:23.638 --> 00:35:28.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s always holding our hand tight,

00:35:28.075 --> 00:35:31.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no one can separate us from him.

00:35:31.779 --> 00:35:36.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anyone tries, they will fail.

00:35:38.653 --> 00:35:41.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s so generous with his love.

00:35:41.656 --> 00:35:44.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s so affectionate with us.

00:35:44.392 --> 00:35:49.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one can take away
the love Jehovah has for us.

00:35:51.699 --> 00:35:54.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice from Reeta’s experience

00:35:54.702 --> 00:35:58.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is with us in several ways?

00:35:58.372 --> 00:36:02.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reeta really appreciates
congregation meetings.

00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:05.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They love being with their brothers.

00:36:05.046 --> 00:36:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about you?

00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:08.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you value the meetings

00:36:08.749 --> 00:36:11.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the encouraging association
you find there?

00:36:13.321 --> 00:36:18.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reeta takes time to meditate
on the wonders of creation,

00:36:18.192 --> 00:36:21.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she does more than marvel
at what she sees.

00:36:21.562 --> 00:36:25.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She notices
how Jehovah’s love and care for her

00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is evident in all his works.

00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:33.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She knows that Jehovah
has the power to create anything,

00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:37.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants to use his power in her behalf.

00:36:37.678 --> 00:36:42.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no surprise that Reeta is keenly aware

00:36:42.617 --> 00:36:46.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jehovah’s constant support
in her pioneer ministry.

00:36:49.156 --> 00:36:52.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah proves to be with us in the ministry,

00:36:52.426 --> 00:36:55.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether we’re preaching
in our local community

00:36:55.196 --> 00:36:57.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or sharing in a special campaign.

00:36:57.765 --> 00:36:59.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go to Europe

00:36:59.767 --> 00:37:03.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch a report about a special campaign.

00:37:03.004 --> 00:37:05.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As with Reeta’s experience,

00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:07.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
see if you can identify

00:37:07.341 --> 00:37:11.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how Jehovah was with the many thousands

00:37:11.145 --> 00:37:13.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who volunteered for this campaign.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Central Europe branch territory,

00:37:18.519 --> 00:37:20.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a special campaign was organized.

00:37:20.855 --> 00:37:22.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, the School

00:37:22.857 --> 00:37:24.258 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for Branch Committee Members and Their Wives

00:37:24.258 --> 00:37:27.061 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
triggered an evaluation of how much territory

00:37:27.061 --> 00:37:32.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the countries we oversee
is not really covered thoroughly.

00:37:32.066 --> 00:37:34.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we asked our circuit overseers

00:37:34.368 --> 00:37:37.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to recommend to us which sections 

00:37:37.071 --> 00:37:39.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the congregation’s territory

00:37:39.106 --> 00:37:42.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be listed
as so-called “unassigned territory.”

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:47.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All in all, we received
over 11,000 territories

00:37:47.748 --> 00:37:52.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the congregations,
with approximately 3 million inhabitants.

00:37:52.353 --> 00:37:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So because of this grand scale,
there was suddenly the idea,

00:37:55.923 --> 00:37:59.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Why not organize
a special preaching campaign

00:37:59.393 --> 00:38:01.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to cover all these territories

00:38:01.862 --> 00:38:04.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on one single weekend?’

00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:06.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was really exciting.

00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:08.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And after getting
the Branch Committee’s approval,

00:38:08.903 --> 00:38:12.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Service Department
started to organize it.

00:38:12.006 --> 00:38:15.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To be honest, at first,
we were not really sure

00:38:15.242 --> 00:38:18.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how the publishers
would react to such a campaign.

00:38:18.079 --> 00:38:20.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we fully trusted in Jehovah,

00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:22.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the response was stunning.

00:38:22.717 --> 00:38:26.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over 20,000 publishers participated

00:38:26.253 --> 00:38:28.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were assigned
to all these territories throughout Germany.

00:38:30.224 --> 00:38:34.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The campaign took place
on one weekend in May 2017

00:38:34.795 --> 00:38:37.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was especially successful
in metropolitan areas,

00:38:37.932 --> 00:38:41.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as in Berlin, Hamburg, and Düsseldorf.

00:38:46.374 --> 00:38:49.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At one door, a man just arrived.

00:38:49.276 --> 00:38:52.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted to open his shop
where he sells Arabian specialties.

00:38:52.913 --> 00:38:56.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were able to show him a video in Arabic.

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:59.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then he gave us his address and phone number.

00:38:59.987 --> 00:39:02.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He also agreed
to have someone visit him again.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:06.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it’s really a privilege
to join in such a campaign

00:39:06.394 --> 00:39:09.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to see that every human
is precious to Jehovah,

00:39:09.130 --> 00:39:11.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter where they live
or where they come from.

00:39:12.933 --> 00:39:16.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the need
and the fantastic response in 2017,

00:39:16.804 --> 00:39:21.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was decided to repeat
such a campaign in May 2018.

00:39:21.742 --> 00:39:24.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this time it was expanded to Switzerland,

00:39:24.478 --> 00:39:27.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Austria, Luxembourg, and Liechtenstein.

00:39:27.782 --> 00:39:29.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now imagine,

00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:33.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over 32,000 publishers participated,

00:39:33.421 --> 00:39:36.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is actually over 60 percent more

00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:38.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than in May 2017.

00:39:38.826 --> 00:39:41.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was really faith-strengthening.

00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:45.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, again, a lot
of wonderful experiences were reported.

00:39:45.699 --> 00:39:47.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s incredible.

00:39:47.701 --> 00:39:49.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter where you are in Berlin,

00:39:49.804 --> 00:39:52.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can see small groups
of brothers everywhere.

00:39:52.306 --> 00:39:54.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was really great.

00:39:54.308 --> 00:39:56.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the ministry we met a woman,
and she told us 

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she had just prayed for a Bible study.

00:39:58.312 --> 00:40:00.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are now more than ever convinced

00:40:00.214 --> 00:40:02.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah leads all this work

00:40:02.817 --> 00:40:04.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through his angels.

00:40:04.852 --> 00:40:08.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Sunday, we had a nice experience.

00:40:08.389 --> 00:40:10.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A woman called us from behind.

00:40:10.391 --> 00:40:13.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had actually already passed us,

00:40:13.027 --> 00:40:15.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she had the feeling
she had to go back again

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—she told us later.

00:40:20.267 --> 00:40:23.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After she had invited us to her home,

00:40:23.137 --> 00:40:25.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we exchanged our contact information

00:40:25.406 --> 00:40:28.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we also filled in
the online contact form.

00:40:30.377 --> 00:40:33.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Had we been in the territory
just one minute later,

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would never have made the contact.

00:40:35.516 --> 00:40:38.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This must have been guided by the angels.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yesterday morning while in the ministry,

00:40:41.922 --> 00:40:44.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a young man ran after us
and asked us what we were doing.

00:40:44.458 --> 00:40:46.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We explained it to him.

00:40:46.127 --> 00:40:49.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He asked us why there is still
so much evil in the world, then.

00:40:49.463 --> 00:40:51.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the afternoon,
we were able to call on him again.

00:40:51.932 --> 00:40:54.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could start a Bible study right away

00:40:54.068 --> 00:40:57.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and arrange a return visit,
which we will make today.

00:40:58.439 --> 00:41:01.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being together
with the friends is just so great.

00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:03.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re out and about with a large group.

00:41:03.811 --> 00:41:05.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You meet up again regularly

00:41:05.513 --> 00:41:08.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to change partners and to relate experiences.

00:41:08.916 --> 00:41:11.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s just great.

00:41:11.352 --> 00:41:14.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thousands of videos were shown,

00:41:14.088 --> 00:41:16.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a lot of Bible studies were started.

00:41:16.790 --> 00:41:19.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what is very interesting
is that a lot of publishers

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
felt motivated
to expand their ministry after the campaign.

00:41:23.497 --> 00:41:26.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For sure,
these preaching campaigns truly prove

00:41:26.433 --> 00:41:29.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah and Jesus
are directing the preaching work.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:34.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the angels are helping us
in reaching out to all people.

00:41:35.376 --> 00:41:39.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we really have a lot of reasons
to be Jehovah’s happy people.

00:41:46.487 --> 00:41:49.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah truly proved to be

00:41:49.056 --> 00:41:52.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with all who volunteered
to share in this campaign.

00:41:52.793 --> 00:41:56.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How else could the good news
reach three million people

00:41:56.463 --> 00:41:59.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such a well-organized way?

00:41:59.500 --> 00:42:04.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’d like to thank
the more than 32,000 brothers and sisters

00:42:04.238 --> 00:42:06.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who shared in this special work.

00:42:07.875 --> 00:42:10.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Lösch noted in his talk,

00:42:10.878 --> 00:42:14.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with us in the ministry.

00:42:14.048 --> 00:42:18.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt he is directing
the global preaching work

00:42:18.586 --> 00:42:21.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through Jesus and his angels.

00:42:21.288 --> 00:42:24.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how many people were contacted

00:42:24.024 --> 00:42:26.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
soon after they prayed for a Bible study

00:42:26.660 --> 00:42:29.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or for a question to be answered?

00:42:29.063 --> 00:42:31.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that interesting?

00:42:32.233 --> 00:42:36.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re together
with a large group of Jehovah’s people

00:42:36.570 --> 00:42:40.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ministry
and at our meetings and assemblies,

00:42:40.474 --> 00:42:44.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we really feel Jehovah’s blessing, don’t we?

00:42:44.612 --> 00:42:46.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what if we’re isolated?

00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:49.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we’re facing persecution?

00:42:49.783 --> 00:42:54.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is what Alphonse Takla
experienced some years ago in Egypt.

00:42:54.488 --> 00:42:58.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s see how Jehovah proved to be with him.

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:05.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All was dark;

00:43:05.799 --> 00:43:10.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything was pitch-black dark.

00:43:10.804 --> 00:43:13.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Egypt was at war with Israel,

00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:15.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were arresting the brothers,

00:43:15.342 --> 00:43:19.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
charging us of practicing illegal activities

00:43:19.747 --> 00:43:22.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a banned organization.

00:43:22.583 --> 00:43:24.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On that night, we were being transferred

00:43:24.885 --> 00:43:27.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the concentration camp.

00:43:29.323 --> 00:43:32.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t see much.

00:43:34.094 --> 00:43:38.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What’s going on there?
What’s this place look like? Where is it?”

00:43:45.939 --> 00:43:49.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The officer got two soldiers to escort us

00:43:49.176 --> 00:43:52.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our cell where the brothers were.

00:43:54.114 --> 00:43:57.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that when people
are taken to the concentration camp,

00:43:57.918 --> 00:44:00.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they spend years

00:44:00.087 --> 00:44:01.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some of them never return back.

00:44:03.190 --> 00:44:06.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was, you know, a teenager,

00:44:06.193 --> 00:44:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I liked the characters in the Bible,

00:44:08.362 --> 00:44:11.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Abraham,

00:44:11.665 --> 00:44:14.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel,

00:44:14.935 --> 00:44:16.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:20.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought that they were
champions of true worship.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:23.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At some stage, I felt jealous of them.

00:44:23.544 --> 00:44:27.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had this huge relationship with God,

00:44:27.047 --> 00:44:30.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I’d like to be part of that.

00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:33.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I continued to read the Bible

00:44:33.320 --> 00:44:35.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get closer to God.

00:44:35.356 --> 00:44:37.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that Jehovah would look after me;

00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:39.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would not abandon his servant.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:42.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we tried to encourage them:

00:44:42.296 --> 00:44:44.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brothers, keep in mind

00:44:44.365 --> 00:44:48.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’re here because we worship Jehovah.”

00:44:48.335 --> 00:44:50.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We sat together to discuss, you know,

00:44:50.738 --> 00:44:53.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we were going to do

00:44:53.173 --> 00:44:55.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep spiritually strong.

00:44:55.309 --> 00:44:58.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we thought that we needed to pray.

00:44:58.679 --> 00:45:02.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We picked out a scripture every day,
like a daily text,

00:45:02.816 --> 00:45:06.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then after that, recited scriptures.

00:45:06.653 --> 00:45:09.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One would handle
a talk from the memory of heart

00:45:10.557 --> 00:45:14.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then an open discussion 
of Bible questions.

00:45:14.862 --> 00:45:17.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At that stage,
we didn’t have a Bible with us.

00:45:21.535 --> 00:45:25.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The officers wanted us to renounce our faith,

00:45:27.007 --> 00:45:30.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they told me to lay on the ground,

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:33.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there they started to beat me.

00:45:33.647 --> 00:45:35.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole camp was around,

00:45:35.649 --> 00:45:38.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one of the prisoners fainted.

00:45:38.118 --> 00:45:40.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to pray to Jehovah:

00:45:40.387 --> 00:45:43.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah, help me to be able to endure that!”

00:45:43.323 --> 00:45:45.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very severe pain.

00:45:45.325 --> 00:45:48.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt his help
because after a few beatings,

00:45:48.262 --> 00:45:50.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my body felt numb.

00:45:50.264 --> 00:45:52.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t feel much more pain.

00:45:52.599 --> 00:45:54.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the prisoners said to me,

00:45:54.968 --> 00:45:57.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If I get out of here alive,

00:45:57.604 --> 00:46:02.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I’ll tell my children
that in the concentration camp,

00:46:02.142 --> 00:46:07.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I saw the Christians that reminded me
 of the first-century Christians

00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:12.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that they were happy even to die
without renouncing their faith.”

00:46:12.653 --> 00:46:14.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the officers

00:46:14.655 --> 00:46:19.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this nasty one
that used to beat us very, very severely—

00:46:19.059 --> 00:46:21.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came one day and said,

00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:23.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We need two of you to come out

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:27.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and write a report about what you believe.”

00:46:27.334 --> 00:46:30.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we thought about it:
‘Is it wise to do that?

00:46:30.370 --> 00:46:32.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or maybe they will use it against us.’

00:46:32.372 --> 00:46:35.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, we prayed to Jehovah
for help to make a decision here,

00:46:35.676 --> 00:46:37.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to guide us on what to do.

00:46:37.845 --> 00:46:40.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the end, we reached a point that,

00:46:40.013 --> 00:46:42.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, we may get out; we may not.

00:46:43.383 --> 00:46:46.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we might as well give them a witness.

00:46:48.021 --> 00:46:51.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told the officer, “We need a Bible.”

00:46:51.391 --> 00:46:52.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he said, “What for?”

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to him, “Because we need
to quote from the Bible in this report.”

00:46:58.599 --> 00:47:02.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he said,
“OK, do you have a Bible in the storeroom?”

00:47:02.436 --> 00:47:04.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said, “Yes, I have a Bible.”

00:47:04.071 --> 00:47:08.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “OK, go and get your Bible.”

00:47:11.311 --> 00:47:14.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to my bag and picked up the Bible.

00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:27.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he picked up the Bible from my hand,
opened it randomly, and started to read.

00:47:27.794 --> 00:47:28.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Numbers.”

00:47:28.996 --> 00:47:31.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He looked at me.
“Who wrote this book?”

00:47:31.431 --> 00:47:33.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to him, “Moses.”

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re a liar!” at the top of his voice.

00:47:37.704 --> 00:47:39.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I kept quiet,

00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:42.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he closed the book again

00:47:42.676 --> 00:47:44.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and opened it again.

00:47:49.283 --> 00:47:52.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You’re a liar!”
again at the top of his voice.

00:47:52.586 --> 00:47:55.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was racing in my mind
where it is written in the Bible

00:47:55.789 --> 00:48:00.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah told Moses to write any of this.

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He shut the book again,
and for a third time,

00:48:02.996 --> 00:48:05.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
opened it again,
and he started to read in a loud voice.

00:48:13.307 --> 00:48:18.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the officer looked at me
with a big surprise on his face.

00:48:21.281 --> 00:48:24.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we wrote the report,

00:48:24.151 --> 00:48:26.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked him,
“Can we keep the Bible, please?”

00:48:26.853 --> 00:48:29.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “OK, keep the Bible.”

00:48:30.424 --> 00:48:32.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For three months, nearly every day,

00:48:32.993 --> 00:48:35.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the officers came in and beat us

00:48:35.696 --> 00:48:37.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and expected us to compromise.

00:48:37.731 --> 00:48:40.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never did that.

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All I can say is that it was Jehovah’s hand.

00:48:42.669 --> 00:48:44.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was helping us to endure

00:48:44.738 --> 00:48:47.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to continue to do his will

00:48:47.007 --> 00:48:49.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by not compromising
because we belong to him

00:48:49.876 --> 00:48:52.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we rely on him.

00:48:55.582 --> 00:49:00.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God will not abandon his servant.

00:49:01.822 --> 00:49:04.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was Alphonse thrown into prison?

00:49:04.958 --> 00:49:07.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t because he refused to say

00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a simple greeting
to the president of his country.

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:13.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, that phrase was a political slogan.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:16.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like many Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:49:16.269 --> 00:49:20.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alphonse was persecuted for his neutrality.

00:49:20.407 --> 00:49:23.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped Alphonse to be loyal?

00:49:23.176 --> 00:49:24.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prayed.

00:49:24.811 --> 00:49:27.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He prayed to maintain
a strong spiritual routine,

00:49:27.981 --> 00:49:30.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he prayed when he had to make a decision,

00:49:30.851 --> 00:49:35.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he prayed for help
to endure brutal treatment.

00:49:35.088 --> 00:49:39.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Alphonse,
do you depend on the power of prayer?

00:49:41.361 --> 00:49:44.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alphonse and, earlier, Reeta

00:49:44.631 --> 00:49:49.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
likened their relationship
with Jehovah to holding His hand.

00:49:49.636 --> 00:49:54.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reeta said,
‘Jehovah holds our hand tight.’

00:49:54.441 --> 00:49:59.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alphonse said, “All I can say
is that it was Jehovah’s hand.”

00:49:59.446 --> 00:50:02.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful image!

00:50:02.015 --> 00:50:05.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how close we can be to Jehovah.

00:50:06.887 --> 00:50:11.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s music video reminds us of that.

00:50:11.291 --> 00:50:15.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is always willing to hold our hand.

00:50:15.328 --> 00:50:20.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s entitled <i>Jehovah’s Always by Our Side.</i>

00:50:35.082 --> 00:50:41.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At times, I felt scared inside,
Only looking for a place to hide.

00:50:41.855 --> 00:50:49.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The world made me feel different. 
Now I hold my head up high.

00:50:49.196 --> 00:50:55.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said he’d be my confidence,
That he’d come to my defense.

00:50:55.102 --> 00:51:00.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His love I can’t deny,

00:51:00.173 --> 00:51:06.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
’Cause he gave me
Courage when I was feeling weak,

00:51:06.113 --> 00:51:14.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage when I could not speak,
Courage in my darkest night,

00:51:16.156 --> 00:51:23.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage to stand up tall,
Courage to face it all,

00:51:23.163 --> 00:51:31.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage to trust him with my life.
Jehovah’s always by my side.

00:51:31.304 --> 00:51:38.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He walks with me
To help me see

00:51:38.078 --> 00:51:48.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His ways are always right.
He’ll take my hand,

00:51:48.054 --> 00:51:55.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help me understand
It’s worth the sacrifice.

00:51:58.265 --> 00:52:03.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You are not alone.
Even far away from home,

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:14.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be your guide.
He will pick you up

00:52:14.781 --> 00:52:26.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even when you think you’ve had enough
And make you strong and wise,

00:52:26.626 --> 00:52:31.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
’Cause he’ll give you
Courage when you are feeling weak,

00:52:31.231 --> 00:52:40.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage when you cannot speak,
Courage in your darkest nights,

00:52:40.207 --> 00:52:48.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage to stand up tall,
Courage to face it all,

00:52:48.782 --> 00:52:57.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage to trust him with your life.
Jehovah’s always by our side—

00:52:57.757 --> 00:53:09.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always, always.
Jehovah’s always by our side.

00:53:09.269 --> 00:53:16.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He walks with you and me
To help us see

00:53:16.910 --> 00:53:24.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His ways are always right.
Jehovah’s always by our side.

00:53:24.117 --> 00:53:30.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll take our hand,
Help us understand

00:53:30.824 --> 00:53:35.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s worth the sacrifice.

00:53:35.161 --> 00:53:40.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gave me
Courage when I was feeling weak,

00:53:40.166 --> 00:53:49.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage when I could not speak,
Courage in my darkest night,

00:53:49.976 --> 00:53:57.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage to stand up tall,
Courage to face it all,

00:53:57.517 --> 00:54:06.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Courage to trust him with my life.
Jehovah’s always by our side—

00:54:06.226 --> 00:54:20.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always, always.
Jehovah’s always by our side—

00:54:20.206 --> 00:54:35.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always, always.
Jehovah’s always by our side.

00:54:39.192 --> 00:54:42.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful song!

00:54:42.429 --> 00:54:45.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many months on JW Broadcasting,

00:54:45.799 --> 00:54:49.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve enjoyed a series
of video dramatizations

00:54:49.636 --> 00:54:53.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about applying Bible principles in our lives.

00:54:53.473 --> 00:54:58.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have learned
that we can enjoy happier lives today

00:54:58.078 --> 00:55:00.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and live in a way that pleases God

00:55:00.747 --> 00:55:04.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we apply
Jehovah’s principles and standards.

00:55:04.884 --> 00:55:09.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Applying God’s principles
also gives us a wonderful hope.

00:55:09.723 --> 00:55:13.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As our concluding video in this series shows,

00:55:13.593 --> 00:55:16.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
focusing on our future hope

00:55:16.763 --> 00:55:18.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us to build the faith

00:55:18.765 --> 00:55:21.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to withstand trials we face today.

00:55:21.801 --> 00:55:24.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See if you remember these scenes.

00:55:34.948 --> 00:55:37.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Getting baptized

00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:39.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the most important decision I ever made.

00:55:39.419 --> 00:55:41.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it took some time to realize that

00:55:41.621 --> 00:55:44.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was just the start of my Christian life.

00:55:44.624 --> 00:55:46.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes it was hard to show courage.

00:55:46.926 --> 00:55:51.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why don’t you people get involved
and make a real difference for once?

00:55:57.437 --> 00:55:59.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was hard for my son too.

00:55:59.472 --> 00:56:00.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No thanks.

00:56:00.473 --> 00:56:03.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a Jehovah’s Witness,
and I don’t celebrate birthdays.

00:56:03.476 --> 00:56:04.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What? 

00:56:04.244 --> 00:56:05.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hum?

00:56:05.045 --> 00:56:05.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s rude.

00:56:05.912 --> 00:56:06.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come on, sign it!

00:56:06.746 --> 00:56:08.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really liked Lucas,

00:56:08.214 --> 00:56:11.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was very sick.

00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:15.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really wanted to sign his birthday card,

00:56:15.355 --> 00:56:19.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Dad helped me to see
how Jehovah felt about it,

00:56:19.526 --> 00:56:22.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that helped me be brave.

00:56:22.562 --> 00:56:25.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still didn’t sign the card,

00:56:25.231 --> 00:56:27.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I’m going to do something else for Lucas.

00:56:35.475 --> 00:56:39.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My parents had always set
a good example for me.

00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:42.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But after I moved
to serve where the need was greater,

00:56:42.849 --> 00:56:44.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seemed like my parents were growing apart.

00:56:46.019 --> 00:56:48.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you both doing OK?

00:56:48.388 --> 00:56:50.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because you don’t look OK.

00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:51.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we’re OK.

00:56:51.925 --> 00:56:53.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK? We’re doing wonderful, right?

00:56:53.526 --> 00:56:54.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, we’re doing good.

00:56:54.527 --> 00:56:55.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything is good.

00:56:56.096 --> 00:56:59.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really worried.

00:56:59.132 --> 00:57:01.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, they told me that what helped them

00:57:01.534 --> 00:57:03.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was their love for Jehovah.

00:57:04.604 --> 00:57:08.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They meditated on the example
of Abraham and Sarah,

00:57:08.341 --> 00:57:12.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who showed honor to each other
by listening and by caring.

00:57:12.745 --> 00:57:15.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That example really helped my parents.

00:57:15.548 --> 00:57:18.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since then,

00:57:18.051 --> 00:57:20.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve seen how it can help
in any relationship.

00:57:23.556 --> 00:57:26.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m a long way from home,
but showing love to others

00:57:28.094 --> 00:57:31.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—it helps me to stay happy in my assignment.

00:57:36.169 --> 00:57:38.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When our doctor told us that our baby

00:57:38.404 --> 00:57:41.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would likely be born with severe problems

00:57:41.474 --> 00:57:44.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and could even die,

00:57:44.944 --> 00:57:47.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was more than I could bear.

00:57:49.048 --> 00:57:53.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And because my husband
was not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:57:53.386 --> 00:57:57.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed God’s help more than ever

00:57:57.290 --> 00:58:01.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to calm my heart and help me explain
why I could never have an abortion.

00:58:02.962 --> 00:58:06.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even though it took me years

00:58:06.032 --> 00:58:08.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before I would agree to a Bible study

00:58:08.801 --> 00:58:13.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even more years before I made
enough changes to qualify for baptism,

00:58:14.407 --> 00:58:16.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the life we have now

00:58:16.876 --> 00:58:18.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—serving Jehovah together—

00:58:19.946 --> 00:58:22.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nothing could make me happier.

00:58:22.782 --> 00:58:25.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing could make us happier.

00:58:26.786 --> 00:58:31.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happiness really does come
from serving Jehovah,

00:58:31.157 --> 00:58:35.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but serving him faithfully
definitely takes courage.

00:58:36.396 --> 00:58:40.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was so hard for me
to turn down that girl at school.

00:58:41.301 --> 00:58:45.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I felt so guilty
for how involved I’d gotten with her.

00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My uncle used the Bible
to help me get back on track

00:58:50.376 --> 00:58:54.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to remind me
of two other very important things:

00:58:54.681 --> 00:58:59.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah was proud of me
and that I was not alone.

00:59:00.353 --> 00:59:03.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:2, 3 says:

00:59:03.156 --> 00:59:05.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Consider it all joy, my brothers,

00:59:05.825 --> 00:59:07.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when you meet with various trials,

00:59:07.827 --> 00:59:09.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“knowing as you do

00:59:09.862 --> 00:59:12.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that this tested quality of your faith

00:59:12.232 --> 00:59:14.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
produces endurance.”

00:59:16.035 --> 00:59:18.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think about that scripture a lot

00:59:18.071 --> 00:59:20.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because soon I’ll probably be sent

00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prison for refusing military service.

00:59:24.877 --> 00:59:26.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being courageous with that classmate

00:59:26.879 --> 00:59:30.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me build the faith
and courage that I need now.

00:59:30.550 --> 00:59:33.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can give up anything for Jehovah.

00:59:33.653 --> 00:59:37.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I might live in a small cell for now,

00:59:37.056 --> 00:59:41.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in Paradise,
I’m going to travel everywhere.

00:59:42.528 --> 00:59:45.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes I get lonely, but that’s OK.

00:59:45.565 --> 00:59:50.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a choice that I’ve made
to stay in my assignment right now.

00:59:50.603 --> 00:59:53.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the future, if I choose to get married,

00:59:53.906 --> 00:59:57.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope to have a marriage like my parents.

01:00:00.046 --> 01:00:04.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really hope that Lucas is resurrected
so I can show him around Paradise

01:00:04.083 --> 01:00:06.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and teach him more about Jehovah.

01:00:06.653 --> 01:00:08.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I showed him pictures,

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:11.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the real thing will be so much better.

01:00:12.792 --> 01:00:17.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then I can hold my baby girl again.

01:00:20.199 --> 01:00:23.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our program 
has focused on the many ways

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:26.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is with us.

01:00:26.306 --> 01:00:30.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s with us
as we work toward dedication

01:00:30.310 --> 01:00:32.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and baptism.

01:00:32.345 --> 01:00:36.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s with us at our congregation meetings

01:00:36.616 --> 01:00:40.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when we are with our spiritual family.

01:00:40.153 --> 01:00:43.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s with us as we successfully face

01:00:43.356 --> 01:00:46.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecution and hardship.

01:00:46.592 --> 01:00:48.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is with us

01:00:48.594 --> 01:00:51.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we share the good news of his Kingdom

01:00:51.497 --> 01:00:54.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with everyone we meet.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:56.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, Brother Marais,

01:00:56.302 --> 01:00:59.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I appreciate that you were here with me

01:00:59.205 --> 01:01:01.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this month’s program.

01:01:01.207 --> 01:01:03.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Brother Lösch.

01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:05.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We end this month’s program

01:01:05.478 --> 01:01:09.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with a visit to our brothers
and sisters in Tenerife.

01:01:09.115 --> 01:01:12.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tenerife is the largest
of the Canary Islands,

01:01:12.919 --> 01:01:17.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an archipelago
off the northwest coast of Africa.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:21.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These islands
were formed by volcanic eruptions.

01:01:21.894 --> 01:01:23.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The highest point

01:01:23.963 --> 01:01:27.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the dormant Teide volcano on Tenerife.

01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:33.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here the weather
is mild and sunny throughout the year.

01:01:35.341 --> 01:01:39.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This has made the Canary Islands famous
for their extensive banana plantations.

01:01:43.349 --> 01:01:46.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tenerife is a popular tourist destination.

01:01:46.386 --> 01:01:49.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s home to nearly a million people,

01:01:49.422 --> 01:01:52.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but more than ten million visitors

01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:56.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come every year to enjoy the beaches,

01:01:56.396 --> 01:01:58.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lush terrain,

01:01:58.698 --> 01:02:00.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the food.

01:02:01.768 --> 01:02:04.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The island of Tenerife has 33 congregations

01:02:04.771 --> 01:02:07.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more than 3,000 publishers,

01:02:09.075 --> 01:02:13.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
492 of whom are regular pioneers.

01:02:14.881 --> 01:02:19.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the influx of visitors
from all over the world,

01:02:19.886 --> 01:02:23.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters
preach in over 15 languages,

01:02:23.923 --> 01:02:27.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including Russian,

01:02:27.460 --> 01:02:30.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
German,

01:02:30.296 --> 01:02:32.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
French,

01:02:32.765 --> 01:02:35.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hindi,

01:02:35.134 --> 01:02:38.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Romanian.

01:02:38.371 --> 01:02:41.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They preach everywhere

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in the cities
as well as the rural and mountainous regions.

01:02:46.646 --> 01:02:49.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Tenerife

01:02:49.649 --> 01:02:54.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send you
their warm Christian love and greetings.

01:02:55.555 --> 01:02:58.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:02:58.257 --> 01:03:01.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
