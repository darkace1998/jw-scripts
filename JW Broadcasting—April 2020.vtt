Welcome to our program.

00:00:04.187 --> 00:00:06.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s theme is

00:00:06.256 --> 00:00:09.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You Are Precious to Jehovah.”

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are some highlights.

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re going through difficult times,

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does Jehovah notice?

00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:18.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll learn in Malu’s experience,

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:22.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does care
and he helps us overcome

00:00:22.105 --> 00:00:25.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the most challenging circumstances.

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:27.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer is a powerful way

00:00:27.644 --> 00:00:31.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can ask for and receive
loving comfort from Jehovah.

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:34.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in our new music video.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon, all over the earth,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses will be inviting people

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:40.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to this year’s conventions.

00:00:40.824 --> 00:00:44.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can attending a convention
change a person’s life?

00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:47.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll find out in this report.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to the April 2020 edition

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting®!

00:01:12.489 --> 00:01:16.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We begin with the experience
of Juan Pablo Zermeño.

00:01:16.426 --> 00:01:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how he found a life
of real meaning and purpose.

00:01:25.902 --> 00:01:30.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you’re little,
you just want to be happy.

00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:39.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sadly, my father
had a problem with alcohol,

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and no child wants to live through that.

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:56.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, my family
from the United States came to visit us.

00:01:58.434 --> 00:02:00.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They looked so happy!

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:04.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The way they talked,
it was as though they only had fun

00:02:04.774 --> 00:02:09.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a good life
with no economic problems.

00:02:10.647 --> 00:02:12.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was shocked.

00:02:12.148 --> 00:02:14.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked myself, ‘How can we live

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such poverty
while their life is so great?’

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:20.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was the life I wanted for my family.

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:32.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I was nine years old,

00:02:35.738 --> 00:02:37.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I left my mother and the rest of my family

00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:41.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to cross the border into the United States.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lived in a pretty rough neighborhood.

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:50.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I joined a local gym
to learn how to defend myself.

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:57.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The trainer, Leo, was like a father to me.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He always tried to give us good advice.

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:05.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raymond was part of the boxing team.

00:03:05.235 --> 00:03:07.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a good friend.

00:03:07.237 --> 00:03:09.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got along really well.

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He respected me, and he looked after me.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After several years of being around Raymond

00:03:15.712 --> 00:03:18.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other members of the team,
I felt really comfortable.

00:03:20.216 --> 00:03:22.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To some extent, I admired him

00:03:22.518 --> 00:03:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because I could see
that he was really doing well,

00:03:25.688 --> 00:03:28.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Raymond was selling drugs.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:31.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew that it wasn’t right.

00:03:31.094 --> 00:03:33.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in time,

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to sell drugs as well.

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:40.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raymond was in a drug deal gone wrong,

00:03:40.937 --> 00:03:42.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was murdered.

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:48.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said to myself,
‘This could happen to me too.’

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:55.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had been six years
since I had seen my mom and my siblings.

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother was studying the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:04:12.101 --> 00:04:14.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It helped her to cope
with a lot of suffering.

00:04:14.737 --> 00:04:16.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It brought her peace.

00:04:16.973 --> 00:04:20.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was so happy.

00:04:21.844 --> 00:04:26.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to realize
that this was what I really needed.

00:04:26.182 --> 00:04:28.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also thought about my friends at the gym.

00:04:28.384 --> 00:04:33.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wanted them to understand why life
was so hard for all of us,

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I returned to the United States.

00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:40.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they weren’t interested.

00:04:40.196 --> 00:04:44.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My trainer, Leo, told me
that I didn’t need to sell drugs anymore;

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:48.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he could make me a professional boxer,

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I could help out my family in that way.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even gave me the nickname The Bible Boy.

00:05:03.353 --> 00:05:07.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I realized that
that was just a temporary solution.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I was learning
was going to help me forever.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was determined to serve Jehovah.

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I returned to Mexico.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:19.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started to study the Bible
and take it seriously.

00:05:19.168 --> 00:05:22.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to view Jehovah as my Father

00:05:22.638 --> 00:05:26.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he helped me
to find real relief from my pain,

00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:29.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have peace
—a tranquility that makes you 

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel accepted, loved, and wanted.

00:05:34.817 --> 00:05:38.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have enjoyed
an incredible life serving Jehovah.

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Decades later, my father was baptized
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:49.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been so kind to me,

00:05:49.665 --> 00:05:52.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my family, and my siblings.

00:05:52.735 --> 00:05:57.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, I have no way to repay Jehovah
for the life he’s given me.

00:05:59.108 --> 00:06:03.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve had so many blessings in my life:
a wonderful wife

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:05.681 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and great friends, 

00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:07.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
including those that I serve

00:06:07.283 --> 00:06:09.585 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
alongside of in Bethel.

00:06:09.585 --> 00:06:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not on my own anymore.

00:06:12.855 --> 00:06:17.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given me
a life full of real meaning, purpose,

00:06:17.794 --> 00:06:20.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so much happiness.

00:06:21.964 --> 00:06:26.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine
leaving your home at the age of nine?

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Juan Pablo sought a better life,

00:06:28.504 --> 00:06:32.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that only led
to danger and disappointment.

00:06:32.308 --> 00:06:35.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Juan Pablo said that it was
Jehovah who gave him

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:39.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a life full of real meaning,
purpose, and . . . happiness.”

00:06:39.115 --> 00:06:42.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Juan Pablo is precious to Jehovah.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we mentioned—

00:06:45.288 --> 00:06:48.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our theme for this month’s program is

00:06:48.124 --> 00:06:51.694 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“You Are Precious to Jehovah.”

00:06:51.694 --> 00:06:53.229 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How vital it is

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.431 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we remind ourselves of that!

00:06:55.431 --> 00:06:57.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:00.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider three reasons.

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:02.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Satan wants us to believe

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:06.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah doesn’t love us
or value our service.

00:07:06.442 --> 00:07:09.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted Job to believe that.

00:07:09.612 --> 00:07:14.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was a lie in Job’s day,
and it’s still a lie today.

00:07:16.953 --> 00:07:20.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second reason that we need
to be reminded that we’re precious to Jehovah

00:07:20.323 --> 00:07:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because of negative circumstances

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:25.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or events that have taken place in our life.

00:07:26.095 --> 00:07:30.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Severe illness,
advancing years, injustices,

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:35.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mistreatment,
a difficult family life, or other situations

00:07:35.138 --> 00:07:40.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may cause some brothers and sisters
to feel that they’re just not worth loving.

00:07:41.077 --> 00:07:44.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may question why Jehovah
allows those things to happen.

00:07:46.082 --> 00:07:50.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we need reminders
of how Jehovah feels about us

00:07:50.253 --> 00:07:55.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because our imperfection
can cause us to have negative thoughts.

00:07:55.258 --> 00:07:58.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may still punish
themselves for past mistakes,

00:07:58.928 --> 00:08:01.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doubting that Jehovah has forgiven them

00:08:01.531 --> 00:08:03.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that he could ever love them.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others wage a constant battle
against feelings of worthlessness.

00:08:09.539 --> 00:08:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Witness wrote:

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:14.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Satan has done an excellent job of making

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:19.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even those who love Jehovah
feel worthless and unlovable.

00:08:19.248 --> 00:08:22.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . I never felt worthy of Jehovah’s love,

00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:24.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so I tried to do
more and more in his service

00:08:24.887 --> 00:08:27.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as a way of earning that love.

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:30.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . So no matter
how many hours I spent in the ministry,

00:08:30.393 --> 00:08:34.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or how many people I helped,
I felt it was not enough.

00:08:34.463 --> 00:08:37.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw only the lack in me.”

00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:41.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother stated:

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:44.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I came from a family
that showed little love.

00:08:44.507 --> 00:08:48.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was belittled, teased, and laughed at.

00:08:48.411 --> 00:08:52.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, early in life I felt worthless.

00:08:52.381 --> 00:08:55.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I still carry
entrenched feelings from my past

00:08:55.585 --> 00:08:59.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that beat me down
when I experience calamity.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:02.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I stopped serving
as a congregation elder,

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I felt like a failure as usual

00:09:05.361 --> 00:09:09.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to God, my family,
and my brothers in the congregation.”

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve experienced such feelings,

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:16.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not alone.

00:09:16.172 --> 00:09:20.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can you
be assured of Jehovah’s interest?

00:09:20.243 --> 00:09:22.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine three lines of evidence

00:09:22.545 --> 00:09:26.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prove you’re precious to Jehovah.

00:09:26.449 --> 00:09:31.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’ll examine
Jehovah’s feelings for the nation of Israel.

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:35.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we’ll reflect
on an event recorded in the Gospels.

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:38.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third,
we’ll consider a modern-day example

00:09:38.894 --> 00:09:41.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who was very precious to God.

00:09:44.033 --> 00:09:47.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of the 16th century B.C.E.,

00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:49.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions of Israelites
were enslaved in Egypt,

00:09:49.805 --> 00:09:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they were severely oppressed.

00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:57.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In their distress,
the Israelites cried out to Jehovah.

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:59.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he feel?

00:09:59.148 --> 00:10:03.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me to Isaiah 63:9.

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:05.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>A</i> portion reads:

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:08.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During all their distress

00:10:08.524 --> 00:10:11.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was distressing to him.”

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice?

00:10:13.462 --> 00:10:16.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did Jehovah see their troubles

00:10:16.198 --> 00:10:18.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he felt for his people,

00:10:18.267 --> 00:10:21.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was moved to act in their behalf.

00:10:21.637 --> 00:10:25.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 63:9 goes on to say:

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:30.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In his love and compassion
he repurchased them.”

00:10:31.113 --> 00:10:34.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah couldn’t see
their suffering or hear their outcries

00:10:34.984 --> 00:10:38.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without feeling for them
and doing something about it.

00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:41.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That may remind us of the loving concern

00:10:41.991 --> 00:10:44.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a mother has for her newborn child.

00:10:44.493 --> 00:10:46.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that baby cries,

00:10:46.495 --> 00:10:48.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mother takes notice

00:10:48.497 --> 00:10:50.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she feels for her child.

00:10:51.367 --> 00:10:56.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, notice how
this is expressed at Isaiah 49:15.

00:10:56.372 --> 00:10:58.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:10:58.374 --> 00:11:01.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can a woman forget her nursing child

00:11:01.877 --> 00:11:05.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or have no compassion
for the son of her womb?

00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:08.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even if these women forget,

00:11:08.317 --> 00:11:11.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would never forget you.”

00:11:12.321 --> 00:11:17.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to imagine a mother forgetting
to nourish and care for her nursing child.

00:11:17.159 --> 00:11:19.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That baby is helpless

00:11:19.195 --> 00:11:22.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—day and night
it needs its mother’s attention.

00:11:22.965 --> 00:11:24.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sad to say, however,

00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:28.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we hear at times
of such maternal neglect.

00:11:28.337 --> 00:11:32.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did Jehovah say
to reassure the Israelites?

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:36.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I would never forget you.”

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the tender compassion
that Jehovah felt for his servants

00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was immeasurably stronger

00:11:42.885 --> 00:11:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than one of the most tender
and natural feelings we can imagine

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:50.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the compassion
a mother normally feels for her baby.

00:11:52.161 --> 00:11:54.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s feelings for the Israelites

00:11:54.363 --> 00:11:57.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are summed up
in another expression in the book of Isaiah.

00:11:57.633 --> 00:12:01.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me Isaiah 43:4:

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:06.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For you became precious in my eyes,

00:12:06.609 --> 00:12:11.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were honored, and I have loved you.”

00:12:11.647 --> 00:12:15.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah clearly expressed
his feelings for his people.

00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:18.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As one of Jehovah’s servants,

00:12:18.954 --> 00:12:23.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can be sure
that he also loves you most tenderly.

00:12:23.325 --> 00:12:27.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what trials you’re facing now
or have endured in the past,

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hurt, he hurts.

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:39.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re far too precious to Jehovah
for him to forget you.

00:12:39.475 --> 00:12:41.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers your past efforts,

00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:44.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sees
your continuing efforts to please him.

00:12:46.449 --> 00:12:50.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Jehovah promises
to sustain and comfort his people

00:12:50.453 --> 00:12:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Isaiah 66:12, 13:

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:59.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will nurse and be carried on the hip,

00:12:59.795 --> 00:13:03.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will be bounced on the knees.

00:13:03.098 --> 00:13:05.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a mother comforts her son,

00:13:05.401 --> 00:13:08.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I will keep comforting you.”

00:13:09.138 --> 00:13:12.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a heartwarming scene!

00:13:12.041 --> 00:13:15.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine a loving mother
carrying a baby on her hip

00:13:15.177 --> 00:13:18.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bouncing him on her knees.

00:13:18.147 --> 00:13:20.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way,

00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:23.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah touchingly illustrates the intensity

00:13:23.018 --> 00:13:26.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tenderness of his love for you.

00:13:26.755 --> 00:13:29.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah loved his people, Israel,

00:13:29.758 --> 00:13:34.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he likewise feels that you
are very precious and dear

00:13:34.530 --> 00:13:36.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never doubt that!

00:13:38.133 --> 00:13:40.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second example
of how Jehovah feels

00:13:40.536 --> 00:13:44.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his faithful servants
can be found in the Gospels.

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what happened on one occasion

00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:49.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus was at the temple in Jerusalem

00:13:49.111 --> 00:13:53.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 21:1-4:

00:13:53.282 --> 00:13:55.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now as he looked up,

00:13:55.551 --> 00:13:57.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw the rich dropping their gifts

00:13:57.786 --> 00:14:00.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into the treasury chests.

00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:03.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he saw a needy widow drop in

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:07.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“two small coins of very little value,

00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:09.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he said:

00:14:09.231 --> 00:14:12.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Truly I say to you that this poor widow

00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:14.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘put in more than they all did.

00:14:14.937 --> 00:14:16.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For all of these put in gifts

00:14:16.939 --> 00:14:18.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘out of their surplus,

00:14:18.974 --> 00:14:21.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but she, out of her want

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:24.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[or as the footnote says, “poverty”],

00:14:24.713 --> 00:14:28.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put in all the means of living she had.’”

00:14:29.184 --> 00:14:31.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The study note for verse 2

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures</i>

00:14:34.023 --> 00:14:37.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells us that the Greek word
for “needy” may describe

00:14:37.493 --> 00:14:41.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a person who lacks
the basic necessities of life

00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:44.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or someone for whom
life is a great struggle.

00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Christian Greek Scriptures,
it is used only here.”

00:14:49.405 --> 00:14:52.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about the widow’s circumstances.

00:14:52.575 --> 00:14:54.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only had she experienced the grief

00:14:54.877 --> 00:14:57.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of losing her husband, her provider,

00:14:57.613 --> 00:15:00.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she also lived in a religious climate

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dominated by leaders who,

00:15:02.251 --> 00:15:05.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Luke 20:47,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:08.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would “devour the houses of the widows”

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:11.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than help such vulnerable ones.

00:15:11.727 --> 00:15:16.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That widow was so poor
that her contribution to the temple

00:15:16.131 --> 00:15:19.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was what a laborer
might earn in just a few minutes.

00:15:19.702 --> 00:15:23.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life wasn’t easy for her.

00:15:23.072 --> 00:15:25.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Jesus said that she

00:15:25.741 --> 00:15:28.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“put in all the means of living she had.”

00:15:30.245 --> 00:15:34.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our publications have stated
that the coins the widow contributed

00:15:34.383 --> 00:15:37.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were likely two lepta.

00:15:37.386 --> 00:15:41.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eight lepta,
a person could buy two sparrows,

00:15:41.457 --> 00:15:45.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which were among the cheapest birds
used for food.

00:15:45.194 --> 00:15:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the widow had
only half the amount needed

00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:51.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to buy one sparrow,

00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:53.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hardly enough for a single meal.

00:15:53.669 --> 00:15:56.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, both the widow and her contribution

00:15:56.105 --> 00:15:58.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were valuable to Jehovah.

00:15:58.974 --> 00:16:02.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that her contribution was greater

00:16:02.144 --> 00:16:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the contributions of the rich.

00:16:05.014 --> 00:16:09.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she put those two small coins
in the treasury chest,

00:16:09.018 --> 00:16:11.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would be mixed
with what the rich had put in.

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:16.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To imperfect human eyes,
they might seem lost, buried.

00:16:16.425 --> 00:16:20.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, this precious widow
was the one Jesus singled out for praise.

00:16:20.562 --> 00:16:23.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the treasury workers
came across the coins,

00:16:23.632 --> 00:16:27.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they wouldn’t have known
how precious the coins and their donor

00:16:27.002 --> 00:16:29.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were to Jehovah.

00:16:29.204 --> 00:16:32.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s view
was the one that really mattered,

00:16:32.174 --> 00:16:34.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not what other people thought

00:16:34.176 --> 00:16:37.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even how that dear widow viewed herself.

00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like that widow,

00:16:39.882 --> 00:16:41.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may find that circumstances limit

00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:45.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you can contribute to Jehovah.

00:16:45.154 --> 00:16:50.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Age, infirmities,
or other circumstances beyond your control

00:16:50.159 --> 00:16:54.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may limit the amount of time
you’re able to spend in the ministry.

00:16:54.697 --> 00:16:57.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might feel
that your efforts are like those

00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:01.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“two small coins of very little value.”

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, we learn from this account
of the needy widow

00:17:05.574 --> 00:17:10.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah notices
and he treasures each act done for him,

00:17:10.579 --> 00:17:14.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when we do it
despite difficult circumstances.

00:17:15.851 --> 00:17:20.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a moment, think back on your worship
of Jehovah during the past year.

00:17:21.557 --> 00:17:24.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you may feel
that you accomplished little.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your imperfect heart
might cause you to wonder

00:17:27.463 --> 00:17:30.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether Jehovah
was pleased with your efforts.

00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:34.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, did one of the hours you spent

00:17:34.036 --> 00:17:36.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
require a special sacrifice on your part?

00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah took notice of the widow

00:17:40.509 --> 00:17:45.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dropping in those two coins
and valued her contribution,

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you think he also noticed

00:17:47.449 --> 00:17:50.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and valued what you did
for him during that hour?

00:17:51.687 --> 00:17:55.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah values every gift,
no matter how small,

00:17:55.324 --> 00:17:58.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that springs from a heart motivated by love.

00:17:58.727 --> 00:18:01.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers, and he’ll reward

00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:06.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the smallest contribution
given in support of his Kingdom.

00:18:06.068 --> 00:18:09.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s proof of how Jehovah feels about you.

00:18:11.607 --> 00:18:14.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, let’s consider a modern-day example

00:18:14.443 --> 00:18:17.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who was very precious to Jehovah.

00:18:17.946 --> 00:18:21.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the experience of Sister Areti Pina.

00:18:21.116 --> 00:18:24.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina lived
on the southern coast of Albania

00:18:24.787 --> 00:18:26.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the town of Vlorë.

00:18:26.822 --> 00:18:31.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was baptized in 1928 at the age of 18.

00:18:31.059 --> 00:18:34.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a strong congregation 
in Vlorë in the 1930’s,

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sister Pina was a zealous evangelizer

00:18:37.866 --> 00:18:40.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who climbed up and down rugged mountains,

00:18:40.469 --> 00:18:43.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching with her Bible in hand.

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:47.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, a congregation
no longer existed in Vlorë,

00:18:47.276 --> 00:18:50.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sister Pina lost contact
with the brothers.

00:18:50.779 --> 00:18:53.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, she kept preaching faithfully
on her own.

00:18:54.683 --> 00:18:58.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think her efforts
went unnoticed by Jehovah?

00:18:58.086 --> 00:19:01.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, years later, word reached the brothers

00:19:01.190 --> 00:19:03.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there was an old, senile woman

00:19:03.525 --> 00:19:06.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was reportedly preaching in Vlorë.

00:19:06.628 --> 00:19:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People thought she was crazy
for keeping faith in God

00:19:09.798 --> 00:19:12.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during years of totalitarian rule.

00:19:12.968 --> 00:19:17.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Sister Pina, now in her 80’s,
was anything but senile.

00:19:18.807 --> 00:19:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the brothers arrived at her home,

00:19:21.143 --> 00:19:23.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina invited them in,

00:19:23.478 --> 00:19:26.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she seemed somewhat reserved.

00:19:26.381 --> 00:19:29.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they explained
that they were her spiritual brothers,

00:19:29.418 --> 00:19:31.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had no reaction.

00:19:32.321 --> 00:19:34.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a few minutes,

00:19:34.323 --> 00:19:37.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina started firing
questions at the brothers:

00:19:37.659 --> 00:19:41.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe in the Trinity?
What is God’s name?

00:19:41.129 --> 00:19:44.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe in hellfire?
What happens when we die?

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the earth?
How many go to heaven?”

00:19:48.370 --> 00:19:50.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers answered each question.

00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:53.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you preach?” she then asked.

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:56.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes,” said one brother, “we preach.”

00:19:56.945 --> 00:20:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But,” she responded, 
“how do you preach?”

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:05.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We preach from house to house,”
replied the brother.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I know that you are my brothers!”
she exclaimed.

00:20:09.658 --> 00:20:13.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only Jehovah’s people
preach from house to house!”

00:20:13.896 --> 00:20:17.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through her tears, Sister Pina stated:

00:20:17.332 --> 00:20:21.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is wonderful.
He never forgot me!”

00:20:23.505 --> 00:20:27.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometime later, the brothers
were notified that Sister Pina was ill

00:20:27.910 --> 00:20:31.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that she wanted to meet
with one of the responsible brothers.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he arrived, she asked in part,

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as she gasped for air,

00:20:37.219 --> 00:20:40.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Has the book of Revelation been fulfilled?”

00:20:40.889 --> 00:20:45.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother responded,
“Yes, Areti, most of it has.”

00:20:45.894 --> 00:20:50.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina said:
“Now I can die in peace.

00:20:50.532 --> 00:20:54.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to know how close we are.”

00:20:54.436 --> 00:20:56.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after that conversation,

00:20:56.772 --> 00:21:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina
faithfully finished her earthly course.

00:21:01.743 --> 00:21:03.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:21:03.745 --> 00:21:06.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During all those years of isolation

00:21:06.181 --> 00:21:08.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the earthly part
of Jehovah’s organization,

00:21:08.884 --> 00:21:12.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did Sister Pina’s efforts
go unnoticed by Jehovah?

00:21:12.988 --> 00:21:15.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely not!

00:21:15.290 --> 00:21:17.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just imagine Jehovah’s joy

00:21:17.926 --> 00:21:22.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he watched her faithfully doing
what she could in his service.

00:21:22.631 --> 00:21:26.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that Sister Pina
was precious to Jehovah?

00:21:26.668 --> 00:21:28.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt she was.

00:21:30.138 --> 00:21:35.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your efforts in Jehovah’s service
do not go unnoticed by him either.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:38.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Sister Pina, you are precious to him.

00:21:40.882 --> 00:21:44.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what has this consideration
helped us to realize?

00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have to contend with Satan’s lies,

00:21:47.556 --> 00:21:50.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
negative circumstances
and events in our lives,

00:21:50.492 --> 00:21:53.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our own imperfections.

00:21:53.028 --> 00:21:58.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we should never forget
that Jehovah highly values his servants.

00:21:58.934 --> 00:22:03.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that in his words to the Israelites
through the prophet Isaiah.

00:22:03.271 --> 00:22:08.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be sure that Jehovah
loves you most tenderly.

00:22:08.210 --> 00:22:12.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what trials you’re facing now
or have endured in the past,

00:22:12.547 --> 00:22:16.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.

00:22:16.118 --> 00:22:19.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hurt, he hurts.

00:22:19.354 --> 00:22:23.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re far too precious to Jehovah
for him to forget you.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:28.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The account of the widow in Luke chapter 21

00:22:28.163 --> 00:22:30.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can assure you that although circumstances

00:22:30.665 --> 00:22:33.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may affect what you
can contribute to Jehovah,

00:22:33.502 --> 00:22:38.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he notices and treasures
each act you do for him,

00:22:38.073 --> 00:22:42.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when you do it
in the face of difficult circumstances.

00:22:42.677 --> 00:22:45.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers,
and he will reward

00:22:45.313 --> 00:22:49.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the smallest contribution
given in support of his Kingdom.

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:54.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what beautiful modern-day examples
we have in the organization

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:58.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of brothers and sisters
who have proven their loyalty to Jehovah

00:22:58.727 --> 00:23:03.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are precious to him,
like the example of Sister Pina!

00:23:04.399 --> 00:23:06.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters, please,

00:23:06.935 --> 00:23:11.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forget that you
are precious to Jehovah!

00:23:13.408 --> 00:23:16.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another modern-day example

00:23:16.078 --> 00:23:18.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Sister Malu Mørch.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we’ll see, she faced a number

00:23:21.183 --> 00:23:24.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of serious hardships early in life.

00:23:24.119 --> 00:23:28.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice all the ways
she received comfort from Jehovah.

00:23:39.534 --> 00:23:41.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My name is Malu Mørch.

00:23:41.703 --> 00:23:44.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one can imagine

00:23:44.239 --> 00:23:47.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how much Jehovah has helped me.

00:23:52.747 --> 00:23:55.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was raised in Sisimiut in Greenland.

00:23:55.917 --> 00:23:58.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My childhood was wonderful.

00:23:58.353 --> 00:24:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were very often out in nature.

00:24:00.422 --> 00:24:02.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the summer, we sailed.

00:24:02.424 --> 00:24:04.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the winter, we rode dog sledge

00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:07.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we went hunting and fishing.

00:24:09.431 --> 00:24:12.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was a child,
I was very close to my parents.

00:24:12.167 --> 00:24:14.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was a “daddy’s girl.”

00:24:14.202 --> 00:24:16.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He called me “My Beloved,”

00:24:16.404 --> 00:24:19.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so “Beloved” became my nickname.

00:24:19.441 --> 00:24:22.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been so wonderful
to be raised in the truth.

00:24:23.311 --> 00:24:25.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The greatest gift that I could get

00:24:25.814 --> 00:24:27.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is to know Jehovah through them.

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was nine years old,
my parents got divorced.

00:24:35.223 --> 00:24:37.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was terrible.

00:24:37.025 --> 00:24:39.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw how my siblings were hurt.

00:24:39.361 --> 00:24:44.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It cannot be explained how—
I mean, we were very wounded in our hearts.

00:24:44.366 --> 00:24:47.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my parents divorced,
my father was disfellowshipped.

00:24:47.602 --> 00:24:50.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very hard to be separated like that.

00:24:50.872 --> 00:24:53.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I missed my dad a lot.

00:24:53.808 --> 00:24:56.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When my mom started to drink,

00:24:56.778 --> 00:24:59.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also felt abandoned.

00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:03.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because I knew what she had been doing,
I was not surprised when, 

00:25:03.485 --> 00:25:06.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after some time, she was disfellowshipped.

00:25:06.488 --> 00:25:10.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, of course, I felt very hurt and sad.

00:25:12.494 --> 00:25:16.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I supplicated Jehovah
to help me stay in the truth.

00:25:17.966 --> 00:25:21.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pioneer sister who studied
with me helped me a lot.

00:25:23.638 --> 00:25:26.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She studied with me and sometimes took me

00:25:26.308 --> 00:25:28.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ministry and invited me to dinner.

00:25:30.712 --> 00:25:32.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was about 12 years old,

00:25:32.747 --> 00:25:35.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my father came back into the truth.

00:25:35.383 --> 00:25:38.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very happy that it finally happened.

00:25:40.755 --> 00:25:43.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to have
a good relationship with him again.

00:25:43.758 --> 00:25:48.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We sailed a lot,
drove snowmobiles, and rode dog sledge,

00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:51.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my father and I
watched movies in the evening.

00:25:51.633 --> 00:25:55.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember that when my dad
heard that I was going to be baptized,

00:25:55.837 --> 00:25:59.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he shed a tear,
and I could see that he was proud.

00:26:08.950 --> 00:26:11.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 15 years old,

00:26:11.686 --> 00:26:14.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my world fell to pieces.

00:26:16.124 --> 00:26:18.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My father committed suicide.

00:26:20.428 --> 00:26:24.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s difficult to describe
that my father was suddenly gone.

00:26:24.766 --> 00:26:26.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t understand

00:26:26.801 --> 00:26:29.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why he would do such a selfish thing.

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I missed him a lot.

00:26:37.212 --> 00:26:40.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was like my heart was stabbed.

00:26:47.622 --> 00:26:50.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was also very angry at him.

00:26:53.428 --> 00:26:55.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wrote a lot.

00:26:55.664 --> 00:26:58.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I wrote many letters to my father

00:26:58.166 --> 00:27:01.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about things that I wanted to tell him.

00:27:01.269 --> 00:27:05.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also cried out to Jehovah in long prayers.

00:27:06.841 --> 00:27:09.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I love Psalm 34:18

00:27:09.678 --> 00:27:13.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah being close
to “those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:27:13.014 --> 00:27:15.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was how I felt.

00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:18.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the thought that Jehovah is close to them

00:27:18.253 --> 00:27:20.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
comforts me a lot.

00:27:20.288 --> 00:27:23.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I also did all I could
to go to all the meetings,

00:27:23.692 --> 00:27:28.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when I didn’t want to see anyone.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:31.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if I had cried before the meeting,

00:27:31.533 --> 00:27:33.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went anyway.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:40.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One month after my father’s death,
I got baptized.

00:27:40.008 --> 00:27:43.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized because I loved Jehovah.

00:27:44.979 --> 00:27:47.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was nine years old,
I had promised Jehovah

00:27:47.649 --> 00:27:49.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve him for the rest of my life.

00:27:51.486 --> 00:27:54.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My relationship with my mother
is much better now.

00:27:57.992 --> 00:28:00.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is great to serve Jehovah
together with her now.

00:28:02.364 --> 00:28:04.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We preach together every Sunday,

00:28:04.666 --> 00:28:08.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I always look forward to going
in the ministry together with her.

00:28:10.739 --> 00:28:13.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I was 18 years old,

00:28:13.041 --> 00:28:16.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I began to help
in the remote translation office.

00:28:16.978 --> 00:28:19.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, I started pioneering.

00:28:20.915 --> 00:28:24.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have always learned a lot from King David.

00:28:24.018 --> 00:28:26.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what circumstances he faced,

00:28:26.588 --> 00:28:30.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether bad or good,
he used them to draw close to Jehovah.

00:28:36.464 --> 00:28:38.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has helped me to overcome 

00:28:38.466 --> 00:28:41.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
challenges through the congregation,

00:28:41.102 --> 00:28:44.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
giving me “power beyond what is normal”

00:28:44.439 --> 00:28:48.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and taking me in as his daughter.

00:28:51.613 --> 00:28:55.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a child,
Malu’s nickname was Beloved.

00:28:55.283 --> 00:28:58.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, for a while,
she felt anything but loved.

00:28:58.887 --> 00:29:02.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She said that her “world fell to pieces.”

00:29:02.257 --> 00:29:05.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever felt that way?

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember what helped
Malu stay close to Jehovah:

00:29:09.097 --> 00:29:11.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A pioneer sister encouraged her;

00:29:11.733 --> 00:29:13.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
personal study reminded Malu

00:29:13.935 --> 00:29:16.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah helped his servants in the past;

00:29:16.871 --> 00:29:21.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she pursued spiritual goals,
such as auxiliary pioneering;

00:29:21.042 --> 00:29:24.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she went
to as many Christian meetings as she could,

00:29:24.479 --> 00:29:27.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when she wanted to be alone.

00:29:27.315 --> 00:29:29.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all these ways,

00:29:29.317 --> 00:29:33.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Malu was reminded
that she is precious to Jehovah.

00:29:33.254 --> 00:29:37.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As she said,
‘Jehovah has taken me in as his daughter.’

00:29:39.427 --> 00:29:43.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some people, staying busy
may seem like the right thing to do

00:29:43.431 --> 00:29:46.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they’ve suffered a serious setback.

00:29:46.134 --> 00:29:48.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does staying busy really help?

00:29:48.837 --> 00:29:51.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s find out in this dramatization.

00:29:54.175 --> 00:29:59.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I, Steven, take you, Emily,
to be my wedded wife.

00:30:00.949 --> 00:30:04.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I, Emily, take you, Steven,
to be my wedded husband.

00:30:08.056 --> 00:30:11.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I had no doubt our vows were forever.

00:30:14.429 --> 00:30:17.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nothing could have prepared me
for the heartbreak.

00:30:19.901 --> 00:30:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never expected her to be unfaithful

00:30:23.771 --> 00:30:27.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and unwilling to work things out.

00:30:40.488 --> 00:30:42.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt humiliated.

00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:47.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could she do such a thing?

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was embarrassed,

00:30:50.832 --> 00:30:52.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I didn’t want to talk to anyone.

00:31:00.942 --> 00:31:03.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read somewhere that time
would help me heal

00:31:03.978 --> 00:31:06.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and just to stay busy.

00:31:09.217 --> 00:31:12.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It seemed to work.

00:31:14.889 --> 00:31:18.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I was constantly reminded of what I lost:

00:31:18.192 --> 00:31:20.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our spiritual goals,

00:31:20.762 --> 00:31:23.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the hopes and dreams we had

00:31:23.898 --> 00:31:26.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—all destroyed.

00:31:33.741 --> 00:31:36.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to dwell on the hurt,

00:31:36.744 --> 00:31:40.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I just couldn’t ignore it.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was I really coping?

00:31:53.328 --> 00:31:56.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or was I leaving myself open
to even more pain?

00:31:56.898 --> 00:32:00.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters,
we’re going to talk about marriage today.

00:32:00.635 --> 00:32:02.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we turn to Ephesians chapter 5, . . .

00:32:02.203 --> 00:32:06.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was angry, but not just with Emily.

00:32:06.808 --> 00:32:09.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was angry with everything.

00:32:12.714 --> 00:32:14.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Steven!
Steven!

00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:17.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, let me stop by tomorrow.

00:32:23.958 --> 00:32:25.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What I had to say,

00:32:27.295 --> 00:32:30.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wouldn’t have blamed Tom for judging me,

00:32:30.298 --> 00:32:32.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he didn’t.

00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:35.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re right, Steven.

00:32:35.803 --> 00:32:38.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t understand how you feel.

00:32:38.806 --> 00:32:41.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you know who can.

00:32:43.211 --> 00:32:45.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember Psalm 34?

00:32:48.483 --> 00:32:52.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think verse 18 says it best.

00:32:52.153 --> 00:32:54.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you read it for us?

00:32:56.024 --> 00:33:00.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;

00:33:00.228 --> 00:33:03.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:33:03.765 --> 00:33:06.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful scripture?

00:33:06.034 --> 00:33:10.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take advantage of Jehovah
being that close to you,

00:33:10.605 --> 00:33:13.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and include him in everything.

00:33:13.341 --> 00:33:17.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah <i>is </i> a loving Shepherd.

00:33:17.045 --> 00:33:20.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we hurt, he cares.

00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:24.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I knew this, but in a way, I’d forgotten.

00:33:26.087 --> 00:33:29.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized I hadn’t included Jehovah

00:33:29.791 --> 00:33:32.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the ways I tried to cope.

00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Staying busy was important,

00:33:34.362 --> 00:33:36.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I needed to draw closer to God,

00:33:36.664 --> 00:33:39.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not push away.

00:33:39.834 --> 00:33:41.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when I did,

00:33:41.836 --> 00:33:45.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the real healing began.

00:33:45.406 --> 00:33:49.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though the pain is still there,

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:51.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees the tears;

00:33:54.082 --> 00:33:56.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah feels what I feel.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is getting better, slowly,

00:34:11.432 --> 00:34:14.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because “Jehovah is close
to the brokenhearted.”

00:34:34.989 --> 00:34:39.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The vast majority of marriages
among Jehovah’s people prosper

00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Christian husbands and wives

00:34:41.162 --> 00:34:43.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apply Bible principles,

00:34:43.564 --> 00:34:47.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a few fail to live up
to their marriage commitment.

00:34:47.769 --> 00:34:50.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you among the brokenhearted?

00:34:50.705 --> 00:34:55.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, never forget
that you are precious to Jehovah

00:34:55.676 --> 00:34:58.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remember what will help you heal.

00:34:58.579 --> 00:35:00.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our dramatization,

00:35:00.581 --> 00:35:04.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Steven kept himself busy
with recreation and other activities.

00:35:04.752 --> 00:35:07.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But he experienced
true comfort and healing

00:35:07.688 --> 00:35:10.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he drew close to Jehovah.

00:35:10.958 --> 00:35:13.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Always remember
how Jehovah is described

00:35:13.895 --> 00:35:16.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Psalm 34:18:

00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:19.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted;

00:35:19.634 --> 00:35:22.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:35:24.372 --> 00:35:26.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prayer is one of the most powerful ways

00:35:26.874 --> 00:35:28.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah helps us.

00:35:28.876 --> 00:35:31.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see that in our new music video.

00:35:49.363 --> 00:35:56.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I called yesterday,
I could tell you’d lost your way.

00:35:56.904 --> 00:36:05.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be assured you are loved
By our God up above.

00:36:06.881 --> 00:36:18.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So do not fear.
When you’re broken, he is near.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:26.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah; don’t give in.
Just let it go; roll it on him.

00:36:26.634 --> 00:36:34.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not alone; you can pray.
He hears your words; he feels your pain.

00:36:35.977 --> 00:36:44.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t keep that burden in.
Roll it on him.

00:36:44.585 --> 00:36:52.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roll it on him.
Roll it on him.

00:36:52.894 --> 00:37:00.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Raise your eyes up and see;
The new world is in our reach—

00:37:00.534 --> 00:37:10.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No more tears, only love
Through the gift of God’s dear Son.

00:37:10.111 --> 00:37:22.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But until then,
We can endure down to the end

00:37:22.523 --> 00:37:30.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we trust in Jehovah; don’t give in.
Just let it go; roll it on him.

00:37:30.331 --> 00:37:39.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not alone; we can pray.
He hears our words; he feels our pain.

00:37:39.874 --> 00:37:49.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t keep that burden in.
Roll it on him.

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:56.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roll it on him.
Roll it on him.

00:38:30.157 --> 00:38:38.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Trust in Jehovah; don’t give in.
Just let it go; roll it on him.

00:38:38.099 --> 00:38:47.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not alone; we can pray.
He hears our words; he feels our pain.

00:38:47.208 --> 00:38:54.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t keep that burden in.
Roll it on him.

00:38:56.584 --> 00:39:02.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roll it on him.
Roll it on him.

00:39:03.724 --> 00:39:14.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roll it on him.
Roll it on him.

00:39:17.905 --> 00:39:20.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful reminder

00:39:20.007 --> 00:39:22.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we can go to Jehovah
in prayer at any time

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:26.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and express our deepest feelings to him!

00:39:26.047 --> 00:39:28.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the song says:

00:39:28.049 --> 00:39:31.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Don’t keep that burden in.
Roll it on him.”

00:39:33.087 --> 00:39:36.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we’re experiencing
pain and difficulty in life,

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:41.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it may not be easy to see
all that Jehovah is doing in our behalf.

00:39:41.595 --> 00:39:44.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following Morning Worship program,

00:39:44.065 --> 00:39:48.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother John Ekrann helps us
to see Jehovah’s hand in action.

00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:51.639 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, I think all of us would agree

00:39:51.639 --> 00:39:53.874 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it’s easy to see Jehovah’s hand

00:39:53.874 --> 00:39:55.876 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when things are going well

00:39:55.876 --> 00:39:58.112 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—when we get a court victory,

00:39:58.112 --> 00:40:00.714 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when someone’s health improves,

00:40:00.714 --> 00:40:03.884 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or maybe when someone really asked to come

00:40:03.884 --> 00:40:07.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study the Bible with us
and they’re at our meetings.

00:40:07.488 --> 00:40:12.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s harder to see Jehovah’s hand
when we see bad things happen

00:40:12.393 --> 00:40:15.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either to us or to our brothers and sisters.

00:40:15.863 --> 00:40:19.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we may wonder,
‘How can we see Jehovah’s hand

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when bad things are happening?’

00:40:21.602 --> 00:40:25.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can see my hand right now, right?

00:40:25.406 --> 00:40:29.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if I put it away, you can’t see it.

00:40:29.677 --> 00:40:33.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, do you assume
that because you can’t see my hand

00:40:33.214 --> 00:40:35.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I don’t have a hand anymore?

00:40:35.216 --> 00:40:36.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no.

00:40:36.584 --> 00:40:38.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You reason on the fact
that since you see the rest of me,

00:40:38.586 --> 00:40:40.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there’s probably still my hand attached.

00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:46.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So likewise, there are times
when it’s easy to see Jehovah’s hand,

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there are other times
when we have to reason

00:40:49.830 --> 00:40:54.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what we know about Jehovah
in order to see his hand in action.

00:40:54.768 --> 00:40:56.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s consider one thing.

00:40:56.770 --> 00:40:58.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we know about Jehovah

00:40:58.772 --> 00:41:02.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we could reason
that his hand is in action?

00:41:02.143 --> 00:41:06.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s reason on the point
that he is a “happy God.”

00:41:07.948 --> 00:41:11.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does Jehovah stay happy,

00:41:11.185 --> 00:41:13.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeing all the bad things that are happening?

00:41:13.854 --> 00:41:16.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve wondered that.
I know it’s crossed my mind.

00:41:16.724 --> 00:41:19.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does Jehovah stay happy

00:41:19.326 --> 00:41:22.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he sees
all the suffering that’s going on?

00:41:22.596 --> 00:41:25.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And frankly, he sees <i>all </i> the suffering;

00:41:25.666 --> 00:41:27.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he sees everything going on.

00:41:27.668 --> 00:41:30.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know how I feel,
and you probably know how you feel

00:41:30.538 --> 00:41:32.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just when you read about what’s happening

00:41:32.873 --> 00:41:35.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to our brothers in Venezuela or in Russia

00:41:35.509 --> 00:41:37.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or with all of the hurricanes

00:41:37.545 --> 00:41:40.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and earthquakes
that we’ve had in recent times.

00:41:40.514 --> 00:41:42.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we see the suffering

00:41:42.516 --> 00:41:45.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only of our brothers and sisters
but also of other people,

00:41:45.019 --> 00:41:47.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we consider,

00:41:47.021 --> 00:41:51.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How can Jehovah stay happy
when he knows all of what is happening?’

00:41:51.992 --> 00:41:54.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider three
(I’m sure) of many reasons

00:41:54.828 --> 00:41:57.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why Jehovah can stay happy
even though he knows all the suffering.

00:41:57.965 --> 00:42:00.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then we can see
how that could benefit us as well.

00:42:00.968 --> 00:42:02.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First of all,

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:07.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his hand is hard at work
preparing the new world for us.

00:42:07.107 --> 00:42:10.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I think Jeremiah 29:11

00:42:10.678 --> 00:42:14.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
really covers how Jehovah feels

00:42:14.014 --> 00:42:16.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the future for us.

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:18.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Jeremiah 29:11, he says:

00:42:18.986 --> 00:42:21.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For I well know the thoughts
that I am thinking toward you,’

00:42:21.822 --> 00:42:25.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah,
‘thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,

00:42:25.926 --> 00:42:29.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give you a future and a hope.’”

00:42:29.763 --> 00:42:34.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah
is not simply just watching events occur.

00:42:34.001 --> 00:42:37.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s actively working on the solution.

00:42:37.705 --> 00:42:40.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He, along with Jesus and the heavenly angels,

00:42:40.374 --> 00:42:42.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is working hard on the Kingdom.

00:42:42.943 --> 00:42:47.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we can’t see into heaven right now,

00:42:47.047 --> 00:42:52.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I want you to just imagine
all the activity of the angels,

00:42:52.052 --> 00:42:54.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the resurrected anointed brothers,

00:42:54.188 --> 00:42:58.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jesus working hard on making preparations

00:42:58.792 --> 00:43:01.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Armageddon and the new world.

00:43:01.362 --> 00:43:03.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think of all the work
we’re doing just to prepare

00:43:03.731 --> 00:43:05.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the annual meeting and dedication.

00:43:05.733 --> 00:43:08.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine all the work
going on in heaven that is there?

00:43:08.569 --> 00:43:11.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, how far along are the new scrolls?

00:43:11.739 --> 00:43:14.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How are our basic needs 
as far as clean water,

00:43:14.508 --> 00:43:18.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
food, and homes
going to be provided for the survivors?

00:43:18.012 --> 00:43:21.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So while we can’t see into heaven,

00:43:21.915 --> 00:43:25.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we know that his hand is there.

00:43:25.152 --> 00:43:28.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah is happy
because he’s actively working right now

00:43:28.522 --> 00:43:30.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make things better for us.

00:43:30.858 --> 00:43:32.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the lesson for us?

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can be happy
when we see the suffering around us

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:39.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we know what Jehovah
and our brothers are doing up there

00:43:39.867 --> 00:43:42.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare for the new world.

00:43:42.202 --> 00:43:45.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second point about how Jehovah can be happy

00:43:45.172 --> 00:43:47.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that he can comfort us right now.

00:43:47.741 --> 00:43:50.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is happy when he can do that.

00:43:50.077 --> 00:43:54.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In verse 12 of Jeremiah chapter 29,

00:43:54.515 --> 00:43:59.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah continued after saying
that he was working on the future (he says): 

00:43:59.219 --> 00:44:03.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And you will call me
and come and pray to me,

00:44:03.991 --> 00:44:05.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I will listen to you.”

00:44:06.894 --> 00:44:10.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I love this point
because Jehovah is saying,

00:44:10.698 --> 00:44:14.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Don’t worry; I’m taking care
of building a better future for you.’

00:44:14.435 --> 00:44:15.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we appreciate it.

00:44:15.736 --> 00:44:18.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re going through some trial
—some difficulty—

00:44:18.939 --> 00:44:20.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a good friend of ours reminds us,

00:44:20.774 --> 00:44:23.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Remember things are going
to get better in the future;

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:25.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to change this;
it’s going to get better,”

00:44:25.546 --> 00:44:27.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is comforting.

00:44:27.214 --> 00:44:30.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is also comforting 
(like Jehovah says here in verse 12)

00:44:30.484 --> 00:44:33.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the person says,
“What can I do for you right now?”

00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jehovah is saying right now,
‘Come, pray to me.’

00:44:37.558 --> 00:44:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is there to comfort and help us.

00:44:41.228 --> 00:44:44.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could kind of illustrate
the way Jehovah feels

00:44:44.064 --> 00:44:47.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by thinking about parents
and how they deal with a small child.

00:44:47.901 --> 00:44:51.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever seen a small child,
maybe two or three years of age,

00:44:51.572 --> 00:44:55.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they fall really badly
and scrape their knees badly,

00:44:55.542 --> 00:44:57.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are screaming in pain?

00:44:57.878 --> 00:45:00.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s this red liquid leaking out of them.

00:45:00.447 --> 00:45:02.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are distraught.

00:45:02.549 --> 00:45:04.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, in that child’s mind,

00:45:04.551 --> 00:45:07.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he may think: ‘This is the end of it.
This is the end of my life as I know it.

00:45:07.588 --> 00:45:10.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m never going to recover from this.

00:45:10.257 --> 00:45:12.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to die.’

00:45:12.526 --> 00:45:16.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for the parents, of course,
their perspective is different, isn’t it?

00:45:16.663 --> 00:45:20.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they comfort the child;
they help to take care of the skinned knee.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They comfort them, and they tell them:
“You’re going to live.

00:45:23.103 --> 00:45:25.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to be OK.
It’s going to be all right.”

00:45:25.839 --> 00:45:27.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And why can the parent have that view?

00:45:27.841 --> 00:45:30.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they know that in a few hours maybe

00:45:30.677 --> 00:45:32.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(at least in a week or so),

00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:34.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the child is not even going to remember
that skinned knee.

00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:37.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to be just a very distant memory.

00:45:37.451 --> 00:45:41.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Jehovah also knows
that whatever we’re going through right now

00:45:41.989 --> 00:45:45.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whatever suffering
we may be going through now—

00:45:45.325 --> 00:45:49.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that soon in that new world,
we aren’t going to recall that suffering.

00:45:49.129 --> 00:45:51.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he knows that he can solve
any problem we’re facing

00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:55.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as easily as we heal from a scraped knee.

00:45:55.135 --> 00:45:58.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows our whole eternal lives
are ahead of us.

00:45:58.839 --> 00:46:03.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So he comforts us;
he listens to our heartfelt prayers.

00:46:03.110 --> 00:46:05.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like a kind parent, he’s telling us

00:46:05.412 --> 00:46:08.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(through our brothers,
the Bible, and holy spirit),

00:46:08.849 --> 00:46:11.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You will live.’

00:46:11.385 --> 00:46:14.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is happy
because right now, what can he do?

00:46:14.888 --> 00:46:17.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He can comfort us and help us.

00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:19.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what is the lesson for us?

00:46:19.026 --> 00:46:22.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can comfort and help others.

00:46:22.029 --> 00:46:24.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re, really, kind of all
in this “lifeboat” together,

00:46:24.898 --> 00:46:26.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to make it to the “new-world shore,”

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:28.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we can help one another.

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:34.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third,
his hand is patiently waiting

00:46:34.107 --> 00:46:36.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the right time to act.

00:46:36.109 --> 00:46:38.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is waiting patiently

00:46:38.779 --> 00:46:41.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the complete vindication
of his sovereignty.

00:46:41.315 --> 00:46:44.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really love
what the June 2017 <i>Watchtower </i> article

00:46:44.885 --> 00:46:48.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Keep Your Eyes on the Big Issue” said:

00:46:48.455 --> 00:46:51.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Let us not become
so absorbed in our own lives

00:46:51.358 --> 00:46:54.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we lose sight of this big issue

00:46:54.027 --> 00:46:56.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“—the vindication of Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:46:56.663 --> 00:47:00.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And let us appreciate
that our role in this vital issue

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“entails remaining faithful

00:47:02.002 --> 00:47:05.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even under difficult circumstances.”

00:47:05.739 --> 00:47:08.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful quote to think about?

00:47:08.642 --> 00:47:12.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah knows that by his being patient now,

00:47:12.446 --> 00:47:16.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he and all his faithful servants
will never have to go through this again.

00:47:16.383 --> 00:47:21.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The issue of sovereignty
will be completely settled.

00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:23.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t you admire Jehovah’s patience?

00:47:23.657 --> 00:47:26.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I mean, to watch all that is happening

00:47:26.426 --> 00:47:31.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to have the self-control
to wait for the appointed time

00:47:31.398 --> 00:47:35.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is truly an example of patience in action.

00:47:35.135 --> 00:47:37.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we think about the different situations

00:47:37.638 --> 00:47:39.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters and others face

00:47:39.673 --> 00:47:41.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when a mother, for example,

00:47:41.675 --> 00:47:46.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watches a handicapped son
struggle to walk or to talk

00:47:46.246 --> 00:47:50.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a husband watches his wife
struggle to breathe—

00:47:50.317 --> 00:47:52.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want so much at that moment

00:47:52.653 --> 00:47:56.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to press that big, red,
“start-the-new-world” button now.

00:47:57.724 --> 00:48:00.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you have that feeling,

00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:03.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember our text for today:

00:48:03.463 --> 00:48:08.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The hand of Jehovah
will become known to his servants.”

00:48:09.803 --> 00:48:11.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the lesson for us?

00:48:11.805 --> 00:48:13.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be patient

00:48:13.807 --> 00:48:18.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep our eyes
on the big issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:48:19.379 --> 00:48:22.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s just review those three points.

00:48:22.049 --> 00:48:25.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we see Jehovah’s hand

00:48:25.586 --> 00:48:29.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be happy when we see
all of this suffering around us?

00:48:29.289 --> 00:48:31.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we can be happy knowing

00:48:31.291 --> 00:48:34.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what Jehovah and Jesus
and the resurrected anointed

00:48:34.428 --> 00:48:37.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are doing right now
to prepare for the new world.

00:48:37.364 --> 00:48:40.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can be happy
because we have a role

00:48:40.067 --> 00:48:42.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in comforting and helping others.

00:48:42.869 --> 00:48:46.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we can be happy being patient,

00:48:46.607 --> 00:48:48.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knowing why we’re being patient.

00:48:48.742 --> 00:48:53.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have our eyes
on that big issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty.

00:48:55.048 --> 00:48:58.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may not always
be able to see Jehovah’s hand,

00:48:58.552 --> 00:49:02.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we can be sure,
as our text for today says,

00:49:02.089 --> 00:49:06.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah’s hand is there,
and it will become known.

00:49:07.527 --> 00:49:11.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every year, millions of people
come together at our conventions

00:49:11.598 --> 00:49:15.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to learn about Jehovah
and encourage each other.

00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:18.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting next month,
“Always Rejoice”! Conventions

00:49:18.972 --> 00:49:21.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be held all over the earth.

00:49:21.575 --> 00:49:25.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses
will be actively inviting their neighbors,

00:49:25.579 --> 00:49:30.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
workmates, schoolmates,
and all interested ones to join us.

00:49:30.350 --> 00:49:32.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What effect can receiving an invitation

00:49:32.753 --> 00:49:34.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have on a person’s life?

00:49:34.821 --> 00:49:37.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s watch the following report.

00:49:44.364 --> 00:49:47.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I came to Greece as an immigrant
when I was just 16 years old.

00:49:48.201 --> 00:49:50.404 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Because of that, I never felt safe

00:49:50.404 --> 00:49:52.439 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with people around me.

00:49:52.439 --> 00:49:54.441 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At that time, I was renting

00:49:54.441 --> 00:49:57.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an apartment from a man
who was studying the Bible

00:49:57.277 --> 00:49:59.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day I joined the study,

00:50:02.949 --> 00:50:05.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brother invited me to the convention.

00:50:06.553 --> 00:50:11.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was very cautious at the beginning,
but the brother seemed trustworthy.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:16.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I always had questions about the true God,

00:50:16.296 --> 00:50:19.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I wanted to learn more about Him,
so I decided to go.

00:50:21.068 --> 00:50:23.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2016,

00:50:23.437 --> 00:50:24.905 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I received an invitation

00:50:24.905 --> 00:50:26.406 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from my son to attend

00:50:26.406 --> 00:50:28.408 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:50:28.408 --> 00:50:30.677 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He was getting baptized at that convention,

00:50:30.677 --> 00:50:33.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was important to him
for me to be there,

00:50:33.914 --> 00:50:35.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so he asked me to go.

00:50:35.949 --> 00:50:39.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though I was very active
in another religion for 30 years,

00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:42.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went in order to please him.

00:50:44.257 --> 00:50:49.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I learned the truth after I supplicated God
with all my strength

00:50:49.262 --> 00:50:51.264 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because I was really lost.

00:50:51.264 --> 00:50:53.266 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I asked for answers to questions

00:50:53.266 --> 00:50:55.001 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that were yet unanswered.

00:50:55.001 --> 00:50:57.003 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And God answered me.

00:50:57.003 --> 00:51:01.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave me the answer
to my prayers when I found this.

00:51:01.308 --> 00:51:06.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This invitation, “Deliverance at Hand!,”
was the answer to my prayers.

00:51:07.781 --> 00:51:12.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Arriving there, at that convention,
I observed the crowd—many people.

00:51:12.686 --> 00:51:15.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Starting right at the parking lot,

00:51:15.589 --> 00:51:19.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything was organized;
people were entering in an orderly manner.

00:51:19.626 --> 00:51:22.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Inside the Assembly Hall,
everyone was very organized,

00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:25.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well-dressed, very loving.

00:51:25.065 --> 00:51:27.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when the convention began,

00:51:27.834 --> 00:51:32.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw such spiritual food
that I had never seen in my religion.

00:51:32.572 --> 00:51:35.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thirty years in a religion
—I thought I knew a lot,

00:51:35.942 --> 00:51:37.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I didn’t know anything.

00:51:38.912 --> 00:51:41.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I decided to study.

00:51:41.982 --> 00:51:46.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I arrived at the convention,
I started watching the people.

00:51:46.186 --> 00:51:48.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their faces were smiling.

00:51:48.221 --> 00:51:50.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They seemed to be happy.

00:51:50.590 --> 00:51:54.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were men, women, and children
from different races and nationalities.

00:51:55.996 --> 00:51:59.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they sang,
I could sense their true joy and unity.

00:52:02.669 --> 00:52:06.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the first time in my life,
I felt very safe.

00:52:06.973 --> 00:52:09.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was not in fear
of being taken advantage of.

00:52:11.645 --> 00:52:15.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, what I learned at that convention

00:52:15.182 --> 00:52:17.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
drew me to the true God.

00:52:18.852 --> 00:52:20.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought, ‘If all these people

00:52:20.887 --> 00:52:25.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘are truly happy and feel really safe
being part of this organization

00:52:25.292 --> 00:52:28.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘—Jehovah’s organization—

00:52:28.295 --> 00:52:32.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then, indeed,
this is what I was looking for.’

00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:36.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went to the convention on Sunday.

00:52:36.870 --> 00:52:40.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was really warmly welcomed
by all the brothers and sisters there.

00:52:42.542 --> 00:52:46.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I listened to all of the morning program,

00:52:46.213 --> 00:52:49.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at noon,
I recognized the sound of the truth.

00:52:49.983 --> 00:52:52.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was sure it was the truth.

00:52:52.953 --> 00:52:56.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided to become
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:52:56.089 --> 00:52:58.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I became one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:52:58.225 --> 00:53:03.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I got baptized in 2017,
and now I serve as a pioneer.

00:53:03.797 --> 00:53:07.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My first study was the following Wednesday.

00:53:07.167 --> 00:53:09.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was happy to get to know Jehovah.

00:53:09.903 --> 00:53:12.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:53:12.739 --> 00:53:17.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and as much as I can,
I participate in the invitation campaigns.

00:53:17.577 --> 00:53:21.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really hope that it helps
many people to be delivered.

00:53:21.848 --> 00:53:26.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started attending meetings
right after the convention.

00:53:26.019 --> 00:53:28.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I started a Bible study,
and eventually I got baptized

00:53:28.989 --> 00:53:31.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:53:32.559 --> 00:53:34.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother, one of my brothers,

00:53:34.928 --> 00:53:37.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and my two sisters
are now serving Jehovah as well.

00:53:39.199 --> 00:53:42.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later on, I got married to a faithful sister,

00:53:42.202 --> 00:53:45.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a very good wife,
and we serve Jehovah together.

00:53:46.006 --> 00:53:49.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People need to feel safe,

00:53:49.042 --> 00:53:53.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I know for sure that Jehovah’s
organization is the safest place you can be.

00:53:58.218 --> 00:54:02.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice how
the convention invitations were obtained?

00:54:02.222 --> 00:54:05.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were given by a relative
or an associate

00:54:05.358 --> 00:54:07.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or simply left at the door.

00:54:07.727 --> 00:54:10.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never know how even a single invitation

00:54:10.997 --> 00:54:14.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can help a person come to know Jehovah.

00:54:14.301 --> 00:54:17.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our diligence in the invitation campaign

00:54:17.137 --> 00:54:20.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can make a powerful difference.

00:54:20.006 --> 00:54:22.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s program
has helped us remember

00:54:22.909 --> 00:54:26.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we are precious to Jehovah.

00:54:26.079 --> 00:54:28.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned that even if we
had a hard start in life,

00:54:28.949 --> 00:54:31.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we don’t have to be a victim of our past.

00:54:32.686 --> 00:54:34.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how Jehovah sees us,

00:54:34.688 --> 00:54:39.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cares for us,
and provides loving help in many ways.

00:54:39.092 --> 00:54:43.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were reminded
that “Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted”

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:47.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that through prayer,
we can unburden ourselves

00:54:47.133 --> 00:54:50.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and receive comfort,
knowing that whatever suffering

00:54:50.270 --> 00:54:53.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re enduring now will soon be forgotten.

00:54:55.075 --> 00:54:58.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s conclude our program by visiting
our brothers and sisters in Cuba.

00:54:59.512 --> 00:55:04.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Republic of Cuba
is a chain of 1,600 islands and islets

00:55:04.250 --> 00:55:06.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the intersection of the Atlantic Ocean,

00:55:06.653 --> 00:55:08.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Caribbean Sea,

00:55:08.088 --> 00:55:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Gulf of Mexico.

00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:14.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cuba itself is by far
the largest island in the chain,

00:55:14.427 --> 00:55:17.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with one major city: Havana.

00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:20.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many are embracing the truth.

00:55:21.001 --> 00:55:24.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cuba is home to almost 95,000 publishers

00:55:24.938 --> 00:55:28.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 1,400 congregations.

00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:33.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re conducting
more than 135,000 Bible studies. 

00:55:33.246 --> 00:55:37.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lush mountains and hills
cover a quarter of Cuba.

00:55:37.117 --> 00:55:41.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the western end
of the island is Viñales,

00:55:41.021 --> 00:55:44.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
famous for its towerlike hills
called <i>mogotes</i>.

00:55:45.692 --> 00:55:48.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caves and rivers run through many of them.

00:55:48.495 --> 00:55:53.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Este de Viñales Congregation
is located in this part of Cuba.

00:55:53.199 --> 00:55:56.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, 128 publishers conduct

00:55:56.536 --> 00:55:59.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
275 Bible studies.

00:55:59.572 --> 00:56:03.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of its vast territory,
the congregation has three groups.

00:56:03.676 --> 00:56:07.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One group that has only seven publishers

00:56:07.380 --> 00:56:11.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had 75 people attend last year’s Memorial.

00:56:11.251 --> 00:56:15.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To cover their territory,
the brothers travel long distances,

00:56:15.688 --> 00:56:19.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes by bicycle or motorcycle.

00:56:19.359 --> 00:56:22.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They witness to people wherever they are

00:56:22.162 --> 00:56:25.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—on farms and in their homes.

00:56:25.965 --> 00:56:28.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers enjoy Christian fellowship,

00:56:28.601 --> 00:56:30.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
good coffee,

00:56:30.603 --> 00:56:33.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and singing songs of praise to Jehovah.

00:56:33.039 --> 00:56:37.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in the Este de Viñales Congregation

00:56:37.077 --> 00:56:40.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their love to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:56:40.914 --> 00:56:43.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:56:43.616 --> 00:56:46.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
