00:00:01.105 --> 00:00:03.524 line:10% position:50% align:center
When I first began serving at Bethel,

00:00:03.524 --> 00:00:05.776 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’d call home to speak with my family

00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:07.820 line:10% position:50% align:center
and my mother would always ask,

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.321 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Have they told you when the date

00:00:09.321 --> 00:00:10.865 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Armageddon is?”

00:00:11.574 --> 00:00:14.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though she was being humorous
and didn’t expect an answer,

00:00:14.368 --> 00:00:17.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
her question reveals what we all long for

00:00:17.496 --> 00:00:21.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s promised new world.

00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you have, in a sense,
asked Jehovah that question,

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:26.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How much longer, Jehovah?”

00:00:26.881 --> 00:00:30.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or you’ve said to Jehovah:
“I’m exhausted.

00:00:30.134 --> 00:00:33.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t know how much longer
I can keep going.

00:00:33.888 --> 00:00:38.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please, Jehovah, when will your promises
for a world of lasting peace,

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
refreshment, and relief from the pressures
of this world come true?”

00:00:43.731 --> 00:00:46.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all likely feel this way
from time to time.

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:49.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us not give up,

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:53.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
not give out, in our spiritual battle?

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the words of Jesus at Mark 13:29.

00:00:59.622 --> 00:01:04.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what he says: “Likewise also you,

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when you see these things happening,

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:09.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
know that he is near at the doors.”

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:13.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
What things would we see happening?

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:17.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prophecy being fulfilled.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we recognize Bible prophecies
being fulfilled before our eyes,

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
our faith is fortified.

00:01:24.063 --> 00:01:26.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see that the end is imminent.

00:01:26.357 --> 00:01:30.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recognize that we’re almost done.

00:01:30.444 --> 00:01:33.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helps us not give out.

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some of these prophecies?

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:39.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re familiar with the prophecies
of earthquakes,

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:41.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
“wars and reports of wars,”
food shortages,

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:44.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
and disease all happening at once.

00:01:44.333 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see these things happening.”

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:50.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see the diminished love of God

00:01:50.339 --> 00:01:54.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the deteriorating attitude
of people in general,

00:01:54.218 --> 00:01:57.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
as foretold in 2 Timothy chapter 3.

00:01:58.305 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Timothy 3:13 says:

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Wicked men and impostors

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:06.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
will advance from bad to worse.”

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:09.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see these things happening.”

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:13.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
As foretold, “this good news
of the Kingdom” is being preached worldwide

00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
—now in over 1,000 languages.

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:18.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see these things happening.”

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of Christ’s rule,

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
the knowledge of Jehovah
is abundantly overflowing.

00:02:23.998 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You see these things happening.”

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about Isaiah 45:18?

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here Jehovah calls himself
the “Maker” of the earth,

00:02:34.216 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who did not create it simply for nothing,

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
but formed it to be inhabited.”

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, scientists say that the world
is on the brink of becoming uninhabitable.

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:50.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
They warn that if action to stop
global warming is not taken quickly,

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
its compounding effects
will become irreversible.

00:02:54.737 --> 00:02:56.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 11:18,

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible foretold that in our day,

00:02:59.825 --> 00:03:02.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
man would be “ruining the earth,”

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it also assures us

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will step in
and not let the earth be completely ruined.

00:03:11.295 --> 00:03:14.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some may wonder how much worse
things will get.

00:03:14.757 --> 00:03:18.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, at Luke 17:20,

00:03:18.093 --> 00:03:20.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said this

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:22.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke 17:20:

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Kingdom of God
is not coming with striking observableness.”

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:31.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that world conditions
during the last days

00:03:31.815 --> 00:03:33.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
would not be so extreme

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:37.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people would be forced to believe
that the end is near.

00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:41.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Matthew 24:37-39 indicates,

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:43.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would still be “eating and drinking,”

00:03:43.952 --> 00:03:47.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting married,
and able to carry on their everyday lives.

00:03:48.165 --> 00:03:50.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should this affect us?

00:03:50.918 --> 00:03:55.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
It should fortify us not to give up.

00:03:55.172 --> 00:03:57.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Mark 13:35,

00:03:57.424 --> 00:04:00.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said we must “keep on the watch.”

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:04.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means to stay awake and be on guard.

00:04:04.348 --> 00:04:07.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the parallel account in Matthew 24,

00:04:07.392 --> 00:04:11.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus connects this with being ready.

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:17.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will help us to do this
when we feel so exhausted?

00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:20.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where can we get strength
to keep up the fight?

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a word—trust.

00:04:26.036 --> 00:04:29.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all love Jehovah.

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to be convinced

00:04:32.334 --> 00:04:36.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s loyal love for us individually.

00:04:37.548 --> 00:04:42.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we trust that he’ll always
be there to help us?

00:04:43.387 --> 00:04:46.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice on-screen the assurance Jehovah gives

00:04:46.765 --> 00:04:50.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 13:5:

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:54.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will never leave you,

00:04:54.648 --> 00:04:57.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will never abandon you.”

00:04:58.694 --> 00:05:03.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has been sustaining us.

00:05:03.323 --> 00:05:05.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how he sustains you.

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:11.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’ve experienced
the ravages of a natural disaster;

00:05:11.248 --> 00:05:14.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has sustained you.

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:17.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’ve dealt
with the loss of a loved one;

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:20.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has sustained you.

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whatever trial we’ve gone through,

00:05:22.384 --> 00:05:26.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can see how Jehovah has helped us.

00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:30.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
This confirms for us
that he’ll sustain us in the future.

00:05:30.976 --> 00:05:33.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have the confidence

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:36.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s stated at Psalm 46:1, 2:

00:05:37.608 --> 00:05:41.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God is our refuge and strength,

00:05:41.236 --> 00:05:45.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a help that is readily found
in times of distress.

00:05:45.574 --> 00:05:49.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why we will not fear,
though the earth undergoes change,

00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:52.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
though the mountains topple
into the depths of the sea.”

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:57.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
These emphatic expressions leave no doubt

00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:00.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah will care for us.

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:05.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is this reminder so important?

00:06:06.303 --> 00:06:09.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, verse 6 of Hebrews chapter 13

00:06:09.348 --> 00:06:12.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
links trust with courage.

00:06:12.809 --> 00:06:15.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says:

00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:21.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So that we may be of good courage and say:

00:06:21.235 --> 00:06:25.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘‘‘Jehovah is my helper;
I will not be afraid.

00:06:25.906 --> 00:06:27.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can man do to me?’”

00:06:28.825 --> 00:06:32.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice it doesn’t say <i>our </i> or <i>their </i> helper.

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says “my helper.”

00:06:34.957 --> 00:06:36.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love Jehovah.

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:40.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also be absolutely convinced

00:06:40.128 --> 00:06:44.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah loves us
and will help us individually.

00:06:46.218 --> 00:06:50.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, it can be difficult
to trust that Jehovah loves us personally

00:06:50.555 --> 00:06:53.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will act in our behalf.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help build our trust
in Jehovah’s love?

00:06:57.604 --> 00:07:00.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss three ways.

00:07:00.148 --> 00:07:02.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Proverbs 15

00:07:02.651 --> 00:07:05.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Proverbs 15, notice verse 9:

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:09.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah detests the way of the wicked one,

00:07:09.825 --> 00:07:14.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he loves the one
who pursues righteousness.”

00:07:15.998 --> 00:07:18.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He loves the one

00:07:18.625 --> 00:07:22.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
who pursues
[or, chases after] righteousness.”

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows we can’t be perfectly righteous.

00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:30.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he loves us for trying our best,

00:07:30.846 --> 00:07:34.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he said, ‘for pursuing righteousness.’

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:37.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves us because we don’t quit.

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:40.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can trust that he’ll never abandon us

00:07:40.814 --> 00:07:45.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we don’t give up
in pursuing righteousness.

00:07:46.236 --> 00:07:51.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, pour out your heart to Jehovah.

00:07:51.158 --> 00:07:54.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lamentations 2:19 says this

00:07:54.453 --> 00:07:57.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Lamentations 2:19:

00:07:57.372 --> 00:08:00.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pour out your heart like water

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:02.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the face of Jehovah.”

00:08:03.587 --> 00:08:08.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t say,
“Pour out your mind” or “your thoughts”

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:10.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
but “pour out your heart”

00:08:10.969 --> 00:08:15.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that includes our feelings,
our concerns, our anxieties.

00:08:15.974 --> 00:08:19.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
We pour out our heart
like one pours out water

00:08:19.728 --> 00:08:21.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not holding anything back.

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:25.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we express to our heavenly Father

00:08:25.525 --> 00:08:28.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
our love and appreciation for him,

00:08:28.487 --> 00:08:31.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we tell him our concerns and desires,

00:08:31.490 --> 00:08:34.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we ask for his direction,

00:08:34.034 --> 00:08:37.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
we show that we value
our friendship with him.

00:08:38.538 --> 00:08:41.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will be the result for you?

00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:43.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more you pour out your heart like water

00:08:43.877 --> 00:08:47.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feel his personal response to you,

00:08:47.005 --> 00:08:50.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more you’ll sense his love for you

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the more you’ll trust
that he’ll never abandon you.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your gratitude for Jehovah’s
enduring love will increase.

00:08:59.684 --> 00:09:02.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, third, remember that trials

00:09:02.729 --> 00:09:06.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
do not mean a loss of Jehovah’s favor.

00:09:06.733 --> 00:09:10.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our enemy knows that feeling close to Jehovah

00:09:10.153 --> 00:09:12.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the source of our strength.

00:09:12.989 --> 00:09:16.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he’ll try to undermine our confidence,

00:09:16.118 --> 00:09:19.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he hopes that we break away from Jehovah.

00:09:19.287 --> 00:09:24.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when Job
was undergoing a severe trial,

00:09:24.126 --> 00:09:29.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
his false comforters lyingly said
that the reason for these trials

00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:31.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that he’d lost Jehovah’s favor.

00:09:32.884 --> 00:09:36.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah reminded Job to look at creation

00:09:36.596 --> 00:09:40.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see His love and wisdom.

00:09:41.518 --> 00:09:44.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did faithful Job respond?

00:09:44.271 --> 00:09:46.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said at Job 42:5:

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:51.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My ears have heard about you,

00:09:51.403 --> 00:09:55.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now I do see you with my eyes.”

00:09:56.783 --> 00:10:00.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may wonder if we’ve lost Jehovah’s favor.

00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:03.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should ask Jehovah to help us see him

00:10:03.457 --> 00:10:07.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see his loyal love for us every day.

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:10.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask him to help you use this trial

00:10:10.547 --> 00:10:14.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a stepping stone to love
and trust him even more.

00:10:16.136 --> 00:10:20.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve discussed one way
we get ready for the upcoming events

00:10:20.974 --> 00:10:25.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
—build our trust that Jehovah
has loyal love for us individually.

00:10:27.063 --> 00:10:29.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting that Jehovah will never abandon us

00:10:29.816 --> 00:10:32.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us the strength to keep up the fight

00:10:32.444 --> 00:10:35.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep on the watch.

00:10:35.197 --> 00:10:37.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ephesians 6:16,

00:10:37.199 --> 00:10:41.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
faith, or trust, in Jehovah
is compared to a shield

00:10:41.661 --> 00:10:46.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a shield “with which you [can] extinguish
all the wicked one’s burning arrows,”

00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:49.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
or all of Satan’s spiritual attacks.

00:10:49.336 --> 00:10:53.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when we hear lies about Jehovah,

00:10:53.715 --> 00:10:57.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
his organization,
and those he’s appointed to take the lead,

00:10:57.802 --> 00:10:59.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not be shaken.

00:10:59.846 --> 00:11:03.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t give up or give out.

00:11:03.558 --> 00:11:08.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know the prophecy
at Matthew 24:45 has been fulfilled.

00:11:08.104 --> 00:11:11.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has lovingly provided a slave

00:11:11.107 --> 00:11:13.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s “faithful and discreet.”

00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:19.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recognize that Jehovah
provides spiritual food and direction

00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:23.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
through this body of men at the right time.

00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:26.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re not left floundering
or trying to find our way.

00:11:26.414 --> 00:11:29.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we remain obedient

00:11:29.334 --> 00:11:33.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
and responsive to the direction we receive.

00:11:33.129 --> 00:11:35.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never dismiss it,

00:11:35.131 --> 00:11:38.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if it doesn’t appear practical
from a human standpoint.

00:11:40.679 --> 00:11:43.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting in Jehovah’s loyal love

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:45.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
has saved his people in the past.

00:11:46.893 --> 00:11:51.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Chronicles 20:1, 2,

00:11:51.815 --> 00:11:55.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
it tells us that Jehoshaphat
learned that a coalition of nations

00:11:55.777 --> 00:11:58.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“a large crowd . . . from the region
of the sea”—

00:11:58.238 --> 00:12:00.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
were coming against him.

00:12:00.574 --> 00:12:04.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat already had the habit
of turning to Jehovah.

00:12:04.869 --> 00:12:08.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He resolved to search for Jehovah.”

00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:12.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he and his faithful subjects do this?

00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:16.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat poured his heart out
like water to Jehovah.

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:19.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice in verse 12

00:12:19.676 --> 00:12:23.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
how he expresses
his complete trust in Jehovah:

00:12:26.057 --> 00:12:30.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For we are powerless before this large crowd
that is coming against us;

00:12:30.895 --> 00:12:33.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we do not know what we should do,

00:12:33.898 --> 00:12:37.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our eyes are toward you.”

00:12:38.194 --> 00:12:40.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah respond?

00:12:40.697 --> 00:12:42.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice verse 15.

00:12:42.991 --> 00:12:47.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sent Jahaziel to reassure them:

00:12:47.537 --> 00:12:51.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid or be terrified
because of this large crowd,

00:12:51.625 --> 00:12:55.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the battle is not yours but God’s.”

00:12:56.379 --> 00:12:58.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
The strategy that Jehoshaphat followed

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t seem practical
from a human standpoint.

00:13:02.302 --> 00:13:04.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat appointed singers

00:13:04.304 --> 00:13:07.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
dressed “in holy adornment”
to praise Jehovah.

00:13:07.932 --> 00:13:12.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how unusual that he put them
in front of the armed men!

00:13:13.396 --> 00:13:15.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were they singing songs about how Jehovah

00:13:15.732 --> 00:13:19.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
defeated their enemies in past wars?

00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:20.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:25.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
They sang about Jehovah’s loyal love.

00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:27.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the result?

00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:31.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah confused their enemies,
and they attacked each other.

00:13:32.916 --> 00:13:36.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons can we learn from this account?

00:13:36.544 --> 00:13:41.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting Jehovah includes
trusting his representatives.

00:13:41.383 --> 00:13:45.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lifesaving direction we receive
from Jehovah’s organization

00:13:45.345 --> 00:13:49.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not appear practical
from a human standpoint.

00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:52.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we recognize
the fulfillment  of the prophecy

00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:54.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 24:45

00:13:54.187 --> 00:13:56.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
about “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:13:56.356 --> 00:13:59.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re ready to obey
any instruction they provide.

00:14:00.735 --> 00:14:05.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, getting ready includes building trust

00:14:05.407 --> 00:14:10.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being convinced that Jehovah
will deliver us from the wicked one.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trusting Him will help us understand

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophetic role
of “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:14:17.585 --> 00:14:20.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this time of the end
when Jehovah is using them

00:14:20.922 --> 00:14:24.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide lifesaving direction.

00:14:24.759 --> 00:14:29.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
This direction is helping us to stay ready.

00:14:30.265 --> 00:14:33.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has sustained us in the past,

00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:36.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he sustains us now.

00:14:38.356 --> 00:14:40.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing these things happening

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:44.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also fortify and strengthen us.

00:14:45.947 --> 00:14:49.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of you have been fighting
to “keep on the watch”

00:14:49.159 --> 00:14:51.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
for many years.

00:14:51.536 --> 00:14:54.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the end is clearly in sight.

00:14:54.998 --> 00:14:57.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t want to give up now.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:02.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the reassurance at Galatians 6:9

00:15:03.506 --> 00:15:07.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Galatians 6:9:

00:15:07.218 --> 00:15:11.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So let us not give up in doing what is fine,

00:15:11.473 --> 00:15:14.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for in due time we will reap

00:15:14.309 --> 00:15:16.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we do not tire out.”

00:15:18.104 --> 00:15:20.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of our imperfect flesh

00:15:20.398 --> 00:15:23.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the efforts of Satan
and this wicked world,

00:15:23.359 --> 00:15:27.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must constantly battle
negative influences.

00:15:27.864 --> 00:15:32.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you dear brothers and sisters
must fight hard every day

00:15:32.327 --> 00:15:35.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
to maintain your relationship with Jehovah.

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:36.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t give up!

00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:40.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your fight has not been in vain.

00:15:40.835 --> 00:15:43.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve made the right choices.

00:15:43.087 --> 00:15:45.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has seen your loyal love for him,

00:15:45.507 --> 00:15:49.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he treasures your devotion.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:52.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time and time again,
you’ve made sacrifices

00:15:52.347 --> 00:15:55.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
and left your comfort zone
to give Jehovah your best,

00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:58.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay active in the ministry,
to keep taking in spiritual food,

00:15:58.895 --> 00:16:02.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to teach your children
how to speak about Jehovah.

00:16:03.149 --> 00:16:06.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves you dearly for this

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:11.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will loyally continue
to help you until the battle is won.

00:16:11.783 --> 00:16:14.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not give up now!

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:19.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you young ones,
Jehovah loves you too.

00:16:19.123 --> 00:16:23.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that you’re growing up
in a world that’s broken.

00:16:23.086 --> 00:16:27.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that it can be hard for you
to maintain hope for the future.

00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:30.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, never forget that your God,

00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:34.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
your heavenly Father, loves you dearly.

00:16:34.848 --> 00:16:38.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never forget that your future is bright.

00:16:40.144 --> 00:16:43.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we’re young or old or in between,

00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:45.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not give up.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:47.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so close.

00:16:47.485 --> 00:16:51.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see these things happening
with our own eyes.
