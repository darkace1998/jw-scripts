00:02.118 --> 00:04.453
During his earthly ministry, 


00:04.453 --> 00:06.455
Jesus miraculously healed 


00:06.455 --> 00:08.992
many sick or disabled persons. 


00:08.992 --> 00:11.294
At times, 
he would say to such ones 


00:11.293 --> 00:15.231
the expression we find 
at Matthew 9:29: 


00:15.232 --> 00:20.237
“According to your faith 
let it happen to you.” 


00:20.237 --> 00:22.539
The principle of what Jesus stated 


00:22.538 --> 00:27.076
applies in every aspect 
of our Christian life and ministry. 


00:27.077 --> 00:30.614
But today we will discuss how this principle 


00:30.613 --> 00:33.550
that faith in Jehovah makes things happen 


00:33.550 --> 00:35.552
can work for us in three areas. 


00:35.552 --> 00:37.554
We will see: 


00:37.553 --> 00:42.391
1) how our faith has made positive things 
happen in our personal life, 


00:42.392 --> 00:46.495
2) how we can accomplish 
things in God’s service 


00:46.495 --> 00:51.633
that would not be possible 
without faith in Jehovah God, 


00:51.633 --> 00:56.505
and 3) how faith moves us 
to step out of our comfort zone 


00:56.505 --> 00:59.842
to do more in Jehovah’s service.


00:59.842 --> 01:03.747
The principle that faith in Jehovah 
makes things happen 


01:03.747 --> 01:07.950
is well illustrated in one 
of the miracles Jesus performed. 


01:07.950 --> 01:12.122
Please open your Bible to Mark chapter 5, 


01:12.122 --> 01:16.025
and let’s read verses 25-29: 


01:16.025 --> 01:18.428
“Now there was a woman 


01:18.428 --> 01:21.965
“who had had 
a flow of blood for 12 years. 


01:21.965 --> 01:25.568
“She had suffered much 
at the hands of many physicians 


01:25.568 --> 01:28.103
“and had spent all her resources, 


01:28.103 --> 01:31.808
“and she was no better but, 
rather, had become worse. 


01:31.808 --> 01:35.778
“When she heard 
the reports about Jesus, 


01:35.778 --> 01:40.583
“she came up behind him in the crowd 
and touched his outer garment, 


01:40.583 --> 01:42.985
“for she kept saying: 


01:42.985 --> 01:47.723
“‘If I touch just his outer garments, 
I will get well.’ 


01:47.723 --> 01:51.961
“And immediately her flow 
of blood dried up, 


01:51.962 --> 01:54.064
“and she sensed in her body 


01:54.063 --> 01:58.468
that she had been healed 
of the grievous sickness.” 


01:58.468 --> 02:02.671
In the following verses, 
Jesus asked who had touched him. 


02:02.672 --> 02:04.674
The woman then revealed 
before the crowd 


02:04.673 --> 02:07.976
what she had done 
and how she’d been cured. 


02:07.977 --> 02:12.515
Now notice Jesus’ response in verse 34: 


02:12.515 --> 02:15.117
“He said to her: 


02:15.117 --> 02:18.889
“‘Daughter, 
your faith has made you well. 


02:18.888 --> 02:21.323
“‘Go in peace, and be healed


02:21.323 --> 02:23.458
from your grievous sickness.’”


02:23.458 --> 02:25.461
What comforting words 


02:25.462 --> 02:27.830
Jesus spoke to this trembling woman: 


02:27.830 --> 02:30.833
“Your faith has made you well.” 


02:30.833 --> 02:32.835
What did Jesus mean? 


02:32.835 --> 02:36.272
Let’s examine the account more closely.


02:36.272 --> 02:40.577
It says that the woman 
heard “reports about Jesus.” 


02:40.577 --> 02:42.845
Many others heard the same reports, 


02:42.845 --> 02:45.147
but not all put faith in Jesus. 


02:45.147 --> 02:47.584
And think of the circumstances 


02:47.583 --> 02:51.153
that could have prevented her 
from even coming to Jesus. 


02:51.153 --> 02:53.823
She had been disappointed many times 


02:53.823 --> 02:55.991
over the past 12 years. 


02:55.992 --> 02:57.994
She might well have thought: 


02:57.993 --> 02:59.995
‘What’s the use? 


02:59.995 --> 03:03.198
‘I’m tired and weak and poor. 


03:03.198 --> 03:05.201
I’m staying home.’ 


03:05.202 --> 03:07.804
Or ‘I would like for Jesus to see me, 


03:07.803 --> 03:09.971
‘but there is such a crowd. 


03:09.972 --> 03:12.242
‘How will I ever get through to him? 


03:12.242 --> 03:15.945
‘And after all, 
I’m in an unclean state, 


03:15.945 --> 03:18.013
‘and if the people discover this, 


03:18.013 --> 03:20.015
perhaps they will punish me.’ 


03:20.015 --> 03:23.485
No, she did not allow 
these negative thoughts 


03:23.485 --> 03:25.988
or doubts to fill her mind. 


03:25.988 --> 03:27.990
She left her home. 


03:27.990 --> 03:31.393
She found Jesus 
despite the large crowd. 


03:31.393 --> 03:33.428
And what was she saying? 


03:33.428 --> 03:35.431
Did she say, 


03:35.432 --> 03:37.734
“If I touch just his outer garments, 


03:37.733 --> 03:40.035
maybe I will get well”? 


03:40.035 --> 03:42.038
No, she said, 


03:42.038 --> 03:44.040
“I will get well.” 


03:44.040 --> 03:46.742
Now, it was not the case 


03:46.742 --> 03:48.879
that her faith healed her. 


03:48.878 --> 03:53.048
No, but her faith moved her 
to come to Jesus, 


03:53.048 --> 03:55.851
and she was healed 
by the power from Jehovah 


03:55.852 --> 03:58.054
that flowed through his Son. 


03:58.053 --> 04:00.523
Faith to approach Jesus 


04:00.523 --> 04:03.926
made it happen for her.


04:03.927 --> 04:07.064
If you are a dedicated, 
baptized Christian, 


04:07.063 --> 04:10.400
don’t you agree 
that your faith has already made 


04:10.400 --> 04:13.235
positive things happen 
in your personal life? 


04:13.235 --> 04:16.305
No, you were not miraculously healed 


04:16.305 --> 04:18.340
of your physical sicknesses. 


04:18.340 --> 04:20.977
We look forward 
to physical healing of our ills 


04:20.977 --> 04:23.647
during the Thousand Year Reign of Christ. 


04:23.647 --> 04:27.350
But today Jesus Christ directs a program 


04:27.350 --> 04:29.618
of spiritual healing. 


04:29.618 --> 04:32.555
When we were a part 
of this godless world, 


04:32.555 --> 04:36.792
many of us were sick spiritually, 
morally, and emotionally. 


04:36.792 --> 04:38.929
No one could cure us. 


04:38.928 --> 04:43.531
Perhaps we desperately 
tried material things or pleasures 


04:43.532 --> 04:45.602
to fill our spiritual need, 


04:45.602 --> 04:48.705
but our condition only got worse. 


04:48.705 --> 04:51.640
We were helpless and hopeless. 


04:51.640 --> 04:54.777
But then we heard “reports”


04:54.777 --> 04:58.514
—the good news 
of God’s Kingdom under Christ! 


04:58.513 --> 05:00.516
We studied the Bible. 


05:00.517 --> 05:04.687
Our faith moved us 
to make positive changes in our life 


05:04.687 --> 05:07.990
and to associate 
with the Christian congregation. 


05:07.990 --> 05:12.662
Today, we enjoy 
good spiritual health and happiness. 


05:12.662 --> 05:15.000
Our faith has made it happen.


05:17.067 --> 05:19.369
Faith has also made it possible 


05:19.368 --> 05:22.005
to accomplish things in God’s service 


05:22.005 --> 05:25.140
that perhaps 
we never thought we could do. 


05:25.140 --> 05:30.012
Please open your Bibles 
to Hebrews chapter 11. 


05:30.012 --> 05:33.717
In this portion 
of Paul’s letter to the Hebrews, 


05:33.717 --> 05:35.819
he focuses on faith. 


05:35.818 --> 05:39.221
He begins with a definition of faith. 


05:39.222 --> 05:41.957
But then, starting in verse 4, 


05:41.957 --> 05:45.027
Paul acts as a sort of tour guide, 


05:45.027 --> 05:47.030
walking us through the corridor 


05:47.030 --> 05:49.965
of thousands of years of Bible history. 


05:49.965 --> 05:52.102
He stops along the way 


05:52.102 --> 05:54.670
to point out the extraordinary things 


05:54.670 --> 05:57.005
that men and women of the past did 


05:57.005 --> 06:00.610
by means of faith in Jehovah God. 


06:00.610 --> 06:05.347
Just glance down the columns 
in this chapter 


06:05.347 --> 06:08.719
and notice how Paul introduces 
each paragraph 


06:08.718 --> 06:11.000
with the words “by faith.” 


06:12.555 --> 06:15.392
This expression “by faith” 


06:15.392 --> 06:19.000
appears 18 times in this one chapter. 


06:20.730 --> 06:22.898
Now, when we look at the names 


06:22.898 --> 06:24.933
Paul lists in this chapter, 


06:24.933 --> 06:26.701
we may think, 


06:26.702 --> 06:30.039
‘Well, these were spiritual “giants.”’ 


06:30.038 --> 06:33.743
But in reality, 
they were ordinary humans 


06:33.743 --> 06:37.011
with weaknesses 
like all of us have today. 


06:37.012 --> 06:39.915
The thing they all had in common 


06:39.915 --> 06:41.917
was faith, 


06:41.917 --> 06:44.054
and faith in Jehovah 


06:44.053 --> 06:47.590
made it possible 
for them to do amazing things. 


06:47.590 --> 06:51.127
Let’s look at some of them 
and compare what they did 


06:51.127 --> 06:54.030
with what many of you 
are doing today 


06:54.030 --> 06:56.065
by faith.


06:56.065 --> 06:58.633
Let’s read verse 5: 


06:58.633 --> 07:02.505
“By faith Enoch was transferred 


07:02.505 --> 07:04.707
“so as not to see death, 


07:04.707 --> 07:06.775
“and he was nowhere to be found 


07:06.775 --> 07:09.445
“because God had transferred him; 


07:09.445 --> 07:11.547
“for before he was transferred 


07:11.547 --> 07:13.549
“he received the witness 


07:13.548 --> 07:16.251
that he had pleased God well.” 


07:16.252 --> 07:19.622
The book of Jude, verses 14 and 15, 


07:19.622 --> 07:22.825
informs us that Enoch boldly proclaimed 


07:22.825 --> 07:24.860
that Jehovah was going to destroy 


07:24.860 --> 07:27.463
that ungodly world. 


07:27.463 --> 07:30.165
It appears that wicked, violent men 


07:30.165 --> 07:32.168
were going to take Enoch’s life 


07:32.168 --> 07:34.170
because of his bold witness. 


07:34.170 --> 07:36.938
So God chose to take him


07:36.938 --> 07:39.975
—that is, gently cutting short his life, 


07:39.975 --> 07:43.000
sparing him the pangs of a violent death.


07:44.747 --> 07:46.982
In modern times, like Enoch, 


07:46.982 --> 07:48.985
many brothers and sisters 


07:48.985 --> 07:51.587
have boldly declared God’s judgments 


07:51.587 --> 07:54.557
even when faced with death. 


07:54.557 --> 07:57.025
One brother, 
after receiving a death sentence 


07:57.025 --> 07:59.895
at Nazi hands during World War II, 


07:59.895 --> 08:03.798
wrote these words 
shortly before his execution: 


08:03.798 --> 08:08.703
“I have such peace, such tranquillity, 


08:08.703 --> 08:12.006
that you can’t possibly imagine!” 


08:12.007 --> 08:14.677
Faith made such boldness 


08:14.677 --> 08:16.879
and calmness possible. 


08:16.878 --> 08:19.381
In many ways, you very likely 


08:19.382 --> 08:22.000
have shown the same faith as Enoch. 


08:23.185 --> 08:27.055
By faith, 
you stand up to an ungodly world 


08:27.055 --> 08:30.192
by not adopting its corrupt ways. 


08:30.192 --> 08:33.864
By faith, 
you boldly declare God’s Word 


08:33.863 --> 08:36.798
from house to house 
and in public places. 


08:36.798 --> 08:39.568
Before you became a baptized Witness, 


08:39.568 --> 08:43.071
you may have thought you would never do 
this preaching work! 


08:43.072 --> 08:45.074
But you are doing it, 


08:45.073 --> 08:47.075
sometimes even in the face 


08:47.075 --> 08:49.478
of verbal abuse and opposition. 


08:49.478 --> 08:52.581
Faith has made it happen.


08:52.582 --> 08:55.217
Let’s read verse 7: 


08:55.217 --> 08:57.754
“By faith Noah, 


08:57.753 --> 09:01.423
“after receiving divine warning 
of things not yet seen, 


09:01.423 --> 09:04.860
“showed godly fear 
and constructed an ark 


09:04.860 --> 09:07.230
“for the saving of his household; 


09:07.230 --> 09:10.432
“and through this faith 
he condemned the world, 


09:10.432 --> 09:12.902
“and he became an heir 
of the righteousness 


09:12.902 --> 09:14.870
that results from faith.” 


09:14.870 --> 09:17.673
Nothing in the Bible indicates 


09:17.673 --> 09:20.541
that Jehovah chose Noah 
to construct an ark 


09:20.542 --> 09:23.579
because he was an experienced builder. 


09:23.578 --> 09:27.716
Certainly, he never had built 
such a gigantic vessel 


09:27.717 --> 09:30.687
as what Jehovah 
had asked him to construct. 


09:30.687 --> 09:34.324
Noah likely pondered many questions:


09:34.323 --> 09:37.225
‘How will I get all the building materials? 


09:37.225 --> 09:40.495
‘Do I have the right tools to do the job? 


09:40.495 --> 09:43.232
‘How will I gather all the animals? 


09:43.232 --> 09:46.269
‘What food will they need, and how much? 


09:46.268 --> 09:49.971
‘When, exactly, will the Deluge begin? 


09:49.972 --> 09:52.074
‘How long will it last? 


09:52.073 --> 09:55.811
Where will the ark land 
after the Flood subsides?’ 


09:55.812 --> 09:58.347
Nothing in the record indicates 


09:58.347 --> 10:01.850
that Jehovah gave Noah 
all the details in advance. 


10:01.850 --> 10:05.287
What Noah did have was faith. 


10:05.287 --> 10:08.024
Faith moved him to begin building. 


10:08.023 --> 10:11.593
His faith saved him and his family. 


10:11.593 --> 10:15.631
Faith in Jehovah made it happen.


10:15.632 --> 10:19.069
Like Noah, during this time of the end, 


10:19.068 --> 10:21.336
Jehovah’s people have taken on 


10:21.337 --> 10:24.540
challenging theocratic building projects. 


10:24.540 --> 10:27.377
Certainly, constructing 
the new world headquarters 


10:27.377 --> 10:29.245
at Warwick, New York, 


10:29.245 --> 10:32.615
was one of these projects 
that required much faith. 


10:32.615 --> 10:34.917
A committee of brothers was assigned 


10:34.917 --> 10:37.085
to complete this vast project 


10:37.085 --> 10:39.088
in less than four years. 


10:39.088 --> 10:42.156
To do so, they knew they had to begin 


10:42.157 --> 10:45.027
by July 2013. 


10:45.027 --> 10:47.764
They moved ahead in faith. 


10:47.763 --> 10:51.600
Though the town 
had not yet approved the site permits, 


10:51.600 --> 10:54.203
they began inviting workers to the site 


10:54.203 --> 10:57.038
with that date in mind. 


10:57.038 --> 10:59.075
Time was passing quickly. 


10:59.075 --> 11:02.778
The invited volunteers 
were buying plane tickets. 


11:02.778 --> 11:06.748
Bethel was arranging rooming 
and other details. 


11:06.748 --> 11:10.318
Yet, the committee 
still did not have site permits. 


11:10.318 --> 11:12.888
Would they cancel these invitations? 


11:12.888 --> 11:15.290
They state: 


11:15.290 --> 11:18.193
“We spent a lot of time praying about it. 


11:18.193 --> 11:21.630
“We decided we needed to act in faith. 


11:21.630 --> 11:24.033
“And we were just convinced 


11:24.033 --> 11:26.868
Jehovah was going to make it happen.” 


11:26.868 --> 11:29.538
As the deadline approached, 


11:29.538 --> 11:32.006
the brothers had done everything possible 


11:32.007 --> 11:34.044
to obtain the permits. 


11:34.043 --> 11:38.113
The town planning board 
was holding a public hearing. 


11:38.113 --> 11:40.783
And to the brothers’ great surprise, 


11:40.783 --> 11:43.851
within 15 minutes 
of the start of the meeting, 


11:43.852 --> 11:47.222
the town board voted 
to approve the project. 


11:47.222 --> 11:50.659
These overseers commented, 


11:50.658 --> 11:53.395
“When the approval came through, 


11:53.395 --> 11:56.498
“we knew it was 
only by Jehovah’s spirit 


11:56.498 --> 11:58.366
that that happened.” 


11:58.367 --> 12:01.804
True, but it was 
also the brothers’ faith 


12:01.803 --> 12:04.606
to act that made it happen. 


12:04.607 --> 12:07.844
Those experiences 
are found in the video 


12:07.843 --> 12:11.713
World Headquarters
—History Is Being Written. 


12:11.713 --> 12:15.050
You can find it 
in the “Our Activities” section 


12:15.050 --> 12:18.000
under the “Construction” category.


12:19.020 --> 12:23.025
Now let’s read Hebrews 11:8: 


12:23.025 --> 12:27.195
“By faith Abraham, when he was called, 


12:27.195 --> 12:29.332
“obeyed by going out to a place 


12:29.332 --> 12:32.200
“he was to receive as an inheritance; 


12:32.200 --> 12:34.903
“he went out, although not knowing 


12:34.903 --> 12:36.738
where he was going.” 


12:36.738 --> 12:38.773
What faith it took 


12:38.773 --> 12:41.743
for Abraham 
and his submissive wife, Sarah, 


12:41.743 --> 12:44.380
to leave the prosperous city of Ur 


12:44.380 --> 12:47.550
and to go wherever 
Jehovah would lead them! 


12:47.550 --> 12:51.020
It meant leaving the security 
of a pleasant home 


12:51.020 --> 12:55.390
and moving to some strange 
and potentially hostile land 


12:55.390 --> 13:00.000
some 1,000 miles, 
or 1,609 kilometers,  away.


13:01.430 --> 13:03.698
Do we see such faith today? 


13:03.698 --> 13:05.700
Absolutely! 


13:05.700 --> 13:07.770
Since 2014, 


13:07.770 --> 13:09.872
thousands of brothers and sisters 


13:09.872 --> 13:12.809
have attended the School 
for Kingdom Evangelizers, 


13:12.808 --> 13:15.443
agreeing to be assigned 
to wherever 


13:15.443 --> 13:18.013
there is a need 
by the organization. 


13:18.013 --> 13:21.000
Faith has made it happen. 


13:22.083 --> 13:24.953
When a call goes out 
for skilled volunteers 


13:24.953 --> 13:28.356
to help build 
or expand branch facilities, 


13:28.357 --> 13:32.962
faith moves brothers and sisters 
to simplify their lives 


13:32.962 --> 13:36.632
and to leave their comfort zone 
in order to assist. 


13:36.632 --> 13:40.135
For example, in 2009, 


13:40.135 --> 13:43.538
the congregations 
in the United States were informed 


13:43.538 --> 13:46.975
that an expansion project 
at Wallkill, New York, 


13:46.975 --> 13:49.043
was being planned. 


13:49.043 --> 13:52.213
One couple moved out 
of their newly built 


13:52.213 --> 13:57.753
2,200-square-foot, 
or 200-square-meter, dream home 


13:57.753 --> 14:02.758
and into a 270-square-foot, 
or 25-square-meter, apartment 


14:02.758 --> 14:05.426
so that they could make 
themselves available. 


14:05.427 --> 14:07.429
What happened? 


14:07.428 --> 14:08.930
They explain: 


14:08.930 --> 14:12.467
“One month after we moved 
into our small apartment, 


14:12.467 --> 14:14.970
“we received an invitation to serve 


14:14.970 --> 14:18.040
“as temporary volunteers at Wallkill. 


14:18.040 --> 14:22.110
“It was clear to us 
that by simplifying our life, 


14:22.110 --> 14:25.647
we had given Jehovah 
something to bless.” 


14:25.647 --> 14:29.184
Faith made it happen for them.


14:29.183 --> 14:33.188
So, what have we learned today? 


14:33.188 --> 14:37.893
Faith in Jehovah God 
is a powerful motivating force 


14:37.893 --> 14:41.430
that impels us to act 
in harmony with his will. 


14:41.430 --> 14:44.098
Jehovah rewards such faith. 


14:44.098 --> 14:48.836
Remember, the very meaning 
of the name of our God, Jehovah, 


14:48.837 --> 14:51.874
is “He Causes to Become.” 


14:51.873 --> 14:56.078
Truly, he is a God 
who makes things happen! 


14:56.078 --> 15:00.983
Brothers and sisters, 
let us continue to act in faith. 


15:00.983 --> 15:03.751
Jehovah will continue 
to make wonderful things 


15:03.752 --> 15:06.155
happen in our personal life. 


15:06.155 --> 15:09.157
We will accomplish things 
we never could do 


15:09.157 --> 15:11.394
through our own personal efforts. 


15:11.393 --> 15:14.430
We will be able to do more 
in Jehovah’s service. 


15:14.430 --> 15:24.757
May it happen to you 
“according to your faith.”
