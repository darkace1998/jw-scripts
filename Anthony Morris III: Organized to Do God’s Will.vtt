00:01.617 --> 00:03.787
There are people who believe 


00:03.787 --> 00:06.890
there is no need 
for a religious organization. 


00:06.890 --> 00:10.427
They feel they have 
their own personal relationship with God 


00:10.427 --> 00:12.562
and that is good enough. 


00:12.562 --> 00:17.567
They see no need to be associated 
with a specific organization. 


00:17.567 --> 00:21.805
However, what does 
God’s own inspired Word suggest? 


00:21.805 --> 00:25.342
That he would use an organization, 
or channel, 


00:25.342 --> 00:27.977
through which spiritual food 
would be dispensed 


00:27.977 --> 00:31.214
from his Word, the Bible. 


00:31.213 --> 00:34.950
For example, 
1 Peter 2:17 says 


00:34.950 --> 00:38.955
to “have love 
for the whole association of brothers.” 


00:38.955 --> 00:42.058
One dictionary definition for “association” 


00:42.058 --> 00:47.863
is “an organization of persons 
having a common interest.”


00:47.863 --> 00:50.966
We have a very interesting, insightful look 


00:50.967 --> 00:53.970
at the organization in the first century. 


00:53.970 --> 00:58.908
If we glance down through chapter 15 
of the book of Acts, 


00:58.908 --> 01:01.143
we can gain some insight. 


01:01.143 --> 01:05.315
Verse 1 indicates there was 
an issue that caused a disagreement 


01:05.315 --> 01:08.183
between some of the members 
of the congregation. 


01:08.183 --> 01:10.253
Then verse 2 says: 


01:10.253 --> 01:14.256
“But after quite a bit 
of dissension and disputing 


01:14.257 --> 01:16.692
“by Paul and Barnabas with them, 


01:16.692 --> 01:19.729
“it was arranged for Paul, 
Barnabas, and some of the others 


01:19.728 --> 01:23.900
“to go up to the apostles 
and elders in Jerusalem 


01:23.900 --> 01:26.535
regarding this issue.” 


01:26.535 --> 01:29.405
It sounds like an organization to me. 


01:29.405 --> 01:31.942
And after considerable discussion 


01:31.942 --> 01:35.077
and with the help of God’s holy spirit, 


01:35.077 --> 01:37.080
what transpired? 


01:37.080 --> 01:41.283
Verses 22 and 23 say: 


01:41.283 --> 01:45.921
“Then the apostles and the elders, 
together with the whole congregation, 


01:45.922 --> 01:48.825
“decided to send chosen men 
from among them to Antioch, 


01:48.825 --> 01:50.860
“along with Paul and Barnabas; 


01:50.860 --> 01:54.563
“they sent Judas 
who was called Barsabbas and Silas, 


01:54.563 --> 01:56.966
“who were leading men 
among the brothers. 


01:56.967 --> 02:00.137
They wrote this 
and sent it through them.” 


02:00.137 --> 02:03.405
Then in verses 23-29 


02:03.405 --> 02:06.642
is the letter of direction 
that was delivered to Antioch 


02:06.642 --> 02:08.712
and other congregations as well. 


02:08.712 --> 02:12.382
In fact, in verse 41, 
it says Paul and Silas 


02:12.382 --> 02:16.887
“went through Syria and Cilicia, 
strengthening the congregations.” 


02:16.887 --> 02:19.755
Chapter 16, verse 5 says: 


02:19.755 --> 02:23.893
“Then, indeed, the congregations 
continued to be made firm in the faith 


02:23.893 --> 02:27.663
and to increase in number day by day.” 


02:27.663 --> 02:32.335
So it was not a matter 
of isolated Christians sitting at home 


02:32.335 --> 02:35.605
claiming to have 
a personal relationship with God. 


02:35.605 --> 02:38.708
No, the work was organized, 


02:38.708 --> 02:43.311
and congregations 
kept being added “day by day.”


02:43.312 --> 02:47.650
That is very similar to what we see 
in Jehovah’s organization today. 


02:47.650 --> 02:51.520
In fact, the organization 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses is patterned 


02:51.520 --> 02:54.823
after the first-century 
Christian congregation 


02:54.823 --> 02:57.726
as set forth in the Scriptures. 


02:57.727 --> 03:00.597
I would like to remind 
all of Jehovah’s Witnesses


03:00.597 --> 03:04.167
—whether already baptized 
or working toward baptism—


03:04.167 --> 03:09.199
of this book, 
Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will. 


03:09.198 --> 03:11.440
It provides an overall view 


03:11.440 --> 03:14.077
of how the Christian congregation 
is organized 


03:14.077 --> 03:16.312
for getting God’s work done. 


03:16.312 --> 03:19.849
The book also offers counsel and direction 


03:19.848 --> 03:23.000
to help us maintain unity 
with our brothers worldwide. 


03:24.453 --> 03:26.455
New ones need to become familiar 


03:26.455 --> 03:28.558
with the operation 
of Jehovah’s organization 


03:28.558 --> 03:30.793
and learn how they can have a share 


03:30.793 --> 03:32.795
in the modern-day preaching work. 


03:32.795 --> 03:36.632
In fact, 
when a Bible student progresses 


03:36.632 --> 03:38.835
and desires to join us in the ministry 


03:38.835 --> 03:40.970
as an unbaptized publisher, 


03:40.970 --> 03:44.340
the elders direct him 
to make a study of this book, 


03:44.340 --> 03:48.377
including the “Questions for Those 
Desiring to Get Baptized” 


03:48.377 --> 03:50.480
in the appendix. 


03:50.480 --> 03:54.717
Even for those of us 
who have been baptized many years, 


03:54.717 --> 03:56.852
it may be good to schedule the reading 


03:56.852 --> 03:59.122
of one chapter of the book each week 


03:59.122 --> 04:03.092
during our personal study 
or family worship. 


04:03.092 --> 04:05.329
It contains general information 


04:05.328 --> 04:08.765
concerning the duties 
of elders and ministerial servants, 


04:08.765 --> 04:10.767
judicial procedures, 


04:10.767 --> 04:15.170
and various other features 
of congregation organization.


04:15.170 --> 04:19.575
I would like to take a few minutes 
and review some of the information 


04:19.575 --> 04:23.212
in chapter 1 of the publication. 


04:23.212 --> 04:25.515
Though there are thousands of national 


04:25.515 --> 04:28.017
and international organizations 
around the world, 


04:28.017 --> 04:30.019
they are organized 


04:30.018 --> 04:33.221
according to human viewpoints 
and philosophies. 


04:33.222 --> 04:36.225
But our organization is different; 


04:36.225 --> 04:38.995
it is theocratic. 


04:38.995 --> 04:43.867
That means it is ruled by Jehovah 
as Head over all. 


04:43.867 --> 04:48.604
Isaiah 33:22 says that he is our Judge, 


04:48.603 --> 04:51.640
Lawgiver, and King. 


04:51.640 --> 04:54.077
Many large organizations appoint 


04:54.077 --> 04:57.747
a chief executive officer, or CEO. 


04:57.747 --> 05:01.684
He is the executive 
with the chief decision-making authority 


05:01.683 --> 05:04.420
in a business or corporation. 


05:04.420 --> 05:08.490
In a similar way, 
Jehovah has appointed his Son, Jesus, 


05:08.490 --> 05:12.195
to be the one 
with chief decision-making authority 


05:12.195 --> 05:15.197
over the congregation of God. 


05:15.197 --> 05:19.202
Ephesians 1:22 


05:19.202 --> 05:22.972
is speaking of Jehovah’s actions 
in connection with Jesus. 


05:22.972 --> 05:24.974
It says: 


05:24.973 --> 05:28.576
“He also subjected all things under his feet 


05:28.577 --> 05:31.380
“and made him head over all things 


05:31.380 --> 05:34.000
with regard to the congregation.” 


05:35.050 --> 05:38.688
We see the structure 
of the organization taking shape. 


05:38.688 --> 05:42.258
Jehovah is the Universal Sovereign, 
the King, 


05:42.258 --> 05:44.660
directing the millions of angels 


05:44.660 --> 05:47.263
making up his heavenly organization. 


05:47.263 --> 05:49.265
But when it comes to directing 


05:49.265 --> 05:53.035
the visible earthly part 
of God’s organization, 


05:53.035 --> 05:56.072
he has delegated 
that responsibility to Jesus, 


05:56.072 --> 05:58.809
the head of the congregation of God. 


05:58.808 --> 06:01.743
Chapter 2 of the Organized book 


06:01.743 --> 06:05.748
explains this Scriptural position of Jesus.


06:05.748 --> 06:09.685
And how does Jesus direct 
the organization here on earth? 


06:09.685 --> 06:13.857
Matthew 24:45 says 
that Jesus has appointed 


06:13.857 --> 06:16.492
a “faithful and discreet slave” 


06:16.492 --> 06:20.295
to serve 
spiritual “food at the proper time.” 


06:20.295 --> 06:21.897
Today, 


06:21.897 --> 06:24.167
seven anointed men 
make up the faithful slave, 


06:24.167 --> 06:27.837
and collectively, 
they are known as the Governing Body. 


06:27.837 --> 06:31.274
And Jesus uses the holy spirit 
to direct these men 


06:31.273 --> 06:34.810
in harmony with the Scriptures. 


06:34.810 --> 06:37.147
The Scriptural basis 
for this layer of organization 


06:37.147 --> 06:40.817
is set forth in chapter 3 of the book. 


06:40.817 --> 06:42.852
Chapter 4 is entitled 


06:42.852 --> 06:46.355
“How the Congregation 
Is Organized and Governed.” 


06:46.355 --> 06:50.527
The organizational structure 
incorporates Branch Committees, 


06:50.527 --> 06:55.297
circuit overseers, elders, 
and ministerial servants. 


06:55.297 --> 06:57.700
The subject index in the back of the book 


06:57.700 --> 07:01.803
can be useful 
to quickly gain access to information 


07:01.803 --> 07:05.306
on various aspects of the organization.


07:05.307 --> 07:07.744
Suppose you’re a young person, 


07:07.743 --> 07:11.013
maybe even 
a relatively young married couple. 


07:11.013 --> 07:13.148
The circuit overseer is visiting, 


07:13.148 --> 07:16.018
and he asks you 
what spiritual goals you have. 


07:16.018 --> 07:18.020
How would you answer? 


07:18.020 --> 07:20.022
Would your mind start racing, 


07:20.022 --> 07:25.060
trying to think 
of various avenues of service available? 


07:25.060 --> 07:29.898
How about now, 
before you are asked such a question, 


07:29.898 --> 07:34.070
you look in the subject index 
under “Goals”? 


07:34.070 --> 07:39.075
There are 11 references 
to paragraphs in the book on that subject. 


07:39.075 --> 07:41.277
After reading about all 


07:41.277 --> 07:43.779
of the possibilities 
and different categories, 


07:43.778 --> 07:46.881
you would be 
in a better position to plan your life 


07:46.882 --> 07:48.885
for a great future 


07:48.885 --> 07:52.000
in the earthly part 
of Jehovah’s organization.


07:53.288 --> 07:55.290
At this time, 


07:55.290 --> 07:59.095
I would like to draw your attention 
to a very important factor 


07:59.095 --> 08:01.463
in a new ones making progress 


08:01.463 --> 08:04.600
and attaining spiritual stability. 


08:04.600 --> 08:09.272
On page 213 of the Organized book, 


08:09.272 --> 08:13.809
it discusses a person 
interested in being baptized. 


08:13.808 --> 08:17.045
After the elders go over the questions 
in part 3 of the book, 


08:17.045 --> 08:19.048
it says this: 


08:19.048 --> 08:23.785
“If he has not completed his study 
of the Bible Teach and ‘God’s Love’ books, 


08:23.785 --> 08:28.000
the elders should make arrangements 
for someone to help him do so.” 


08:30.125 --> 08:34.863
The two books 
complement each other so well. 


08:34.863 --> 08:39.201
When someone becomes a dedicated 
and baptized servant of Jehovah, 


08:39.202 --> 08:43.305
we want them to stay 
closely attached to the organization. 


08:43.305 --> 08:45.307
Yet every year, 


08:45.307 --> 08:47.944
there are a number 
who stop attending meetings 


08:47.943 --> 08:49.945
and become inactive. 


08:49.945 --> 08:51.947
At times, 
it has been found 


08:51.947 --> 08:55.552
that they did not finish 
studying the two books.


08:55.552 --> 08:56.885
You see, 


08:56.885 --> 08:59.222
the Bible Teach book helps new ones 


08:59.222 --> 09:01.790
to have an accurate knowledge of the Bible, 


09:01.790 --> 09:05.060
and they often learn to love Jehovah. 


09:05.060 --> 09:07.095
The “Keep Yourselves in God’s Love” book 


09:07.095 --> 09:10.032
helps us to learn to apply the Bible 


09:10.032 --> 09:13.102
and live in harmony 
with Jehovah’s standards. 


09:13.102 --> 09:17.105
Notice what Jesus told his faithful apostles 


09:17.105 --> 09:23.178
at John 15:10: 


09:23.178 --> 09:27.048
“If you observe my commandments, 
you will remain in my love, 


09:27.048 --> 09:30.151
“just as I have observed 
the commandments of the Father 


09:30.152 --> 09:33.822
and remain in his love.” 


09:33.822 --> 09:36.859
Did you notice 
that Jesus remained in God’s love 


09:36.858 --> 09:39.928
by observing his Father’s commandments? 


09:39.928 --> 09:42.498
The same is true of us today. 


09:42.498 --> 09:44.866
To remain in God’s love, 


09:44.867 --> 09:48.437
we need to apply the truth 
in our everyday life. 


09:48.437 --> 09:52.642
And what is the result 
if we keep ourselves in God’s love? 


09:52.642 --> 09:55.310
It is so clearly stated 


09:55.310 --> 09:58.847
in Jude 21: 


09:58.847 --> 10:02.352
“In order to keep yourselves in God’s love, 


10:02.352 --> 10:05.622
“while you await the mercy 
of our Lord Jesus Christ 


10:05.622 --> 10:08.000
with everlasting life in view.” 


10:09.392 --> 10:14.397
Staying in God’s love 
results in everlasting life.


10:14.397 --> 10:17.700
It is so important 
to make sure our Bible students 


10:17.700 --> 10:21.103
complete a study of both books, 


10:21.103 --> 10:23.605
and that applies to our children too. 


10:23.605 --> 10:25.708
Sometimes as parents, 


10:25.708 --> 10:27.976
we can assume 
that our children are developing 


10:27.977 --> 10:30.612
a trusting relationship with Jehovah 


10:30.612 --> 10:34.450
because they have been going 
to meetings since they were very small. 


10:34.450 --> 10:39.455
A relationship with Jehovah 
does not happen by means of osmosis. 


10:39.455 --> 10:43.558
A child does not simply absorb 
and assimilate truth 


10:43.558 --> 10:45.560
and a love for God 


10:45.560 --> 10:47.797
just by being in the presence of others 


10:47.797 --> 10:51.567
who have a close relationship with Jehovah. 


10:51.567 --> 10:55.437
We very much appreciate 
all of the videos we have, 


10:55.437 --> 10:59.375
including Become Jehovah’s Friend 
and JW Broadcasting. 


10:59.375 --> 11:02.945
But new ones and young ones 


11:02.945 --> 11:07.315
need to be able to go 
through the process of deep study 


11:07.315 --> 11:09.430
to get to the Bible’s truth 


11:09.430 --> 11:11.432
and get it etched into their minds 


11:11.432 --> 11:14.190
and lodged deep in their hearts. 


11:14.190 --> 11:16.197
Therefore, 


11:16.197 --> 11:18.999
if you parents realize 
that you have not studied 


11:18.998 --> 11:21.368
both books with your young ones, 


11:21.368 --> 11:26.401
it would be good to see 
that a schedule is established to do so.


11:26.402 --> 11:29.405
The Governing Body gives all credit 


11:29.405 --> 11:32.742
for the success 
of this organization to Jehovah 


11:32.742 --> 11:36.745
and the appointed head 
of the congregation, Jesus Christ. 


11:36.745 --> 11:39.382
We are just imperfect men trying to follow 


11:39.382 --> 11:42.050
the lead of Christ and the holy spirit. 


11:42.050 --> 11:47.055
At 1 Corinthians 1:26, 


11:47.055 --> 11:49.180
Paul says:


11:49.180 --> 11:51.448
“For you see his calling of you, brothers,


11:51.448 --> 11:54.996
that there are not many wise 
in a fleshly way.”


11:54.997 --> 11:56.999
Verse 27 says: 


11:56.998 --> 12:00.068
“But God chose 
the foolish things of the world 


12:00.068 --> 12:02.203
to put the wise men to shame.” 


12:02.203 --> 12:05.540
Then verse 30 says that Christ Jesus 


12:05.540 --> 12:09.000
“has become to us wisdom from God.” 


12:10.045 --> 12:12.815
That is where the direction and wisdom 


12:12.815 --> 12:14.917
of the organization come from, 


12:14.917 --> 12:18.154
not from mere man. 


12:18.153 --> 12:22.090
The words of Jehovah 
to the prophet Zechariah fit today 


12:22.090 --> 12:25.895
when we see 
the amazing advances in the organization. 


12:25.895 --> 12:27.963
Zechariah 4:6 says: 


12:27.963 --> 12:31.033
“‘Not by a military force, nor by power, 


12:31.033 --> 12:36.438
but by my spirit,’ says Jehovah of armies.”


12:36.438 --> 12:39.441
While there are 
some well-educated and prominent men 


12:39.442 --> 12:43.445
who have accepted the truth 
and are now our fellow brothers, 


12:43.445 --> 12:47.883
the majority in the organization 
come from a more humble background. 


12:47.883 --> 12:49.885
For example, 


12:49.885 --> 12:52.320
among the first 
of Jehovah’s modern-day servants 


12:52.320 --> 12:55.357
to introduce the Kingdom message 
to people in Denmark 


12:55.357 --> 12:57.359
was a shoemaker. 


12:57.358 --> 13:00.595
In Switzerland and France, 
it was a gardener. 


13:00.595 --> 13:02.598
In many parts of Africa, 


13:02.598 --> 13:05.466
the message was carried 
by itinerant workers. 


13:05.467 --> 13:08.704
In Brazil, sailors had a share. 


13:08.703 --> 13:12.373
Quite a few of the Polish Witnesses 
in northern France 


13:12.373 --> 13:14.643
were coal miners. 


13:14.643 --> 13:17.613
Jehovah and Jesus use all of us 


13:17.613 --> 13:20.481
to get a remarkable work accomplished. 


13:20.482 --> 13:25.020
We are proud to be a part 
of this spirit-directed organization. 


13:25.020 --> 13:28.123
As one older circuit overseer 
was heard to say, 


13:28.123 --> 13:33.128
“This is the best imperfect organization 
on earth!” 


13:33.128 --> 13:36.865
There are no perfect organizations on earth. 


13:36.865 --> 13:40.735
However, this is the best of them all. 


13:40.735 --> 13:44.173
And we appreciate 
the contribution all of you make 


13:44.173 --> 13:54.800
to the success 
of the preaching work worldwide.
