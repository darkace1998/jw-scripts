00:00:01.551 --> 00:00:05.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our convention theme is so timely.

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:10.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world is full of conflict and anguish.

00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:14.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
People long for peace,
and they long for unity,

00:00:14.631 --> 00:00:18.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is the focus of this month’s broadcast.

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:20.070 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our theme is

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.208 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Stand Together as One United People.”

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:28.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me begin with a question:

00:00:28.044 --> 00:00:30.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where do you keep your wallet?

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:32.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re out in public,

00:00:32.882 --> 00:00:37.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
you brothers likely keep it
in your pocket (maybe a front pocket)

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that it doesn’t get lost or stolen.

00:00:40.957 --> 00:00:45.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
You sisters might carry your wallet
in a purse, or handbag,

00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:48.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
which you keep close by your side.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:53.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
You guard your wallet
because you know that if you get careless,

00:00:53.336 --> 00:00:57.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
a thief might steal it
and you might never see

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
your wallet or its contents again.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is similar with the precious unity

00:01:04.614 --> 00:01:07.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoy as Jehovah’s people.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to guard it and protect it,

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
or else someone might steal it.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make no mistake,

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Devil is looking for an opportunity

00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:22.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
to steal our unity from us.

00:01:22.065 --> 00:01:25.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about how unique our unity is.

00:01:25.835 --> 00:01:28.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike other religious organizations,

00:01:28.471 --> 00:01:31.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not divided into subdenominations.

00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:34.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t have Northern Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:34.778 --> 00:01:36.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Orthodox Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:39.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
or Reformed Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:42.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the apostle Paul expressed it,

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:46.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are “united in the same mind

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:49.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the same line of thought.”

00:01:50.794 --> 00:01:53.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also united internationally.

00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:58.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t fight against one another
in the wars that divide nations.

00:01:58.268 --> 00:02:01.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we are united racially.

00:02:01.171 --> 00:02:05.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times, Witnesses have risked their lives

00:02:05.108 --> 00:02:09.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect their fellow Christians
of another race who were being threatened

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:14.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
or persecuted
because of their racial or ethnic background.

00:02:15.285 --> 00:02:17.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also united in our purpose.

00:02:17.954 --> 00:02:20.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, no matter where we live,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all preach the same good news

00:02:24.894 --> 00:02:29.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we all receive
the same weekly spiritual instruction.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:33.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you find this unity out in the world?

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:35.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look around.

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:37.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are divided.

00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:39.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nations attack each other.

00:02:39.876 --> 00:02:44.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
And within nations,
political parties fight one another.

00:02:44.314 --> 00:02:48.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Corporations compete with
and destroy each other,

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:51.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
and citizens commit racially

00:02:51.054 --> 00:02:53.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ethnically motivated hate crimes

00:02:53.756 --> 00:02:55.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
against each other.

00:02:55.825 --> 00:02:58.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a contrast that is

00:02:58.761 --> 00:03:00.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s worshippers!

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
We stand together

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one united people.

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:11.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, though, do we each need to guard

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:14.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and protect our unity?

00:03:14.143 --> 00:03:18.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can’t we safely assume
that Jehovah will protect it

00:03:18.147 --> 00:03:22.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he will see to it
that our unity is preserved?

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:24.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not entirely.

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Guarding the unity of God’s people
is a responsibility

00:03:28.791 --> 00:03:31.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah has given each one of us.

00:03:31.761 --> 00:03:34.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must do our part to ensure

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:39.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we stand together as one united people.

00:03:39.903 --> 00:03:42.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen if we don’t?

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:45.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Divisions will occur among us

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:49.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
—divisions that resemble
what we see in the world.

00:03:49.913 --> 00:03:54.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happened
in the first-century congregation in Corinth.

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
To them, Paul wrote

00:03:56.586 --> 00:04:00.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Corinthians 1:11:

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There are dissensions among you.”

00:04:06.162 --> 00:04:08.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of “dissensions”?

00:04:08.364 --> 00:04:11.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some said, ‘I belong to Peter’;

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
others said, ‘I belong to Paul’;

00:04:14.003 --> 00:04:18.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
and still others said, ‘I belong to Apollos.’

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:21.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul felt compelled to ask

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:24.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Corinthians 1:13:

00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:29.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is the Christ divided?”

00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:34.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a reproach on Jehovah’s name
and on true worship!

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
By failing to guard their unity,

00:04:36.893 --> 00:04:40.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
those early disciples
were making Christianity

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:42.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
look like just another religion.

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:47.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could something like that
happen in a congregation today?

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could happen

00:04:49.072 --> 00:04:53.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
if individuals cared more
about their own personal preferences,

00:04:53.643 --> 00:04:56.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
conveniences, and opinions

00:04:56.546 --> 00:05:01.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
than they do about the unity
of Jehovah’s people.

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:06.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Selfishness is not
“the fruitage of [Jehovah’s] spirit.”

00:05:06.322 --> 00:05:09.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, it reflects
“the spirit of the world.”

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:13.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world is aggressively promoting the view

00:05:13.363 --> 00:05:16.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you should put yourself first,

00:05:16.232 --> 00:05:19.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we have learned Jehovah’s view.

00:05:20.103 --> 00:05:23.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 10:24 tells us

00:05:23.473 --> 00:05:25.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “keep seeking,

00:05:25.174 --> 00:05:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not [our] own advantage,

00:05:27.343 --> 00:05:30.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:05:30.947 --> 00:05:33.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
In chapter 13, verse 5,

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:37.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul wrote that love
“does not look for its own interests.”

00:05:37.687 --> 00:05:41.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he states at Romans 15:3

00:05:41.557 --> 00:05:45.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the Christ did not please himself.”

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:51.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we cannot afford
to care more about our privileges,

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:54.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
our pride, or our opinions

00:05:54.303 --> 00:05:57.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
than we do about Christian unity.

00:05:57.306 --> 00:06:00.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we put our own wants first,

00:06:00.209 --> 00:06:03.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
then just like a man
who leaves his wallet out in public

00:06:03.846 --> 00:06:05.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a thief to steal,

00:06:05.882 --> 00:06:08.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
we place the congregation’s unity

00:06:08.885 --> 00:06:12.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
in plain view for Satan to snatch.

00:06:12.688 --> 00:06:17.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there is no doubt
that the Devil will seize the opportunity,

00:06:17.326 --> 00:06:20.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the congregation will suffer.

00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:23.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to accept

00:06:23.332 --> 00:06:25.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
our personal responsibility

00:06:25.401 --> 00:06:28.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
to guard and protect our unity

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:33.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only as a congregation
but also as field service groups,

00:06:33.843 --> 00:06:38.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
families, married couples, and friends.

00:06:38.314 --> 00:06:42.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s now discuss four areas

00:06:42.118 --> 00:06:44.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we especially need

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:48.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
to guard and protect our Christian unity.

00:06:49.092 --> 00:06:52.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first is our response to direction

00:06:52.862 --> 00:06:55.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s organization.

00:06:56.232 --> 00:07:00.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020,

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all received direction,

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:07.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
including new ways to attend our meetings
and carry out our ministry

00:07:07.844 --> 00:07:12.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ways to comply
with the secular authorities.

00:07:12.248 --> 00:07:14.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you disagree?

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:17.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or did you have a different idea?

00:07:17.086 --> 00:07:21.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, did you follow the direction anyway

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give it your support?

00:07:23.426 --> 00:07:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you did,

00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:28.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you contributed to our unity.

00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:31.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we stand together

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unitedly follow direction

00:07:34.337 --> 00:07:39.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s organization,
good things happen.

00:07:39.208 --> 00:07:40.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like what?

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:44.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like what happened
when the first-century Christians complied

00:07:44.647 --> 00:07:49.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the direction from the apostles
and older men in Jerusalem.

00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:53.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts 16:4, 5 says:

00:07:55.024 --> 00:07:58.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As they traveled on through the cities,

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:02.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they would deliver to them
for observance the decrees

00:08:02.131 --> 00:08:03.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that had been decided on

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by the apostles and the elders
who were in Jerusalem.

00:08:07.937 --> 00:08:09.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then, indeed,

00:08:09.972 --> 00:08:14.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the congregations continued
to be made firm in the faith

00:08:14.277 --> 00:08:18.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to increase in number day by day.”

00:08:19.849 --> 00:08:23.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Individual Christians and congregations

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:27.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
recognized and submitted to the authority

00:08:27.456 --> 00:08:29.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the governing body at that time

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:33.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the apostles and elders
who were in Jerusalem.

00:08:33.396 --> 00:08:36.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you note the beneficial results?

00:08:36.265 --> 00:08:40.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The congregations continued
to be made firm . . .

00:08:40.303 --> 00:08:42.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to increase.”

00:08:42.405 --> 00:08:46.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what happened
when you brothers and sisters

00:08:46.075 --> 00:08:49.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
followed the direction
regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:53.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
We experienced significant increases

00:08:53.583 --> 00:08:55.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
in meeting attendance.

00:08:55.618 --> 00:08:59.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
The attendance for the 2021 Memorial

00:08:59.355 --> 00:09:02.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
reached an all-time peak.

00:09:02.058 --> 00:09:04.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is amazing

00:09:04.093 --> 00:09:06.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah accomplishes

00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:07.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we stand together

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one united people!

00:09:12.201 --> 00:09:15.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second area in which we need
to protect our unity

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:17.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
is culture.

00:09:17.607 --> 00:09:20.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization is diverse.

00:09:20.476 --> 00:09:22.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to be introduced

00:09:22.578 --> 00:09:24.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
to different kinds of food,

00:09:24.614 --> 00:09:28.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
different styles of dress,
and interesting customs.

00:09:28.317 --> 00:09:30.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful!

00:09:30.019 --> 00:09:34.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if we started feeling that my race,

00:09:34.957 --> 00:09:38.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
my tribe, my ethnicity,

00:09:38.427 --> 00:09:41.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
my culture is superior?

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:46.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you see how
that kind of thinking would divide us?

00:09:46.202 --> 00:09:49.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
To preserve our unity, we need to focus,

00:09:49.972 --> 00:09:52.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on how we are different from one another,

00:09:52.908 --> 00:09:55.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how we are the same.

00:09:55.344 --> 00:09:56.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are

00:09:56.979 --> 00:09:59.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses first

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:01.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not African, Asian,

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:04.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
North American,
South American,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
or European.

00:10:06.155 --> 00:10:07.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our people

00:10:07.823 --> 00:10:09.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
are our spiritual family

00:10:09.792 --> 00:10:12.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
—our spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:18.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our culture is genuine Christianity.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are willing
to adopt Jehovah’s thinking

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:24.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we learn from his Word,

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
even setting aside our own
personal customs

00:10:27.543 --> 00:10:29.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
or culture if necessary,

00:10:29.945 --> 00:10:32.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
we stand together

00:10:32.548 --> 00:10:35.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one united people.

00:10:35.451 --> 00:10:38.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
We experience what the Bible describes

00:10:38.754 --> 00:10:42.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Zephaniah 3:9:

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:46.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For then I will change the language

00:10:46.629 --> 00:10:49.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of the peoples to a pure language,

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:53.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that all of them
may call on the name of Jehovah,

00:10:53.536 --> 00:10:57.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve him shoulder to shoulder.”

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
How wonderful!

00:11:00.309 --> 00:11:01.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
A third area

00:11:01.744 --> 00:11:04.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
is personality differences.

00:11:04.513 --> 00:11:06.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up in this divided world,

00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:10.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may have absorbed
some of its sensitivities.

00:11:10.886 --> 00:11:15.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Ecclesiastes 7:9 says:

00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:19.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be quick to take offense.”

00:11:19.562 --> 00:11:22.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a fellow Christian hurts our feelings,

00:11:22.732 --> 00:11:25.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a special opportunity

00:11:25.901 --> 00:11:28.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and obligation

00:11:28.571 --> 00:11:33.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show that we stand together
as one united people.

00:11:33.275 --> 00:11:35.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we do that?

00:11:35.644 --> 00:11:39.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 3:13 says:

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:44.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Continue putting up with one another

00:11:44.019 --> 00:11:46.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and forgiving one another freely

00:11:46.422 --> 00:11:50.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
“even if anyone has a cause
for complaint against another.

00:11:50.493 --> 00:11:54.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just as Jehovah freely forgave you,

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:57.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must also do the same.”

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:00.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note both phrases:

00:12:00.870 --> 00:12:05.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
“putting up with one another
and forgiving one another.”

00:12:05.541 --> 00:12:10.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some imperfections and slights are so small.

00:12:10.212 --> 00:12:13.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do they really require formal forgiveness?

00:12:13.783 --> 00:12:16.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of our human imperfection,

00:12:16.485 --> 00:12:19.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to do what Paul says.

00:12:19.155 --> 00:12:22.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to learn to just put up with them.

00:12:22.992 --> 00:12:26.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, maybe a certain family

00:12:26.095 --> 00:12:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not include us
in a gathering at their home

00:12:29.064 --> 00:12:31.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a brother failed to greet us

00:12:31.066 --> 00:12:32.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Kingdom Hall or call on us

00:12:32.435 --> 00:12:35.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give a comment at the meeting.

00:12:35.805 --> 00:12:40.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
These things may irritate us
or even hurt our feelings,

00:12:41.143 --> 00:12:44.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they are not sins 
that we need to forgive.

00:12:44.313 --> 00:12:46.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are mere slights,

00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:51.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
or imperfections,
that we need to learn to put up with.

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:55.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand, if a fellow Christian

00:12:55.157 --> 00:12:58.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
has actually sinned against us in some way,

00:12:58.127 --> 00:13:01.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
giving us a genuine “cause for complaint,”

00:13:01.163 --> 00:13:04.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
what does the scripture encourage us to do?

00:13:04.767 --> 00:13:08.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Forgive one another freely.’

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is what Jehovah does for you and for me.

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:17.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Putting up with and forgiving
one another is vital

00:13:17.947 --> 00:13:22.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we are to stand together
as one united people.

00:13:23.752 --> 00:13:26.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our fourth area is how we respond

00:13:26.689 --> 00:13:29.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
when our brothers are in distress.

00:13:29.859 --> 00:13:32.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
While coping with the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:36.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
numerous lands were hit by other disasters

00:13:36.198 --> 00:13:39.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hurricanes, volcanoes, fires.

00:13:39.735 --> 00:13:43.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our brothers also experience
other forms of distress,

00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:48.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the effects of old age,
the loss of a loved one in death,

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:53.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
chronic health problems,
and the list goes on and on.

00:13:53.182 --> 00:13:56.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do Jehovah’s Witnesses do

00:13:56.151 --> 00:13:59.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we see our brothers in distress?

00:13:59.455 --> 00:14:02.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
We immediately

00:14:02.024 --> 00:14:03.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
come to their aid.

00:14:03.025 --> 00:14:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
We stand together.

00:14:05.127 --> 00:14:07.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this very selfish

00:14:07.196 --> 00:14:09.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
and divided world,

00:14:09.965 --> 00:14:14.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is not a small thing.

00:14:14.537 --> 00:14:18.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not something to take for granted.

00:14:18.507 --> 00:14:20.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said

00:14:20.543 --> 00:14:24.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
at John 13:34, 35

00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:26.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this deep,

00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:30.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
unselfish love in action

00:14:30.486 --> 00:14:34.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
would identify his true disciples.

00:14:34.356 --> 00:14:36.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, brothers and sisters,

00:14:36.458 --> 00:14:40.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we work hard to stand together

00:14:40.162 --> 00:14:43.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the four areas that we have discussed,

00:14:43.566 --> 00:14:46.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
we give powerful evidence

00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:51.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are true disciples of Christ Jesus.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew that unity was vital.

00:14:54.877 --> 00:14:59.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the night before he was put to death,
he was concerned

00:14:59.415 --> 00:15:02.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his disciples would remain united.

00:15:02.551 --> 00:15:07.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
He prayed at John chapter 17

00:15:07.022 --> 00:15:10.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verses 20-22:

00:15:10.593 --> 00:15:14.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I make request, not concerning these only,

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:19.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but also concerning those
putting faith in me through their word,

00:15:19.735 --> 00:15:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they may all be one,

00:15:22.705 --> 00:15:25.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as you, Father, are in union with me

00:15:25.708 --> 00:15:27.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I am in union with you,

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that they also may be in union with us,

00:15:32.147 --> 00:15:36.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the world
may believe that you sent me.

00:15:36.085 --> 00:15:39.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have given them the glory
that you have given me,

00:15:39.955 --> 00:15:43.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order that they may be one

00:15:43.025 --> 00:15:45.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as we are one.”

00:15:47.162 --> 00:15:51.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Obviously, Jehovah answered that prayer.

00:15:51.266 --> 00:15:53.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is teaching us

00:15:53.302 --> 00:15:57.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stand together as one united people.

00:15:57.339 --> 00:16:00.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, dear brothers and sisters,

00:16:00.643 --> 00:16:03.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us renew our determination

00:16:03.812 --> 00:16:07.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect our Christian unity

00:16:07.049 --> 00:16:09.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
by following direction

00:16:09.151 --> 00:16:11.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s organization,

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
by valuing Jehovah’s thinking

00:16:14.089 --> 00:16:16.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than our own culture,

00:16:16.158 --> 00:16:18.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
by putting up with

and forgiving one another freely,

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:23.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by helping one another

00:16:23.198 --> 00:16:25.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
in times of distress.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so,

00:16:26.769 --> 00:16:28.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will not allow Satan

00:16:28.771 --> 00:16:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
to steal our precious unity.

00:16:31.674 --> 00:16:35.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we will stand together

00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:39.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
as one united people.
