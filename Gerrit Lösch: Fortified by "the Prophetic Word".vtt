My comments to you today

00:00:03.953 --> 00:00:07.557 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are based on 2 Peter 1:19.

00:00:07.557 --> 00:00:09.592 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There it states:

00:00:09.592 --> 00:00:12.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We have the prophetic word
made more sure.”

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:16.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we are fortified by the prophetic word.

00:00:17.834 --> 00:00:20.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Actually, there is no one on earth today

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:23.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is not affected by prophecy,

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if he is not aware of it.

00:00:25.341 --> 00:00:27.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is a prophecy?

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Hebrew term for prophecy is not limited

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:34.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to predicting or foretelling
something in the future.

00:00:34.584 --> 00:00:37.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also includes divine commands

00:00:37.253 --> 00:00:39.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or inspired instruction.

00:00:39.556 --> 00:00:42.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Samaritan woman at the well

00:00:42.258 --> 00:00:45.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognized Jesus as a prophet

00:00:45.161 --> 00:00:48.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he revealed, not future things,

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:50.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but things about her past

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:53.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he could not have known
except by divine power.

00:00:53.937 --> 00:00:58.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The source of all true prophecy
is Jehovah God.

00:00:58.608 --> 00:01:02.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At 2 Peter 1:21

00:01:02.512 --> 00:01:04.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is said of prophecy

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:09.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “men spoke from God
as they were moved by holy spirit.”

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:14.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to transmitting prophecy
by holy spirit,

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:17.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah occasionally communicated

00:01:17.093 --> 00:01:20.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such messages by means of angels.

00:01:20.396 --> 00:01:24.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One outstanding prophet was Daniel.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In about 536 before our Common Era,

00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel recorded a vision

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:34.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involving world powers
having interaction with God’s servants.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me to Daniel 8:21, 22.

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:46.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel’s vision was
of animals representing governments.

00:01:47.824 --> 00:01:49.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note this remarkable prophecy

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Daniel 8:21, 22:

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The hairy male goat
stands for the king of Greece;

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the great horn that was between its eyes

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:05.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“stands for the first king.

00:02:05.375 --> 00:02:08.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As for the horn that was broken,

00:02:08.044 --> 00:02:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that four stood up instead of it,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“there are four kingdoms from his nation

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will stand up, but not with his power.”

00:02:18.788 --> 00:02:22.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interestingly, the Bible
specifically named Greece.

00:02:22.458 --> 00:02:24.494 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The ruler under which Greece

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:27.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
became a world power
in relation to God’s people,

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a great horn,

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:33.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the Macedonian Alexander the Great.

00:02:33.303 --> 00:02:35.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alexander’s rulership was short-lived.

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He died young

00:02:37.774 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the year 323 before our Common Era

00:02:41.744 --> 00:02:46.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—two hundred thirteen years
after Daniel wrote his book.

00:02:46.482 --> 00:02:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s angel had told Daniel

00:02:49.285 --> 00:02:51.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be four kingdoms

00:02:51.955 --> 00:02:56.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from his nation that will stand up
in place of the Grecian empire.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And chapter 11, verse 4, specifically states

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:04.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the four regions
would not go to his descendants.

00:03:04.901 --> 00:03:09.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do the historical facts
support these prophecies?

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:10.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alexander’s two sons, from different women,

00:03:13.476 --> 00:03:16.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heracles and Alexander IV,

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both were killed
before they reached adulthood.

00:03:19.616 --> 00:03:24.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it astounding
how precisely the prophecy came true

00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:28.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the rulership would not be passed on
to Alexander’s posterity?

00:03:30.426 --> 00:03:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the prophecy also foretold
that Alexander’s empire

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:37.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be divided up into four kingdoms.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did that happen?

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes!

00:03:41.204 --> 00:03:45.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One source listed
72 different military leaders

00:03:45.275 --> 00:03:47.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
under Alexander the Great,

00:03:47.543 --> 00:03:50.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the prophecy said only four

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:53.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would eventually rule in his place.

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After Alexander’s death,

00:03:55.551 --> 00:03:59.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were constant fierce battles
between these military leaders.

00:03:59.756 --> 00:04:03.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But finally, just four dynasties resulted

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—just as the Bible prophesied.

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:09.632 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One was that of General Cassander,

00:04:09.632 --> 00:04:13.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
son of Antipater, in Macedonia and Greece.

00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:17.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second was that of General Lysimachus

00:04:17.407 --> 00:04:21.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Asia Minor and European Thrace.

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:26.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third was the one
of General Seleucus Nicator,

00:04:26.215 --> 00:04:28.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the conqueror who secured

00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:31.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Babylon, Media, Syria, Persia,

00:04:31.654 --> 00:04:36.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the provinces eastward
into the Indus River.

00:04:36.125 --> 00:04:38.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finally, the fourth was that

00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:41.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of General Ptolemy Soter, son of Lagus,

00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:45.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who secured Egypt, Libya, Arabia,

00:04:45.268 --> 00:04:48.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Palestine, and Celesyria [Coele-Syria].

00:04:48.104 --> 00:04:50.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These four proclaimed themselves king

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
around 305 before our Common Era,

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:57.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
18 years after the death of Alexander.

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prophecy was so detailed,

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
its fulfillment is fascinating proof

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of divine inspiration.

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:10.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this not strengthen
your faith and trust in the Bible?

00:05:12.829 --> 00:05:17.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s another point:
What is the first prophecy in the Bible?

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:21.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first prophecy ever
was the one uttered

00:05:21.337 --> 00:05:25.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Jehovah at Genesis 3:15.

00:05:25.475 --> 00:05:29.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It foretold that the offspring
of his figurative wife,

00:05:29.912 --> 00:05:32.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the heavenly part of his organization,

00:05:32.615 --> 00:05:35.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would crush Satan and his offspring,

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:38.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
bringing liberation to mankind.

00:05:38.221 --> 00:05:43.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To identify this offspring,
primarily Christ Jesus,

00:05:43.092 --> 00:05:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah arranged
for many prophecies pointing to him.

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 19:10 says:

00:05:51.034 --> 00:05:56.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The witness concerning Jesus
is what inspires prophecy,”

00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:59.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or literally ‘is the spirit of prophecy.’

00:05:59.709 --> 00:06:02.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that mean?

00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:05.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That all inspired
Messianic messages from God,

00:06:05.948 --> 00:06:10.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
proclaimed by his servants
pointed to his Son.

00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:14.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Luke 24:44 Jesus himself said

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all the prophecies
concerning the Messiah

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must be fulfilled.

00:06:21.497 --> 00:06:24.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s consider some outstanding prophecies

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jesus and their fulfillment.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One was that he would be born

00:06:30.973 --> 00:06:32.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the tribe of Judah,

00:06:32.975 --> 00:06:36.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the family of David, the son of Jesse.

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:40.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than 700 years before Jesus was born,

00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:42.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Micah foretold in chapter 5

00:06:42.585 --> 00:06:45.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would be born in Bethlehem.

00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:49.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The prophecy speaks
of “Bethlehem Ephrathah.”

00:06:49.358 --> 00:06:53.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why is the designation “Ephrathah” important?

00:06:53.896 --> 00:06:56.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because there existed another Bethlehem

00:06:56.532 --> 00:06:58.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the territory of Zebulun.

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:02.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been identified with Beit Lahm

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:04.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 7 miles, or 11 kilometers,

00:07:04.807 --> 00:07:07.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
west-northwest of Nazareth.

00:07:07.577 --> 00:07:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, the prophecy was extremely specific.

00:07:11.814 --> 00:07:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And amazingly,

00:07:13.816 --> 00:07:17.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah prophesied
he would be born of a virgin.

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:21.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What human would ever think of such a thing?

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Daniel chapter 9 foretold that the Messiah

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would arrive 483 years
after the command to rebuild Jerusalem.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This proved to be true
in the year 29 of our Common Era

00:07:34.971 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus was baptized.

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:41.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zechariah chapter 11
foretold that the Messiah

00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:44.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be betrayed for “30 pieces of silver.”

00:07:44.847 --> 00:07:49.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 12 says
that his body would be pierced.

00:07:49.652 --> 00:07:52.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was foretold that the Messiah

00:07:52.288 --> 00:07:55.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would die a sacrificial death for our sins

00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:58.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be buried in the tomb of a rich man.

00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:02.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Furthermore, prophecy proclaimed
that he would be in the grave

00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:07.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for parts of three days
and then be resurrected.

00:08:07.303 --> 00:08:09.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the argument

00:08:09.505 --> 00:08:12.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus deliberately arranged matters

00:08:12.108 --> 00:08:16.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that the events in his life
would fit all these prophecies?

00:08:16.779 --> 00:08:18.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:08:18.814 --> 00:08:22.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could Jesus have arranged
to be born of the tribe of Judah,

00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:25.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the town of David’s birth, Bethlehem?

00:08:25.688 --> 00:08:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His mother, Mary, lived in Nazareth.

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could he tell her, while in the womb,

00:08:31.861 --> 00:08:33.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Please take me to Bethlehem

00:08:33.629 --> 00:08:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the scriptures say
I must be born there?’

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:41.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, the very start
of his life on earth

00:08:41.237 --> 00:08:43.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was beyond his control.

00:08:43.739 --> 00:08:46.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Furthermore, could Jesus have arranged

00:08:46.876 --> 00:08:51.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the priests to pay Judas
the 30 pieces of silver to betray him?

00:08:51.847 --> 00:08:56.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could he have arranged
that his enemies spit in his face?

00:08:56.052 --> 00:09:00.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Roman authorities
sentence him to be nailed to a stake?

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:04.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the soldiers
cast lots for his garments?

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or that, while piercing his side
with a spear,

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:12.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they not follow the custom
of breaking any of his bones?

00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:15.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could the prophecies, just mentioned,

00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:18.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been fulfilled by mere chance?

00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Bible scholar likened this process

00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the assembling of a statue

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:26.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made of individual pieces of marble.

00:09:26.916 --> 00:09:28.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that many men

00:09:28.918 --> 00:09:31.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had never communicated
with one another

00:09:31.754 --> 00:09:34.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each brought a piece of marble into a room.

00:09:34.523 --> 00:09:39.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If those pieces
fit together to form a perfect statue,

00:09:39.228 --> 00:09:42.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you would logically conclude
that there must have been

00:09:42.098 --> 00:09:44.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
someone behind the scenes

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had drawn the specifications

00:09:46.435 --> 00:09:49.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sent an assignment to each man.

00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:53.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fitting together like the pieces of a statue,

00:09:53.376 --> 00:09:55.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every Messianic prophecy would provide

00:09:55.911 --> 00:09:59.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a vital piece of information
about the Messiah.

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What, then, would be the likelihood

00:10:04.453 --> 00:10:06.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of all the prophecies about the Messiah

00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:10.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being fulfilled by coincidence in one person?

00:10:12.161 --> 00:10:16.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In an interview,
researcher Louis Lapides said:

00:10:16.432 --> 00:10:19.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Someone did the math and figured out

00:10:19.168 --> 00:10:22.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that the probability
of just eight prophecies

00:10:22.672 --> 00:10:24.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“being fulfilled [by Jesus]

00:10:24.473 --> 00:10:29.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is one chance
in one hundred million billion.”

00:10:29.478 --> 00:10:33.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To arrive at the figure
mentioned by this scholar,

00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by addition rather than by multiplication,

00:10:36.652 --> 00:10:39.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you would have to write down one million

00:10:39.355 --> 00:10:44.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then copy that figure a billion times.

00:10:44.026 --> 00:10:48.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Putting those odds in perspective,
the scholar stated:

00:10:48.497 --> 00:10:53.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘If you took
one hundred million billion silver dollars,

00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:57.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘they would cover
the state of Texas in the United States

00:10:57.673 --> 00:11:02.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a depth of 2 feet, or .6 meters.’

00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:04.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Texas has a land area

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 266,807 square miles,

00:11:08.951 --> 00:11:12.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or 690,000 square kilometers.

00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:15.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine that huge area covered

00:11:15.224 --> 00:11:19.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in silver dollars up to a depth of 2 feet.

00:11:19.061 --> 00:11:22.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now what ‘if you put a mark on just one

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:26.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of those silver dollars
and then had a blindfolded person

00:11:26.702 --> 00:11:29.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘wander the whole state
and bend down

00:11:29.305 --> 00:11:33.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to pick up just one coin?

00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:38.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would be the chance that he choose
the only coin that had been marked?’

00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scholar then stated that those

00:11:41.884 --> 00:11:45.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are “the same odds that anybody in history

00:11:45.488 --> 00:11:50.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could have fulfilled
just eight of the [Messianic] prophecies.”

00:11:50.359 --> 00:11:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Jesus fulfilled not just eight

00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:56.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but many more Bible prophecies.

00:11:56.665 --> 00:12:01.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is overwhelming proof
of divine inspiration.

00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:05.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Corinthians 1:20 says:

00:12:05.508 --> 00:12:08.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘No matter how many the promises of God are,

00:12:08.277 --> 00:12:11.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they have become “yes” by means of Jesus.’

00:12:11.781 --> 00:12:14.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does this mean for us?

00:12:14.917 --> 00:12:17.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It means that Jesus was actually

00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:20.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the promised Messiah who was sent by God.

00:12:20.689 --> 00:12:23.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As such, he taught the truth.

00:12:23.426 --> 00:12:26.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we believe him and follow him,

00:12:26.195 --> 00:12:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we too have the truth.

00:12:28.397 --> 00:12:30.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the divine origin of Bible prophecies.

00:12:33.903 --> 00:12:38.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Bible prophecies
deal not only with past events,

00:12:38.774 --> 00:12:42.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some prophecies are having
remarkable fulfillment

00:12:42.144 --> 00:12:45.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right now before our eyes!

00:12:45.281 --> 00:12:47.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This gives us strong assurance

00:12:47.983 --> 00:12:50.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the few outstanding prophecies

00:12:50.219 --> 00:12:52.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the end of this wicked system of things

00:12:52.988 --> 00:12:55.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Paradise on earth to come

00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:58.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will also be fulfilled in the near future

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:01.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without any possibility of failure.

00:13:01.897 --> 00:13:06.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As true Christians,
we are engaged in a prophetic work.

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:10.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is, not in the sense
that we initiate new prophecies,

00:13:10.739 --> 00:13:13.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but in the sense that we proclaim prophecies

00:13:13.476 --> 00:13:16.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
already written down in the Bible.

00:13:16.312 --> 00:13:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Pentecost 33 of our Common Era

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:23.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when holy spirit
was poured out on 120 disciples,

00:13:23.352 --> 00:13:25.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both men and women,

00:13:25.354 --> 00:13:28.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter quoted the prophet Joel saying:

00:13:28.557 --> 00:13:32.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘In the last days,’
God says, ‘I will pour out

00:13:32.127 --> 00:13:35.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘some of my spirit on every sort of flesh,

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and your sons
and your daughters will prophesy.’”

00:13:38.801 --> 00:13:43.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did the 120 disciples do at Pentecost?

00:13:43.339 --> 00:13:46.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no indication
 that they foretold new events,

00:13:46.976 --> 00:13:49.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Acts 2:11 says:

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:54.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We hear them speaking . . .
about the magnificent things of God.”

00:13:54.216 --> 00:13:57.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was called prophesying.

00:13:57.419 --> 00:14:01.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, too, whether brothers
or sisters or children,

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:03.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we share in a prophetic work,

00:14:03.826 --> 00:14:07.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speaking about
“the magnificent things of God.”

00:14:07.162 --> 00:14:09.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We speak about what he has done,

00:14:09.365 --> 00:14:11.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what he is doing now,

00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:13.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what he will do in the near future.

00:14:13.903 --> 00:14:15.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a privilege!

00:14:15.938 --> 00:14:18.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having seen many prophecies fulfilled,

00:14:18.741 --> 00:14:22.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have the prophetic word made more sure.

00:14:22.511 --> 00:14:26.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we are telling people
about the prophetic word

00:14:26.215 --> 00:14:28.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to fortify their faith too.

00:14:28.951 --> 00:14:32.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we do it to help them to get to the road

00:14:32.721 --> 00:14:35.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to everlasting life and to develop

00:14:35.457 --> 00:14:39.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an intimate relationship
with our great God, Jehovah.
