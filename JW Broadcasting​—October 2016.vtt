00:01.583 --> 00:04.920
Welcome to JW Broadcasting! 


00:04.920 --> 00:08.190
Here’s what we 
can look forward to in our program: 


00:08.190 --> 00:12.595
What if your courtship 
reveals problems you didn’t expect? 


00:12.595 --> 00:16.165
Part 3 of the Preparing for Marriage series 


00:16.165 --> 00:19.135
will show us how we 
can “calculate the expense” 


00:19.135 --> 00:21.537
when considering marriage. 


00:21.537 --> 00:25.975
We go to Australia 
to meet Viv and Ann Mouritz. 


00:25.975 --> 00:29.445
Their life of full-time service 
has taken them around the world. 


00:29.445 --> 00:32.315
What advice do they have 
for those who are deciding 


00:32.315 --> 00:35.000
what form 
of sacred service to pursue? 


00:36.485 --> 00:38.888
And we’ll enjoy 
a music video that highlights 


00:38.888 --> 00:40.890
the theme of our program. 


00:40.890 --> 00:44.993
It will encourage us to settle differences 
with our brothers and sisters 


00:44.993 --> 00:47.496
and to forgive one another. 


00:47.497 --> 00:51.200
This is the October 2016 edition 


00:51.200 --> 00:54.000
of JW Broadcasting!


01:12.355 --> 01:15.325
We begin with a report from Ukraine. 


01:15.325 --> 01:19.395
In 2014, 
political tensions in eastern Ukraine 


01:19.395 --> 01:23.332
boiled over 
into a full-blown military conflict. 


01:23.332 --> 01:25.335
Within months, 


01:25.335 --> 01:28.237
over 7,600 Witnesses 


01:28.237 --> 01:30.974
needed to flee the area 
to seek refuge. 


01:30.973 --> 01:33.710
Others sheltered in their homes. 


01:33.710 --> 01:36.112
How did our brothers 
survive physically 


01:36.112 --> 01:38.482
and spiritually 
through the fighting? 


01:38.482 --> 01:41.750
Relief was organized 
from hundreds of miles away 


01:41.750 --> 01:44.287
at the branch office in L’viv. 


01:44.287 --> 01:46.589
In the following interviews, 


01:46.588 --> 01:49.958
our brothers and sisters 
describe the love and care 


01:49.958 --> 01:53.000
they received from the organization 
and from each other.


02:09.545 --> 02:11.815
It happened that the hostilities 


02:11.815 --> 02:13.950
started without warning, 


02:13.950 --> 02:16.000
and the brothers needed to flee quickly.


02:19.222 --> 02:21.224
There was not enough food; 


02:21.223 --> 02:23.358
there was nothing in the stores; 


02:23.358 --> 02:25.361
there was a lack of medicine; 


02:25.362 --> 02:27.364
there was no water, 


02:27.363 --> 02:29.931
no electricity.


02:29.932 --> 02:31.767
It was scary. 


02:31.767 --> 02:33.604
There was no stability at all. 


02:33.603 --> 02:36.671
We did not know what to do.


02:36.672 --> 02:39.000
Should we stay, or should we leave?


02:41.777 --> 02:45.249
There were triplets; 
they were seven years old. 


02:45.248 --> 02:47.383
As soon as they 
got into the shelter, 


02:47.383 --> 02:50.000
they started singing 
a Kingdom song. 


02:53.022 --> 02:55.292
The adults 
also joined them in singing, 


02:55.292 --> 02:58.160
and because of that, 
we couldn’t hear the explosions 


02:58.160 --> 03:01.000
that were happening outside.


03:02.098 --> 03:04.633
True, we ran out of foodstuffs, 


03:04.633 --> 03:06.701
and we had no money. 


03:06.702 --> 03:09.705
But I knew we would be able to get by. 


03:09.705 --> 03:12.642
God would not let us die of hunger.


03:12.642 --> 03:16.845
Because the shelling was happening
so often, it was impossible 


03:16.845 --> 03:18.848
to conduct our usual meetings. 


03:18.848 --> 03:23.051
We also couldn’t organize the ministry 
in the normal way. 


03:23.052 --> 03:25.789
It was just too dangerous.


03:25.788 --> 03:29.191
When we received the first reports 
about the unrest in the east, 


03:29.192 --> 03:31.194
our Branch Committee gathered 


03:31.193 --> 03:34.130
and we prayerfully analyzed 
the situation. 


03:34.130 --> 03:37.533
We asked Jehovah for wisdom
—how to act, 


03:37.533 --> 03:41.236
how to help our brothers 
to be spiritually and physically safe. 


03:41.237 --> 03:44.774
We were also sending regular
update reports to the Governing Body.


03:44.773 --> 03:47.910
More than 156 tons of food 


03:47.910 --> 03:51.047
and 21 tons of clothing donated 


03:51.047 --> 03:53.549
by local brothers have been distributed 


03:53.548 --> 03:56.785
to fellow believers 
and also to some non-Witnesses.


03:56.785 --> 03:59.822
We had been told 
that we would be receiving 


03:59.822 --> 04:01.824
about five tons of relief supplies. 


04:01.823 --> 04:05.328
So we were astounded 
when instead of 5 tons, 


04:05.328 --> 04:07.330
we received 15 tons!


04:07.330 --> 04:09.798
It was lovely to find little notes 


04:09.798 --> 04:12.368
that our brothers 
and sisters had written 


04:12.368 --> 04:15.000
and included in the packages.


04:16.105 --> 04:18.942
Brothers from neighboring cities responded 


04:18.942 --> 04:21.110
and offered their homes, 


04:21.110 --> 04:23.112
provided foodstuffs 


04:23.112 --> 04:27.250
and, more importantly, 
their brotherly hospitality.


04:27.250 --> 04:29.752
So we are ready to make sacrifices, 


04:29.752 --> 04:31.955
to adjust our schedules, 


04:31.955 --> 04:34.823
and to even take time 
out from our families 


04:34.823 --> 04:37.000
to render practical help 
to our brothers.


04:39.528 --> 04:42.598
For example,
beginning at 6 a.m., 


04:42.598 --> 04:45.266
I would visit 
the brothers and sisters 


04:45.267 --> 04:48.000
and bring them 
the things that they needed. 


04:49.872 --> 04:53.109
So during two and a half months of war 


04:53.108 --> 04:55.176
and two months of reconstruction, 


04:55.177 --> 04:57.180
I rode my bicycle 


04:57.180 --> 05:00.000
6,500 kilometers.


05:01.783 --> 05:04.586
The local elders from Slavyansk 


05:04.587 --> 05:06.789
organized small congregations 


05:06.788 --> 05:08.791
and regularly conducted meetings 


05:08.792 --> 05:11.960
to support them spiritually.


05:11.960 --> 05:14.963
Major repairs 
have been carried out on 20 houses 


05:14.963 --> 05:17.566
of brothers and sisters, 
and minor repair work 


05:17.567 --> 05:21.470
was done on 72 houses 
and apartments.


05:21.470 --> 05:23.638
We prepared two more programs. 


05:23.638 --> 05:27.243
This time, not only 
for the congregations in the war zone 


05:27.243 --> 05:29.311
but for the whole country of Ukraine, 


05:29.312 --> 05:31.480
even for Russia and Belarus. 


05:31.480 --> 05:36.818
We even had 325,000 
in attendance.


05:36.818 --> 05:38.821
An interesting experience 


05:38.822 --> 05:42.759
was the response of the people 
who were not Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


05:42.758 --> 05:46.361
They belong to another religion, 
yet they said: 


05:46.362 --> 05:49.565
“You are the only ones 
that really care. 


05:49.565 --> 05:52.968
Your genuine love 
is shown by your deeds.” 


05:52.968 --> 05:55.871
This is what makes us different 


05:55.872 --> 05:58.000
from all other religions.


06:00.208 --> 06:02.811
This unselfish love 
shown by our brothers 


06:02.812 --> 06:05.000
did not go unnoticed 
by my husband and my son. 


06:06.815 --> 06:08.885
My husband 
started studying the Bible, 


06:08.885 --> 06:11.620
and he regularly attends 
the meetings now. 


06:11.620 --> 06:15.000
Recently, he enrolled 
in the Theocratic Ministry School.


06:17.593 --> 06:20.396
I experienced this love personally, 


06:20.397 --> 06:24.767
and I started studying 
the Bible again with the brothers. 


06:24.767 --> 06:27.637
Now I am preparing for baptism.


06:27.637 --> 06:31.440
Unfortunately, 
one of our sisters was killed.


06:31.440 --> 06:34.810
I realized that a person can lose


06:34.810 --> 06:38.113
—lose everything, but that 


06:38.113 --> 06:42.016
is really nothing 
compared to losing your children. 


06:42.017 --> 06:44.954
The brothers and sisters listened to us. 


06:44.953 --> 06:46.955
We cried together. 


06:46.955 --> 06:49.725
I just can’t put it into words. 


06:49.725 --> 06:52.928
It is as if Jehovah 
is holding you in his arms


06:52.928 --> 06:54.930
—he doesn’t let you fall—


06:54.930 --> 06:56.932
as if he is saying to you: 


06:56.932 --> 06:59.269
‘Don’t let go, my dear one. 


06:59.268 --> 07:02.000
I’m helping you. 
I’m supporting you.’


07:03.605 --> 07:07.410
With Jehovah there are no borders 
between nations. 


07:07.410 --> 07:12.000
I could see 
that this was the true religion.


07:13.515 --> 07:17.387
We continue to pray 
for our brothers in Ukraine. 


07:17.387 --> 07:20.657
We’re confident 
of Jehovah’s love for them, 


07:20.657 --> 07:24.000
and we know he’ll sustain them 
through any tribulation.


07:26.262 --> 07:29.799
Our worldwide brotherhood 
is truly special. 


07:29.798 --> 07:32.000
When our brothers are in need, 


07:32.000 --> 07:34.670
we want to help 
in whatever way possible. 


07:34.670 --> 07:37.873
It also brings us great joy 
to be with our brothers


07:37.873 --> 07:40.610
—whether at the meetings, 
in the field service, 


07:40.610 --> 07:42.612
or on other occasions. 


07:42.612 --> 07:46.282
We love our brothers 
and enjoy spending time with them. 


07:46.282 --> 07:49.685
At the same time, 
because we are all imperfect, 


07:49.685 --> 07:52.688
our love and unity will be tested. 


07:52.688 --> 07:54.956
We may have our feelings hurt, 


07:54.957 --> 07:57.000
or we may hurt
the feelings of others.


07:58.895 --> 08:01.363
That brings me to the theme 
I would like to discuss 


08:01.363 --> 08:03.765
with you 
in this month’s program, 


08:03.765 --> 08:07.000
“Settling Differences 
Brings Jehovah’s Favor.” 


08:08.570 --> 08:11.440
It is based on Matthew 6:14. 


08:11.440 --> 08:13.977
Let’s read 
this important verse together. 


08:13.977 --> 08:17.314
Right after teaching 
his disciples how to pray, 


08:17.313 --> 08:21.000
Jesus says in verse 14: 


08:22.885 --> 08:25.955
“For if you forgive 
men their trespasses, 


08:25.955 --> 08:29.125
your heavenly Father 
will also forgive you.”


08:29.125 --> 08:32.395
To what extent do Jesus’ words 
affect how Jehovah 


08:32.395 --> 08:35.932
views what we do each day 
in our worship to him? 


08:35.932 --> 08:37.934
Consider this: 


08:37.933 --> 08:40.603
You’re concluding 
your day in prayer. 


08:40.603 --> 08:44.140
You pray for Jehovah’s name 
to be sanctified. 


08:44.140 --> 08:46.675
You pray 
for his Kingdom to come. 


08:46.675 --> 08:49.145
You ask that he bless 
the Governing Body 


08:49.145 --> 08:51.280
and the brothers taking the lead. 


08:51.280 --> 08:53.615
You share with him 
a few matters 


08:53.615 --> 08:55.618
of personal concern. 


08:55.618 --> 08:57.620
And then you say: “Jehovah, 


08:57.620 --> 08:59.622
“I know I am imperfect, 


08:59.622 --> 09:01.824
“and I sin against you often. 


09:01.823 --> 09:04.360
“Please forgive me 
for my sins. 


09:04.360 --> 09:06.362
“Let me stand before you 


09:06.362 --> 09:09.000
in a clean 
and approved state.”


09:10.833 --> 09:12.835
Now the question is, 


09:12.835 --> 09:15.000
Has Jehovah heard 
your heartfelt request? 


09:16.905 --> 09:19.042
Will he forgive you? 


09:19.042 --> 09:21.377
Well, what did Jesus say? 


09:21.377 --> 09:24.114
Look again at verse 14: 


09:24.113 --> 09:27.450
“For if you forgive 
men their trespasses, 


09:27.450 --> 09:31.087
your heavenly Father 
will also forgive you.”


09:31.087 --> 09:34.957
Did you notice 
Jesus’ use of the word “if”? 


09:34.957 --> 09:38.560
That tells us that forgiveness 
is not automatic. 


09:38.560 --> 09:41.030
It comes with a condition, or price. 


09:41.030 --> 09:42.698
What price? 


09:42.698 --> 09:46.501
According to Jesus, 
‘if we forgive others,’ 


09:46.502 --> 09:48.504
the condition has been met; 


09:48.503 --> 09:50.906
the price has been paid. 


09:50.907 --> 09:53.375
What will Jehovah do for us? 


09:53.375 --> 09:57.000
Jesus said: 
“[He] will also forgive you.” 


09:58.247 --> 10:01.117
Really, though, 
is it fair or reasonable 


10:01.117 --> 10:03.119
for Jehovah to say to us, 


10:03.118 --> 10:05.120
‘Only if you forgive others, 


10:05.120 --> 10:08.323
then I will also forgive you’? 


10:08.323 --> 10:12.260
Well, suppose you 
get very sick and lose your job. 


10:12.260 --> 10:15.597
You’re unable 
to pay rent for many months. 


10:15.597 --> 10:18.067
Your situation is desperate. 


10:18.067 --> 10:21.470
You have very few,
if any, options. 


10:21.470 --> 10:24.000
You worry about your wife 
and your children. 


10:25.073 --> 10:27.275
Say you go to the owner 
of the house and ask 


10:27.275 --> 10:31.447
if he would give you time 
to get back on your feet. 


10:31.447 --> 10:34.584
Once you get better 
and are able to work again, 


10:34.583 --> 10:36.651
you will do everything 
within your power 


10:36.652 --> 10:39.055
to pay him what you owe.


10:39.055 --> 10:41.590
He tells you not to worry. 


10:41.590 --> 10:44.260
He understands your situation. 


10:44.260 --> 10:46.262
He will cancel your debt, 


10:46.262 --> 10:48.530
and you do not have 
to pay him any rent 


10:48.530 --> 10:50.667
until your situation improves. 


10:50.667 --> 10:53.802
In fact, he’ll cover 
your monthly expenses 


10:53.802 --> 10:57.272
until you are able 
to care for your family. 


10:57.272 --> 11:00.609
How would you feel 
about what he has done, 


11:00.608 --> 11:04.000
and would this affect 
how you treat others?


11:05.213 --> 11:07.783
Well, because of our sinful nature, 


11:07.783 --> 11:10.051
we are all in debt to Jehovah


11:10.052 --> 11:12.120
—deserving of death. 


11:12.120 --> 11:14.923
We are unable 
to cover our expenses. 


11:14.923 --> 11:17.493
But when we go 
to Jehovah in prayer 


11:17.493 --> 11:19.695
and beg for his help, 


11:19.695 --> 11:22.632
in his great mercy and kindness, 


11:22.632 --> 11:24.634
he tells us not to worry. 


11:24.633 --> 11:28.000
He has given the life 
of his Son to pay our debt. 


11:29.038 --> 11:31.806
And on the basis of that sacrifice, 


11:31.807 --> 11:34.610
He is willing to cover our expenses


11:34.610 --> 11:36.712
—the sins we commit daily—


11:36.712 --> 11:40.115
and to extend forgiveness 
to us until we are able 


11:40.115 --> 11:42.117
to get back on our feet, 


11:42.117 --> 11:45.000
when we reach perfection 
in the new world.


11:46.522 --> 11:49.392
So think again about those 
simple yet powerful words 


11:49.392 --> 11:52.562
of Jesus at Matthew 6:14: 


11:52.562 --> 11:56.032
“For if you forgive 
men their trespasses, 


11:56.032 --> 11:59.169
your heavenly Father 
will also forgive you.” 


11:59.168 --> 12:01.236
Is that fair? 


12:01.237 --> 12:03.305
Is that reasonable? 


12:03.305 --> 12:05.307
Is it realistic? 


12:05.307 --> 12:07.309
Without a doubt! 


12:07.308 --> 12:09.545
In fact, settling differences, 


12:09.545 --> 12:11.580
or forgiving others freely, 


12:11.580 --> 12:13.915
is one of the best ways to imitate 


12:13.915 --> 12:17.000
Jehovah’s compassionate 
and merciful nature.


12:19.020 --> 12:22.000
What can help us 
to settle differences quickly? 


12:23.192 --> 12:25.527
The first thing 
we should do is to try 


12:25.527 --> 12:27.997
and let love cover 
over the wrong. 


12:27.997 --> 12:31.300
Can I just forgive and forget? 


12:31.300 --> 12:33.568
If we are able to do so, 


12:33.568 --> 12:35.771
this is a beautiful way to maintain 


12:35.772 --> 12:38.000
the congregation’s peace and unity. 


12:39.508 --> 12:42.243
But if we’re struggling 
to forget the wrong, 


12:42.243 --> 12:45.180
there are two scriptures 
that are especially helpful 


12:45.180 --> 12:47.783
in this matter 
of settling differences. 


12:47.783 --> 12:51.120
They are Matthew 5:23, 24 


12:51.120 --> 12:55.000
and Matthew 18:15-17.


12:56.192 --> 12:58.260
Keep in mind that these texts 


12:58.260 --> 13:01.197
are not referring 
to the same scenarios, 


13:01.197 --> 13:03.199
nor are they to be applied 


13:03.198 --> 13:05.566
in the exact same way. 


13:05.567 --> 13:07.570
Matthew chapter 5 


13:07.570 --> 13:09.705
has a broader application 


13:09.705 --> 13:11.707
and can be used to bring peace 


13:11.707 --> 13:13.709
in most situations. 


13:13.708 --> 13:15.911
Matthew chapter 18 


13:15.912 --> 13:18.547
has a more limited application 


13:18.547 --> 13:21.484
and applies to specific situations 


13:21.483 --> 13:24.000
that are more serious in nature.


13:25.453 --> 13:27.590
Now let’s consider the first text, 


13:27.590 --> 13:30.927
Matthew 5:23, 24: 


13:30.927 --> 13:34.197
“If, then, 
you are bringing your gift to the altar 


13:34.197 --> 13:37.867
“and there you remember that 
your brother has something against you, 


13:37.867 --> 13:42.004
“leave your gift there 
in front of the altar, and go away. 


13:42.003 --> 13:44.740
“First make your peace 
with your brother, 


13:44.740 --> 13:47.977
and then come back 
and offer your gift.”


13:47.977 --> 13:51.247
To truly capture 
what these two brief verses mean 


13:51.247 --> 13:53.282
for you and me today, 


13:53.282 --> 13:56.019
we have to understand 
what Jesus’ words meant 


13:56.018 --> 13:59.321
to his first-century Jewish listeners. 


13:59.322 --> 14:02.792
Picture the scene in your mind 
as we transport ourselves 


14:02.792 --> 14:06.595
into the city of Jerusalem 
some 2,000 years ago. 


14:06.595 --> 14:09.865
It is during one 
of the annual festivals. 


14:09.865 --> 14:13.402
There are tens of thousands 
of people in the city. 


14:13.402 --> 14:17.139
You are there to make your sacrifice
—a beautiful lamb. 


14:17.138 --> 14:19.140
The best one you have. 


14:19.140 --> 14:21.877
It’s clean and unblemished.


14:21.877 --> 14:24.747
You take the lamb 
through a series of courts 


14:24.747 --> 14:27.082
all the way 
to the Court of Priests. 


14:27.082 --> 14:30.085
It has taken you 
most of the day to get there. 


14:30.085 --> 14:33.488
Now you’re ready 
to put your hands on that animal 


14:33.488 --> 14:35.958
and offer a prayer for forgiveness, 


14:35.958 --> 14:37.960
and then you remember something. 


14:37.960 --> 14:39.295
What? 


14:39.295 --> 14:42.163
Verse 23 reads: 


14:42.163 --> 14:45.366
“If, then, you are bringing 
your gift to the altar 


14:45.367 --> 14:47.435
“and there you remember 
that your brother 


14:47.435 --> 14:49.805
has something against you,”


14:49.805 --> 14:52.107
Now you think: 
‘My brother 


14:52.107 --> 14:54.377
‘does have 
something against me! 


14:54.377 --> 14:56.379
‘The last time I saw him, 


14:56.378 --> 14:58.580
‘he greeted 
everybody else but me. 


14:58.580 --> 15:01.317
‘He was upset. 
But what is it? 


15:01.317 --> 15:03.719
‘I don’t remember 
doing anything. 


15:03.718 --> 15:05.720
‘He is so sensitive! 


15:05.720 --> 15:08.000
He’s always upset 
with something.’


15:10.125 --> 15:12.393
Did Jesus 
have all of that in mind 


15:12.393 --> 15:14.996
when he said 
what he did in verse 23? 


15:14.997 --> 15:16.265
No! 


15:16.265 --> 15:18.267
He did not go into detail 


15:18.267 --> 15:21.070
about what 
that “something” might be. 


15:21.070 --> 15:23.972
He doesn’t say 
who is right or wrong. 


15:23.972 --> 15:25.975
He doesn’t make a comment 


15:25.975 --> 15:28.143
about whether
someone is too sensitive, 


15:28.143 --> 15:31.080
always getting upset, 
never satisfied, 


15:31.080 --> 15:33.082
difficult to get along with. 


15:33.082 --> 15:34.484
Why not? 


15:34.483 --> 15:37.620
Because the reason 
behind the “something” 


15:37.620 --> 15:40.222
is not the important thing.


15:40.222 --> 15:42.759
What is the important thing? 


15:42.758 --> 15:46.028
That the peace 
has been disturbed. 


15:46.028 --> 15:49.298
There is a difference 
that needs to be settled. 


15:49.298 --> 15:51.766
The lack of peace 
between brothers 


15:51.767 --> 15:54.437
could affect their relationship 
with Jehovah. 


15:54.437 --> 15:56.705
That is important! 


15:56.705 --> 15:59.375
So what should be done?


15:59.375 --> 16:02.477
We see the answer in verse 24: 


16:02.477 --> 16:04.480
“Leave your gift there 


16:04.480 --> 16:07.348
“in front of the altar, 
and go away. 


16:07.348 --> 16:10.085
“First make your peace 
with your brother, 


16:10.085 --> 16:13.155
and then come back 
and offer your gift.”


16:13.155 --> 16:15.657
That animal sacrifice 
is important too. 


16:15.657 --> 16:17.727
There’s no doubt about that. 


16:17.727 --> 16:20.429
It represents worship to Jehovah


16:20.428 --> 16:23.431
—like going to the meetings, 
in the field service, 


16:23.432 --> 16:25.567
sharing in family worship. 


16:25.567 --> 16:27.569
But according to Jesus, 


16:27.568 --> 16:29.771
what is more important? 


16:29.772 --> 16:33.042
It is settling the difference


16:33.042 --> 16:36.179
—making peace 
with our brother first. 


16:36.178 --> 16:39.381
Then we will be 
in an acceptable position 


16:39.382 --> 16:43.119
to offer our gift 
of worship to Jehovah. 


16:43.118 --> 16:47.000
Yes, settling differences 
will bring Jehovah’s favor.


16:48.190 --> 16:52.327
But when can we apply
the principle of Matthew 5? 


16:52.327 --> 16:55.597
Whenever there is 
a difference to be settled. 


16:55.597 --> 16:59.000
Perhaps our brother 
misunderstood what we said or did. 


16:59.000 --> 17:01.403
Or maybe he didn’t misunderstand


17:01.403 --> 17:04.740
—maybe we did give him 
a valid reason to be hurt. 


17:04.740 --> 17:06.742
Regardless, we notice 


17:06.742 --> 17:09.412
that he has something against us. 


17:09.412 --> 17:12.949
In that case, we make peace. 


17:12.948 --> 17:16.085
We can also use 
the principles of this text 


17:16.085 --> 17:18.553
when we are hurt
or have something 


17:18.553 --> 17:20.555
against our brother. 


17:20.555 --> 17:22.690
We can take the initiative ourselves 


17:22.690 --> 17:24.760
to settle misunderstandings, 


17:24.760 --> 17:26.762
to resolve differences, 


17:26.762 --> 17:28.797
and to make peace 
with our brother. 


17:28.797 --> 17:32.000
Again, Jehovah blesses 
such a spirit.


17:34.202 --> 17:38.074
Now, open your Bible 
to Matthew chapter 18. 


17:38.073 --> 17:40.141
We mentioned earlier that it has 


17:40.142 --> 17:42.344
a more limited application. 


17:42.343 --> 17:44.345
How so? 


17:44.345 --> 17:46.915
Notice verse 15: 


17:46.915 --> 17:50.785
“Moreover, 
if your brother commits a sin, 


17:50.785 --> 17:54.457
“go and reveal his fault 
between you and him alone. 


17:54.457 --> 17:58.294
If he listens to you, 
you have gained your brother.”


17:58.293 --> 18:02.296
Here Jesus says, 
“if your brother commits a sin.” 


18:02.297 --> 18:04.700
That is much different
 than just having 


18:04.700 --> 18:06.768
“something against [us].” 


18:06.768 --> 18:10.705
We are talking about a situation 
that is much more serious. 


18:10.705 --> 18:12.707
What situation? 


18:12.707 --> 18:15.644
The revised 
Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will book, 


18:15.643 --> 18:17.678
page 136, explains 


18:17.678 --> 18:21.416
that it “involves financial 
or property matters, 


18:21.417 --> 18:23.752
“such as failing to repay a loan 


18:23.752 --> 18:25.787
“or committing fraud. 


18:25.787 --> 18:28.390
“Or the offense 
might be slander, 


18:28.390 --> 18:31.000
which seriously affects 
someone’s reputation.” 


18:32.393 --> 18:34.830
Of course, 
they are sins that could be resolved


18:34.830 --> 18:36.965
between the individuals concerned 


18:36.965 --> 18:39.167
but are also serious enough 


18:39.167 --> 18:43.000
to merit expulsion 
from the congregation if not settled.


18:44.205 --> 18:47.142
Before we start applying 
Matthew 18:15, 


18:47.142 --> 18:50.345
we should first consider 
whether it is really necessary 


18:50.345 --> 18:52.347
to pursue the matter. 


18:52.347 --> 18:55.017
Could we simply 
forgive the individual 


18:55.017 --> 18:57.619
for what was done 
or even take the loss 


18:57.618 --> 19:00.155
if it were a financial matter? 


19:00.155 --> 19:03.458
That is a personal decision.


19:03.458 --> 19:05.926
If we decide to pursue the matter, 


19:05.927 --> 19:07.930
what do we do? 


19:07.930 --> 19:10.932
Jesus helps us in verse 15, 
when he says 


19:10.932 --> 19:12.935
that we reveal his fault 


19:12.935 --> 19:15.470
between the two of us alone. 


19:15.470 --> 19:18.207
We do not discuss 
the matter with others, 


19:18.207 --> 19:21.210
attempting to get them 
to side with us. 


19:21.210 --> 19:23.212
We do not go 
straight to the elders 


19:23.212 --> 19:26.415
and try to get them 
to solve the problem for us. 


19:26.415 --> 19:30.152
No, we try to resolve
the matter between us. 


19:30.152 --> 19:33.355
And since our goal 
is to settle the difference, 


19:33.355 --> 19:36.057
maintain our relationship 
with Jehovah, 


19:36.057 --> 19:38.527
and help our brother do the same, 


19:38.527 --> 19:41.730
we make repeated efforts 
to speak with him 


19:41.730 --> 19:44.967
when our initial efforts 
are unsuccessful. 


19:44.967 --> 19:47.769
Keep in mind 
that Jesus did not say: 


19:47.768 --> 19:50.000
“Go only once 
and reveal his fault.”


19:52.908 --> 19:55.376
When applying this first step, 
make it clear 


19:55.377 --> 19:58.314
that your motive 
is to ‘gain your brother.’ 


19:58.313 --> 20:00.915
Also, it would be helpful 
to clearly state 


20:00.915 --> 20:04.185
that you are applying 
the first step in settling differences 


20:04.185 --> 20:07.622
as outlined by Jesus 
at Matthew 18:15. 


20:07.622 --> 20:11.227
Of course, 
this would be stated in a kindly, 


20:11.227 --> 20:13.229
nonthreatening manner 


20:13.228 --> 20:15.830
but still in a way 
to show the seriousness 


20:15.830 --> 20:18.000
of getting the matter settled.


20:19.133 --> 20:21.135
What if the first step 


20:21.135 --> 20:24.000
in gaining your brother
is unsuccessful? 


20:25.140 --> 20:28.243
Notice verse 16 explains step 2: 


20:28.243 --> 20:30.711
“But if he does not listen, 


20:30.712 --> 20:32.982
“take along with you 
one or two more, 


20:32.982 --> 20:36.719
“so that on the testimony 
of two or three witnesses 


20:36.718 --> 20:39.721
every matter 
may be established.”


20:39.722 --> 20:43.092
Yes, we talk with him 
in the company of one or two more. 


20:43.092 --> 20:45.827
Would that be our best friends? 


20:45.827 --> 20:46.962
No. 


20:46.962 --> 20:49.632
The whole purpose 
is to ‘gain our brother.’ 


20:49.632 --> 20:52.167
Teaming up with two 
of our best friends 


20:52.167 --> 20:54.302
could alienate our brother. 


20:54.302 --> 20:56.705
Instead, it makes sense 


20:56.705 --> 21:00.042
that we would choose 
other mature Christians. 


21:00.042 --> 21:03.045
How would mature Christians 
be helpful? 


21:03.045 --> 21:06.247
Well, are we 
misunderstanding things? 


21:06.247 --> 21:09.517
Could they help him 
to reason about the matter? 


21:09.517 --> 21:12.387
Could a solution be found? 


21:12.387 --> 21:15.790
Having spiritually
mature witnesses there 


21:15.790 --> 21:18.260
may help to resolve the matter. 


21:18.260 --> 21:20.795
Generally, applying steps 1 


21:20.795 --> 21:22.998
and 2 will result 
in gaining your brother 


21:22.998 --> 21:25.000
and preserving the peace 
of the congregation.


21:27.735 --> 21:31.005
If he does not respond 
to these repeated efforts 


21:31.005 --> 21:33.575
to help him, then what? 


21:33.575 --> 21:36.000
You have a decision to make. 


21:37.078 --> 21:39.480
Are you willing 
to forgive your brother, 


21:39.480 --> 21:43.000
even take a loss 
if a financial matter is involved? 


21:44.118 --> 21:46.955
If you choose 
to pursue the matter further, 


21:46.955 --> 21:49.090
listen to Jesus’ words recorded 


21:49.090 --> 21:51.092
at verse 17: 


21:51.092 --> 21:53.995
“If he does not listen to them, 


21:53.995 --> 21:56.063
“speak to the congregation. 


21:56.063 --> 21:59.400
“If he does not listen 
even to the congregation, 


21:59.400 --> 22:02.737
“let him be to you 
just as a man of the nations 


22:02.737 --> 22:05.074
and as a tax collector.”


22:05.073 --> 22:07.941
At this point, 
the body of elders 


22:07.942 --> 22:11.347
representing the congregation 
will get involved. 


22:11.347 --> 22:14.482
They will review 
the facts of the case and determine 


22:14.482 --> 22:17.552
if a judicial committee 
should be appointed. 


22:17.552 --> 22:21.357
Happily, though, 
these situations are rare, 


22:21.357 --> 22:23.892
and matters 
are often resolved peacefully 


22:23.892 --> 22:26.000
before reaching 
such a serious point.


22:27.962 --> 22:31.900
Think back again 
to that heartfelt prayer to Jehovah. 


22:31.900 --> 22:35.703
Has Jehovah heard 
our sincere requests? 


22:35.703 --> 22:37.905
Will he forgive? 


22:37.905 --> 22:39.908
Well, at this moment, 


22:39.908 --> 22:43.245
if you realize there is a difference 
with your brother 


22:43.245 --> 22:45.247
that needs to be settled, 


22:45.247 --> 22:47.549
pray to Jehovah about the matter. 


22:47.548 --> 22:49.550
Ask him to help you see 


22:49.550 --> 22:52.753
beyond the emotion 
and make peace. 


22:52.753 --> 22:56.000
Do not let any more time go by!


22:57.925 --> 23:01.328
Once we have followed 
the simple steps outlined by Jesus 


23:01.328 --> 23:03.331
and have forgiven others, 


23:03.332 --> 23:05.534
the condition has been met; 


23:05.533 --> 23:07.935
the price has been paid. 


23:07.935 --> 23:10.338
Then what will Jehovah 
do for us? 


23:10.338 --> 23:12.340
Jesus said: 


23:12.340 --> 23:14.743
‘He will also forgive us.’ 


23:14.743 --> 23:18.080
As a result, 
we will gain the peace of mind 


23:18.080 --> 23:20.615
that comes with a clean conscience, 


23:20.615 --> 23:24.218
knowing that we have 
Jehovah’s favor and blessing. 


23:24.218 --> 23:27.588
We can then 
make a valuable contribution 


23:27.588 --> 23:30.458
to the beautiful, 
united brotherhood 


23:30.458 --> 23:33.000
that we are privileged 
to be a part of.


23:34.528 --> 23:38.200
There are more lessons 
in Matthew chapter 18 


23:38.200 --> 23:42.703
that teach us how to maintain peace 
and unity with our brothers. 


23:42.703 --> 23:46.475
Just as important 
as settling differences, 


23:46.475 --> 23:50.645
Jesus cautioned against becoming 
a cause for stumbling. 


23:50.645 --> 23:53.315
At a Bethel morning worship, 


23:53.315 --> 23:55.317
Brother Stephen Lett described 


23:55.317 --> 23:59.187
three ways 
we can avoid stumbling others.


23:59.187 --> 24:01.222
Now, this word picture 


24:01.222 --> 24:03.459
of someone being stumbled 


24:03.458 --> 24:05.460
is quite vivid, isn’t it? 


24:05.460 --> 24:07.528
We’ve all seen someone stumbled. 


24:07.528 --> 24:10.998
In fact, we’ve all stumbled 
ourselves at times, 


24:10.998 --> 24:14.936
and there are varying degrees 
of consequences. 


24:14.937 --> 24:17.672
For example, 
a person can stumble, 


24:17.672 --> 24:19.674
quickly recover, 


24:19.673 --> 24:23.411
and continue 
almost uneventfully down the path. 


24:23.412 --> 24:26.014
Or a person can stumble, 


24:26.013 --> 24:28.416
fall, break a bone, 


24:28.417 --> 24:30.619
eventually they recover


24:30.618 --> 24:33.288
—but only after extensive therapy. 


24:33.288 --> 24:35.890
Then again, a person can stumble, 


24:35.890 --> 24:39.427
fall, hit his head, 
never recover


24:39.427 --> 24:42.097
—becoming a casualty. 


24:42.097 --> 24:44.565
Well, the situation is similar 


24:44.565 --> 24:47.368
when one is stumbled spiritually. 


24:47.368 --> 24:49.770
He can recover quickly, 


24:49.770 --> 24:52.173
maybe recover over time, 


24:52.173 --> 24:54.308
or he may never recover


24:54.308 --> 24:57.211
—becoming a spiritual casualty. 


24:57.212 --> 25:01.149
So we cannot know 
the ultimate outcome 


25:01.148 --> 25:03.218
for someone who is stumbled. 


25:03.218 --> 25:05.886
So no wonder we’re cautioned 
to be very careful 


25:05.887 --> 25:09.757
to never be any cause 
for stumbling.


25:09.757 --> 25:12.427
Open up 
to Matthew chapter 18, 


25:12.427 --> 25:15.497
and here’s 
an especially powerful scripture 


25:15.497 --> 25:17.499
in this regard. 


25:17.498 --> 25:19.733
Matthew 18:6, Jesus says: 


25:19.733 --> 25:23.271
“But whoever stumbles 
one of these little ones 


25:23.272 --> 25:25.474
“who have faith in me, 


25:25.473 --> 25:28.876
“it would be better for him 
to have hung around his neck 


25:28.877 --> 25:32.214
“a millstone 
that is turned by a donkey 


25:32.213 --> 25:36.183
and to be sunk in the open sea.” 


25:36.183 --> 25:39.453
Well, with graphic language, 


25:39.453 --> 25:43.225
Jesus describes 
how that if we cause someone 


25:43.225 --> 25:45.560
to become a spiritual casualty, 


25:45.560 --> 25:47.828
we could actually bring 
eternal doom 


25:47.828 --> 25:49.830
upon ourselves. 


25:49.830 --> 25:51.833
But now, here’s a question, 


25:51.833 --> 25:55.370
What could we do 
to cause someone to stumble? 


25:55.370 --> 25:58.507
Well, interestingly, 
there are several similarities 


25:58.507 --> 26:01.309
between causing someone 
to stumble physically 


26:01.308 --> 26:04.178
and causing someone 
to stumble spiritually.


26:04.178 --> 26:06.313
Let us discuss three. 


26:06.313 --> 26:09.850
Now one, pushing someone 


26:09.850 --> 26:11.853
could cause them to stumble, 


26:11.853 --> 26:16.023
especially if they’re on uneven terrain, 
if you think about it. 


26:16.023 --> 26:20.261
And this is true 
physically and spiritually. 


26:20.262 --> 26:22.430
But think about Jehovah 
for a moment. 


26:22.430 --> 26:24.732
He could push any of us, 
couldn’t he? 


26:24.732 --> 26:27.002
He could force us to serve him. 


26:27.002 --> 26:30.939
He certainly has the power, 
but he never uses it that way. 


26:30.938 --> 26:33.875
Instead, he invites, he encourages; 


26:33.875 --> 26:35.943
and he explains the blessings, 


26:35.943 --> 26:38.946
the curses, 
depending upon how we decide. 


26:38.947 --> 26:40.415
But it’s up to us, isn’t it? 


26:40.415 --> 26:43.485
For example, at Isaiah 48:18, 


26:43.485 --> 26:46.553
Jehovah says: ‘If only 


26:46.553 --> 26:49.623
‘you would pay attention 
to my commandments! 


26:49.623 --> 26:53.628
‘Then your peace 
would become like a river 


26:53.628 --> 26:57.765
and your righteousness 
like the waves of the sea.’ 


26:57.765 --> 27:01.102
Beseeching, but not forcing. 


27:01.102 --> 27:03.339
Now think about it, 
if Jehovah doesn’t force, 


27:03.338 --> 27:05.606
he doesn’t want us 
to force either, does he? 


27:05.607 --> 27:08.075
For example, parents 


27:08.075 --> 27:10.912
need to be very careful 
they don’t just simply push 


27:10.912 --> 27:12.980
their children to serve Jehovah. 


27:12.980 --> 27:14.983
But rather, lovingly, 


27:14.983 --> 27:17.051
beseechingly like Jehovah, 


27:17.052 --> 27:19.087
try to reach the heart, 
and of course, 


27:19.087 --> 27:21.122
clearly show them the blessings 


27:21.122 --> 27:23.325
that will come their way 
if they do.


27:23.325 --> 27:24.993
Another example, 


27:24.993 --> 27:28.796
elders should never try 
to push Jehovah’s sheep. 


27:28.797 --> 27:32.300
I heard an experience 
about an elder, during his part, 


27:32.300 --> 27:35.137
asked the brothers 
for a show of hands 


27:35.137 --> 27:37.805
how many were going out in service 
the next morning. 


27:37.805 --> 27:40.408
Well, only a few raised their hand. 


27:40.408 --> 27:43.411
He proceeded 
to scold the congregation 


27:43.412 --> 27:45.747
that more should be going out. 


27:45.747 --> 27:48.282
Well, he then unwisely asked


27:48.282 --> 27:50.285
for another show of hands. 


27:50.285 --> 27:53.053
You guessed it
—fewer raised their hand 


27:53.053 --> 27:55.056
the second time. 


27:55.057 --> 27:57.092
Take another example, 


27:57.092 --> 27:59.627
those who conduct Bible studies 


27:59.627 --> 28:03.030
should not just try to push 
their students to do the right thing. 


28:03.030 --> 28:06.600
“You’ve got to quit smoking! 
You’ve got to get rid of those idols!” 


28:06.600 --> 28:09.137
No, not with external pressure, 


28:09.137 --> 28:11.740
but by motivating their hearts, 


28:11.740 --> 28:14.408
you motivate your students.


28:14.408 --> 28:16.643
Or take another example, 
none of us 


28:16.643 --> 28:20.115
should try to push schoolmates, 
workmates, or relatives 


28:20.115 --> 28:22.117
to accept the truth. 


28:22.117 --> 28:24.919
A pushing approach, 


28:24.918 --> 28:28.790
shoving approach
—even though motivated with sincerity—


28:28.790 --> 28:30.992
has actually resulted 
in people being stumbled 


28:30.992 --> 28:33.194
away from the truth 
for many years. 


28:33.193 --> 28:36.330
It makes me think of the story, 
or the saying, 


28:36.330 --> 28:39.000
that when a person 
first learns the truth, 


28:39.000 --> 28:41.803
you should lock them up 
for about six months 


28:41.803 --> 28:44.771
to contain, or minimize, 
the damage they do. 


28:44.772 --> 28:46.975
Well, that saying is totally erroneous. 


28:46.975 --> 28:50.000
You shouldn’t lock that brother up; 
you should follow that brother. 


28:51.980 --> 28:53.982
See, that brother has zeal, 
doesn’t he? 


28:53.982 --> 28:56.417
But it’s true, 
we probably do need to help him 


28:56.417 --> 28:58.420
to properly channel that zeal, 


28:58.420 --> 29:01.923
so that he doesn’t try 
to force his relatives 


29:01.923 --> 29:04.025
or others to accept the truth 


29:04.025 --> 29:06.762
that he is so excited about.


29:06.762 --> 29:09.497
But now, what is the second thing 


29:09.497 --> 29:13.367
we can do to cause someone 
to stumble? 


29:13.367 --> 29:17.305
Placing an obstacle in their path. 


29:17.305 --> 29:21.108
Now again, this is true 
physically or spiritually. 


29:21.108 --> 29:23.143
And if you think about it, 


29:23.143 --> 29:27.081
whether we put 
that stumbling block there intentionally 


29:27.082 --> 29:30.552
or unintentionally, 
the result is the same, isn’t it? 


29:30.552 --> 29:33.420
As mentioned 
in today’s Watchtower comments, 


29:33.420 --> 29:36.157
wholesome speech and upright conduct 


29:36.157 --> 29:38.159
can help us to avoid 


29:38.158 --> 29:40.661
ever being a cause for stumbling. 


29:40.662 --> 29:43.264
In contrast, unwholesome speech, 


29:43.263 --> 29:45.266
unclean conduct, 


29:45.267 --> 29:47.335
can easily stumble ones inside 


29:47.335 --> 29:49.403
or outside the congregation. 


29:49.403 --> 29:51.705
But now, what about in an area 


29:51.705 --> 29:54.775
where we have a Scriptural right 
to do something? 


29:54.775 --> 29:57.645
Now, surely exercising that right, 


29:57.645 --> 29:59.647
if it stumbles someone, 


29:59.647 --> 30:02.250
we can’t be held accountable 
for that, can we? 


30:02.250 --> 30:05.287
Well, open up 
to 1 Corinthians chapter 8, 


30:05.287 --> 30:08.455
and here
—very interestingly—


30:08.455 --> 30:10.925
this scripture 
answers that question. 


30:10.925 --> 30:14.528
1 Corinthians 8:9, 


30:14.528 --> 30:17.165
it says: 
“But keep watching 


30:17.165 --> 30:20.768
“that your right to choose 


30:20.768 --> 30:22.903
“does not somehow 


30:22.903 --> 30:26.006
become a stumbling block 
to those who are weak.” 


30:26.007 --> 30:28.009
Isn’t that interesting? 


30:28.008 --> 30:30.010
Even our right to choose, 


30:30.010 --> 30:32.147
if it would stumble someone, 


30:32.147 --> 30:35.350
we wouldn’t exercise that right 
according to this scripture. 


30:35.350 --> 30:38.953
The apostle Paul, 
in verse 13 of that same chapter, 


30:38.953 --> 30:41.956
he said he 
wouldn’t even eat meat ever again 


30:41.957 --> 30:44.025
if it stumbled his brother. 


30:44.025 --> 30:46.027
Well, like Paul, 
are we willing 


30:46.027 --> 30:48.630
to forgo our rights regarding, 


30:48.630 --> 30:50.832
for example, 
wearing a beard, 


30:50.832 --> 30:53.100
wearing heavy makeup, 


30:53.100 --> 30:57.038
using alcohol
—as just a few examples—


30:57.038 --> 30:59.106
if exercising that right 


30:59.107 --> 31:02.177
might even possibly stumble someone?


31:02.177 --> 31:04.179
But now, 
what’s the third way 


31:04.178 --> 31:06.713
we could cause someone to stumble? 


31:06.713 --> 31:09.316
Failing to warn him 


31:09.317 --> 31:11.852
about a potential trip hazard. 


31:11.852 --> 31:14.589
We could call this 
the sin of omission. 


31:14.588 --> 31:18.325
And again, 
it applies physically and spiritually. 


31:18.325 --> 31:21.328
As a physical example, 
let’s say we see the floor 


31:21.328 --> 31:23.363
has just been mopped, 


31:23.363 --> 31:26.166
and an unsuspecting person 


31:26.167 --> 31:28.770
is approaching that wet area. 


31:28.770 --> 31:30.772
Now will we warn them? 


31:30.772 --> 31:33.909
If we don’t warn them
—they fall, hurt themselves—


31:33.908 --> 31:37.045
would we not share 
some responsibility? 


31:37.045 --> 31:39.047
Well, similarly, 


31:39.047 --> 31:41.349
with spiritual application, 


31:41.348 --> 31:44.551
Galatians 6:1 tells us 


31:44.552 --> 31:47.689
that if someone “takes a false step” 
before he’s aware of it, 


31:47.688 --> 31:50.023
what are we supposed 
to try to do? 


31:50.023 --> 31:52.826
“Try to readjust” such a person, 


31:52.827 --> 31:55.162
but then it adds: 
“In a spirit of mildness.” 


31:55.162 --> 31:56.999
Don’t push him! 


31:56.998 --> 32:00.635
But try to gently, lovingly warn 


32:00.635 --> 32:02.837
and readjust that person.


32:02.837 --> 32:05.307
So there we have three areas 


32:05.307 --> 32:08.509
in which we must be careful 
we never contribute 


32:08.508 --> 32:10.878
toward someone being stumbled. 


32:10.878 --> 32:14.281
We don’t push others 
to serve Jehovah. 


32:14.282 --> 32:16.985
We strive to never, 


32:16.985 --> 32:19.153
even unintentionally, 


32:19.153 --> 32:22.090
put a stumbling block in their path
—for example—


32:22.090 --> 32:25.960
by insisting on exercising 
our personal rights. 


32:25.960 --> 32:29.897
And number three, 
we never fail to lovingly warn 


32:29.897 --> 32:32.767
one whom we see approaching 


32:32.767 --> 32:35.637
a potential trip hazard. 


32:35.637 --> 32:39.307
Rather than being 
any cause for stumbling, 


32:39.307 --> 32:41.909
we want to be 
a force for good, don’t we? 


32:41.908 --> 32:44.378
Helping others to stand firm 


32:44.378 --> 32:48.115
and even helping ones get up 
if they have fallen.


32:48.115 --> 32:51.718
None of us want to cause 
our brother to stumble, 


32:51.718 --> 32:54.521
but it can happen 
if we’re not careful. 


32:54.522 --> 32:56.524
Why not recall the three ways 


32:56.523 --> 32:59.660
Brother Lett listed 
to avoid stumbling others? 


32:59.660 --> 33:02.930
You can then examine 
how you’re doing as a parent, 


33:02.930 --> 33:05.333
an elder, a Bible teacher, 


33:05.333 --> 33:08.000
or as a fellow worshipper 
in the congregation. 


33:09.303 --> 33:13.106
The effort we make toward unity 
is always worthwhile. 


33:13.107 --> 33:15.175
We want only joyful memories 


33:15.175 --> 33:17.845
of the years spent 
working side by side 


33:17.845 --> 33:20.047
with our brothers and sisters. 


33:20.047 --> 33:23.384
That’s the way 
Sister Esther Lozano looks back 


33:23.383 --> 33:28.000
on 73 years 
of special full-time service.


33:29.190 --> 33:32.760
Well, everybody here 
calls me Honey, but my name 


33:32.760 --> 33:34.628
is Esther Lozano. 


33:34.628 --> 33:38.098
And I was born in Fresno, California, 


33:38.098 --> 33:40.368
in 1919. 


33:40.368 --> 33:44.605
I was baptized in 1935, 


33:44.605 --> 33:48.575
and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed 
my service to Jehovah. 


33:48.575 --> 33:51.745
I became a special pioneer, 


33:51.745 --> 33:54.915
and then they called me to Gilead. 


33:54.915 --> 33:58.652
I was in the fourth class of Gilead. 


33:58.652 --> 34:01.822
That was in 1944. 


34:01.822 --> 34:04.992
When I left my assignment as a special, 


34:04.992 --> 34:09.597
I didn’t even know how it was to study, 
but this was beautiful 


34:09.597 --> 34:13.434
how Gilead prepared us 
for what was in the future. 


34:13.433 --> 34:15.836
Right after Gilead, 


34:15.837 --> 34:19.274
we went to Brooklyn Bethel for two years


34:19.273 --> 34:21.575
—Esther Lopez and I—


34:21.575 --> 34:23.812
then I was sent to Mexico.


34:23.812 --> 34:28.082
I came in 1947, 
and I’m still here. 


34:28.082 --> 34:33.789
So that makes more than 68 years 
I’ve been in Mexico. 


34:33.788 --> 34:37.291
When I arrived,
there were 7 Bethelites, 


34:37.292 --> 34:39.294
and there were 22 missionaries. 


34:39.293 --> 34:41.295
We all lived right at the branch; 


34:41.295 --> 34:43.832
it was a branch-missionary home. 


34:43.832 --> 34:46.267
The progress in Mexico 


34:46.267 --> 34:50.939
really is because of the families 
being united. 


34:50.938 --> 34:55.643
And when you get 
the husband and wife together, 


34:55.643 --> 34:59.000
then the whole family 
comes in the truth.


35:00.682 --> 35:04.685
In 1961, Sister Esther Lozano 
preached to our grandparents. 


35:04.685 --> 35:06.853
My grandfather first got interested 


35:06.853 --> 35:09.290
through the book
From Paradise Lost to Paradise Regained.


35:09.290 --> 35:10.357
When I placed the book 


35:10.357 --> 35:13.194
with his wife
and she gave it to him, 


35:13.193 --> 35:17.131
he decided that that’s what 
he was looking for. 


35:17.132 --> 35:21.469
He said, 
“Well, when can I be baptized?”


35:21.468 --> 35:23.703
Three visits later, 


35:23.703 --> 35:26.040
a study was started
with the entire family.


35:26.040 --> 35:29.643
And the oldest son was only 13. 


35:29.643 --> 35:31.645
He said, 
“I’m getting baptized too!” 


35:31.645 --> 35:35.082
About a year ago, he came 


35:35.082 --> 35:39.587
and brought me a letter 
and told me how happy he was 


35:39.587 --> 35:42.924
that I had gone to their home 


35:42.923 --> 35:45.893
and preached to them. 


35:45.893 --> 35:49.363
And that was 
a happy experience of my life.


35:49.363 --> 35:50.731
Today, in our family, 


35:50.732 --> 35:53.767
we are 23 Witnesses 
spread over four generations, 


35:53.767 --> 35:56.070
and now my brother 
and I are serving here


35:56.070 --> 35:58.000
at the Central America branch.


35:59.540 --> 36:01.708
Oh, I forgot to talk about my husband. 


36:01.708 --> 36:04.611
He was the branch overseer at that time. 


36:04.612 --> 36:08.917
We were there 
in the same branch for five years. 


36:08.917 --> 36:11.885
We got to know each other, 
but I didn’t pay attention to him 


36:11.885 --> 36:14.922
because I was always in the service. 


36:14.922 --> 36:18.192
And so,
I don’t know when he decided 


36:18.192 --> 36:20.762
he wanted to get married 
because I know 


36:20.762 --> 36:22.930
that wasn’t his goal in life. 


36:22.930 --> 36:24.698
And so I wrote Brother Knorr 


36:24.698 --> 36:27.735
and asked him if he was surprised 


36:27.735 --> 36:29.737
to hear that we 
were going to be married. 


36:29.737 --> 36:31.439
Then he did write me back 


36:31.438 --> 36:35.810
and also said, 
well this is what he said in the letter: 


36:35.810 --> 36:39.247
‘You’re always jolly 
and talkative when I’m around. 


36:39.247 --> 36:40.314
‘On the other hand, 


36:40.313 --> 36:43.150
‘Brother Lozano is so quiet. 


36:43.150 --> 36:47.555
‘I must say,
it is an interesting combination. 


36:47.555 --> 36:51.158
‘Both of you together 
can serve him and aid 


36:51.158 --> 36:53.160
one another in your true worship.’ 


36:53.160 --> 36:57.632
This is one of my greatest treasures, 


36:57.632 --> 37:00.400
having that letter from Brother Knorr.


37:00.400 --> 37:03.938
Then when Rudy died, 


37:03.938 --> 37:06.773
I didn’t dwell on that. 


37:06.773 --> 37:09.910
I remembered 
I made my dedication to Jehovah, 


37:09.910 --> 37:12.447
and I know that he would want me


37:12.447 --> 37:14.449
to put that first in my life. 


37:14.448 --> 37:18.285
So I did not really suffer 


37:18.285 --> 37:20.353
that much about his death 


37:20.353 --> 37:23.190
because I became even more involved 


37:23.190 --> 37:27.000
in theocratic activities.


37:29.330 --> 37:31.598
I’m in the Correspondence. 


37:31.598 --> 37:36.103
But I’m at work 
about an hour and a half in the morning 


37:36.103 --> 37:39.106
and an hour and a half 
in the afternoon 


37:39.107 --> 37:41.509
and the rest of the time 


37:41.508 --> 37:44.278
I’m studying here in the room. 


37:44.278 --> 37:46.613
I’m so pleased that I’m still able 


37:46.613 --> 37:49.116
to go to the morning text, 


37:49.117 --> 37:52.787
and I have a part in the service. 


37:52.787 --> 37:57.000
I have two studies 
that I conduct every week.


38:00.493 --> 38:03.330
It’s such a pleasure
to be with people 


38:03.330 --> 38:07.000
that have dedicated
their lives to Jehovah. 


38:08.002 --> 38:10.404
And that’s what makes me happy 
because I know 


38:10.403 --> 38:12.673
Jehovah counts them 


38:12.673 --> 38:16.000
as his precious sons and daughters.


38:18.878 --> 38:20.648
I don’t know why, 


38:20.648 --> 38:22.383
but many of the missionaries 


38:22.383 --> 38:24.018
have come up to me and told me 


38:24.018 --> 38:26.220
that I’ve been 
an encouragement to them, 


38:26.220 --> 38:29.557
and really, 
they are the ones that encourage me. 


38:29.557 --> 38:33.194
It’s because I had 
such beautiful examples 


38:33.193 --> 38:37.531
to follow in all these years.


38:37.532 --> 38:41.202
And all I can say 
is thanks to Jehovah 


38:41.202 --> 38:45.000
for this great privilege 
of serving him.


38:52.713 --> 38:55.248
Sister Lozano is a beautiful example 


38:55.248 --> 38:57.518
of sticking to your assignment 
and building 


38:57.518 --> 38:59.920
close bonds of friendship. 


38:59.920 --> 39:03.057
Did you notice 
another blessing she enjoyed? 


39:03.057 --> 39:05.059
It was finding a marriage mate 


39:05.058 --> 39:08.461
who shared her goals 
for full-time service.


39:08.462 --> 39:12.265
Of course, 
not every courtship leads to marriage. 


39:12.265 --> 39:16.003
If you’re dating, 
can you look past your emotions 


39:16.003 --> 39:18.471
to honestly see the differences 


39:18.472 --> 39:21.275
and flaws 
in your potential mate? 


39:21.275 --> 39:23.343
Can you accept these? 


39:23.343 --> 39:25.345
Or are they serious enough 


39:25.345 --> 39:27.548
for you to end your courtship? 


39:27.548 --> 39:30.150
That’s the situation 
depicted in the third 


39:30.150 --> 39:32.352
and final part of the series 


39:32.352 --> 39:35.000
Preparing for Marriage.


39:37.825 --> 39:41.095
Well, the big day finally arrived.


39:41.095 --> 39:43.763
After all those months of preparation, 


39:43.763 --> 39:46.500
it was just as I imagined.


39:46.500 --> 39:48.168
Oh wait! 


39:48.168 --> 39:50.703
That’s not me.


39:50.703 --> 39:52.000
That’s me.


39:58.612 --> 40:02.000
As I watched my sister 
get married that day, 


40:08.122 --> 40:12.000
I couldn’t help 
but think about my own future.


40:20.233 --> 40:23.000
When I began dating Shane, 


40:24.572 --> 40:27.000
everything was perfect.


40:49.630 --> 40:52.000
We spent a lot of time 
talking on the phone.


41:05.178 --> 41:09.000
Everything just naturally 
seemed to click.


41:25.632 --> 41:29.000
I was convinced he was the one.


41:42.315 --> 41:47.000
But over time, 
I started to notice some things.


41:59.667 --> 42:02.000
I was starting to see patterns.


42:24.392 --> 42:28.000
And they didn’t seem 
to be getting better.


42:56.590 --> 43:00.000
I wasn’t even sure 
our goals were the same anymore.


43:12.707 --> 43:15.000
I felt alone. 


43:21.248 --> 43:24.000
But thankfully, I wasn’t.


43:31.458 --> 43:34.861
My mom kindly asked 
how things were going, 


43:34.862 --> 43:37.699
so I told her.


43:37.698 --> 43:41.301
“Maybe he’s not the one,” 
I told her.


43:41.302 --> 43:43.770
I thought she was going to tell me 


43:43.770 --> 43:47.307
which way I should go, 
but she didn’t. 


43:47.307 --> 43:49.977
Instead, she reassured me 


43:49.977 --> 43:53.000
that if he wasn’t the one, 
I was going to be OK.


44:17.003 --> 44:21.000
They reminded me about what Jesus said 
when building a tower. 


44:23.577 --> 44:26.914
“For example, who of you 
wanting to build a tower 


44:26.913 --> 44:30.183
“does not first sit down 
and calculate the expense 


44:30.183 --> 44:33.986
to see if he has enough 
to complete it?”


44:33.987 --> 44:38.525
I realized that I was about to enter 
into a building project of my own


44:38.525 --> 44:40.527
—my relationship with Shane—


44:40.527 --> 44:43.230
and I too needed 
to “calculate the expense” 


44:43.230 --> 44:45.832
before I commit to it.


44:45.832 --> 44:48.402
They encouraged me 
to talk to Shane 


44:48.402 --> 44:52.000
and tell him about the things 
that were concerning me.


44:56.210 --> 44:59.000
So I did.


45:04.785 --> 45:07.187
And my mom was right. 


45:07.187 --> 45:10.724
I was OK, more than OK, really.


45:10.723 --> 45:14.000
Shane and I decided it was best 
to break off the relationship.


45:19.365 --> 45:21.033
And some years later,


45:21.033 --> 45:25.000
I found someone 
that loves Jehovah as much as I do, 


45:27.507 --> 45:30.000
and I love him with my whole heart.


45:35.148 --> 45:37.316
Our sister wisely compared 


45:37.317 --> 45:40.054
her relationship 
to a building project. 


45:40.053 --> 45:42.221
She “calculated the expense” 


45:42.222 --> 45:44.959
of any traits she saw 
during their courtship


45:44.958 --> 45:48.761
—well before they 
could become problems in a marriage. 


45:48.762 --> 45:50.897
Of course, 
we shouldn’t expect 


45:50.897 --> 45:52.934
perfection from our mate, 


45:52.933 --> 45:55.701
but working through matters 
during courtship 


45:55.702 --> 45:58.372
is another opportunity 
that Jehovah provides 


45:58.372 --> 46:01.775
to settle differences in peace.


46:01.775 --> 46:04.645
There’s something common 
to every successful marriage 


46:04.645 --> 46:06.680
between two Christians. 


46:06.680 --> 46:08.882
It is their putting Jehovah first 


46:08.882 --> 46:12.485
and supporting 
each other’s personal dedication to God. 


46:12.485 --> 46:16.088
This is certainly true 
with Viv and Ann Mouritz, 


46:16.088 --> 46:19.025
serving 
in the Australasia branch. 


46:19.025 --> 46:22.228
They’ve been married
for 65 years 


46:22.228 --> 46:25.231
and have 
a combined 131 years 


46:25.232 --> 46:27.300
in full-time service. 


46:27.300 --> 46:30.303
Listen to their advice 
for younger ones 


46:30.303 --> 46:34.000
deciding what to do 
in Jehovah’s organization.


46:35.275 --> 46:38.812
I started pioneering 
in November 1948. 


46:38.812 --> 46:40.814
That’s a while ago now. 


46:40.813 --> 46:44.000
And that’s what I thought 
I would do—pioneer.


46:47.153 --> 46:51.000
So I said, “Well, Jehovah, 
if I do what you ask me, 


46:52.292 --> 46:54.360
“I accept whatever assignment 
you give me,


46:54.360 --> 46:56.430
“and I’ll just go 
where you send me, 


46:56.430 --> 46:59.465
and I won’t seek an assignment, 
but I won’t refuse one.” 


46:59.465 --> 47:02.002
That’s all I intended to do 
as far as I knew, 


47:02.002 --> 47:04.337
but then I had only been pioneering 
about a year 


47:04.337 --> 47:06.474
when I got this envelope, 
and the letter said: 


47:06.473 --> 47:08.875
“Please fill in the enclosed form.” 


47:08.875 --> 47:11.077
It was an application for Bethel, 
and I thought, 


47:11.077 --> 47:13.080
‘Goodness, I didn’t think of Bethel. 


47:13.080 --> 47:17.000
I told Jehovah I’d go where he sent me, 
so don’t argue, just do it.’


47:18.952 --> 47:22.422
I was working in the printery 
cleaning out old ink tins 


47:22.422 --> 47:25.225
and making schedules 
for printing and so on. 


47:25.225 --> 47:28.295
And then I got to work 
on the press too, 


47:28.295 --> 47:32.000
but I wasn’t there very long 
when they moved me to the office.


47:34.568 --> 47:36.770
Well, you learn a lot in Bethel. 


47:36.770 --> 47:38.772
You learn how to live 
with your brothers, 


47:38.772 --> 47:40.774
which you’re not used to. 


47:40.773 --> 47:44.000
You learn about Jehovah’s organization
—you see how it operates. 


47:45.578 --> 47:49.000
I had the privilege of working alongside 
brothers who had lots of experience.


47:51.485 --> 47:54.688
I got assigned 
to Metropolitan Congregation. 


47:54.688 --> 47:56.690
That’s where Ann was.


47:56.690 --> 47:59.727
Yeah, we got married 
in October 1951, 


47:59.727 --> 48:01.729
and two weeks later, 


48:01.728 --> 48:04.000
I started pioneering.


48:05.698 --> 48:09.670
I was 20 at that time 
when we started circuit work, 


48:09.670 --> 48:12.538
and I’d only pioneered for a year; 


48:12.538 --> 48:15.041
so of course I was very worried 


48:15.042 --> 48:18.879
and scared about having to witness 
with sisters 


48:18.878 --> 48:22.000
that had pioneered for years 
and some of them even of the anointed. 


48:23.817 --> 48:26.000
I cried halfway to Melbourne.


48:27.753 --> 48:30.556
We got very close 
to the brothers and sisters 


48:30.557 --> 48:33.560
and especially to the children, 
so we really loved that.


48:33.560 --> 48:36.863
And then we 
got the opportunity to go


48:36.863 --> 48:39.198
to New York 
to the international convention 


48:39.198 --> 48:41.000
in 1958. 


48:42.602 --> 48:45.205
When the Society found out 
we were going, they sent us 


48:45.205 --> 48:48.342
an application for Gilead, 
and we thought, ‘Oh, my goodness. 


48:48.342 --> 48:51.579
How can we do that?’ 


48:51.578 --> 48:55.000
So we said, 
“Well, we don’t say no.”


48:56.215 --> 48:58.552
After the ‘58 convention, 


48:58.552 --> 49:01.087
we were assigned to special pioneer 


49:01.087 --> 49:03.290
in Canada for six months. 


49:03.290 --> 49:05.425
Brother Knorr said 
we were in cold storage, 


49:05.425 --> 49:07.560
so there were about 40 of us 


49:07.560 --> 49:09.863
from British Commonwealth countries. 


49:09.863 --> 49:12.431
So that was a good experience too. 


49:12.432 --> 49:16.470
We saw winter for the first time. 
I did, anyway.


49:16.470 --> 49:19.873
And we took pictures 
of snow and ice and icicles 


49:19.873 --> 49:23.000
to show in our assignment when we 
got into India or Africa or somewhere. 


49:24.343 --> 49:27.000
And Jehovah had a sense of humor; 
he sent us to Finland.


49:29.582 --> 49:31.785
Well, the schooling you get from Gilead 


49:31.785 --> 49:33.787
or the other schools 


49:33.787 --> 49:36.255
helps you to see Jehovah’s organization 


49:36.255 --> 49:39.000
and how it works.


49:40.527 --> 49:43.864
We didn’t know a lot about Finland 
except that we knew it was cold 


49:43.863 --> 49:46.000
and clean 


49:49.202 --> 49:51.237
and a long way from Australia.


49:51.237 --> 49:55.000
Being so far from Australia, 


49:56.008 --> 49:58.011
we knew that we 
wouldn’t be able to get home 


49:58.012 --> 50:02.000
to see our families, 
not for a long, long time.


50:04.752 --> 50:07.087
When we moved into Finland, 
the brothers 


50:07.087 --> 50:10.657
in Russia and those countries 
were under ban. 


50:10.657 --> 50:12.659
They needed spiritual food, 


50:12.658 --> 50:15.000
and so it had to be supplied to them. 


50:16.228 --> 50:19.365
So we used to send people in as tourists, 
and they would meet 


50:19.365 --> 50:22.000
the brothers there 
and deliver the food to them.


50:24.170 --> 50:26.840
Without Jehovah’s blessing 
and his spirit, 


50:26.840 --> 50:29.242
we couldn’t have done it at all. 


50:29.242 --> 50:32.979
It’s amazing to think 
that the amount of spiritual food 


50:32.978 --> 50:35.981
that got in there, 
they translated it, 


50:35.982 --> 50:38.052
and they made it available. 


50:38.052 --> 50:40.054
And we did that for over 20 years 


50:40.053 --> 50:42.255
without any mishaps. 


50:42.255 --> 50:45.692
It couldn’t happen 
without Jehovah’s blessing.


50:45.692 --> 50:47.827
Leaving Finland was not easy, 
of course. 


50:47.827 --> 50:49.629
We had mixed feelings, 


50:49.628 --> 50:52.531
but, actually, 
I saw Jehovah’s hand 


50:52.532 --> 50:54.434
in the assignment 


50:54.433 --> 50:57.470
because we really got back 
to Australia 


50:57.470 --> 50:59.740
at a time when my parents 
were needing help, 


50:59.740 --> 51:02.808
so we didn’t have to leave Bethel 


51:02.808 --> 51:05.845
or full-time service 
to give that help.


51:05.845 --> 51:08.582
We were asked 
to go to Russia in 1999. 


51:08.582 --> 51:11.985
That turned out 
to be two and a half years.


51:11.985 --> 51:14.387
I was a little apprehensive 
about going to Russia, 


51:14.387 --> 51:17.657
but it was really one of the most 
memorable assignments 


51:17.657 --> 51:19.000
we’ve ever had.


51:20.327 --> 51:23.730
In Russia, the brothers 
were not used to house-to-house work 


51:23.730 --> 51:26.000
because of all the years under ban. 


51:27.633 --> 51:30.036
And that was quite different 
because you go to the door; 


51:30.037 --> 51:32.339
you can’t just strike up a conversation. 


51:32.338 --> 51:34.340
The person wants to know 
why you are there. 


51:34.340 --> 51:35.742
And you can’t make 


51:35.742 --> 51:37.744
a return visit on someone 
you met on the street


51:37.743 --> 51:39.745
—well, you don’t know 
where he lives. 


51:39.745 --> 51:42.615
If you’ve called at his house, you do, 
and you can make a return visit. 


51:42.615 --> 51:45.018
The brothers saw 
the advantage of that. 


51:45.018 --> 51:48.355
But they had to learn. 
It was a new thing. 


51:48.355 --> 51:51.492
Circuit overseers had to learn 
how to visit congregations, 


51:51.492 --> 51:55.229
and Polish brothers came in 
and helped a lot with that


51:55.228 --> 51:59.398
—did circuit work—
but they too had to learn. 


51:59.398 --> 52:01.400
So it was a big change for them 


52:01.400 --> 52:04.137
to come from working 
under ban all their lives 


52:04.137 --> 52:07.000
to now working the way 
the rest of the world does.


52:10.477 --> 52:12.512
The best decision I ever made 


52:12.512 --> 52:14.780
was to put my life 
in Jehovah’s hands, 


52:14.780 --> 52:16.850
and to say, “You decide 


52:16.850 --> 52:19.000
where I go and what I do.” 


52:20.187 --> 52:23.524
I’ve had the feeling all along, 
and it’s proven true so far, 


52:23.523 --> 52:25.525
that everything I have done 


52:25.525 --> 52:28.495
has been training for something else. 


52:28.495 --> 52:30.630
So, what I’m doing now 
is still training. 


52:30.630 --> 52:32.732
It must be for the new world
because I haven’t got 


52:32.732 --> 52:34.800
much time left in this one. 


52:34.800 --> 52:37.000
What will it be? 
Well, who knows?


52:41.107 --> 52:43.377
So my recommendation 
to everyone is: 


52:43.377 --> 52:45.379
Don’t decide for yourself. 


52:45.378 --> 52:48.000
Let Jehovah do it.


52:50.150 --> 52:52.752
Brother and Sister Mouritz 
always looked to Jehovah 


52:52.752 --> 52:54.754
for their assignments. 


52:54.753 --> 52:57.223
For Brother Mouritz, 
that’s meant serving 


52:57.223 --> 53:00.193
on the Branch Committees 
in Finland, India, 


53:00.193 --> 53:02.628
Russia, Poland, Ukraine, 


53:02.628 --> 53:04.630
and Australasia 


53:04.630 --> 53:06.633
and the privilege of making visits 


53:06.633 --> 53:08.635
to more than 70 countries 


53:08.635 --> 53:12.772
as a representative 
of world headquarters. 


53:12.772 --> 53:15.375
We can certainly pursue 
any form of service 


53:15.375 --> 53:17.443
that our circumstances allow. 


53:17.443 --> 53:20.446
But when we pray 
for Jehovah’s direction, 


53:20.447 --> 53:22.449
we rely on him to send us 


53:22.448 --> 53:24.716
where it benefits his organization 


53:24.717 --> 53:27.120
and ourselves the most.


53:27.120 --> 53:29.855
The willing spirit 
to do Jehovah’s will 


53:29.855 --> 53:32.058
is shared by Bethelites 
who have received 


53:32.058 --> 53:34.393
new assignments in the field. 


53:34.393 --> 53:36.830
Adjustments in the work at Bethel 


53:36.830 --> 53:40.000
have put greater emphasis 
on the preaching work. 


53:40.000 --> 53:42.002
More resources, 


53:42.002 --> 53:44.870
including experienced Bible teachers, 


53:44.870 --> 53:48.040
are being directed 
to the busy harvest. 


53:48.040 --> 53:51.077
In this report 
from the South Africa branch, 


53:51.077 --> 53:53.079
we hear from loyal ones 


53:53.078 --> 53:56.548
who are supporting theocratic direction.


53:56.548 --> 54:00.620
On September 23, 2015, 
it was announced 


54:00.620 --> 54:04.790
at all branches that 
the Governing Body was requesting 


54:04.790 --> 54:08.995
all Bethel families to reduce in size.


54:08.995 --> 54:10.330
For me personally, 


54:10.330 --> 54:11.732
when they made that announcement 


54:11.732 --> 54:13.334
on Wednesday, September 23, 


54:13.333 --> 54:14.968
that was exciting. 


54:14.968 --> 54:15.935
It was—


54:15.935 --> 54:17.503
I knew it was momentous.


54:17.503 --> 54:19.505
When the announcement was made, 


54:19.505 --> 54:20.807
tears welled up in my eyes


54:20.807 --> 54:22.309
because I realized how close we are


54:22.308 --> 54:23.343
to the end. 


54:23.343 --> 54:24.910
And I remember just closing my eyes 


54:24.910 --> 54:25.945
and saying to Jehovah, 


54:25.945 --> 54:27.180
“Whatever you want, we’ll do.”


54:27.180 --> 54:30.350
When I received news of my reassignment, 


54:30.350 --> 54:32.352
initially I was numb.


54:32.352 --> 54:33.987
When I got the news 


54:33.987 --> 54:35.855
about my reassignment, 


54:35.855 --> 54:38.625
I was so scared in the beginning.


54:38.625 --> 54:40.793
It caught me off guard. 


54:40.793 --> 54:42.361
I wasn’t expecting it.


54:42.362 --> 54:45.965
We were quite shocked and sad, 


54:45.965 --> 54:49.702
but we were encouraged by the brothers 


54:49.702 --> 54:52.205
at Bethel and also in the congregation.


54:52.205 --> 54:54.107
The direction from the Governing Body


54:54.107 --> 54:56.475
was that we were being reassigned 


54:56.475 --> 54:57.977
as regular pioneers. 


54:57.977 --> 55:02.815
We signed the forms for pioneering 
that very Thursday.


55:02.815 --> 55:07.153
For me, I’ve always appreciated 
the scripture at 1 Samuel 12:22 


55:07.153 --> 55:09.288
where it states there: 
“For the sake of his great name, 


55:09.288 --> 55:11.390
Jehovah will not abandon his people.”


55:11.390 --> 55:14.227
I don’t want to forget my Bethel time,


55:14.227 --> 55:15.529
because it was lovely, 


55:15.528 --> 55:17.163
but I want to stretch forward ahead 


55:17.163 --> 55:18.731
to pioneering and really enjoy it.


55:18.732 --> 55:21.567
We prayed specifically for a place 


55:21.567 --> 55:24.470
that is going to help us 
to be as simple


55:24.470 --> 55:28.508
as possible so that we can focus 
our attention to the ministry.


55:28.508 --> 55:32.145
All that I’d love to say 
to everyone who has been reassigned 


55:32.145 --> 55:34.813
is that Jehovah is our Father, 


55:34.813 --> 55:37.983
and he will never relinquish 
his responsibility as a Father. 


55:37.983 --> 55:40.053
He will take care of us.


55:40.053 --> 55:42.021
We are losing four couples 


55:42.022 --> 55:43.990
from our congregation. 


55:43.990 --> 55:45.992
And I would like to tell 


55:45.992 --> 55:48.829
the congregations 
where they have been assigned to 


55:48.828 --> 55:51.063
that they are getting 
real spiritual people 


55:51.063 --> 55:53.766
and that they are 
really going to be an asset 


55:53.767 --> 55:56.069
to their congregation.


55:56.068 --> 55:58.070
I just want to also thank 


55:58.070 --> 56:00.507
the brothers in the congregation 
where we are going to 


56:00.507 --> 56:03.577
because they organized 
secular work for us 


56:03.577 --> 56:06.579
and also, as Bonnie mentioned, 
accommodation. 


56:06.578 --> 56:08.848
So they made it easier for us 


56:08.848 --> 56:11.250
to look forward to our assignment. 


56:11.250 --> 56:14.353
But we know this, 
of course, comes from Jehovah.


56:14.353 --> 56:16.621
And so the Branch Committee said, 


56:16.622 --> 56:18.625
“Well, we have to move quickly with this.” 


56:18.625 --> 56:19.725
We asked the family,


56:19.725 --> 56:22.428
“Please, give us two, 
three weeks to work things out,” 


56:22.428 --> 56:24.696
and that is what they appreciated. 


56:24.697 --> 56:26.599
Congregations phoned in. 


56:26.598 --> 56:29.235
The Bethelites were offered jobs. 


56:29.235 --> 56:31.070
They were offered accommodation.


56:31.070 --> 56:33.473
Our congregation is delighted 


56:33.473 --> 56:36.041
having two young Bethelites


56:36.042 --> 56:37.077
coming and joining us. 


56:37.077 --> 56:40.647
Our congregation 
has quite a number of young people. 


56:40.647 --> 56:41.915
We can already see that 


56:41.915 --> 56:44.317
it’s going to benefit them quite a lot. 


56:44.317 --> 56:46.252
We’ve actually assisted them 


56:46.252 --> 56:48.254
in getting a place 
where they could stay, 


56:48.253 --> 56:50.290
and also we’ve assisted them 
to settle in


56:50.290 --> 56:52.792
and be part of the congregation.


56:52.792 --> 56:54.427
Welcome to our new home! 


56:54.427 --> 56:56.329
We’ve been here
a little over a week now.


56:56.328 --> 56:58.765
The brothers helped 
to paint the house, 


56:58.765 --> 57:02.135
to put tiles on, 
to clean the entire place. 


57:02.135 --> 57:04.737
So they really did 
a lot of work in our behalf.


57:04.737 --> 57:07.107
Also, memories 
of our friends from Bethel.


57:07.107 --> 57:09.275
It was about six months ago 


57:09.275 --> 57:10.643
when we enjoyed pioneer school.


57:10.643 --> 57:14.346
Thanks to our brothers, 
we were able to find employment.


57:14.347 --> 57:16.515
Jehovah has been 
answering our prayers,


57:16.515 --> 57:18.952
and sometimes 
he has been answering 


57:18.952 --> 57:21.654
our concerns 
even before we even pray about it.


57:21.653 --> 57:23.155
No doubt, 


57:23.155 --> 57:26.158
these extraordinary experiences 
in South Africa 


57:26.158 --> 57:29.661
are mirrored all over the world. 


57:29.662 --> 57:32.965
The love we show 
to each other is a reflection 


57:32.965 --> 57:36.202
of Jehovah’s great love 
for each of us, 


57:36.202 --> 57:39.139
and we thank him to be a part 


57:39.138 --> 57:42.000
of this amazing brotherhood.


57:46.245 --> 57:48.682
The Governing Body 
deeply appreciates 


57:48.682 --> 57:52.385
the brotherhood’s loyal response 
to theocratic direction. 


57:52.385 --> 57:54.687
Change is not always easy, 


57:54.687 --> 57:57.357
but it helps when we look 
at Jehovah’s blessing 


57:57.357 --> 57:59.359
on new spiritual provisions 


57:59.358 --> 58:01.626
and adjustments to the work.


58:01.627 --> 58:04.497
Letters of appreciation 
from our brothers 


58:04.497 --> 58:06.632
add to the Governing Body’s confidence 


58:06.632 --> 58:10.337
that Jehovah 
is directing his organization. 


58:10.337 --> 58:15.040
A sister from the United States 
wrote this about JW Broadcasting, 


58:15.040 --> 58:17.543
“Often the programming seems like 


58:17.543 --> 58:20.346
a direct answer to a prayer.” 


58:20.347 --> 58:24.817
After a particularly difficult day, 
she added: 


58:24.817 --> 58:29.222
“What did I find today at home 
for me like a present from Jehovah? 


58:29.222 --> 58:34.000
The March [2016] broadcast 
. . . dealing with discouragement.” 


58:35.762 --> 58:39.632
After watching 
the January 2016 broadcast, 


58:39.632 --> 58:42.202
a family from Austria wrote: 


58:42.202 --> 58:46.705
‘Our eldest son is serving 
in the branch in Selters, Germany. 


58:46.705 --> 58:50.843
‘We are very proud of him, 
but we terribly miss him. 


58:50.843 --> 58:54.980
‘So we love the new song, 
“I Give You My Best.” 


58:54.980 --> 58:57.717
‘It’s heartwarming 
that you know our feelings 


58:57.717 --> 59:00.052
and value our offers.’


59:00.052 --> 59:02.555
Jehovah is certainly giving us 


59:02.555 --> 59:05.225
what we need 
when we need it. 


59:05.225 --> 59:08.427
And it comes to us 
in such variety. 


59:08.427 --> 59:11.564
This next music video, 
for example, 


59:11.563 --> 59:15.235
fits well with our discussion 
on settling differences. 


59:15.235 --> 59:18.605
It begins with a situation 
between a young mother 


59:18.605 --> 59:21.473
and her mother-in-law 
and reminds us


59:21.473 --> 59:24.000
to “Forgive One Another.”


59:38.123 --> 59:50.536
Yes, you had the best of intentions.
Kindnesses too numerous to mention.


59:50.537 --> 59:55.575
But thoughtless words 
just cut me to the heart.


59:55.575 --> 1:00:05.285
Then, as a tear appears, I see.
Things aren’t what they seem to be.


1:00:05.285 --> 1:00:17.263
Before the sun slips from the sky,
Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.


1:00:17.263 --> 1:00:24.000
We’ll forget the things we said,
And, please, let’s forgive.


1:00:25.372 --> 1:00:31.844
Sisters today, sisters we’ll stay.


1:00:31.843 --> 1:00:44.556
Getting along is not always easy.
Angry words can bring you down, believe me.


1:00:44.557 --> 1:00:53.867
Then you find a reason to forgive,
And now you realize it’s true;


1:00:53.867 --> 1:00:59.039
Letting go’s the thing to do.


1:00:59.038 --> 1:01:11.250
Before the sun slips from the sky,
Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.


1:01:11.250 --> 1:01:18.892
We’ll forget the things we said,
And, please, let’s forgive.


1:01:18.892 --> 1:01:25.097
Brothers today, brothers we’ll stay.


1:01:25.097 --> 1:01:37.810
Not one thing said or done can break us up. 
Love’s a bond of unity.


1:01:37.810 --> 1:01:48.922
Cancel the debt; forgive and forget.
That’s the way true friendship should be.


1:01:48.922 --> 1:02:01.200
Before the sun slips from the sky,
Let’s be sure we both see eye to eye.


1:02:01.200 --> 1:02:08.975
We’ll forget the things we said,
And, please, let’s forgive.


1:02:08.975 --> 1:02:15.000
Here in our hearts, that’s where it starts.


1:02:22.422 --> 1:02:32.000
Bonded in love, forgiving one another.


1:02:36.302 --> 1:02:39.105
Did you see two critical areas 


1:02:39.105 --> 1:02:41.240
where we need to be forgiving? 


1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:44.977
It was in the family 
and in the congregation. 


1:02:44.977 --> 1:02:46.979
We’ll always have reasons 


1:02:46.978 --> 1:02:49.448
in this imperfect world 
to forgive. 


1:02:49.448 --> 1:02:51.850
Look for the opportunities 
in your life 


1:02:51.850 --> 1:02:54.987
to imitate Jehovah 
and forgive others.


1:02:54.987 --> 1:02:56.989
As we conclude our program, 


1:02:56.988 --> 1:02:59.725
we take you on a visit 
to world headquarters 


1:02:59.725 --> 1:03:01.727
in Warwick, New York. 


1:03:01.727 --> 1:03:03.997
The Bethel family 
has been moving 


1:03:03.997 --> 1:03:06.132
into their new work areas. 


1:03:06.132 --> 1:03:09.302
More than 25,000 brothers 
and sisters 


1:03:09.302 --> 1:03:12.139
worked on the construction 
of the facility. 


1:03:12.138 --> 1:03:16.075
It was a united effort 
by temporary volunteers, 


1:03:16.075 --> 1:03:20.012
construction servants, 
Bethelites, construction groups, 


1:03:20.012 --> 1:03:22.349
and volunteers 
who previously worked 


1:03:22.348 --> 1:03:24.750
on Kingdom Hall projects. 


1:03:24.750 --> 1:03:27.153
Earlier this year, 
workers were making 


1:03:27.153 --> 1:03:29.155
final preparations for the arrival 


1:03:29.155 --> 1:03:32.625
of world headquarters staff. 


1:03:32.625 --> 1:03:35.227
When open for tours, 
visitors will enjoy 


1:03:35.227 --> 1:03:37.364
the historic Bible display, 


1:03:37.363 --> 1:03:40.966
a visual history exhibit 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


1:03:40.967 --> 1:03:43.235
and an interactive museum 


1:03:43.235 --> 1:03:47.407
explaining how Jehovah directs 
his organization today. 


1:03:47.407 --> 1:03:49.642
We thank Jehovah for all 


1:03:49.642 --> 1:03:52.645
who helped to complete 
the new world headquarters. 


1:03:52.645 --> 1:03:55.782
That includes 
the thousands of volunteers 


1:03:55.782 --> 1:03:58.517
but also the millions 
of you dear brothers and sisters 


1:03:58.517 --> 1:04:01.087
who support the worldwide work 


1:04:01.087 --> 1:04:03.522
with your regular donations. 


1:04:03.522 --> 1:04:06.192
We send you our love 
and pray for Jehovah 


1:04:06.192 --> 1:04:08.527
to bless 
our united brotherhood. 


1:04:08.527 --> 1:04:10.530
From Brooklyn, New York, 


1:04:10.530 --> 1:04:24.695
this is JW Broadcasting!
