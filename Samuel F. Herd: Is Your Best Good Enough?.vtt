In addressing our theme

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:06.189 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Is Your Best Good Enough?”

00:00:06.189 --> 00:00:09.893 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to start by reading Galatians 6:4.

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:13.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “But let each one

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“examine his own actions,

00:00:15.865 --> 00:00:18.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then he will have cause for rejoicing

00:00:18.401 --> 00:00:20.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in regard to himself alone,

00:00:20.904 --> 00:00:24.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not in comparison with the other person.”

00:00:25.041 --> 00:00:27.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re told to “examine [our] own actions.”

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:32.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So ask yourself: ‘How am I doing spiritually?

00:00:32.482 --> 00:00:36.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I happy with my attendance
at Christian meetings?

00:00:36.152 --> 00:00:41.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I participate
by sharing meaningful comments as able?

00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:44.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How about my personal study of the Bible?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Let me examine
my involvement in the ministry.

00:00:48.231 --> 00:00:52.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Could I do better in preparing
for my return visits?

00:00:52.902 --> 00:00:56.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I conduct any Bible studies
with interested ones?

00:00:56.973 --> 00:01:01.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, am I content with what I am doing?’

00:01:01.644 --> 00:01:04.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, you’re asking yourself,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is my best good enough?’

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:13.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might see others in the congregation
that are doing more than we are.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:17.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then we look back at Galatians 6:4 again,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it clearly said

00:01:19.596 --> 00:01:24.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I should not compare
myself with the other person.

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:28.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we could quickly assume
that we’re doing what we can,

00:01:28.605 --> 00:01:32.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reasoning that it’s good enough.

00:01:32.742 --> 00:01:37.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s not forget
the first part of the verse.

00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:41.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are to “examine [our] own actions.”

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:45.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to compare what we are doing

00:01:45.755 --> 00:01:49.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what we personally could be doing.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be active

00:01:51.528 --> 00:01:54.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not become
self-satisfied and overconfident.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 10:12
provides this warning:

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So let the one who thinks he is standing

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beware that he does not fall.”

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you may say: ‘I’m doing my best!

00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:12.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What more can I do?’

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:17.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a good look at your best—scrutinize it.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Examine very closely all you’re doing
with the time that you have.

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:28.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can mundane activity be replaced
with theocratic activity?

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you see?

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:32.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your best good enough?

00:02:32.936 --> 00:02:36.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be; it may not be.

00:02:36.773 --> 00:02:39.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It depends on one’s outlook.

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:42.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some examples?

00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:47.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A runner in a race—he practices; trains;

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:52.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eats the right things;
keeps a lean, healthy body;

00:02:53.523 --> 00:02:57.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wears the best running shoes; and so forth.

00:02:57.694 --> 00:03:00.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives his best

00:03:00.063 --> 00:03:03.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but loses the race to someone faster.

00:03:03.666 --> 00:03:07.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His best was not good enough.

00:03:07.103 --> 00:03:09.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:03:09.105 --> 00:03:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was compared to
whether he was faster than his competitors.

00:03:13.843 --> 00:03:17.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yohan Blake lost to Usain Bolt

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a 100-meter event in 2012

00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:24.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by just a fraction of a second.

00:03:25.021 --> 00:03:29.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did his best,
but his best wasn’t good enough.

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:33.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A mother and daughter

00:03:33.696 --> 00:03:36.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the daughter is
in the second grade at school.

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:40.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She brings home a picture she drew in class.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher had put a <i>B-</i> on the picture.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The daughter shows it to her mother,

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the mother crosses out the <i>B-</i>

00:03:50.246 --> 00:03:52.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and puts an <i>A+</i> on it.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:56.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She then tapes the picture
on the refrigerator.

00:03:58.454 --> 00:04:02.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the difference
between the teacher and the mother?

00:04:03.526 --> 00:04:07.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher compares the student
to other classmates of her age.

00:04:07.997 --> 00:04:11.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mother grades her according to her best,

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in comparison with others.

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:20.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not compare your best
with the best of others.

00:04:21.344 --> 00:04:24.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Psalm 103:14.

00:04:24.647 --> 00:04:28.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah examines
our spiritual accomplishments,

00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:31.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s one of his measuring sticks?

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 103:14:

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For he well knows how we are formed,

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:45.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remembering that we are dust.”

00:04:45.468 --> 00:04:47.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Dust” is used figuratively,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:51.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicating mankind’s frailty and lowliness.

00:04:51.574 --> 00:04:54.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By “remembering that we are dust,”

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never asks more of us
than we can give.

00:04:59.749 --> 00:05:03.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he expects us to obey his commands

00:05:03.953 --> 00:05:07.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the best of our own ability.

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:12.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark 12:30
—you can likely quote it from memory.

00:05:12.962 --> 00:05:14.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 30 says:

00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:18.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:20.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with your whole heart

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:23.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and with your whole soul

00:05:23.773 --> 00:05:26.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and with your whole mind

00:05:26.609 --> 00:05:30.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with your whole strength.”

00:05:30.713 --> 00:05:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This embraces everything we have
—all that we are.

00:05:35.518 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You go in service;

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you use “your whole strength”
to accomplish it.

00:05:41.124 --> 00:05:43.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s commendable.

00:05:43.126 --> 00:05:48.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what good is it to use our whole strength

00:05:48.131 --> 00:05:51.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go in service if our mind

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot direct our tongue

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to say the right things
when we talk to a person?

00:05:58.941 --> 00:06:00.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I used a lot

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of my strength walking

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:06.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘from door to door,
climbing stairs, and so forth.

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And yet, no one let me get past

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:11.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my introduction.’

00:06:11.988 --> 00:06:16.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Question: Was that
the best introduction you could give?

00:06:18.027 --> 00:06:21.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long have you been using
that introduction?

00:06:21.731 --> 00:06:24.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would a new one help?

00:06:24.067 --> 00:06:27.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would using “your whole mind”

00:06:27.103 --> 00:06:29.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of advance preparation

00:06:29.372 --> 00:06:33.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
result in making your best even better?

00:06:33.976 --> 00:06:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you tried to use
some of the introductions

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demonstrated at our midweek meetings

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some of those found
in the <i>Reasoning From the Scriptures</i>  book,

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:46.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pages 9-15?

00:06:47.924 --> 00:06:50.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the householder see

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:52.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your face

00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:53.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she opens the door?

00:06:53.463 --> 00:06:54.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your countenance

00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:57.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
radiating pleasantness and kindness?

00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:02.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does she see good news or bad news?

00:07:02.572 --> 00:07:05.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you look happy or sad?

00:07:05.808 --> 00:07:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The message
we’re commissioned to deliver today

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:12.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the “good news of the Kingdom.”

00:07:12.882 --> 00:07:17.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We expect it to change
sometime in the near future.

00:07:17.019 --> 00:07:21.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do the best you can until you know better.

00:07:21.557 --> 00:07:26.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then when you know better, you can do better.

00:07:27.563 --> 00:07:30.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You attend all congregation meetings

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:33.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pay rapt attention with your mind.

00:07:33.169 --> 00:07:35.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re to be commended.

00:07:35.171 --> 00:07:38.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that all that’s required

00:07:38.107 --> 00:07:41.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love Jehovah with our whole mind?

00:07:41.878 --> 00:07:45.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we meditating on the knowledge

00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:48.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive at our meetings

00:07:48.451 --> 00:07:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to draw close to Jehovah?

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:54.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 4:8 says:

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:59.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Draw close to God,
and he will draw close to you.”

00:07:59.896 --> 00:08:04.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s one benefit we receive
from our meeting attendance.

00:08:06.135 --> 00:08:09.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Hebrews 10:24, 25.

00:08:13.876 --> 00:08:17.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is another benefit
of regular meeting attendance.

00:08:17.413 --> 00:08:21.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, we give
and receive encouragement.

Verses 24 and 25 read:

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:29.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And let us consider one another

00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:34.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so as to incite to love and fine works,

00:08:34.163 --> 00:08:37.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not forsaking our meeting together,

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:39.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as some have the custom,

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but encouraging one another,

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:44.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all the more so

00:08:44.006 --> 00:08:47.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you see the day drawing near.”

00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:50.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you give comments at meetings?

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:53.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they well-prepared?

00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:57.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do they encourage your brothers and sisters?

00:08:57.286 --> 00:08:59.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you giving your best?

00:08:59.655 --> 00:09:03.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, then your best is good enough.

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about your personal study

00:09:07.463 --> 00:09:09.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or family worship?

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:13.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you doing your best?

00:09:13.469 --> 00:09:14.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your best good enough?

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:21.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I read all <i>The Watchtowers</i>  and <i>Awakes! </i>
when they come out,” you say.

00:09:21.244 --> 00:09:24.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It goes without saying that that’s good.

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:28.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you find in what you read

00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:33.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will deepen your love
and appreciation for Jehovah

00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:37.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw you closer to him?

00:09:37.126 --> 00:09:40.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you use your whole mind

00:09:40.796 --> 00:09:44.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meditate and continue to think about it,

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:48.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus spiking it down deep into your heart?

00:09:48.904 --> 00:09:50.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some things we learn

00:09:50.906 --> 00:09:54.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may not be immediately applicable

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:57.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but can be regurgitated

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and applied later as needed.

00:10:01.183 --> 00:10:03.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you giving serious attention

00:10:03.352 --> 00:10:06.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the spiritual needs
of your wife and children?

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:11.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you have family worship most weeks.

00:10:11.427 --> 00:10:13.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s commendable.

00:10:13.629 --> 00:10:15.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you prepare well for it

00:10:15.798 --> 00:10:20.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just throw something together
at the last minute?

00:10:20.169 --> 00:10:23.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if your wife
just threw something on the table 

00:10:23.773 --> 00:10:25.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for dinner each evening

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without giving any thought
to the health needs of the family?

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:35.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think: Is your best good enough?

00:10:36.752 --> 00:10:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can slop a pig, and he’ll enjoy it.

00:10:40.356 --> 00:10:45.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But give the same garbage
to a cow, and she’ll ignore it.

00:10:45.328 --> 00:10:47.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are we considering

00:10:47.363 --> 00:10:50.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is Your Best Good Enough?”

00:10:50.566 --> 00:10:53.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s only as a reminder

00:10:53.803 --> 00:10:58.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at what we think to be our best

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in what we’re doing
for ourselves, our families,

00:11:02.144 --> 00:11:05.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:11:05.514 --> 00:11:09.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, our best is not compared

00:11:09.685 --> 00:11:13.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the best of another brother or sister.

00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:16.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah knows

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:18.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re doing our best.

00:11:18.861 --> 00:11:23.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is a righteous and fair Judge.

00:11:23.299 --> 00:11:26.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our knowledge, even of ourself,

00:11:26.502 --> 00:11:30.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be faulty because of inherited sin.

00:11:30.306 --> 00:11:32.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, it’s wisdom on our part

00:11:32.541 --> 00:11:35.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep examining ourselves

00:11:35.077 --> 00:11:38.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see where we might improve.

00:11:38.547 --> 00:11:41.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is your best good enough?

00:11:41.517 --> 00:11:44.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to think it is.

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?
