00:01.383 --> 00:03.886
Have you enjoyed studying the book 


00:03.887 --> 00:06.724
Imitate Their Faith as much as I have? 


00:06.723 --> 00:09.025
It’s a wonderful book, 
isn’t it? 


00:09.025 --> 00:12.962
And I was particularly captivated 
by the introduction. 


00:12.962 --> 00:15.399
There was a point in the introduction 


00:15.398 --> 00:18.100
that encouraged us 
to use our imagination 


00:18.100 --> 00:20.137
when we’re reading the Bible: 


00:20.137 --> 00:22.772
to see the sights, 
to hear the sounds, 


00:22.772 --> 00:26.744
to smell the aromas, 
to try to capture the feelings 


00:26.743 --> 00:30.046
of the individuals 
that we are reading about. 


00:30.047 --> 00:33.417
Now, of course, we don’t want 
our imagination to run away with us, 


00:33.417 --> 00:35.719
but at the same time, 
we do want to get 


00:35.718 --> 00:39.288
a solid mental picture 
of what we’re reading. 


00:39.288 --> 00:42.091
And that’s what I’d like 
to talk to you about today. 


00:42.092 --> 00:46.964
When you’re reading the Bible, 
try to get the whole picture.


00:46.963 --> 00:51.000
Now we’ll use a couple 
of well-known Bible accounts to illustrate. 


00:53.202 --> 00:58.174
Have you been raised 
in a stepfamily or a blended family? 


00:58.173 --> 01:01.276
If you have, 
did you know that you have 


01:01.277 --> 01:04.747
something in common with Joseph, 
the son of Jacob? 


01:04.747 --> 01:08.852
Joseph was raised 
with ten half brothers 


01:08.852 --> 01:12.389
in a large blended family. 


01:12.388 --> 01:15.958
So now you want to try to view 


01:15.958 --> 01:18.026
this family as a composite. 


01:18.027 --> 01:21.164
You want to try to figure out 
how did people mesh 


01:21.163 --> 01:24.200
or how did they clash 
within this family. 


01:24.200 --> 01:26.202
What would you do? 


01:26.202 --> 01:29.605
Well, you might start by writing down 
some of the characteristics 


01:29.605 --> 01:32.042
of the individual members 
of the family. 


01:32.042 --> 01:35.179
What about Joseph’s half brothers 
and Joseph himself? 


01:35.178 --> 01:37.180
What do you know about them? 


01:37.180 --> 01:41.050
What about Judah, 
Simeon, Levi, 


01:41.050 --> 01:44.853
Dan, Naphtali
—what do you know? 


01:44.853 --> 01:46.856
So write down 
their characteristics, 


01:46.857 --> 01:49.892
and try to figure out 
how they might get along. 


01:49.892 --> 01:53.797
Sometimes there is 
one individual incident 


01:53.797 --> 01:55.799
that’s recorded in the Bible,


01:55.798 --> 01:58.033
but we mustn’t forget:


01:58.033 --> 02:02.271
People’s actions 
have a way of affecting other people. 


02:02.272 --> 02:05.342
So when you read 
about a certain incident in the Bible,


02:05.342 --> 02:09.812
try to imagine who 
might have been affected by that incident.


02:09.812 --> 02:11.514
Take an example. 


02:11.513 --> 02:16.318
In the book of Genesis, 
we read that Jacob’s son Reuben 


02:16.318 --> 02:21.523
committed sexual immorality 
with Bilhah. 


02:21.523 --> 02:24.693
Well, that had an effect 
on other people without doubt. 


02:24.693 --> 02:26.695
Who was Reuben? 


02:26.695 --> 02:29.432
He was Leah’s oldest son. 


02:29.432 --> 02:31.434
Who was Bilhah? 


02:31.433 --> 02:33.435
Rachel’s handmaiden. 


02:33.435 --> 02:36.973
Do you think that there might have been 
a little animosity or tension 


02:36.973 --> 02:40.643
between Leah and Rachel sometimes, 


02:40.643 --> 02:45.348
especially when you consider 
how their marriages started out? 


02:45.348 --> 02:46.950
There may have been. 


02:46.950 --> 02:50.118
And it may be 
that the attitudes of the women 


02:50.118 --> 02:53.890
had some bearing on the attitudes
of their sons as well. 


02:53.890 --> 02:56.960
So you take all of these things 
into consideration. 


02:56.960 --> 03:01.363
Now, Bilhah had two sons, 
Dan and Naphtali. 


03:01.363 --> 03:03.666
How do you think 
they felt when they learned 


03:03.667 --> 03:06.769
that their oldest brother, 
or half brother, 


03:06.768 --> 03:09.738
had committed fornication 
with their mother? 


03:09.738 --> 03:12.008
So there could have been 
tension there. 


03:12.008 --> 03:14.210
And this all goes into the mix 


03:14.210 --> 03:18.380
when we’re considering 
the family as a composite.


03:18.380 --> 03:22.718
Now, do you picture 
Joseph at age 17 


03:22.718 --> 03:27.656
with ten much older half brothers, 
maybe in their 30’s, 


03:27.657 --> 03:30.527
some old enough to be his father? 


03:30.527 --> 03:32.529
Not true. 


03:32.528 --> 03:36.665
The truth is that there was only 
a seven-year age difference 


03:36.665 --> 03:41.470
between Joseph’s oldest brother, 
Reuben, and Joseph himself. 


03:41.470 --> 03:44.173
In fact, 11 of Jacob’s sons 


03:44.173 --> 03:46.943
were born 
during the seven-year period 


03:46.943 --> 03:50.246
when Jacob 
was working for Laban. 


03:50.247 --> 03:53.415
Eleven sons in seven years, 


03:53.415 --> 03:55.418
how is that possible? 


03:55.418 --> 03:59.088
It’s easy, when you remember 
that Jacob had two wives


03:59.088 --> 04:03.025
and two concubines, 
or secondary wives. 


04:03.025 --> 04:05.928
So there didn’t have to be 
a nine-month interval 


04:05.928 --> 04:08.296
between the birth 
of the children. 


04:08.297 --> 04:11.834
In fact, some could have been born 
just about at the same time; 


04:11.833 --> 04:14.403
they could have been 
the same age. 


04:14.403 --> 04:18.875
So when Joseph 
was sold into slavery at age 17, 


04:18.875 --> 04:22.745
his oldest brother 
was no more than 24. 


04:22.745 --> 04:27.617
Some of his brothers were only 
a year or two older than Joseph himself. 


04:27.617 --> 04:30.252
So we’re talking 
about a group of young men 


04:30.252 --> 04:32.889
in their late teens 
and early 20’s, 


04:32.888 --> 04:36.625
and this might explain 
some of the hotheaded reactions 


04:36.625 --> 04:39.000
that some 
of those young men had.


04:40.095 --> 04:42.098
Well, so much for the boys. 


04:42.098 --> 04:44.200
What about their father, Jacob? 


04:44.200 --> 04:46.202
What can we learn about him? 


04:46.202 --> 04:48.204
A lot. 


04:48.203 --> 04:51.006
For one thing, 
he was a spiritual man. 


04:51.007 --> 04:53.810
Now, this is something 
for you young brothers and sisters 


04:53.810 --> 04:56.612
who are contemplating 
marriage to think about. 


04:56.612 --> 04:59.315
Jacob was willing 
to go to any length 


04:59.315 --> 05:03.085
to keep his relationship 
with Jehovah intact. 


05:03.085 --> 05:05.087
Let’s take an example: 


05:05.087 --> 05:09.092
Genesis 29:18. 


05:09.092 --> 05:12.829
You can follow along 
on the screen as I read this. 


05:12.828 --> 05:16.231
And we’re talking 
about marriage here. 


05:16.232 --> 05:18.334
Genesis 29:18.


05:18.333 --> 05:22.171
It says: 
“Jacob had fallen in love with Rachel, 


05:22.172 --> 05:27.210
“so he said: 
‘I am willing to serve you seven years 


05:27.210 --> 05:30.613
for your younger daughter Rachel.’” 


05:30.613 --> 05:32.815
Now what’s the takeaway? 


05:32.815 --> 05:36.152
Jacob didn’t marry 
the first person who came along, 


05:36.152 --> 05:38.154
maybe some pagan woman. 


05:38.153 --> 05:40.956
He didn’t say, 
‘Well, seven years is too long to wait. 


05:40.957 --> 05:44.227
I’m going to find some Philistine woman, 
and I’ll marry her.’ 


05:44.227 --> 05:47.764
He was willing to wait 
so that he could marry someone 


05:47.763 --> 05:51.233
who would join him 
in the worship of Jehovah. 


05:51.233 --> 05:54.370
And you young folks, 
if you are willing to wait, 


05:54.370 --> 05:58.207
you can be sure that you will have 
Jehovah’s blessing as well.


05:58.207 --> 06:02.112
Now Jacob was apparently also 
a bit of a romantic. 


06:02.112 --> 06:04.547
Notice verse 20.


06:04.547 --> 06:08.050
It says: 
“And Jacob served seven years for Rachel,” 


06:08.050 --> 06:10.052
but notice this, 


06:10.052 --> 06:13.924
“but in his eyes 
they were like just a few days


06:13.923 --> 06:16.391
because of his love for her.”


06:16.392 --> 06:18.000
Now, isn’t that poetic? 


06:19.528 --> 06:22.498
Jacob may have learned 
to treasure his wife 


06:22.498 --> 06:25.801
by observing his parents, 
Isaac and Rebekah. 


06:25.802 --> 06:27.970
It appears that they 
had a strong marriage. 


06:27.970 --> 06:30.005
Just notice what we read 


06:30.005 --> 06:35.812
at Genesis 26:8, 


06:35.812 --> 06:39.000
Genesis 26:8.


06:40.683 --> 06:42.985
It says: 
“After some time had passed, 


06:42.985 --> 06:47.423
“Abimelech king of the Philistines 
was looking out of the window, 


06:47.423 --> 06:50.893
and he saw Isaac,” 
that’s Jacob’s father, 


06:50.893 --> 06:55.865
“displaying affection 
for Rebekah his wife.” 


06:55.865 --> 06:59.235
So it appears 
that Isaac and Rebekah 


06:59.235 --> 07:03.000
had a warm relationship, 
a good marriage.


07:04.440 --> 07:07.110
Now, what else 
can we learn about Jacob? 


07:07.110 --> 07:09.212
There’s an interesting detail recorded 


07:09.212 --> 07:13.282
in chapter 25 and verse 27.


07:13.282 --> 07:17.520
It says: 
“As the boys got bigger, Esau,” 


07:17.520 --> 07:19.188
Jacob’s brother, 


07:19.188 --> 07:22.391
“became a skilled hunter, 
a man of the field, 


07:22.392 --> 07:25.360
“but Jacob was a blameless man, 


07:25.360 --> 07:28.463
dwelling in tents.” 


07:28.463 --> 07:32.668
So Jacob liked to dwell in tents. 


07:32.668 --> 07:36.671
That might explain 
the strong bond that developed 


07:36.672 --> 07:41.000
between Jacob and Joseph, 
who was his youngest for many years.


07:42.378 --> 07:45.481
Now although Jacob 
liked to dwell in tents, 


07:45.482 --> 07:47.850
he was by no means a sissy. 


07:47.850 --> 07:52.822
He was a strong man, 
but he was a spiritual man. 


07:52.822 --> 07:56.092
That’s something 
for you young brothers to take away. 


07:56.092 --> 07:58.560
You want to be strong, 
we know you do, 


07:58.560 --> 08:01.000
but spirituality 
should come first.


08:03.165 --> 08:08.137
One time, spiritual Jacob 
gave his sons a beautiful lesson 


08:08.137 --> 08:11.707
on how to settle 
a difference with a family member. 


08:11.707 --> 08:15.144
We read about it 
at Genesis chapter 32. 


08:15.143 --> 08:19.515
And I think all of us can learn 
from his example. 


08:19.515 --> 08:21.517
We learn at Genesis 32 


08:21.517 --> 08:25.487
that Jacob’s brother, Esau, 
was coming to see him. 


08:25.487 --> 08:28.690
Now, they hadn’t seen 
each other for 20 years, 


08:28.690 --> 08:33.128
and to say that their parting 
had been difficult is an understatement. 


08:33.128 --> 08:37.733
The fact is that when they separated 
more than 20 years earlier, 


08:37.733 --> 08:42.170
Esau had vowed that one day 
he was going to kill his brother; 


08:42.170 --> 08:44.673
now he was coming to see him. 


08:44.673 --> 08:48.376
Now, why was he 
so angry with Jacob? 


08:48.377 --> 08:53.082
It’s because Jacob had received 
a blessing from their father, 


08:53.082 --> 08:56.519
and Esau was not happy. 


08:56.518 --> 08:58.686
So Esau arrives, 


08:58.687 --> 09:01.557
and 400 men are with him. 


09:01.557 --> 09:03.792
Why 400 men? 


09:03.792 --> 09:05.795
Well, the Bible doesn’t say. 


09:05.795 --> 09:07.797
But it could be 
that he was trying to show 


09:07.797 --> 09:11.000
how important and prominent 
he had become. 


09:12.200 --> 09:14.370
How did Jacob react? 


09:14.370 --> 09:16.972
Did he try to go tit for tat? 


09:16.972 --> 09:21.110
Did he try to show how important 
and prominent he had become 


09:21.110 --> 09:23.745
with all of the blessings 
he’d received? 


09:23.745 --> 09:27.450
Did he reopen old wounds? 


09:27.450 --> 09:30.085
Did he argue with his brother? 


09:30.085 --> 09:33.055
Did he say, 
‘You know I was right all along, 


09:33.055 --> 09:35.692
and you, Esau, 
you have been wrong’? 


09:35.692 --> 09:38.727
Did he demand an apology? 


09:38.727 --> 09:40.730
No. 


09:40.730 --> 09:43.365
There was a lot that Jacob 
could have bragged about. 


09:43.365 --> 09:45.300
No question about that. 


09:45.300 --> 09:47.870
There was no doubt that Jacob 
had Jehovah’s blessing. 


09:47.870 --> 09:51.440
Early on, 
we read that an angel of Jehovah 


09:51.440 --> 09:53.508
had appeared to him 
and said: 


09:53.508 --> 09:55.543
“I am Jehovah 


09:55.543 --> 09:59.148
“the God of Abraham your father 
and the God of Isaac. 


09:59.148 --> 10:01.550
“The land on which you are lying, 


10:01.550 --> 10:05.387
“to you I am going to give it 
and to your offspring. 


10:05.387 --> 10:07.857
“I am with you, 


10:07.857 --> 10:10.827
“and I will safeguard you 
wherever you go . . . 


10:10.827 --> 10:14.130
I will not leave you.” 


10:14.130 --> 10:16.198
Well, that’s quite a blessing, 
isn’t it? 


10:16.198 --> 10:18.200
But there’s more. 


10:18.200 --> 10:20.302
For a portion 
of the previous night


10:20.302 --> 10:24.107
—that is, the night before Esau 
and Jacob met up—


10:24.107 --> 10:27.209
Jacob had wrestled with an angel, 


10:27.208 --> 10:28.943
and as a result, 


10:28.943 --> 10:32.000
he had managed 
to receive another blessing. 


10:33.282 --> 10:36.652
But Jacob didn’t flaunt 
his blessings. 


10:36.652 --> 10:39.655
Instead, he humbled himself. 


10:39.655 --> 10:43.792
In fact, he even bowed down 
seven times before his brother 


10:43.792 --> 10:48.999
in front of his wives 
and his 11 sons. 


10:48.998 --> 10:52.835
So Jacob settled 
any lingering difference with Esau 


10:52.835 --> 10:54.903
not with his fists, 


10:54.903 --> 10:58.573
not with a bragging tongue, 
not with a weapon, 


10:58.573 --> 11:01.543
but humbly, 
like a real man


11:01.543 --> 11:04.000
—like a real, spiritual man.


11:06.348 --> 11:10.418
In contrast, 
how did Jacob’s ten sons 


11:10.418 --> 11:13.421
settle their difference 
with Joseph? 


11:13.422 --> 11:15.457
Like a bunch of cowards. 


11:15.457 --> 11:18.694
It was 10 to 1 
against Joseph. 


11:18.693 --> 11:22.296
First, they decided 
to kill their brother, 


11:22.297 --> 11:25.500
and then they delivered him 
up into slavery. 


11:25.500 --> 11:28.970
Those jealous young men 
didn’t learn a thing 


11:28.970 --> 11:32.842
from their father’s 
excellent spiritual example. 


11:32.842 --> 11:36.879
Well, if you’re on the outs 
with a member of your family, 


11:36.878 --> 11:40.315
if you had 
a serious difficulty with someone, 


11:40.315 --> 11:45.020
could you try to settle the matter 
peacefully as Jacob did? 


11:45.020 --> 11:49.358
If the person tries to apologize, 
be gracious about it. 


11:49.358 --> 11:51.760
Don’t make it difficult 
for him to apologize. 


11:51.760 --> 11:53.762
Don’t dredge up 


11:53.762 --> 11:56.932
all of the unnecessary details 
about the past.


11:56.932 --> 11:59.902
You may be in the right, 
as Jacob was, 


11:59.902 --> 12:03.005
but isn’t the important thing 
to make peace? 


12:03.005 --> 12:07.410
Jehovah loves the peacemakers.


12:07.410 --> 12:10.112
Well, what else 
do we learn about Jacob? 


12:10.112 --> 12:13.615
We learn that he wasn’t 
his father’s favorite. 


12:13.615 --> 12:17.000
Let’s look 
at Genesis chapter 25


12:19.355 --> 12:21.823
verse 28.


12:21.823 --> 12:26.228
“And Isaac loved Esau 


12:26.228 --> 12:29.131
“because it meant game in his mouth, 


12:29.132 --> 12:33.635
whereas Rebekah loved Jacob.” 


12:33.635 --> 12:37.573
Now, this story may resonate 
with many of you out there, 


12:37.573 --> 12:40.175
especially if you’ve grown up 
in a large family


12:40.175 --> 12:43.012
or perhaps you’ve had 
a number of brothers and sisters. 


12:43.012 --> 12:45.280
Now, we know 
your parents claim 


12:45.280 --> 12:47.850
that they always treated 
all of you the same, 


12:47.850 --> 12:50.185
that they never ever 
had a preference. 


12:50.185 --> 12:52.187
But ask the kids, 


12:52.187 --> 12:55.024
Was there anyone in the family 
who was the favorite? 


12:55.023 --> 12:57.058
They all know. 
‘She was!’ 


12:57.058 --> 12:58.593
They know this. 


12:58.593 --> 13:03.331
The parents don’t realize it, 
but they are giving preferential treatment. 


13:03.332 --> 13:07.537
And so this happens, 
and it can be disconcerting at times.


13:07.537 --> 13:09.339
Imagine this scenario: 


13:09.338 --> 13:13.308
Imagine that you have a couple 
who have two children, two sons. 


13:13.308 --> 13:15.310
One is a pioneer. 


13:15.310 --> 13:18.847
He has never given his parents 
a moment’s grief. 


13:18.847 --> 13:21.984
The other 
never accepted the truth, 


13:21.983 --> 13:24.653
but he has done well 
in business, 


13:24.653 --> 13:28.956
and as a result, 
he has been generous to his parents, 


13:28.957 --> 13:33.362
and the parents are grateful, 
very grateful. 


13:33.362 --> 13:36.799
And the pioneer 
often hears the parents bragging 


13:36.798 --> 13:41.036
about the successes 
that his brother has had in business. 


13:41.037 --> 13:44.940
Well, the pioneer can’t help 
the parents materially very much, 


13:44.940 --> 13:48.177
and so he feels that there’s 
a bit of partiality there. 


13:48.177 --> 13:50.179
Is it hurtful? 


13:50.178 --> 13:52.346
Yes. 
That is life. 


13:52.347 --> 13:55.817
It’s chemistry. 
It’s just chemistry. 


13:55.817 --> 13:58.254
But the pioneer needs to realize 


13:58.253 --> 14:00.890
that Jehovah God 
appreciates his work. 


14:00.890 --> 14:03.925
His heavenly Father 
loves him very much 


14:03.925 --> 14:06.662
for the work 
that he is doing for His name.


14:06.662 --> 14:09.465
Now, Jacob must have known 


14:09.465 --> 14:12.835
that Isaac loved his brother 
more than he loved him. 


14:12.835 --> 14:15.403
And perhaps he vowed 
that when he had children, 


14:15.403 --> 14:17.405
he would treat them all the same. 


14:17.405 --> 14:21.110
Well, if he did, 
he didn’t keep that promise, did he? 


14:21.110 --> 14:25.000
Everyone knew 
that Joseph was the favorite.


14:26.882 --> 14:31.054
Well, have you noticed what we had to do 
to make a composite of this family? 


14:31.053 --> 14:34.856
We had to read 
from several different chapters of the Bible


14:34.857 --> 14:40.000
—Genesis 25, 26, 28, 29, 32. 


14:41.563 --> 14:44.165
You can’t always get 
a complete picture of an incident 


14:44.165 --> 14:47.570
by reading just one chapter, 
just by reading the chapter you are reading. 


14:47.570 --> 14:52.000
Sometimes you have to extract details 
from other chapters of the Bible.


14:54.310 --> 14:56.812
Now let’s consider 
one more example 


14:56.812 --> 15:00.349
where getting the complete picture 
can enrich our understanding. 


15:00.348 --> 15:02.350
This is going to be 
a shorter one. 


15:02.350 --> 15:05.320
We’re going to consider  
the story of Naaman. 


15:05.320 --> 15:07.488
Now, you remember the story. 


15:07.488 --> 15:10.458
At 2 Kings 5:1, 


15:10.458 --> 15:14.263
we learn that Naaman 
was the chief of the army 


15:14.263 --> 15:18.000
of Ben-hadad II, 
the king of Syria. 


15:18.000 --> 15:20.035
But he was a leper. 


15:20.035 --> 15:23.805
Now Ben-hadad learned 
that there was a prophet in Israel 


15:23.805 --> 15:27.643
Elisha who could heal him 
of his leprosy. 


15:27.643 --> 15:30.745
And so he told Naaman 
that he should go to Israel 


15:30.745 --> 15:33.382
and go to the prophet 
and get healed. 


15:33.382 --> 15:37.352
And so word was sent 
to the king of Israel by letter, 


15:37.352 --> 15:42.290
and the king of Israel was asked 
to send Naaman to Elisha. 


15:42.290 --> 15:45.127
Now, when you think of it, 
this was a strange request 


15:45.127 --> 15:48.964
because Israel and Syria 
were often at odds. 


15:48.963 --> 15:51.433
Sometimes there were 
wars between them, 


15:51.433 --> 15:55.136
and now, here you have 
the king of Syria sending his general, 


15:55.137 --> 15:58.040
the one who is going to head 
the army against Israel, 


15:58.040 --> 16:01.043
and saying: ‘Well, I’d like my general 
to be a more effective general. 


16:01.043 --> 16:03.578
Could you please make sure 
that he gets healed?’ 


16:03.578 --> 16:06.681
Well, somehow, 
he’s sent to Elisha 


16:06.682 --> 16:10.019
and Elisha kindly heals Naaman 


16:10.018 --> 16:14.155
and Naaman becomes 
a worshipper of Jehovah. 


16:14.155 --> 16:16.158
Well, we can imagine, 


16:16.158 --> 16:18.793
remember we’re talking 
about using our imagination, 


16:18.793 --> 16:22.330
we can imagine 
that when Naaman returned to Syria, 


16:22.330 --> 16:27.335
Ben-hadad had lots of nice things 
to say about Elisha. 


16:27.335 --> 16:31.773
So then, everyone lived 
happily ever after, right? 


16:31.773 --> 16:35.310
If we didn’t read on, 
we might think so. 


16:35.310 --> 16:37.813
But that’s not 
the end of the story. 


16:37.813 --> 16:41.383
In the next chapter, 
chapter 6, 


16:41.383 --> 16:46.288
we learn that Ben-hadad 
declared war against Israel. 


16:46.288 --> 16:49.858
Now, if Naaman 
was still the chief of the army, 


16:49.858 --> 16:52.026
he’d be in an awkward position. 


16:52.027 --> 16:54.797
Was he going 
to lead the armies of Syria 


16:54.797 --> 16:57.565
against fellow worshippers 
of Jehovah? 


16:57.565 --> 16:59.868
But it gets worse. 


16:59.868 --> 17:03.771
Ben-hadad learns that Elisha 


17:03.772 --> 17:08.077
is revealing the Syrians’ war strategies 
to the king of Israel, 


17:08.077 --> 17:11.747
so he sends a large army 
to capture Elisha


17:11.747 --> 17:15.617
—the very man who 
had healed his general. 


17:15.617 --> 17:17.987
So much for gratitude. 


17:17.987 --> 17:21.757
Now, it’s interesting 
that Naaman is not mentioned 


17:21.757 --> 17:24.494
as being at the head 
of those armies. 


17:24.493 --> 17:26.595
Did he get out of it somehow? 


17:26.595 --> 17:28.597
Don’t ask me. 


17:28.597 --> 17:31.000
If he’s resurrected, 
you’ll have to ask him.


17:32.300 --> 17:34.537
What lesson can we learn? 


17:34.537 --> 17:38.174
That the gratitude of the world 
is fleeting. 


17:38.173 --> 17:41.810
Some of us may get excited 
if there’s a favorable article 


17:41.810 --> 17:44.312
about Jehovah’s Witnesses 
in a newspaper 


17:44.312 --> 17:48.017
or if some TV personality 
makes a kind statement about us. 


17:48.017 --> 17:50.119
But what did Jehovah God say? 


17:50.118 --> 17:52.153
Genesis 3:15:


17:52.153 --> 17:56.191
“I will put enmity 
between you and the woman.” 


17:56.192 --> 17:59.695
So Jehovah’s organization 
and Satan’s organization 


17:59.695 --> 18:02.000
are always going to be at odds.


18:03.665 --> 18:05.700
Bible reading isn’t a chore. 


18:05.700 --> 18:07.702
It’s a joy. 


18:07.702 --> 18:10.039
Get the whole picture 
of what you’re reading, 


18:10.038 --> 18:12.306
and you’ll enjoy it even more.


18:12.307 --> 18:15.110
We wish you all 
Jehovah’s rich blessing 


18:15.110 --> 18:19.113
as you continue 
to enhance your appreciation 


18:19.113 --> 18:31.843
for this sacred volume.
