00:02.052 --> 00:04.754
You and I make a lot of decisions every day. 


00:04.753 --> 00:07.556
Now, some have a little impact on our lives; 


00:07.557 --> 00:10.227
others have a very big impact. 


00:10.227 --> 00:12.462
And we can appreciate that we can make 


00:12.462 --> 00:15.299
choices and decisions for ourselves. 


00:15.298 --> 00:18.968
Think of how life would be 
if you made no decisions for yourself


00:18.968 --> 00:21.838
—someone tells you when to go to bed,


00:21.838 --> 00:23.840
they pick out your clothes, 


00:23.840 --> 00:25.842
and they tell you what to do for work. 


00:25.842 --> 00:27.744
Well, none of us would like that!


00:27.743 --> 00:31.313
Jehovah gave each of us free will, 


00:31.313 --> 00:33.416
and that’s the precious gift 


00:33.417 --> 00:35.919
of making choices for ourselves. 


00:35.918 --> 00:39.221
Now, have you ever thought 
about why Jehovah gave us this gift? 


00:39.222 --> 00:41.992
I mean, 
why trust us with free will 


00:41.992 --> 00:45.895
when he knew that we could make 
bad choices or decisions? 


00:45.895 --> 00:49.032
Well, one powerful reason is love. 


00:49.032 --> 00:52.235
The only way to give us the gift of love 


00:52.235 --> 00:55.172
is also to give us the gift of free will. 


00:55.172 --> 00:57.240
The two are tied together. 


00:57.240 --> 01:00.910
You really can’t have 
one without the other.


01:00.910 --> 01:03.880
For example, 
if I programmed my computer 


01:03.880 --> 01:06.348
to give me a message 
every day at 2:00 p.m.: 


01:06.348 --> 01:09.418
“John, I love you. 
I think you’re a wonderful guy,” 


01:09.418 --> 01:12.788
I think there’d be a little something 
wrong with me if I thought: 


01:12.788 --> 01:16.558
‘Aw, isn’t that nice? 
My computer, it loves me.’ 


01:16.558 --> 01:18.995
Yeah, love only exists 


01:18.995 --> 01:23.332
if it comes truly 
from a free-will expression.


01:23.332 --> 01:27.470
Now, did Jehovah place 
any boundaries on free will? 


01:27.470 --> 01:29.238
Yes. 


01:29.238 --> 01:31.975
They were stated in the Law 
to the nation of Israel. 


01:31.975 --> 01:34.643
And Jesus later repeated them 


01:34.643 --> 01:39.000
at Matthew 22:37-40: 


01:40.082 --> 01:42.652
“He said to him: 


01:42.652 --> 01:46.322
“‘“You must love Jehovah your God 
with your whole heart 


01:46.322 --> 01:49.859
“‘“and with your whole soul
and with your whole mind.”


01:49.858 --> 01:52.961
“‘This is the greatest
and first commandment.


01:52.962 --> 01:55.265
“‘The second, like it, is this: 


01:55.265 --> 01:58.267
“‘“You must love your
neighbor as yourself.”


01:58.267 --> 02:00.970
“‘On these two commandments 


02:00.970 --> 02:04.540
the whole Law hangs,
and the Prophets.’”


02:04.540 --> 02:07.443
So our use of free will 


02:07.443 --> 02:10.180
has love of God
and love of neighbor 


02:10.180 --> 02:12.182
as its boundaries.


02:12.182 --> 02:14.184
Notice, for example, 


02:14.183 --> 02:16.651
what people are doing 
in this picture, 


02:16.652 --> 02:21.657
both inside the circle boundary 
and outside. 


02:21.657 --> 02:23.727
See, free will allows us to do 


02:23.727 --> 02:25.829
any of the things 
we see in the picture. 


02:25.828 --> 02:28.865
But love of God 
and love of neighbor 


02:28.865 --> 02:31.533
move us to reject 
what’s outside the circle 


02:31.533 --> 02:33.570
and choose 
to do the kinds of things 


02:33.570 --> 02:36.038
that we see inside the circle.


02:36.038 --> 02:39.041
Now, to stay 
within those boundaries, 


02:39.042 --> 02:41.210
Jehovah gave us 
a marvelous brain 


02:41.210 --> 02:43.378
and a built-in conscience, 


02:43.378 --> 02:45.748
but he also knows 
we need more help. 


02:45.748 --> 02:48.985
And that’s why 
he also gave us Bible principles


02:48.985 --> 02:52.055
—basic truths from the Bible 


02:52.055 --> 02:54.723
that can help us 
to make good decisions. 


02:54.723 --> 02:58.360
And it can safely be said 
that any decision we face 


02:58.360 --> 03:01.697
can be guided 
by Bible principles. 


03:01.697 --> 03:04.000
Now, our Creator, Jehovah, 
knows what’s best for us. 


03:05.502 --> 03:08.839
And he also trusts us 
to make decisions 


03:08.838 --> 03:11.240
based on Bible principles 


03:11.240 --> 03:13.577
because he knows 
that when we do that, 


03:13.577 --> 03:16.947
then we’re really, 
truly going to be happy, content, 


03:16.947 --> 03:20.450
and at peace with him 
and with others.


03:20.450 --> 03:22.552
So in review so far: 


03:22.552 --> 03:24.954
Jehovah gave us free will


03:24.953 --> 03:28.423
—that’s the privilege 
to make choices for ourselves—


03:28.423 --> 03:31.860
and he also gave us 
Bible principles 


03:31.860 --> 03:35.798
as the boundaries 
to our choices. 


03:35.798 --> 03:40.336
But making difficult decisions 
requires that we train ourselves 


03:40.337 --> 03:44.674
to recognize Bible principles 
and apply them. 


03:44.673 --> 03:48.911
Now let’s read Romans 12:1, 


03:48.912 --> 03:50.980
and let’s see how this verse 


03:50.980 --> 03:55.452
describes the decision-making process. 


03:55.452 --> 03:58.454
“Therefore, I appeal to you 


03:58.453 --> 04:00.456
“by the compassions of God, brothers, 


04:00.457 --> 04:03.994
“to present your bodies 
as a living sacrifice, 


04:03.993 --> 04:06.728
“holy and acceptable to God, 


04:06.728 --> 04:11.733
a sacred service 
with your power of reason.”


04:11.733 --> 04:16.238
So are we using 
our “power of reason” 


04:16.238 --> 04:19.575
to understand Bible principles? 


04:19.575 --> 04:21.710
For example, young children 


04:21.710 --> 04:24.113
ask lots of questions. 


04:24.113 --> 04:26.248
But has a child ever asked you: 


04:26.248 --> 04:28.416
“What happens when I drop a ball? 


04:28.417 --> 04:30.887
a pencil? a book?” 


04:30.887 --> 04:32.889
No, they don’t ask that. 


04:32.888 --> 04:35.458
They know what happens 
to anything they drop. 


04:35.458 --> 04:37.460
It falls down! 


04:37.460 --> 04:40.463
See, the child doesn’t need 
rules for every object 


04:40.463 --> 04:43.465
but has quickly grasped the principle. 


04:43.465 --> 04:46.000
Anything he drops falls down. 


04:47.137 --> 04:49.972
Now, 
what if an 18-year-old asked you, 


04:49.972 --> 04:53.744
“What’s going to happen
when I drop this pen?”


04:53.743 --> 04:56.878
Well, it’s obvious 
he’s not been paying attention 


04:56.878 --> 04:59.781
to basic principles of life. 


04:59.782 --> 05:03.687
So by us paying attention 
to Bible principles, 


05:03.687 --> 05:06.822
we can very quickly see 
the pattern 


05:06.822 --> 05:10.159
of love of God 
and love of neighbor 


05:10.158 --> 05:12.395
and know 
the right thing to do 


05:12.395 --> 05:16.000
without a long list of rules 
for every situation.


05:17.867 --> 05:21.337
Well, how can we train
our “power of reason”?


05:21.337 --> 05:24.807
We train it by paying attention 


05:24.807 --> 05:27.710
as we read and study the Bible. 


05:27.710 --> 05:29.745
Now, we don’t need rules 


05:29.745 --> 05:33.282
for which movies to watch, 
which songs to listen to, 


05:33.282 --> 05:35.519
or what clothes we can wear. 


05:35.518 --> 05:39.721
If we’re paying attention 
when we’re reading the Bible, 


05:39.722 --> 05:43.225
we train our conscience 
with Bible principles 


05:43.225 --> 05:45.362
so we can make 
such decisions 


05:45.362 --> 05:48.664
without needing 
a long list of rules. 


05:48.663 --> 05:51.133
You know, 
we could compare our training 


05:51.133 --> 05:54.336
of our “power of reason” 
to a blind person 


05:54.337 --> 05:56.505
using a guide dog. 


05:56.505 --> 05:58.507
Now, an untrained dog 


05:58.507 --> 06:01.210
would be very helpful 
to a blind person. 


06:01.210 --> 06:04.713
It would bark when others 
were around, for example. 


06:04.713 --> 06:06.948
However, 
a dog trained 


06:06.948 --> 06:10.553
in specific skills 
is amazingly helpful. 


06:10.553 --> 06:12.955
The dog knows 
when to stop at curbs 


06:12.955 --> 06:14.957
and walk around obstacles 


06:14.957 --> 06:17.427
that the person 
might run their head into. 


06:17.427 --> 06:21.164
A guide dog 
is also taught a skill called 


06:21.163 --> 06:23.665
“intelligent disobedience.” 


06:23.665 --> 06:27.103
And even if the blind person 
encourages the dog forward, 


06:27.103 --> 06:29.105
it won’t obey, 


06:29.105 --> 06:31.973
but it’ll pull 
the person back from danger. 


06:31.973 --> 06:35.845
Now, it can take a year or more 
of training for the dog to learn 


06:35.845 --> 06:39.948
the amazing skills 
that are so helpful to a blind person.


06:39.948 --> 06:44.086
Likewise, our raw, 
untrained “power of reason” 


06:44.087 --> 06:46.122
can help us to a degree. 


06:46.122 --> 06:49.159
However, it can be amazing 


06:49.158 --> 06:52.161
if we take the time to train it. 


06:52.162 --> 06:55.164
Now, here are 
three skills that we can use 


06:55.163 --> 06:57.166
to train our “power of reason.” 


06:57.167 --> 06:59.502
They are illustrating, 


06:59.502 --> 07:01.504
analyzing, 


07:01.503 --> 07:04.173
and balancing. 


07:04.173 --> 07:08.076
Now, to consider our first skill, 
illustrating, 


07:08.077 --> 07:13.149
let’s use the general topic 
of forgiveness.


07:13.148 --> 07:18.000
What Bible principles 
could help with forgiveness? 


07:19.288 --> 07:23.491
Please think of as many principles 
and scriptures as you can. 


07:23.492 --> 07:26.862
Now, if it helps, 
you can pause the program now 


07:26.862 --> 07:29.000
and write down 
the principles that come to mind. 


07:31.367 --> 07:35.404
Now, your list 
may include principles like these: 


07:35.403 --> 07:40.000
Matthew 18:22 says 
to forgive “up to 77 times”; 


07:41.443 --> 07:43.913
Proverbs 12:18 says: 


07:43.913 --> 07:46.915
“The tongue of the wise is a healing”; 


07:46.915 --> 07:50.418
and Colossians 3:13 tells us 


07:50.418 --> 07:53.788
to ‘forgive one another freely.’


07:53.788 --> 07:56.958
Now, the skill 
we want to learn is illustrating


07:56.958 --> 08:01.096
—creating a mental picture 
of an idea or principle 


08:01.097 --> 08:03.199
to see its real meaning 
and impact. 


08:03.198 --> 08:06.168
Now, even if we 
are not skilled artists, 


08:06.168 --> 08:10.171
all of us can and do create 
pictures in our minds. 


08:10.172 --> 08:14.844
When illustrating, 
pay attention to things that are similar 


08:14.843 --> 08:17.913
or like the thing 
you are trying to visualize. 


08:17.913 --> 08:21.916
For example, 
if sin is like debt, 


08:21.917 --> 08:26.589
then forgiveness 
is like someone canceling the debt. 


08:26.588 --> 08:30.893
If a hurtful remark 
is like a cut, 


08:30.893 --> 08:34.730
then forgiveness 
is like seeing it heal. 


08:34.730 --> 08:38.267
If sin is like a mark 
on a blackboard, 


08:38.267 --> 08:41.604
forgiveness is like erasing it. 


08:41.603 --> 08:44.873
Proverbs 12:18 


08:44.873 --> 08:48.000
is a great example 
of using the “like” technique. 


08:49.278 --> 08:54.350
“Thoughtless speech 
is like the stabs of a sword, 


08:54.350 --> 08:58.853
but the tongue of the wise 
is a healing.”


08:58.853 --> 09:00.856
Imagine what your skin 
would look like 


09:00.857 --> 09:04.060
if you still had 
every open cut, bruise, 


09:04.060 --> 09:06.562
or bleeding scratch 
since childhood. 


09:06.562 --> 09:09.432
See, Jehovah 
wonderfully designed our body 


09:09.432 --> 09:12.200
to heal such minor cuts 
and bruises. 


09:12.200 --> 09:16.272
And we can now visualize 
how the forgiveness of others 


09:16.272 --> 09:18.840
helps us to heal emotionally. 


09:18.840 --> 09:21.210
Now, learning to illustrate, 
or visualize, 


09:21.210 --> 09:23.212
takes time and practice. 


09:23.212 --> 09:26.615
However, it can be one 
of the most powerful skills we use 


09:26.615 --> 09:28.783
to train 
our “power of reason,” 


09:28.783 --> 09:31.020
and it can also be 
quite enjoyable. 


09:31.020 --> 09:33.122
You know, 
try at your family worship 


09:33.122 --> 09:35.592
to take 
the principles for a topic 


09:35.592 --> 09:37.894
and see 
how many similarities, 


09:37.893 --> 09:40.228
or “likes,” 
you can come up with. 


09:40.228 --> 09:42.998
Now, granted, 
they all won’t be amazing, 


09:42.998 --> 09:46.068
but you may be surprised 
by the insights 


09:46.068 --> 09:50.105
that come from seeing 
something from a new perspective.


09:50.105 --> 09:52.575
Well, let’s consider now 
our second skill: 


09:52.575 --> 09:54.677
analyzing.


09:54.677 --> 09:56.945
Now, analyzing something means 


09:56.945 --> 09:59.815
“examining it carefully in detail.” 


09:59.815 --> 10:04.320
And let’s use 
the topic of wrong desires. 


10:04.320 --> 10:07.188
Now, in this case, 
let’s say that we’ve already found 


10:07.188 --> 10:12.226
the principle 
at Colossians 3:5: 


10:12.227 --> 10:16.899
“Deaden, therefore, your body members 
that are on the earth 


10:16.898 --> 10:20.501
“as respects sexual immorality, 
uncleanness, 


10:20.502 --> 10:22.872
“uncontrolled sexual passion, 


10:22.872 --> 10:25.374
“hurtful desire, and greediness, 


10:25.373 --> 10:27.876
which is idolatry.”


10:27.877 --> 10:32.782
Now, what can we learn
from analyzing Colossians 3:5


10:32.782 --> 10:35.952
to help when we struggle 
with wrong desires? 


10:35.952 --> 10:38.754
Again, feel free 
to pause the program 


10:38.753 --> 10:41.000
if you want some time 
to think about it. 


10:42.525 --> 10:46.062
Look carefully 
at each step outlined. 


10:46.062 --> 10:49.065
Did you notice, for example, 
what appears to be 


10:49.065 --> 10:53.902
a reverse order 
of the steps leading to sin? 


10:53.902 --> 10:57.640
This verse works its way 
from sexual immorality 


10:57.640 --> 11:00.242
back to the very roots 
of the problem.


11:00.242 --> 11:04.514
Now, let’s take each phrase 
starting with the last, 


11:04.513 --> 11:08.350
“greediness, which is idolatry.” 


11:08.350 --> 11:11.553
So, sexual immorality 
starts with selfishness, 


11:11.553 --> 11:15.056
greedily putting our needs 
ahead of anything else. 


11:15.057 --> 11:18.227
Next is “hurtful desire.” 


11:18.227 --> 11:21.797
Greediness leads to “hurtful desire.” 


11:21.797 --> 11:24.967
It’s like a person 
hanging around a bakery, 


11:24.967 --> 11:29.472
smelling the bread and cakes 
when he can’t pay for it. 


11:29.472 --> 11:32.842
Likewise, 
hanging around immoral entertainment 


11:32.842 --> 11:34.844
or bad associates 


11:34.843 --> 11:39.348
can feed “hurtful desire” 
for what is not ours. 


11:39.348 --> 11:43.851
Next is listed 
“uncontrolled sexual passion.” 


11:43.852 --> 11:48.357
So “hurtful desire” 
has now turned from an idea 


11:48.357 --> 11:51.360
into a strong emotion 
of passion, 


11:51.360 --> 11:53.862
causing one 
to look for an opportunity 


11:53.862 --> 11:56.532
to fulfill the desire. 


11:56.532 --> 11:59.269
Next, “uncleanness.” 


11:59.268 --> 12:03.571
The previous steps have now led 
to inappropriate physical conduct 


12:03.572 --> 12:06.809
with another person. 


12:06.808 --> 12:10.545
Finally, “sexual immorality”
—serious sin. 


12:10.545 --> 12:13.448
Sexual immorality 
has occurred between persons 


12:13.448 --> 12:16.418
that are not married 
to one another. 


12:16.418 --> 12:20.488
So analyzing Colossians 3:5 


12:20.488 --> 12:25.393
can really help us to eliminate, 
not stimulate, wrong desires. 


12:25.393 --> 12:27.863
And we can see 
how important it is 


12:27.863 --> 12:30.398
to get rid 
of wrong desires immediately. 


12:30.398 --> 12:32.400
It’s easier 
to walk away from sin 


12:32.400 --> 12:35.938
when we’re still in the early stages, 
rather than later.


12:35.938 --> 12:38.106
So we need 
to practice the skill 


12:38.107 --> 12:41.410
of not simply 
just reading scriptures 


12:41.410 --> 12:43.412
but analyzing them 


12:43.412 --> 12:45.580
until we’ve learned 
all that we can. 


12:45.580 --> 12:47.917
And we can use 
the many research tools we have 


12:47.917 --> 12:50.000
to find valuable comments 
and application.


12:51.820 --> 12:53.788
Now, let’s consider our third 


12:53.788 --> 12:56.925
and final skill: balancing. 


12:56.925 --> 12:58.927
And to do that, 


12:58.927 --> 13:02.465
let’s use a question 
on the topic of alcohol.


13:02.465 --> 13:06.702
What Bible principles 
could help a couple to decide 


13:06.702 --> 13:10.305
whether to serve alcohol 
at their wedding? 


13:10.305 --> 13:14.075
What principles and scriptures 
do you think would help them 


13:14.075 --> 13:17.178
make a balanced decision? 


13:17.178 --> 13:19.481
Again, you’re welcome 
to pause the program 


13:19.482 --> 13:21.850
if you’d like to write down 
what comes to mind 


13:21.850 --> 13:24.653
or to research something. 


13:24.653 --> 13:28.523
Now, your list probably has 
some of these principles. 


13:28.523 --> 13:33.361
At John 2:9, 
Jesus made wine for a wedding. 


13:33.362 --> 13:37.165
However, 
1 Corinthians 6:10 says 


13:37.165 --> 13:40.535
that ‘drunkards 
will not inherit the Kingdom.’ 


13:40.535 --> 13:44.273
And 1 Corinthians 10:31, 32 says: 


13:44.273 --> 13:46.941
“Whether you are eating or drinking . . . , 


13:46.942 --> 13:49.445
do all things for God’s glory” 


13:49.445 --> 13:53.848
and to “keep from becoming 
causes for stumbling.” 


13:53.848 --> 13:55.851
Now, 
it doesn’t seem 


13:55.852 --> 13:59.489
that any one principle 
provides the answer. 


13:59.488 --> 14:01.490
The couple could simply say: 


14:01.490 --> 14:05.127
“Well, Jesus served wine at a wedding, 
so we can too.” 


14:05.127 --> 14:08.030
However, there’s really more 
to it than that, isn’t there? 


14:08.030 --> 14:10.698
It’s clear that a balance 


14:10.698 --> 14:13.568
of all these Bible principles 
is needed.


14:13.568 --> 14:16.271
Will relatives 
or others be there 


14:16.272 --> 14:18.874
who might be prone 
to overdrinking? 


14:18.873 --> 14:22.711
Would serving alcohol bother 
the conscience of many present 


14:22.712 --> 14:26.882
because of local customs 
and feelings about alcohol? 


14:26.882 --> 14:29.719
It’s often the case 
when making decisions 


14:29.718 --> 14:33.455
that we need to balance 
several Bible principles, 


14:33.455 --> 14:38.227
not taking any one principle solely 
on its own merit. 


14:38.227 --> 14:42.097
Jehovah expects us 
to use our “power of reason” 


14:42.097 --> 14:46.369
to balance Bible principles 
and make good decisions. 


14:46.368 --> 14:51.006
Ecclesiastes 7:16-18 


14:51.007 --> 14:53.975
gives us good advice 
about being balanced. 


14:53.975 --> 14:57.278
“Do not be overly righteous, 


14:57.278 --> 15:00.315
“nor show yourself excessively wise. 


15:00.315 --> 15:02.985
“Why should you bring ruin to yourself? 


15:02.985 --> 15:06.188
“Do not be excessively wicked, 
nor be foolish. 


15:06.188 --> 15:08.323
“Why should you die before your time? 


15:08.323 --> 15:11.360
“It is best to grasp one warning 


15:11.360 --> 15:13.362
“without letting go of the other; 


15:13.362 --> 15:17.265
for the one who fears God 
will heed them both.”


15:17.265 --> 15:19.368
How true. 


15:19.368 --> 15:22.805
Such balance between extremes 
is often necessary 


15:22.805 --> 15:24.873
when we apply 
Bible principles. 


15:24.873 --> 15:27.810
We need to heed them both, 
so to speak. 


15:27.810 --> 15:31.247
We need to balance 
all the Bible principles 


15:31.247 --> 15:33.249
so we can come 
to the decision 


15:33.248 --> 15:36.751
that would show love of God 
and love of neighbor. 


15:36.752 --> 15:41.090
We could illustrate the balance 
between different Bible principles 


15:41.090 --> 15:43.958
and applying them with this model bike. 


15:43.958 --> 15:46.328
It was a gift from a brother in Malawi. 


15:46.328 --> 15:50.498
Now, a bicycle has 
three basic principles of operation: 


15:50.498 --> 15:53.568
the brakes, the pedals, and the steering. 


15:53.568 --> 15:57.105
Now, the brakes are really like principles 


15:57.105 --> 15:59.107
that slow us down 


15:59.107 --> 16:01.244
or stop us from doing the wrong thing. 


16:01.243 --> 16:03.445
And the pedals are really like the principles 


16:03.445 --> 16:05.447
that move us forward 


16:05.447 --> 16:08.417
in showing love for Jehovah 
and our brothers and sisters. 


16:08.417 --> 16:11.554
And the steering is like our free will 


16:11.553 --> 16:14.188
to choose a direction in life 


16:14.188 --> 16:16.191
that pleases Jehovah. 


16:16.192 --> 16:19.260
So making decisions 
is like riding a bicycle. 


16:19.260 --> 16:24.298
We have to balance 
several Bible principles.


16:24.298 --> 16:26.468
So in review, 


16:26.468 --> 16:28.836
Jehovah gave us free will 


16:28.837 --> 16:32.374
to use within the boundaries 
of love of God and love of neighbor 


16:32.373 --> 16:35.276
and many other fine Bible principles. 


16:35.277 --> 16:39.180
Making difficult decisions requires 
that we train our “power of reason” 


16:39.180 --> 16:41.950
to recognize Bible principles 
and apply them. 


16:41.950 --> 16:43.985
And we discussed 
how to train 


16:43.985 --> 16:46.155
our power of reason 
with the three skills: 


16:46.155 --> 16:47.588
illustrating, 


16:47.588 --> 16:48.856
analyzing, 


16:48.857 --> 16:50.000
and balancing. 


16:51.227 --> 16:53.295
So no matter what decisions 
you are faced with, 


16:53.295 --> 16:55.297
we encourage you: 


16:55.297 --> 17:04.890
“Let Bible principles guide you.”
