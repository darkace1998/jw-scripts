Do you like mysteries or puzzles?

00:00:03.607 --> 00:00:05.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about secrets?

00:00:06.068 --> 00:00:07.236 line:10% position:50% align:center
Are you good at keeping

00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:09.697 line:10% position:50% align:center
honorable secrets confidential?

00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:12.032 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had a secret

00:00:12.032 --> 00:00:15.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he kept for about 4,000 years!

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike human secrets,
which often are difficult to keep confidential,

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:25.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s sacred secret
would be revealed only by divine revelation.

00:00:25.963 --> 00:00:31.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, Jehovah would reveal
the details only in his due time.

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:34.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 25:2 says:

00:00:34.346 --> 00:00:38.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is the glory of God to keep a matter secret.”

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the secret we’re talking about?

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:45.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s related to the first prophecy
recorded in the Bible,

00:00:45.441 --> 00:00:48.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Genesis 3:15.

00:00:49.486 --> 00:00:52.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would Jehovah fix the damage caused

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the rebellion in the garden of Eden?

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:57.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah said to the serpent who deceived Eve:

00:00:59.538 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And I will put enmity
between you and the woman

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:05.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and between your offspring and her offspring.

00:01:05.502 --> 00:01:10.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will crush your head,
and you will strike him in the heel.”

00:01:11.008 --> 00:01:13.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an intriguing prophecy!

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:16.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was spoken some 6,000 years ago,

00:01:16.972 --> 00:01:20.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
but its meaning affects each one of us

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every person who has ever lived.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was behind the voice of the serpent?

00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:28.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was “the woman”?

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:30.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eve might have thought that she was,

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:32.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
because when she later gave birth to Cain,

00:01:32.655 --> 00:01:35.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
she said at Genesis 4:1:

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have produced a male child
with the help of Jehovah.”

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Eve was not “the woman” of the prophecy.

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:47.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s secret was still a secret.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who was the ‘offspring of the woman’?

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Eve thought it was Cain,
she was sadly disappointed.

00:01:55.135 --> 00:01:59.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would reveal these details
according to his timetable,

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:02.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
long after Adam and Eve died.

00:02:03.268 --> 00:02:07.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might compare the revealing
of Jehovah’s sacred secret to this puzzle box.

00:02:09.108 --> 00:02:13.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s locked and seems impossible to open.

00:02:13.237 --> 00:02:17.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, a series of steps
leads to opening the box

00:02:17.324 --> 00:02:19.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
and revealing the treasure inside.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those steps are like the details

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:27.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
that led to identifying
the promised ‘offspring of the woman.’

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were some of those details?

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 2,000 years after the prophecy in Eden,

00:02:36.343 --> 00:02:40.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah made a promise
to the faithful man Abraham

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
that provided a piece of the puzzle.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:45.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah say?

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find his words at Genesis 22:17, 18:

00:02:49.773 --> 00:02:52.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will surely bless you

00:02:52.151 --> 00:02:56.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will surely multiply your offspring
like the stars of the heavens

00:02:56.447 --> 00:02:59.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and like the grains of sand on the seashore,

00:02:59.324 --> 00:03:03.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your offspring will take possession
of the gate of his enemies.

00:03:03.871 --> 00:03:06.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And by means of your offspring

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
all nations of the earth
will obtain a blessing for themselves.”

00:03:10.627 --> 00:03:12.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:03:12.463 --> 00:03:15.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah revealed the first detail

00:03:15.424 --> 00:03:17.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
to unlock his sacred secret.

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:23.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abraham must have been amazed
when he looked up to the heavens

00:03:23.474 --> 00:03:25.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saw thousands of stars.

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although Abraham would not see

00:03:28.812 --> 00:03:30.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
the complete fulfillment of the promise

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his lifetime,

00:03:32.816 --> 00:03:35.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
it certainly would be fulfilled at a future time

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:38.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the God who does not lie.

00:03:39.198 --> 00:03:43.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah repeated the promise
to Abraham’s son Isaac

00:03:43.452 --> 00:03:46.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to Isaac’s son Jacob.

00:03:46.205 --> 00:03:50.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jacob, in his deathbed prophecy,
said at Genesis 49:10

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:54.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the scepter [would] not
depart from Judah.”

00:03:55.547 --> 00:03:58.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we learn that kingship is involved

00:03:58.634 --> 00:04:02.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the promised offspring
would come through Judah’s line.

00:04:03.388 --> 00:04:06.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, Jehovah provided the Mosaic Law

00:04:06.308 --> 00:04:09.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help protect the nation of Israel

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the promised offspring.

00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:16.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the next significant detail
to be revealed?

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:19.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1070 B.C.E.,

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:21.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Judah’s descendant David

00:04:21.573 --> 00:04:23.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
became king over all Israel.

00:04:24.743 --> 00:04:26.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
David was “a man agreeable

00:04:26.745 --> 00:04:28.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
to [Jehovah’s] heart,”

00:04:28.122 --> 00:04:32.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah promised to raise up
someone in David’s royal line

00:04:32.209 --> 00:04:34.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would rule forever.

00:04:34.294 --> 00:04:37.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
The promise is recorded
at 2 Samuel chapter 7,

00:04:37.965 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 12 and 13:

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:43.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will raise up your offspring after you,

00:04:43.428 --> 00:04:48.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your own son,
and I will firmly establish his kingdom. . . .

00:04:48.308 --> 00:04:52.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will firmly establish the throne
of his kingdom forever.”

00:04:53.397 --> 00:04:57.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re one step closer to identifying
the promised offspring.

00:05:03.282 --> 00:05:06.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
The offspring
would come through David’s line.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although David’s son Solomon
had a peaceful reign,

00:05:09.621 --> 00:05:12.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was not the King who would rule forever.

00:05:13.167 --> 00:05:17.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
That King would appear in the future
at Jehovah’s appointed time.

00:05:18.088 --> 00:05:22.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the Devil didn’t want
the promised offspring of the woman to appear,

00:05:22.634 --> 00:05:25.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he repeatedly tried to eliminate

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:28.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
or contaminate the lineage to the offspring.

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:33.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Jehovah made sure
that the Devil failed in his attempts.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Down through the centuries,
Jehovah, through his prophets,

00:05:38.525 --> 00:05:42.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided specific details
regarding the promised offspring.

00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:45.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance, the prophet Micah foretold

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Messiah would be born in Bethlehem.

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel’s prophecy of the 70 weeks of years

00:05:51.622 --> 00:05:55.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicated the exact year
when the Messiah would appear.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, Isaiah’s prophecy revealed

00:05:58.921 --> 00:06:02.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the offspring would die a sacrificial death.

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:06.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was progressively revealing details

00:06:06.178 --> 00:06:08.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
about his sacred secret.

00:06:09.556 --> 00:06:12.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Centuries later, in the year 2 B.C.E.,

00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:16.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
the angel Gabriel appeared
to a Jewish virgin named Mary

00:06:16.438 --> 00:06:18.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and made a startling declaration to her.

00:06:19.608 --> 00:06:21.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to know what it is?

00:06:21.485 --> 00:06:25.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s found at Luke 1:31-33:

00:06:26.865 --> 00:06:31.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! you will become pregnant
and give birth to a son,

00:06:32.037 --> 00:06:35.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you are to name him Jesus.

00:06:35.082 --> 00:06:37.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This one will be great

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:40.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and will be called Son of the Most High,

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:44.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Jehovah God will give him
the throne of David his father,

00:06:45.425 --> 00:06:49.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he will rule as King
over the house of Jacob forever,

00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:53.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there will be no end to his Kingdom.”

00:06:53.725 --> 00:06:57.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both Mary and Jesus’ adoptive father, Joseph,

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:00.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
were descendants of David,

00:07:00.524 --> 00:07:03.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
so Jesus received both the natural

00:07:03.151 --> 00:07:06.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the legal rights of an heir of David.

00:07:07.447 --> 00:07:11.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine what might have been
going through Mary’s mind

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:13.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
after hearing those words?

00:07:13.829 --> 00:07:16.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did she perhaps remember
hearing similar details

00:07:16.707 --> 00:07:19.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the book of Moses
about the promised offspring?

00:07:20.585 --> 00:07:25.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, about nine months later,
when Jesus was born,

00:07:25.465 --> 00:07:27.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s angel appeared to shepherds

00:07:27.801 --> 00:07:30.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were tending their flocks near Bethlehem.

00:07:30.345 --> 00:07:31.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
The angel announced,

00:07:31.972 --> 00:07:34.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded in Luke chapter 2:

00:07:34.391 --> 00:07:38.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Today there was born to you
in David’s city a savior,

00:07:38.103 --> 00:07:40.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is Christ the Lord.”

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:43.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
After thousands of years,

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:47.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was giving notice
that his sacred secret would soon be revealed.

00:07:48.822 --> 00:07:53.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
The shepherds went and told Mary
and Joseph about this divine message.

00:07:53.702 --> 00:07:56.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word about the Christ was spreading.

00:07:57.456 --> 00:08:01.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
About 30 years later,
in the days of John the Baptizer,

00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:03.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the people were in expectation

00:08:03.628 --> 00:08:06.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and all of them were reasoning
in their hearts about John,

00:08:06.798 --> 00:08:09.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘May he perhaps be the Christ?’”

00:08:10.427 --> 00:08:15.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
A short time later, Jesus the Nazarene
came to John to be baptized.

00:08:16.224 --> 00:08:18.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Jesus came up out of the water,

00:08:18.852 --> 00:08:22.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah anointed him with holy spirit and said:

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:25.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my Son, the beloved.”

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:27.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
At long last,

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:32.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
the promised offspring
of Genesis 3:15 had arrived!

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:51.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humble Jews readily responded
to Jesus’ teachings and ministry.

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:56.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there were many more details
about the sacred secret yet to be revealed,

00:08:56.056 --> 00:08:58.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the many facets

00:08:58.725 --> 00:09:00.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a beautiful crystal.

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:09.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his ministry, 
Jesus himself identified the serpent

00:09:09.277 --> 00:09:12.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Satan and the serpent’s offspring

00:09:12.739 --> 00:09:16.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
as those who display
the Devil’s characteristics.

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:22.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus also revealed,
as recorded at Luke 22:28-30,

00:09:22.207 --> 00:09:26.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there would be a secondary part
of the woman’s offspring:

00:09:26.378 --> 00:09:30.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
spirit-anointed Christians
who will rule with Christ in heaven.

00:09:31.758 --> 00:09:35.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, the apostle Paul identified
the woman of the prophecy

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:38.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the heavenly part of Jehovah’s organization,

00:09:38.932 --> 00:09:41.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
made up of faithful spirit creatures.

00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:46.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the enmity foretold at Genesis 3:15

00:09:46.982 --> 00:09:49.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
continues into our day.

00:09:49.484 --> 00:09:52.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil and his offspring
continue “to wage war

00:09:52.362 --> 00:09:55.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the remaining ones
of [the woman’s] offspring” on earth.

00:09:56.825 --> 00:10:00.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what did the Messiah accomplish
while he was on the earth?

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:06.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews were hoping that he would bring
liberation from Roman oppression.

00:10:06.334 --> 00:10:11.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, Daniel’s prophecy indicated
that the Messiah would be “cut off,”

00:10:11.006 --> 00:10:12.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “put to death.”

00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:15.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
This corresponded to the ‘striking in the heel,’

00:10:15.385 --> 00:10:17.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned at Genesis 3:15.

00:10:19.139 --> 00:10:23.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, Jehovah also revealed at Psalm 16:10

00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:26.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his Son would not be left “in the Grave.”

00:10:26.813 --> 00:10:30.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
True to his promise,
Jehovah resurrected Jesus

00:10:30.025 --> 00:10:32.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
less than three days after his death.

00:10:33.737 --> 00:10:37.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, a principal part
of Jehovah’s sacred secret

00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:42.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
involved the Messianic Kingdom,
of which Christ would be King.

00:10:42.412 --> 00:10:46.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
While Jesus was on earth, 
he cured the sick,

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:49.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
he fed the hungry,
and he resurrected the dead

00:10:49.669 --> 00:10:54.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
—things that he’ll do on a far greater scale
as King of God’s Kingdom.

00:10:55.592 --> 00:10:57.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
After Jesus ascended to heaven,

00:10:57.677 --> 00:11:00.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
many additional details
about God’s sacred secret

00:11:00.931 --> 00:11:05.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
were revealed in the writings we now know
as the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:11:05.977 --> 00:11:08.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 2:3 says:

00:11:08.313 --> 00:11:11.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Carefully concealed in him [or, Christ]

00:11:11.274 --> 00:11:14.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
are all the treasures of wisdom
and of knowledge.”

00:11:15.612 --> 00:11:19.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
When did the sacred secret come to its finish?

00:11:19.991 --> 00:11:22.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 10:7 says that it would occur

00:11:22.953 --> 00:11:26.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the days when the seventh angel
is about to blow his trumpet.”

00:11:27.582 --> 00:11:29.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
When did that take place?

00:11:29.584 --> 00:11:33.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s note the answer at Revelation 11:15:

00:11:34.339 --> 00:11:37.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The seventh angel blew his trumpet.

00:11:37.217 --> 00:11:40.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And there were loud voices in heaven, saying:

00:11:40.387 --> 00:11:41.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The kingdom of the world

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘has become the Kingdom of our Lord
and of his Christ,

00:11:44.724 --> 00:11:47.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will rule as king forever and ever.’”

00:11:48.812 --> 00:11:51.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
This occurred in 1914

00:11:51.523 --> 00:11:54.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Christ Jesus became
King of God’s Kingdom.

00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:58.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is that the end?

00:11:58.363 --> 00:11:59.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:11:59.906 --> 00:12:04.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
The revelation provides additional details
regarding God’s Kingdom

00:12:04.286 --> 00:12:08.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and future events
that most people would consider shocking.

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:13.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, Revelation 19:11-16

00:12:13.587 --> 00:12:17.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
reveals that Christ Jesus,
“the King of kings and Lord of lords,”

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:19.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
will “strike the nations”

00:12:19.801 --> 00:12:23.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “shepherd them with a rod of iron.”

00:12:23.763 --> 00:12:28.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
As King of God’s Kingdom,
Jesus will soon crush all human governments

00:12:28.768 --> 00:12:33.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hurl the Devil into an abyss of inactivity.

00:12:33.148 --> 00:12:37.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will lead to 1,000 years of peace.

00:12:38.903 --> 00:12:41.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the thousand years,

00:12:41.197 --> 00:12:45.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Devil will be released from the abyss
for a short time,

00:12:45.243 --> 00:12:50.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the final fulfillment
of Genesis 3:15 will occur:

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:54.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
The offspring of the woman
will crush the head of the Devil.

00:12:56.921 --> 00:12:59.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does all of this affect us?

00:13:01.092 --> 00:13:04.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re privileged to know
about God’s sacred secret,

00:13:04.429 --> 00:13:09.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
which he kept secret for some 4,000 years.

00:13:09.267 --> 00:13:11.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the details Jehovah
has helped his people

00:13:11.728 --> 00:13:14.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
to understand only in recent decades!

00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:17.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah has made “known to us

00:13:17.942 --> 00:13:20.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
the sacred secret of his will.”

00:13:22.238 --> 00:13:26.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this broadcast,
we have considered only a few facets

00:13:26.034 --> 00:13:28.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
of God’s sacred secret.

00:13:28.536 --> 00:13:31.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not make it a project
for personal or family worship?

00:13:33.083 --> 00:13:36.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s thrilling to think about Kingdom realities

00:13:36.544 --> 00:13:40.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how Jehovah will completely undo
the effects of Satan’s rebellion.

00:13:41.716 --> 00:13:44.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christ Jesus now rules as King in the heavens,

00:13:44.969 --> 00:13:47.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the days for this evil system of things

00:13:47.514 --> 00:13:50.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
under Satan’s domination are numbered.

00:13:50.642 --> 00:13:54.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus will soon strike the nations
with a rod of iron

00:13:54.604 --> 00:13:58.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then transform the earth
into a beautiful paradise.

00:14:00.318 --> 00:14:04.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah want us to do
with his sacred secret?

00:14:04.406 --> 00:14:07.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we put it back into the box?

00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:10.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
bury it in the ground?

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:14:11.538 --> 00:14:14.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants us to make it known!

00:14:14.582 --> 00:14:19.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sacred secret is now being proclaimed
in over 1,000 languages.

00:14:19.587 --> 00:14:21.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you having a full share?

00:14:23.007 --> 00:14:26.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deep appreciation for this sacred secret

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all that it means for the future will impel us

00:14:28.638 --> 00:14:31.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share it with as many people as possible.

00:14:32.767 --> 00:14:36.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the apostle Paul wrote
to Christians in Ephesus,

00:14:36.146 --> 00:14:40.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
he requested of them,
as recorded at Ephesians 6:19:

00:14:41.025 --> 00:14:43.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pray also for me,

00:14:43.903 --> 00:14:47.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that the words may be given to me
when I open my mouth,

00:14:47.407 --> 00:14:49.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that I may be able to speak boldly

00:14:49.909 --> 00:14:53.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
in making known the sacred secret
of the good news.”

00:14:54.664 --> 00:14:58.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s our prayer for you,
dear brothers and sisters,

00:14:58.418 --> 00:15:00.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we all may continue to declare

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s sacred secret with boldness.
