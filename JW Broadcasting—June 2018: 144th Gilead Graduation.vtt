00:01.518 --> 00:05.689
Welcome to the June program 
of JW Broadcasting.

00:24.174 --> 00:25.542
As you likely remember,

00:25.542 --> 00:27.410
Gilead graduations are now featured

00:27.410 --> 00:30.146
as the monthly JW Broadcasting program

00:30.146 --> 00:32.582
once every six months.

00:32.582 --> 00:35.485
For this program, 
we are excited to share with you

00:35.485 --> 00:39.889
the first part of the graduation 
of the 144th class of Gilead,

00:39.889 --> 00:43.760
which took place on March 10, 2018.

00:43.760 --> 00:48.765
This program features Scriptural talks 
with intriguing themes.

00:48.765 --> 00:52.769
We know you’ll enjoy 
these thought-provoking discussions.

00:52.769 --> 00:55.105
In coming weeks, be on the lookout

00:55.105 --> 00:58.608
for Parts 2 and 3 of the Gilead graduation.

00:58.608 --> 01:01.778
You’ll have an opportunity 
to get to know some of the students better

01:01.778 --> 01:03.847
during another heart-stirring episode

01:03.847 --> 01:06.449
of The Inside Story.

01:06.449 --> 01:09.586
But now, we invite you to enjoy Part 1

01:09.586 --> 01:14.591
of the graduation 
of the 144th class of Gilead.

01:15.558 --> 01:19.929
You’ll see a picture on the monitors.

01:19.929 --> 01:21.931
Take a look at it;

01:23.600 --> 01:26.436
take a good look.

01:28.138 --> 01:30.140
What’s the occasion?

01:31.708 --> 01:33.843
I’ll give you a hint.

01:33.843 --> 01:38.181
The picture was taken 
75 years ago last month.

01:40.750 --> 01:44.120
It’s a picture of the very first day

01:44.120 --> 01:48.858
of the very first class of Gilead.

01:48.858 --> 01:52.328
So 75 years ago last month

01:52.328 --> 01:55.832
was the inception of Gilead.

01:56.900 --> 01:59.636
Now, Gilead

01:59.636 --> 02:02.605
—that’s an interesting word, isn’t it?

02:02.605 --> 02:05.341
What does it mean?

02:05.341 --> 02:09.179
Well, if you answer “Heap of Witness,”

02:09.179 --> 02:11.281
it shows that you’re very familiar

02:11.281 --> 02:15.118
with the 1984 edition 
of the New World Translation.

02:16.986 --> 02:21.825
The 2013 edition says “Witness Pile.”

02:23.126 --> 02:28.131
Now, there can be a difference 
between a heap and a pile.

02:29.199 --> 02:33.770
Where I come from in Canada, 
in the wintertime it gets very cold.

02:33.770 --> 02:36.840
And to save on heating expenses,

02:36.840 --> 02:39.909
many families heat with a woodstove.

02:39.909 --> 02:42.178
And so you go to the backyard,

02:42.178 --> 02:47.183
and you see 
a very neat pile of wood stacked up.

02:47.183 --> 02:48.718
They’re not careless about it.

02:48.718 --> 02:52.288
In fact, some of them 
are quite meticulous about their woodpile.

02:52.288 --> 02:55.558
If you appreciate 
the appearance of your home,

02:55.558 --> 03:00.430
some of them are very artistic, 
almost sculpted, these woodpiles.

03:00.430 --> 03:03.733
And we’d never call it a heap 
because with a heap you’d think of wood

03:03.733 --> 03:07.337
that has just been carelessly strewn 
right and left.

03:07.337 --> 03:09.772
But no, this is a woodpile,

03:09.772 --> 03:13.209
so something rather neat.

03:13.209 --> 03:17.947
So why are we talking about a “Witness Pile”?

03:17.947 --> 03:19.816
Well, what was it?

03:19.816 --> 03:22.085
What was this “Heap of Witness”?

03:22.085 --> 03:26.923
What was this “Witness Pile” 
in the original meaning?

03:26.923 --> 03:29.225
What purpose did it serve,

03:29.225 --> 03:33.997
and why does it concern 
you members of the graduating class?

03:33.997 --> 03:35.531
It does.

03:35.531 --> 03:37.734
In fact, it concerns all of us.

03:37.734 --> 03:40.403
There’s a lesson that all of us can learn

03:40.403 --> 03:43.506
from this “Witness Pile” called Gilead.

03:43.506 --> 03:48.344
Let’s go to the origin, 
back in Genesis chapter 31

03:50.179 --> 03:52.348
—Genesis chapter 31.

03:53.783 --> 03:55.952
Now, a little context:

03:55.952 --> 03:58.621
The patriarch Jacob

03:58.621 --> 04:03.126
was tired of being cheated 
by his father-in-law, Laban.

04:03.126 --> 04:05.128
And as we read the Scriptures,

04:05.128 --> 04:08.064
we know that Laban 
was kind of a shady character;

04:08.064 --> 04:10.900
you wouldn’t want to buy 
a used car from Laban.

04:12.168 --> 04:14.971
And so Jacob got tired of being cheated,

04:14.971 --> 04:19.175
and so he ran away 
with his wives and his children.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.477
Well, Laban ran after him.

04:21.477 --> 04:23.746
And when he caught up with Jacob,

04:23.746 --> 04:28.584
Laban and Jacob 
made a covenant of peace.

04:29.452 --> 04:32.255
Now, we’ll take up 
the reading from verse 43.

04:32.255 --> 04:37.260
So this is Genesis 31, 
beginning with verse 43:

04:37.260 --> 04:40.530
“Then Laban answered Jacob:

04:40.530 --> 04:42.598
“‘The daughters are my daughters

04:42.598 --> 04:44.667
“‘and the children my children

04:44.667 --> 04:46.736
“‘and the flock my flock,

04:46.736 --> 04:50.573
and everything you are looking at is mine.’”

04:50.573 --> 04:52.976
It tells you what kind 
of a person he was, doesn’t it?

04:52.976 --> 04:54.744
Verse 44:

04:54.744 --> 04:58.414
“‘Now come, 
let us make a covenant, you and I,

04:58.414 --> 05:03.419
“and it will serve 
as a witness between us.’

05:04.354 --> 05:08.358
“So Jacob took a stone 
and set it up as a pillar.

05:08.358 --> 05:10.560
“Then Jacob said to his brothers:

05:10.560 --> 05:12.562
“‘Pick up stones!’

05:12.562 --> 05:16.699
And they took stones and made a pile.”

05:16.699 --> 05:18.368
And notice this:

05:18.368 --> 05:21.037
“After that they ate there

05:21.037 --> 05:24.240
on the pile of stones.”

05:24.240 --> 05:28.511
So scholars tell us 
that this “pile of stones”

05:28.511 --> 05:31.681
must have been quite neatly arranged,

05:31.681 --> 05:35.485
so that it would form a kind of a table,

05:35.485 --> 05:39.689
and they had 
their meal of peace on this table.

05:39.689 --> 05:42.392
And, of course, 
this was to serve as a monument.

05:42.392 --> 05:45.928
It was to be a monument 
of the covenant of peace

05:45.928 --> 05:48.498
between Laban and Jacob.

05:48.498 --> 05:52.301
Now, let’s carry on, verse 47:

05:52.301 --> 05:57.306
“And Laban began calling it Jegar-sahadutha,

05:57.306 --> 06:00.309
but Jacob called it Galeed.”

06:01.611 --> 06:04.480
When the brothers 
were picking a name for the school,

06:04.480 --> 06:06.983
aren’t you glad 
they didn’t go with Laban’s?

06:08.584 --> 06:10.987
How would you students like to be graduates

06:10.987 --> 06:15.324
of the Watchtower Bible School 
of Jegar-sahadutha?

06:15.324 --> 06:17.660
That would be a mouthful, wouldn’t it?

06:17.660 --> 06:21.931
So they chose Galeed, or Gilead.

06:21.931 --> 06:23.933
Verses 48 and 49:

06:23.933 --> 06:25.768
“Laban then said:

06:25.768 --> 06:29.505
“‘This pile of stones is a witness

06:29.505 --> 06:32.008
“between me and you today.’

06:32.008 --> 06:37.013
That is why he named it Galeed, 
and the Watchtower.”

06:37.013 --> 06:40.950
And isn’t it interesting 
that both “Watchtower” and “Gilead”

06:40.950 --> 06:43.619
are in the name of our school?

06:43.619 --> 06:47.390
But what was the purpose 
of the pile of rocks?

06:47.390 --> 06:49.625
Verse 52:

06:49.625 --> 06:53.896
“This pile of stones is a witness,

06:53.896 --> 06:56.933
“and the pillar is something 
that bears witness,

06:56.933 --> 06:59.669
“that I will not pass 
beyond this pile of stones

06:59.669 --> 07:01.671
“to bring harm to you

07:01.671 --> 07:06.676
“and you will not pass 
beyond this pile of stones and this pillar

07:06.676 --> 07:09.679
to bring harm to me.”

07:09.679 --> 07:12.048
So this Gilead,

07:12.048 --> 07:14.684
this “pile of stones,”

07:14.684 --> 07:17.687
this “Witness Pile,”

07:17.687 --> 07:20.123
was really a monument.

07:20.123 --> 07:24.794
It was a symbol of peace and unity.

07:24.794 --> 07:27.797
And anytime someone 
would pass by that monument,

07:27.797 --> 07:31.234
that “pile of stones,” 
that “witness heap,” if you like,

07:32.602 --> 07:36.739
they would be reminded of the need for unity.

07:36.739 --> 07:41.010
Now, the unity between Laban and Jacob

07:41.010 --> 07:43.279
didn’t come about automatically.

07:43.279 --> 07:44.947
We read verse 43.

07:44.947 --> 07:48.284
Did you notice 
the accusations that Laban made

07:48.284 --> 07:51.354
when he first encountered Jacob?

07:51.354 --> 07:53.589
‘The daughters are mine;

07:53.589 --> 07:55.892
‘the children are mine;

07:55.892 --> 07:58.127
‘the flocks are mine;

07:58.127 --> 08:01.964
everything you see is mine.’

08:01.964 --> 08:05.301
Well, them were fighting words.

08:05.301 --> 08:08.971
Jacob had worked very hard 
for everything he got.

08:08.971 --> 08:11.807
He’d worked for 14 years for his wives,

08:11.807 --> 08:15.478
and Laban changed his wages ten times.

08:15.478 --> 08:18.948
So Laban had no right 
to say that it was all his,

08:18.948 --> 08:21.150
and Jacob could have taken exception to it;

08:21.150 --> 08:22.818
but he bit his tongue.

08:22.818 --> 08:24.053
Why?

08:24.053 --> 08:26.055
The goal was peace.

08:26.055 --> 08:28.891
He wanted to make peace.

08:28.891 --> 08:32.361
So Jacob took the high road.

08:32.361 --> 08:35.731
Well, today, that name Gilead

08:35.731 --> 08:38.434
is an appropriate name for our school.

08:38.434 --> 08:41.671
And it reminds us of the blessed unity

08:41.671 --> 08:45.074
that must pervade 
through the organization today.

08:45.074 --> 08:48.377
When you think of it, 
Gilead has been a tremendous force

08:48.377 --> 08:50.379
to unify God’s people.

08:50.379 --> 08:54.784
As missionaries were sent 
to the far corners of the earth,

08:54.784 --> 08:57.019
they were supplicating people to come

08:57.019 --> 08:59.488
into a peaceful relationship 
with Jehovah God.

08:59.488 --> 09:01.357
And as branches were formed,

09:01.357 --> 09:04.360
the missionaries understood 
how world headquarters worked,

09:04.360 --> 09:06.362
and they helped to promote unity

09:06.362 --> 09:09.098
between the branches 
and world headquarters.

09:09.098 --> 09:13.703
So the missionaries were agents of peace.

09:13.703 --> 09:17.807
Now, of course, the focus of Gilead 
is on strengthening the congregations,

09:17.807 --> 09:20.409
strengthening the circuits, 
strengthening the branches,

09:20.409 --> 09:23.179
forging an unbreakable link

09:23.179 --> 09:25.881
between the branches 
and world headquarters.

09:25.881 --> 09:29.652
And Gilead plays a part in all this.

09:29.652 --> 09:33.856
We are “one flock,” 
under “one shepherd.”

09:33.856 --> 09:37.326
Don’t hurt any member of the flock.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.328
Be a peacemaker.

09:39.328 --> 09:41.797
If you want peace, 
you have to work for it.

09:41.797 --> 09:45.167
And sometimes to achieve it, 
we have to bite our tongues.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.169
Now, isn’t that a good lesson

09:47.169 --> 09:49.772
that you members of the graduating class

09:49.772 --> 09:52.108
and all of us can learn?

09:52.108 --> 09:55.411
Because we all want to work 
for the peace of Jerusalem;

09:55.411 --> 09:59.248
we all want to work 
for the peace of Jehovah’s organization.

10:00.149 --> 10:03.452
Well, back to the first class of Gilead

10:03.452 --> 10:08.291
—graduation day, June 23, 1943.

10:09.158 --> 10:11.160
Wait a minute,

10:11.160 --> 10:13.929
first day of class, February 1;

10:13.929 --> 10:17.199
graduation day, June 23.

10:17.199 --> 10:19.168
That wasn’t five months, was it?

10:19.168 --> 10:21.971
But they had a lovely graduation day.

10:21.971 --> 10:24.373
And the first to speak was a member

10:24.373 --> 10:26.842
of what would later become 
the Governing Body,

10:26.842 --> 10:29.945
Brother W. E. Van Amburgh.

10:29.945 --> 10:34.950
Well, today at the graduation 
of the 144th class,

10:34.950 --> 10:38.888
we have a member of the Governing Body 
who will be first to speak,

10:38.888 --> 10:40.890
not Brother Van Amburgh,

10:40.890 --> 10:42.892
but Brother Anthony Morris.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.328
And Tony is going to speak 
to us on the subject

10:45.328 --> 10:48.331
“Supplicate All the Time!”

10:55.171 --> 10:59.642
You soon-to-be graduates 
are very familiar with the fact

10:59.642 --> 11:03.846
that in Scripture 
there are different forms of prayer.

11:03.846 --> 11:05.348
You have petition.

11:05.348 --> 11:07.950
We petition Jehovah for various needs.

11:07.950 --> 11:11.954
You have thanksgiving 
—so much to thank him for.

11:11.954 --> 11:14.323
And then, of course, 
Jehovah always deserves praise,

11:14.323 --> 11:18.127
so we have these prayers 
we offer to praise him.

11:18.127 --> 11:21.330
However, 
I just want to implant in your minds,

11:21.330 --> 11:24.500
as you get ready to graduate 
and go to your assignments,

11:24.500 --> 11:26.502
this matter of supplication.

11:26.502 --> 11:28.504
It’s unique;

11:28.504 --> 11:33.242
it’s just full of emotion 
—earnest prayer.

11:33.242 --> 11:35.244
And I think you understand that.

11:35.244 --> 11:38.047
We want you to understand 
why we’re suggesting

11:38.047 --> 11:42.818
you should supplicate all the time 
—all the time.

11:42.818 --> 11:46.489
And take, for example, Christ Jesus.

11:46.489 --> 11:49.525
He set the perfect example for us here.

11:49.525 --> 11:53.195
And you’ll notice in Hebrews chapter 5

11:53.195 --> 11:58.200
how priceless his perfect example was.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.636
At least we try to reach for it.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.139
But not just you soon-to-be graduates

12:03.139 --> 12:07.209
but all of us 
can benefit from this good counsel.

12:07.209 --> 12:12.114
Now, notice Hebrews 5:7:

12:12.114 --> 12:17.119
“During his life on earth, 
Christ offered up supplications

12:17.119 --> 12:20.756
“and also petitions, 
with strong outcries and tears,

12:20.756 --> 12:24.093
“to the One 
who was able to save him out of death,

12:24.093 --> 12:28.063
and he was favorably heard 
for his godly fear.”

12:28.063 --> 12:32.735
Now, did you notice, though, 
that “supplications” is plural?

12:32.735 --> 12:37.473
So, certainly he supplicated throughout 
his three-and-a-half-year ministry.

12:37.473 --> 12:42.478
But we can only imagine 
the final weeks, days,

12:42.478 --> 12:46.449
hours was with tears

12:46.449 --> 12:48.684
—the supplication.

12:48.684 --> 12:52.621
So this is the example for us,

12:52.621 --> 12:54.824
and the closer we get to the end,

12:54.824 --> 12:57.993
Jehovah wants us to imitate his Son.

12:57.993 --> 13:01.630
In fact, Jesus made it very clear 
how important this was.

13:01.630 --> 13:04.366
And you’re aware of it, 
but sometimes we get so busy

13:04.366 --> 13:07.503
with the things 
we’re dealing with that we can forget.

13:07.503 --> 13:10.840
Notice what he commanded in Luke.

13:10.840 --> 13:12.842
So find Luke,

13:12.842 --> 13:14.910
and we’re going to look at the 21st chapter.

13:14.910 --> 13:19.215
You’ll quickly remember it

13:19.215 --> 13:22.151
—Luke chapter 21.

13:22.151 --> 13:25.988
Now here, just to highlight a little bit

13:25.988 --> 13:27.990
before we read verse 36,

13:27.990 --> 13:30.125
you’ll notice in verse 34

13:30.125 --> 13:32.962
that these are the things 
we have to “pay attention to”

13:32.962 --> 13:34.997
to avoid being “weighed down with overeating

13:34.997 --> 13:37.500
and heavy drinking and anxieties of life,”

13:37.500 --> 13:40.002
so that it doesn’t hit us like a snare.

13:40.002 --> 13:44.406
Now notice verse 36:

13:44.406 --> 13:46.408
“Keep awake, then,

13:46.408 --> 13:50.045
“all the time making supplication

13:50.045 --> 13:53.048
“that you may succeed 
in escaping all these things

13:53.048 --> 13:57.353
that must occur 
and in standing before the Son of man.”

13:57.353 --> 13:59.722
So this is what he said:

13:59.722 --> 14:04.560
“All the time making supplication.”

14:04.560 --> 14:08.597
Now, obviously,

14:08.597 --> 14:12.601
it’s not going to be 
something where if you’re driving a car,

14:12.601 --> 14:16.138
you’re going to stop 
and start supplicating on the road.

14:16.138 --> 14:18.941
But the spirit of his counsel is,

14:18.941 --> 14:23.345
‘Do you want to succeed like I succeeded?

14:23.345 --> 14:26.282
You must supplicate all the time.’

14:26.282 --> 14:27.349
It just has to be.

14:27.349 --> 14:31.253
You can’t let a day go by 
that you haven’t had supplication,

14:31.253 --> 14:33.956
and the closer we get to the end,

14:33.956 --> 14:36.091
the more important that is.

14:36.091 --> 14:41.063
A lot of us need to focus on supplicating

14:41.063 --> 14:44.233
—because it’s not what might occur,

14:44.233 --> 14:47.903
it’s what will occur.

14:47.903 --> 14:50.339
This is a reality.

14:50.339 --> 14:54.343
So it’s very obvious, 
and it’s understandable

14:54.343 --> 14:56.645
that we will supplicate

14:56.645 --> 15:00.449
when we or a loved one face a crisis,

15:00.449 --> 15:02.518
something happens.

15:02.518 --> 15:07.056
And then it’s just natural 
to get that intense emotion in prayer,

15:07.056 --> 15:09.758
and there could well be tears; 
but it’s intense.

15:09.758 --> 15:11.794
You’re just focused.

15:11.794 --> 15:15.164
It’s just gripping you with the emotion

15:15.164 --> 15:17.166
as you face different things.

15:17.166 --> 15:21.170
So you may have 
a life-threatening illness in the future;

15:21.170 --> 15:23.839
you’ll start supplicating with that news.

15:23.839 --> 15:27.343
If you have a loved one 
and their life is threatened,

15:27.343 --> 15:29.878
there’s going to be supplication.

15:29.878 --> 15:32.648
But even though that’s appropriate

15:32.648 --> 15:36.552
and Jehovah expects us to do that,

15:36.552 --> 15:40.155
I just want to have you take back 
with you on your assignments

15:40.155 --> 15:43.158
something that you must supplicate about too.

15:43.158 --> 15:46.228
And I have to take the same counsel.

15:46.228 --> 15:48.731
It means a lot to Jehovah.

15:48.731 --> 15:53.002
It’s very basic, 
but look at Matthew chapter 6

15:56.905 --> 15:59.241
—Matthew chapter 6.

16:02.077 --> 16:05.347
And this is where Jesus 
gave the example of prayer,

16:05.347 --> 16:08.317
and it certainly extends to supplicating.

16:08.317 --> 16:11.887
You’ll notice in verse 9 where he mentions:

16:11.887 --> 16:13.889
“You must pray . . . this way:

16:13.889 --> 16:17.826
“‘Our Father in the heavens, 
let your name be sanctified.

16:17.826 --> 16:19.895
“‘Let your Kingdom come.

16:19.895 --> 16:24.366
Let your will take place, 
as in heaven, also on earth.’”

16:24.366 --> 16:27.736
So it’s Jehovah’s name.

16:27.736 --> 16:32.041
You look at this wicked world, 
and it’s getting worse.

16:32.041 --> 16:35.577
The Bible foretold 
it would go “from bad to worse,”

16:35.577 --> 16:39.148
and it’s just so reproachful 
to the holy name of God.

16:39.148 --> 16:42.051
Everybody is in the face 
of anything Scriptural.

16:42.051 --> 16:45.087
And how terrible that is!

16:45.087 --> 16:49.091
Supplicate about your concern 
to Jehovah himself

16:49.091 --> 16:52.327
—how that bothers you—
and that will touch him.

16:52.327 --> 16:56.532
And it’s nice because it gets 
your mind off yourself

16:56.532 --> 17:00.402
(which is not always spiritually healthy)

17:00.402 --> 17:02.404
and focused on Jehovah’s name,

17:02.404 --> 17:06.041
because it’s his name and the Kingdom

17:06.041 --> 17:09.712
that are going to rid the whole world 
of all the problems anyway.

17:09.712 --> 17:12.414
So it’s just something 
we want you to take with you,

17:12.414 --> 17:15.918
to supplicate about Jehovah’s name

17:15.918 --> 17:19.722
and removing the reproach 
and that his Kingdom come.

17:19.722 --> 17:21.757
Do that often.

17:21.757 --> 17:24.359
All the time, if you will.

17:24.359 --> 17:27.796
Now just some final thoughts here

17:27.796 --> 17:30.999
in a very familiar Psalm, 
Psalm 83.

17:30.999 --> 17:36.004
So if you’ll find Psalm 83 here.

17:38.207 --> 17:42.211
And this connects with supplicating Jehovah

17:42.211 --> 17:44.279
to have his will done

17:44.279 --> 17:49.318
and his name vindicated 
(as we say in English as well now),

17:49.318 --> 17:51.320
cleared of the reproach.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.689
I know you feel the same way I do.

17:53.689 --> 17:55.724
I’m way over here.

17:55.724 --> 17:58.427
I just— 
It’s disgusting!

17:58.427 --> 18:00.796
You’ve got to keep up 
with some of the news,

18:00.796 --> 18:05.300
but it’s almost like, 
‘Let me stop!’

18:05.300 --> 18:08.504
But you’ve got to know 
a little something that’s going on.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.073
And we have connections with our brothers

18:11.073 --> 18:14.309
from all different parts of the earth; 
things are coming up all the time.

18:14.309 --> 18:16.745
There’s so much to supplicate about,

18:16.745 --> 18:19.815
and the Kingdom 
is going to finally put an end to all of it.

18:19.815 --> 18:22.651
Now, what I thought you’d appreciate

18:22.651 --> 18:26.455
if you look at the 83rd Psalm in context,

18:26.455 --> 18:30.192
in the first five verses 
(this is interesting),

18:30.192 --> 18:33.095
it’s about those who hate Jehovah.

18:33.095 --> 18:35.964
These arrogant enemies of Jehovah God

18:35.964 --> 18:38.734
hate him and hate his people.

18:38.734 --> 18:41.436
They’re cunning; they’re despicable.

18:41.436 --> 18:45.974
Now, it’s quite fascinating that in verse 5,

18:45.974 --> 18:48.010
see the “b” part of the verse:

18:48.010 --> 18:50.913
“They have made an alliance against you.”

18:50.913 --> 18:53.482
So this was an alliance of nations

18:53.482 --> 18:57.920
coming against Jehovah’s name people 
—an alliance.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.988
What does that remind you of?

18:59.988 --> 19:03.892
So by focusing on supplicating all the time,

19:03.892 --> 19:08.897
you’re really getting yourself ready 
for the great tribulation.

19:08.897 --> 19:12.634
We call it a coalition of nations

19:12.634 --> 19:15.070
—Gog’s attack.

19:15.070 --> 19:20.075
It connects with what we see here 
that happened in the past.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.744
And these are beautiful thoughts here.

19:22.744 --> 19:26.548
Notice verse 17 and verse 18

19:26.548 --> 19:28.917
of the 83rd Psalm.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.986
And this is from our heart.

19:30.986 --> 19:33.589
We want to supplicate this to our Father:

19:33.589 --> 19:38.160
“May they be put to shame 
and be terrified forever;

19:38.160 --> 19:42.164
“may they be disgraced and perish;

19:42.164 --> 19:46.902
“may people know that you, 
whose name is Jehovah,

19:46.902 --> 19:51.139
you alone are the Most High 
over all the earth.”

19:51.139 --> 19:56.144
Ah! What a stirring supplication!

19:56.144 --> 20:00.482
So with whatever you face, 
you soon-to-be graduates,

20:00.482 --> 20:04.820
in the future, 
remember the Scriptural advice:

20:04.820 --> 20:09.825
‘Supplicate all the time,’ 
and you are sure to succeed.

20:16.098 --> 20:17.599
Beautifully done.

20:17.599 --> 20:20.402
Thank you very much, Brother Morris.

20:20.402 --> 20:23.972
Now, at the graduation 
of the first class of Gilead,

20:23.972 --> 20:27.376
the next to speak 
was a responsible brother.

20:27.376 --> 20:30.746
And we have a responsible brother 
who is going to speak to us next,

20:30.746 --> 20:32.748
Brother Hermanus van Selm.

20:32.748 --> 20:35.117
He’s a helper to the Writing Committee,

20:35.117 --> 20:39.221
and Brother van Selm is going to speak 
to us on the interesting theme

20:39.221 --> 20:44.226
“See and Be Jehovah’s Hand.”

20:47.562 --> 20:51.833
Think for a moment 
of your congregation back home.

20:51.833 --> 20:56.305
Imagine that Jehovah observes 
there a dear elderly sister

20:56.305 --> 21:00.709
who has suffered 
one painful setback after another.

21:00.709 --> 21:03.645
As a result, she is heartbroken.

21:03.645 --> 21:07.282
She even feels that Jehovah 
doesn’t love her anymore.

21:07.282 --> 21:09.384
But then through the working of his spirit,

21:09.384 --> 21:11.553
Jehovah makes you aware of her situation.

21:11.553 --> 21:14.256
You want to help your dear sister, 
but you wonder:

21:14.256 --> 21:18.860
‘How can I show her 
that Jehovah is still reaching out to her?

21:18.860 --> 21:21.029
‘How can I help her to see

21:21.029 --> 21:24.866
Jehovah’s supporting hand 
at work in her life?’

21:25.867 --> 21:28.770
To answer, 
let us consider a few verses

21:28.770 --> 21:31.039
in the Bible book of Ruth,

21:31.039 --> 21:33.375
which relates the touching story

21:33.375 --> 21:37.045
of Naomi, Ruth, and Boaz.

21:37.980 --> 21:41.683
As we remember, 
Naomi’s husband had died.

21:41.683 --> 21:43.952
Then her two sons got married,

21:43.952 --> 21:47.756
but sadly, 
both of them also died.

21:47.756 --> 21:49.891
Those blows caused Naomi

21:49.891 --> 21:53.328
to sink deeper and deeper into despair.

21:53.328 --> 21:56.765
She even felt 
that Jehovah had abandoned her.

21:56.765 --> 22:01.403
Note at chapter 1, verse 13, 
at the end of the verse,

22:01.403 --> 22:04.439
note what Naomi said:

22:04.439 --> 22:09.444
“The hand of Jehovah 
has turned against me.”

22:09.444 --> 22:12.781
Verse 20, at the end of the verse:

22:12.781 --> 22:17.786
“The Almighty has made 
my life very bitter for me.”

22:17.786 --> 22:21.223
Verse 21, 
at the end of the verse:

22:21.223 --> 22:23.825
“Jehovah who opposed me

22:23.825 --> 22:27.929
and the Almighty who caused me calamity.”

22:27.929 --> 22:30.065
Now, these were strong statements,

22:30.065 --> 22:32.367
but, of course, 
none of them were true.

22:32.367 --> 22:35.037
Jehovah had not turned against her.

22:35.037 --> 22:38.273
Jehovah had not caused her calamity.

22:38.273 --> 22:42.744
So how did Jehovah react 
to Naomi’s bitter words?

22:42.744 --> 22:46.548
Well, he did not send 
fire from heaven to punish her.

22:46.548 --> 22:49.351
He did not send 
a prophet to reprove her.

22:49.351 --> 22:53.588
Instead, 
he used Ruth and Boaz

22:53.588 --> 22:55.957
to reach out to Naomi

22:55.957 --> 22:59.594
and pull her gently out of her despair.

22:59.594 --> 23:02.497
In a sense, 
Jehovah gave Ruth and Boaz

23:02.497 --> 23:05.934
the privilege to serve as His hand

23:05.934 --> 23:08.703
—that is, the means 
through which He could provide

23:08.703 --> 23:12.240
support to Naomi.

23:12.240 --> 23:17.012
In this class, 
we have 22 Ruth-like sisters

23:17.012 --> 23:20.916
and 27 Boaz-like brothers.

23:20.916 --> 23:25.087
Also, there are thousands 
of Ruths and Boazes in this audience.

23:25.087 --> 23:28.290
So how can we be Jehovah’s hand?

23:28.290 --> 23:31.393
And how can we help 
the Naomis in our congregation

23:31.393 --> 23:34.696
to see Jehovah’s hand at work in their life?

23:35.864 --> 23:39.868
To answer, 
we will consider five steps

23:39.868 --> 23:41.870
mentioned in the book of Ruth

23:41.870 --> 23:46.875
that we could follow to help 
our fellow worshippers who are in need.

23:48.110 --> 23:52.714
Step number one: 
Have the right motivation.

23:52.714 --> 23:55.917
Since helping those in need 
takes great effort,

23:55.917 --> 23:58.053
we have to be motivated by love.

23:58.053 --> 24:01.423
But it needs to be a special kind of love.

24:01.423 --> 24:03.425
What do we mean?

24:03.425 --> 24:06.561
Well, love is a bit like coffee.

24:06.561 --> 24:09.531
Coffee? 
In what way?

24:09.531 --> 24:11.666
Well, coffee comes in different types,

24:11.666 --> 24:15.804
such as cappuccino, caffe latte, caffe mocha

24:15.804 --> 24:17.806
—mmm.

24:17.806 --> 24:21.009
Similarly, love comes in different types,

24:21.009 --> 24:26.014
such as love for family, 
brotherly love, principled love.

24:26.014 --> 24:29.384
But the love considered in the book of Ruth

24:29.384 --> 24:31.720
is yet of a different type.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.388
What is it?

24:33.388 --> 24:37.492
It is mentioned at chapter 1, verse 8:

24:37.492 --> 24:40.795
“Naomi said to both of her daughters-in-law:

24:40.795 --> 24:45.800
“‘Go, return, 
each of you to your mother’s home.

24:45.800 --> 24:50.438
“‘May Jehovah show loyal love to you,

24:50.438 --> 24:55.210
just as you have shown it to the men 
who have died and to me.’”

24:56.311 --> 24:58.313
“Loyal love.”

24:58.313 --> 25:00.081
What kind of love is that?

25:00.081 --> 25:02.083
It’s a very strong kind of love.

25:02.083 --> 25:05.554
It’s a bit like a double espresso, undiluted.

25:05.554 --> 25:09.758
It gives you a real boost that helps you 
to attach yourself to a brother in need

25:09.758 --> 25:13.695
and to cling to him until you 
have pulled him out of his despair.

25:13.695 --> 25:18.700
Now, that’s the type of love 
we show to our brothers and sisters in need.

25:20.702 --> 25:25.640
Step number two: 
Be persistent.

25:25.640 --> 25:29.911
When Ruth offered 
her helping hand to Naomi,

25:29.911 --> 25:34.149
Naomi first refused to accept it.

25:34.149 --> 25:38.520
But Ruth, motivated by loyal love, 
did not take no for an answer.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.522
What was the result?

25:40.522 --> 25:43.491
Chapter 1, verse 18:

25:43.491 --> 25:47.662
“When Naomi saw 
that Ruth insisted on going with her,

25:47.662 --> 25:52.267
she stopped trying to convince her.”

25:52.267 --> 25:55.770
Similarly today, 
a sister in despair

25:55.770 --> 25:58.707
may first refuse to accept our help.

25:58.707 --> 26:03.211
Even so, loyal love 
will move us to cling to that sister,

26:03.211 --> 26:07.782
hoping that she will eventually accept 
our hand of friendship.

26:09.317 --> 26:14.289
Step number three: 
Don’t take it personally.

26:14.289 --> 26:17.225
When Naomi and Ruth 
arrived in Bethlehem,

26:17.225 --> 26:19.661
Naomi met her former neighbors.

26:19.661 --> 26:21.663
What did she tell them?

26:21.663 --> 26:24.799
Chapter 1, verse 21:

26:24.799 --> 26:28.169
“I was full when I went,

26:28.169 --> 26:33.208
but Jehovah made me return empty-handed.”

26:36.544 --> 26:38.913
What did she tell them?

26:38.913 --> 26:43.051
Now, put yourself in the place of Ruth.

26:43.051 --> 26:46.921
She had gone out of her way to help Naomi.

26:46.921 --> 26:50.292
She cried with her, she comforted her,

26:50.292 --> 26:53.428
she walked with her for days on end.

26:53.428 --> 26:57.098
And then, 
with Ruth standing next to her,

26:57.098 --> 27:02.103
Naomi said, 
‘I returned empty-handed.’

27:02.103 --> 27:06.708
She did not even acknowledge 
the presence of Ruth.

27:06.708 --> 27:11.279
How painful that must have been 
for our dear Ruth.

27:11.279 --> 27:15.350
Yet, Ruth stuck with Naomi.

27:15.350 --> 27:18.386
Likewise today, a brother or sister,

27:18.386 --> 27:20.889
because of their bitter feelings of despair,

27:20.889 --> 27:23.792
may speak to us or treat us in a hurtful way

27:23.792 --> 27:27.162
in spite of all of our efforts to help them.

27:27.162 --> 27:31.433
But we try not to take it personally.

27:31.433 --> 27:34.469
We stick with our sister in need 
and pray to Jehovah:

27:34.469 --> 27:37.038
“Please, open the sister’s eyes.

27:37.038 --> 27:40.675
Let her see your outstretched hand.”

27:40.675 --> 27:44.312
Step number four: 
Give practical help.

27:44.312 --> 27:47.015
Ruth realized that Naomi’s depression

27:47.015 --> 27:49.884
prevented her from taking the initiative.

27:49.884 --> 27:52.187
So, what did Ruth do?

27:52.187 --> 27:55.657
Chapter 2, verse 2:

27:55.657 --> 27:58.393
“Ruth . . . said to Naomi:

27:58.393 --> 28:00.395
“‘Let me go out, please,

28:00.395 --> 28:03.198
“‘to the fields 
and glean among the ears of grain

28:03.198 --> 28:06.534
behind whoever 
looks on me with favor.’”

28:06.534 --> 28:09.804
Now, today, we also realize 
that the brother in despair

28:09.804 --> 28:14.809
may lack the energy 
to take any initiative to help himself.

28:14.809 --> 28:18.813
So loyal love for our brother moves us

28:18.813 --> 28:22.650
to take the first step 
in giving him practical help

28:22.650 --> 28:26.020
in and around his house.

28:26.020 --> 28:29.958
Step number five: 
Get encouragement.

28:29.958 --> 28:32.494
Ruth badly needed encouragement,

28:32.494 --> 28:35.764
and Jehovah moved Boaz to give it to her.

28:35.764 --> 28:37.866
Look at chapter 2, verse 12.

28:37.866 --> 28:41.336
Boaz said to Ruth:

28:41.336 --> 28:45.807
“May Jehovah reward you 
for what you have done,

28:45.807 --> 28:48.443
“and may there be 
a perfect wage for you

28:48.443 --> 28:50.712
“from Jehovah the God of Israel,

28:50.712 --> 28:55.450
under whose wings 
you have come to seek refuge.”

28:55.450 --> 28:57.886
Now, after Ruth had been hearing

28:57.886 --> 29:00.889
negative talk for so long,

29:00.889 --> 29:03.191
those heartwarming words of Boaz

29:03.191 --> 29:05.193
deeply touched her.

29:05.193 --> 29:08.930
In response, in the middle of verse 13 
we read that Ruth said to Boaz:

29:08.930 --> 29:10.965
“You have comforted me

29:10.965 --> 29:15.203
and [you have] spoken reassuringly 
to your servant.”

29:15.203 --> 29:18.440
The kind and timely words of Boaz

29:18.440 --> 29:21.276
gave Ruth the strength 
she needed to carry on.

29:22.444 --> 29:25.447
Today,
 the kind words of a caring elder

29:25.447 --> 29:27.482
will have the same uplifting effect

29:27.482 --> 29:29.551
on those who give their all

29:29.551 --> 29:33.221
in helping brothers and sisters in need.

29:33.221 --> 29:35.957
If we follow these five steps,

29:35.957 --> 29:39.861
Jehovah may give us 
the privilege of being his hand.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.863
With what result?

29:41.863 --> 29:45.300
Consider what happened next to Naomi.

29:45.300 --> 29:48.536
The Bible account continues 
by telling that Boaz provided

29:48.536 --> 29:52.373
a generous gift of food 
for Ruth and Naomi.

29:52.373 --> 29:57.045
What was Naomi’s reaction 
to Boaz’s generosity?

29:57.045 --> 30:01.216
Chapter 2, verse 20:

30:01.216 --> 30:05.453
“At that Naomi said 
to her daughter-in-law:

30:05.453 --> 30:08.690
“‘May he be blessed by Jehovah,

30:08.690 --> 30:11.292
“‘who has not failed in his loyal love

30:11.292 --> 30:14.762
toward the living and the dead.’”

30:14.762 --> 30:17.732
Now, 
what a turning point this was for Naomi.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.901
Earlier she had cried out in pain,

30:19.901 --> 30:22.303
‘Jehovah caused me calamity.’

30:22.303 --> 30:24.339
But then she exclaimed with joy,

30:24.339 --> 30:27.575
‘Jehovah has not failed in his loyal love!’

30:27.575 --> 30:31.412
Finally, 
Naomi was able to connect the dots

30:31.412 --> 30:33.915
and realize that when Ruth had said to her,

30:33.915 --> 30:36.618
‘I will stick with you; 
I will glean with you,’

30:36.618 --> 30:39.220
Ruth was acting as Jehovah’s hand.

30:39.220 --> 30:42.690
And then Boaz had gone 
far beyond what was required

30:42.690 --> 30:44.692
in caring for her and Ruth.

30:44.692 --> 30:46.928
Boaz had acted as Jehovah’s hand.

30:46.928 --> 30:51.499
‘Ahh, now I understand,’ 
Naomi must have thought.

30:51.499 --> 30:53.501
‘Jehovah never left me.

30:53.501 --> 30:55.670
‘He has been with me all the time.

30:55.670 --> 31:00.041
‘I’m so grateful to Ruth and Boaz

31:00.041 --> 31:04.913
that they helped me 
to see Jehovah’s supporting hands.’

31:04.913 --> 31:08.483
No doubt all three of them rejoiced

31:08.483 --> 31:11.252
over the decisive turning point

31:11.252 --> 31:13.388
they had reached.

31:13.388 --> 31:17.058
In summary, 
what gave Ruth and Boaz

31:17.058 --> 31:20.628
the strength to pull Naomi 
out of her despair?

31:20.628 --> 31:22.630
Loyal love.

31:22.630 --> 31:26.501
A strong kind of love that we give, 
not to people in general,

31:26.501 --> 31:31.506
but to our brothers and sisters, 
especially those who are in need.

31:31.506 --> 31:33.741
What was the result?

31:33.741 --> 31:36.544
Boaz and Ruth had the joy

31:36.544 --> 31:41.549
of seeing how Naomi 
regained her spiritual balance.

31:41.549 --> 31:45.653
Today, 
we may experience the same deep joy

31:45.653 --> 31:49.290
when we are able to help 
our brothers and sisters in need,

31:49.290 --> 31:54.295
to see Jehovah’s hand 
and thus regain their spiritual strength.

31:55.530 --> 31:59.801
Therefore, 
our dear Ruth-like sisters

31:59.801 --> 32:02.403
and Boaz-like brothers

32:02.403 --> 32:05.840
of class 144,

32:05.840 --> 32:08.710
it is our heartfelt prayer

32:08.710 --> 32:13.014
that the precious education 
that you received at Gilead

32:13.014 --> 32:15.717
may help you more than ever

32:15.717 --> 32:20.054
to see and to be Jehovah’s hand.

32:27.161 --> 32:31.833
Well, that was better 
than a double espresso, wasn’t it?

32:33.434 --> 32:38.306
Now we’re going to have a helper 
to the Teaching Committee to talk to us,

32:38.306 --> 32:40.808
and he has the interesting theme

32:40.808 --> 32:44.712
“Be the Keel” 
—K-E-E-L.

32:44.712 --> 32:47.482
So we’ll listen with interest.

32:49.550 --> 32:54.088
Like a sailboat in the open sea, 
you could be sailing along

32:54.088 --> 32:57.659
—enjoying life, enjoying your view—

32:57.659 --> 33:00.328
but then suddenly and unexpectedly

33:00.328 --> 33:03.398
a turbulent storm, a trialsome situation,

33:03.398 --> 33:05.633
could be confronting you.

33:05.633 --> 33:09.437
That could really rock your boat.

33:09.437 --> 33:12.140
How true are the words 
found in The Watchtower

33:12.140 --> 33:16.678
of the March 1, 1896, issue

33:16.678 --> 33:18.680
where it stated:

33:18.680 --> 33:21.382
“The Christian course of self-sacrifice

33:21.382 --> 33:26.387
“cannot be one of ease 
and continuous smooth-sailing and peace.

33:26.387 --> 33:29.123
“There may be a calm now and then,

33:29.123 --> 33:33.628
but storms and battles are the rule.”

33:33.628 --> 33:37.231
Now, if that was the case 122 years ago,

33:37.231 --> 33:39.600
way before all of us were alive,

33:39.600 --> 33:44.338
how much more so is that the rule, 
or the case, today.

33:45.773 --> 33:50.778
Life in Satan’s system 
is anything but smooth sailing.

33:50.778 --> 33:55.483
How can you students 
help others endure present storms

33:55.483 --> 33:59.821
and prepare them for future tests 
—future storms?

33:59.821 --> 34:02.623
Be the keel.

34:02.623 --> 34:04.625
What does that mean?

34:04.625 --> 34:07.261
The keel is a heavily-weighted fin

34:07.261 --> 34:09.997
attached to the bottom of a sailboat.

34:09.997 --> 34:12.934
So when strong, gusting winds fill the sail

34:12.934 --> 34:15.269
and the vessel leans on its side,

34:15.269 --> 34:19.107
the keel serves as the ballast 
—the counterweight.

34:19.107 --> 34:21.709
It provides stability.

34:21.709 --> 34:24.278
It prevents the sailboat 
from blowing sideways

34:25.012 --> 34:29.484
and from capsizing, or keeling over.

34:29.484 --> 34:31.486
Our brothers and sisters,

34:31.486 --> 34:34.422
now more than ever, 
need to be strengthened.

34:34.422 --> 34:37.391
They need to be stabilized 
so that they can face

34:37.391 --> 34:41.129
storms of anxiety, natural disasters,

34:41.129 --> 34:45.700
and wave after wave 
of ridicule and persecution.

34:45.700 --> 34:49.036
That’s the focus of Gilead School

34:49.036 --> 34:53.908
—to strengthen and stabilize 
qualified men and women like you

34:53.908 --> 34:56.410
so that you, in turn, can strengthen

34:56.410 --> 35:00.148
and stabilize Jehovah’s organization.

35:00.148 --> 35:02.683
Empowered with Jehovah’s spirit,

35:02.683 --> 35:05.086
you can be like those strengthening aids

35:05.086 --> 35:07.088
in the first century

35:07.088 --> 35:09.190
who proved to be someone

35:09.190 --> 35:11.793
who could stabilize 
their brothers and sisters.

35:11.793 --> 35:13.795
And there are many examples.

35:13.795 --> 35:17.698
But let’s look at Acts 18:24,

35:17.698 --> 35:22.703
and let’s see why the man Apollos 
is someone who we want to follow.

35:22.703 --> 35:24.972
There in Acts chapter 18,

35:24.972 --> 35:29.343
let’s read together verse 24.

35:29.343 --> 35:31.345
And there it reads:

35:31.345 --> 35:34.882
“Now a Jew named Apollos, 
a native of Alexandria,

35:34.882 --> 35:36.918
“arrived in Ephesus;

35:36.918 --> 35:41.522
“[and notice] he was an eloquent man 
who was well-versed in the Scriptures.

35:41.522 --> 35:45.026
This man had been instructed 
in the way of Jehovah,”

35:45.026 --> 35:47.762
and notice that he was 
“aglow with the spirit,”

35:47.762 --> 35:50.998
which caused him 
to speak and teach accurately

35:50.998 --> 35:53.100
about the things of Jesus.

35:53.100 --> 35:56.938
“But he was acquainted 
only with the baptism of John.

35:56.938 --> 35:59.807
“He began to speak boldly in the synagogue,

35:59.807 --> 36:02.109
“and when Priscilla and Aquila heard him,

36:02.109 --> 36:03.911
“[What did they do?]

36:03.911 --> 36:05.913
“they took him into their company

36:05.913 --> 36:10.151
and explained the way of God 
more accurately to him.”

36:10.151 --> 36:13.588
Well, what outstanding qualities Apollos had

36:13.588 --> 36:17.425
—qualities that you students have as well!

36:17.425 --> 36:19.994
Now, Apollos had his strengths;

36:19.994 --> 36:23.631
but like all of us, 
he also had his weaknesses

36:23.631 --> 36:27.101
and he knew 
that he needed to humbly get more help,

36:27.101 --> 36:29.103
more understanding.

36:29.103 --> 36:32.106
So how thankful we are, and he was,

36:32.106 --> 36:36.010
that Aquila and Priscilla filled in the gaps

36:36.010 --> 36:39.881
—helped him to appreciate 
the deeper things of Jehovah

36:39.881 --> 36:42.950
so that he could speak more accurately.

36:42.950 --> 36:46.921
Yes, this well-grounded, 
spiritually mature couple

36:46.921 --> 36:51.525
also helped Apollos learn life lessons.

36:51.525 --> 36:53.027
Like what?

36:53.027 --> 36:55.129
Like working as a team

36:55.129 --> 36:57.231
—working in unity.

36:57.231 --> 37:01.002
They also taught him life lessons 
about going the extra mile

37:01.002 --> 37:03.638
in helping those who needed help spiritually

37:03.638 --> 37:06.107
as well as materially;

37:06.107 --> 37:08.342
what it means to be generous,

37:08.342 --> 37:10.444
to be hospitable;

37:10.444 --> 37:14.715
and also the key that humility is needed

37:14.715 --> 37:16.884
in order to support others,

37:16.884 --> 37:20.521
so that we’re content in our assignment.

37:20.521 --> 37:24.792
Like Apollos, you accepted 
the invitation to come to Gilead

37:24.792 --> 37:26.794
to receive extra schooling

37:26.794 --> 37:30.231
to have a deeper understanding 
of God’s Word, the Bible.

37:30.231 --> 37:32.233
And along the way,

37:32.233 --> 37:35.336
you learned vital life lessons 
from this Bethel family,

37:35.336 --> 37:37.338
who are supporting you.

37:37.338 --> 37:39.607
You learned what it means 
to go the extra mile

37:39.607 --> 37:44.612
—to be hospitable, 
generous, kind, and patient.

37:44.612 --> 37:49.650
You also learned what it means 
to be a giver and not simply a taker.

37:50.651 --> 37:52.653
You will soon graduate.

37:52.653 --> 37:54.989
You will have a diploma in your hand.

37:54.989 --> 37:57.558
Is that it? 
You walk away and that’s it?

37:57.558 --> 37:59.560
That’s all for your instruction?

37:59.560 --> 38:00.728
Of course not.

38:00.728 --> 38:02.830
We know Jehovah promises

38:02.830 --> 38:06.367
that he will continue 
to give you instruction.

38:06.367 --> 38:11.172
In fact, at 1 Peter chapter 5, 
notice verse 10.

38:13.140 --> 38:15.643
There at 1 Peter 5:10,

38:15.643 --> 38:20.047
Jehovah promises 
that he will “finish your training.”

38:20.047 --> 38:22.783
Well, how will he finish your training?

38:22.783 --> 38:25.453
It goes on to say 
that his continued training

38:25.453 --> 38:27.455
“will make you firm,”

38:27.455 --> 38:29.457
it “will make you strong,”

38:29.457 --> 38:32.326
and “he will firmly ground you.”

38:32.326 --> 38:35.830
So just as a keel 
is filled with heavy weight

38:35.830 --> 38:39.834
to keep the boat stable and upright,

38:39.834 --> 38:44.038
so too Jehovah promises 
to give you his powerful holy spirit

38:44.038 --> 38:47.241
so that you 
can be strengthened and stabilized

38:47.241 --> 38:49.710
and help others to do the same

38:49.710 --> 38:52.079
—to be firmly grounded.

38:52.079 --> 38:56.083
Now, because Apollos was humble 
and he accepted the help,

38:56.083 --> 39:00.921
he put himself in a position 
to be used mightily by Jehovah

39:00.921 --> 39:03.057
and by his organization.

39:03.057 --> 39:07.561
Now, what did he do to greatly help 
the congregations back then?

39:07.561 --> 39:11.732
Notice Acts 18:27.

39:11.732 --> 39:15.736
There at Acts 18:27,

39:15.736 --> 39:19.974
Apollos not only helped 
the congregation in Achaia

39:19.974 --> 39:24.812
but it says 
that “he greatly helped” them.

39:24.812 --> 39:28.182
And it went on to say 
in another translation of this verse

39:28.182 --> 39:31.419
that “he powerfully reinforced” them.

39:31.419 --> 39:34.922
So he was really someone 
who took the training

39:34.922 --> 39:37.124
and really made it happen.

39:37.124 --> 39:39.126
In fact, if you look at verse 28,

39:39.126 --> 39:43.431
he set an example of someone 
who should be zealous in the ministry.

39:43.431 --> 39:46.500
He used the Scriptures 
that he had at the time,

39:46.500 --> 39:48.903
and he used these as his authority.

39:48.903 --> 39:50.604
And how did he speak?

39:50.604 --> 39:54.141
Verse 28 says “with great intensity.”

39:54.141 --> 39:56.143
So we could say

39:56.143 --> 40:00.581
that basically Apollos 
was a keel with zeal.

40:01.916 --> 40:06.020
And we look forward to seeing 
how you will use your Gilead training

40:06.020 --> 40:08.522
to greatly help others in your assignments

40:08.522 --> 40:11.859
and doing so with great intensity.

40:11.859 --> 40:13.861
Now, when you look at a sailboat,

40:13.861 --> 40:16.564
what’s the first thing that you normally see?

40:16.564 --> 40:18.232
Isn’t it the sail?

40:18.232 --> 40:19.233
Why?

40:19.233 --> 40:23.938
Because it’s the most prominent, 
outstanding thing on a sailboat.

40:23.938 --> 40:27.007
Now, the keel, 
on the other hand, is unseen.

40:27.007 --> 40:30.077
It’s below the water, 
below the boat, but there it is.

40:30.077 --> 40:31.745
It’s doing its job.

40:31.745 --> 40:36.584
It’s keeping that sailboat upright, 
supported, and stabilized.

40:36.584 --> 40:40.421
Now, you could hardly imagine 
Apollos thinking to himself:

40:40.421 --> 40:43.023
‘I know that my assignment as a keel

40:43.023 --> 40:45.025
‘—as a support, as a stabilizer—

40:45.025 --> 40:49.697
‘is important, but I don’t think 
I’m being tapped into my true potential.

40:49.697 --> 40:52.133
‘I don’t think the brothers 
can really see me down here,

40:52.133 --> 40:54.401
‘doing all that I’m supposed to do.

40:54.401 --> 40:57.404
‘Yes, I know that I’m not an apostle.

40:57.404 --> 41:00.307
‘I’m not being used 
to write inspired letters,

41:00.307 --> 41:02.343
‘although I would be a logical choice.

41:04.078 --> 41:09.083
‘If only, if only, I could have 
a more elevated, higher position,

41:09.083 --> 41:11.252
‘maybe like the sail.

41:11.252 --> 41:14.054
‘If I was the sail, everyone could see me

41:14.054 --> 41:16.524
‘and I could get more airtime.

41:16.524 --> 41:18.826
‘And then everyone could hear me

41:18.826 --> 41:21.495
and my words that are so eloquent.’

41:21.495 --> 41:23.497
Well, we know that that’s ridiculous.

41:23.497 --> 41:27.968
He never thought that, 
and he never acted that way toward others.

41:27.968 --> 41:30.905
The Bible only reveals just a fraction

41:30.905 --> 41:33.874
of all that Apollos said and that he did.

41:33.874 --> 41:35.609
But what we do know

41:35.609 --> 41:39.146
is that the most outstanding 
and most prominent thing about Apollos

41:39.146 --> 41:41.148
was his humility.

41:41.148 --> 41:43.751
He was willing, humble,

41:43.751 --> 41:48.322
to do anything 
wherever he was sent to go.

41:48.322 --> 41:53.027
He never allowed his strengths 
to become weaknesses.

41:53.027 --> 41:56.730
Likewise, 
much of what you, Gilead students,

41:56.730 --> 42:00.100
will do in the future 
will be unseen by others.

42:00.100 --> 42:03.737
But you know 
that Jehovah sees everything you do

42:03.737 --> 42:06.640
and all the work and the stabilizing you do

42:06.640 --> 42:09.410
in behalf of his precious sheep.

42:09.410 --> 42:14.448
You students have many gifts, 
many strengths, many abilities.

42:14.448 --> 42:17.651
But your humility must exceed

42:17.651 --> 42:20.254
any gifts or strengths that you have;

42:20.254 --> 42:24.992
never allow your strengths 
to become your weakness.

42:24.992 --> 42:29.997
Remember, 
ability without humility is a liability,

42:31.565 --> 42:36.070
but ability with humility is stability.

42:36.070 --> 42:39.006
And that’s the key to a keel.

42:39.006 --> 42:41.442
And no doubt 
when you look back at your life,

42:41.442 --> 42:45.145
there were many 
that served as a keel for you.

42:45.145 --> 42:47.848
They were the ones 
who stabilized you, balanced you,

42:47.848 --> 42:49.650
when you needed it most.

42:49.650 --> 42:51.852
When you were going 
through turbulent storms in your life,

42:51.852 --> 42:53.854
they were there for you.

42:53.854 --> 42:55.856
Who was your Apollos?

42:55.856 --> 42:58.559
Who was your Aquila? your Pricilla?

42:58.559 --> 43:02.196
Remember all that they said and did for you,

43:02.196 --> 43:05.799
and remember that you can be 
that person for someone else.

43:05.799 --> 43:10.204
They can help you to be balanced, 
stable, even-keeled.

43:11.405 --> 43:13.407
Now it’s your turn.

43:13.407 --> 43:18.145
Take your Gilead training 
and greatly help your brothers and sisters.

43:18.145 --> 43:20.814
Love them, support them,

43:20.814 --> 43:23.684
strengthen them, stabilize them.

43:23.684 --> 43:26.720
Be the keel.

43:32.660 --> 43:35.663
By the way, I forgot to mention 
that was Ron Curzan,

43:35.663 --> 43:37.831
in case you didn’t know.

43:37.831 --> 43:42.136
So we appreciate 
that spiritual sailing lesson.

43:42.136 --> 43:46.974
Now, at the first graduation in 1943,

43:46.974 --> 43:49.743
there were four Gilead instructors

43:49.743 --> 43:53.180
who gave parting words to the class.

43:53.180 --> 43:55.182
Three of them

43:55.182 --> 43:59.119
—three instructors, 
not the original instructors—

43:59.119 --> 44:03.190
three instructors are going 
to be on the program today.

44:03.190 --> 44:06.260
And so the first one is Brother Jim Cauthon,

44:06.260 --> 44:08.595
and he’s going to speak on the subject

44:08.595 --> 44:12.299
“Pause and Reset.”

44:13.534 --> 44:17.938
There are two things that I know about you

44:17.938 --> 44:20.941
and two things that you know about me.

44:23.010 --> 44:27.414
The first is we want to serve Jehovah,

44:27.414 --> 44:29.717
and we want to do so acceptably.

44:29.717 --> 44:32.386
And the second is we want to be happy.

44:32.386 --> 44:34.421
Wouldn’t you agree?

44:34.421 --> 44:38.225
Now, to the first point, 
there’s not much of a problem

44:38.225 --> 44:41.528
because you’ve had five months of study now.

44:41.528 --> 44:43.530
You’ve been through the Bible.

44:43.530 --> 44:46.100
You know what Jehovah expects 
—what he wants—

44:46.100 --> 44:48.302
and you’re prepared to do it.

44:48.302 --> 44:50.404
But, now, as to the second point,

44:50.404 --> 44:52.773
that can be a little bit more challenging.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.908
Why do I say that?

44:54.908 --> 44:57.644
Well, happiness can be tricky.

44:57.644 --> 45:01.448
We all know people who by all standards

45:01.448 --> 45:05.285
should seem to be happy, but they’re not.

45:05.285 --> 45:08.021
On the other hand, we know people who face

45:08.021 --> 45:11.225
many, many difficult challenges every day,

45:11.225 --> 45:14.228
but they just seem to radiate happiness.

45:17.030 --> 45:20.367
We quickly realize that happiness

45:20.367 --> 45:24.037
is not dependent 
on things, on circumstances,

45:24.037 --> 45:26.039
or even on people.

45:26.039 --> 45:27.508
Why is that?

45:27.508 --> 45:31.345
It’s because true happiness 
is not an end goal;

45:31.345 --> 45:33.447
it is a by-product.

45:33.447 --> 45:36.417
But a by-product of what?

45:36.417 --> 45:40.754
Well, the answer to that question 
lies back in time.

45:40.754 --> 45:44.925
Open your Bibles, if you would, 
to Deuteronomy chapter 16.

45:46.560 --> 45:50.898
And here, discussing one 
of the three annual festivals

45:50.898 --> 45:54.168
that Jehovah required 
the Israelites to attend,

45:54.168 --> 45:58.872
in verse 15 he gave these words.

45:58.872 --> 46:03.210
He said: “Seven days you will celebrate 
the festival to Jehovah your God

46:03.210 --> 46:05.579
“in the place that Jehovah chooses,

46:05.579 --> 46:10.517
“for Jehovah your God will bless 
all your produce and all that you do,

46:10.517 --> 46:14.988
and you will become nothing but joyful.”

46:14.988 --> 46:18.258
Now, did you notice Jehovah’s words there?

46:18.258 --> 46:22.696
“You will become nothing but joyful.”

46:22.696 --> 46:27.034
You see, being joyful 
as a worshipper of Jehovah

46:27.034 --> 46:29.036
was not an option.

46:29.036 --> 46:32.706
He actually made it an act of worship.

46:32.706 --> 46:34.708
But why?

46:34.708 --> 46:38.078
It’s because imperfect humans 
can lose their appreciation

46:38.078 --> 46:41.615
for things that become 
a routine part of life,

46:41.615 --> 46:46.620
even if these things are a reflection 
of Jehovah’s loving concern.

46:47.554 --> 46:51.391
So, what was it about these festivals 
that would cause all who attended them

46:51.391 --> 46:54.528
to “become nothing but joyful”?

46:54.528 --> 46:57.498
Well, each festival was to be a time

46:57.498 --> 47:00.701
when the Israelites 
stopped what they were doing.

47:00.701 --> 47:03.770
In other words, they would pause,

47:03.770 --> 47:06.640
and they would go up to Jerusalem

47:06.640 --> 47:10.577
to reflect on the blessings 
that they had received from Jehovah

47:10.577 --> 47:12.813
and that they were receiving.

47:12.813 --> 47:16.283
In other words, they would reset.

47:16.283 --> 47:21.121
What effect did this pause and reset 
have on the Israelites?

47:21.121 --> 47:24.691
One word 
—gratitude.

47:24.691 --> 47:28.095
You know what happens 
when we feel gratitude?

47:28.095 --> 47:30.697
Happiness always follows.

47:30.697 --> 47:32.699
You remember Jehovah’s words:

47:32.699 --> 47:35.235
“You will become nothing but joyful,”

47:35.235 --> 47:40.240
and Jehovah knows that happiness 
is a by-product of gratitude.

47:40.240 --> 47:44.912
Now, how does this ancient example 
help us today?

47:44.912 --> 47:49.550
Well, life in this old system 
is filled with hardships.

47:49.550 --> 47:54.087
Ahead of you 
will be challenges, uncertainties,

47:54.087 --> 47:56.356
“time and unforeseen occurrence.”

47:56.356 --> 47:59.159
And really, that’s true for all of us.

47:59.159 --> 48:01.161
Jehovah knows this,

48:01.161 --> 48:06.099
but he also knows 
that it is precisely during times of crisis

48:06.099 --> 48:08.535
that we have the most to gain

48:08.535 --> 48:12.239
by having a grateful perspective.

48:12.239 --> 48:17.244
Gratitude reminds us that our Creator 
loves us and that he cares about us.

48:17.244 --> 48:21.315
It reminds us that God’s goodness exists

48:21.315 --> 48:25.018
even in the worst that life has to offer.

48:25.018 --> 48:29.723
Gratitude doesn’t cure suffering, 
but it has the power to heal.

48:29.723 --> 48:32.893
Gratitude doesn’t erase despair,

48:32.893 --> 48:36.396
but it has the power to radiate hope.

48:36.396 --> 48:41.168
Gratitude nullifies negativity.

48:41.168 --> 48:45.138
“The joy of Jehovah 
[becomes our] stronghold.”

48:45.138 --> 48:47.474
But it’s up to us.

48:47.474 --> 48:49.977
Because gratitude 
is more than just a feeling,

48:49.977 --> 48:51.979
brothers and sisters;

48:51.979 --> 48:55.015
it’s a mind-set, it’s a disposition,

48:55.015 --> 48:57.250
and it’s a choice.

48:57.250 --> 48:59.653
Why do we say a choice?

48:59.653 --> 49:03.357
It’s because we can make a conscious decision

49:03.357 --> 49:06.493
to see blessings instead of curses.

49:06.493 --> 49:08.795
Jehovah is called “the happy God,”

49:08.795 --> 49:13.166
and he gives us the recipe to be happy too.

49:13.166 --> 49:15.969
That recipe is found, in part,

49:15.969 --> 49:18.538
in Psalm 143.

49:18.538 --> 49:20.540
Let’s turn there,

49:20.540 --> 49:24.511
Psalm 143:5.

49:24.511 --> 49:28.949
David, the psalmist, said this;

49:28.949 --> 49:31.485
he said: “I remember the days of old;

49:31.485 --> 49:34.421
“I meditate on all your activity;

49:34.421 --> 49:39.026
I eagerly ponder 
over the works of your hands.”

49:39.026 --> 49:41.028
What’s the point?

49:41.028 --> 49:43.563
The psalmist is basically telling us

49:43.563 --> 49:45.565
that from time to time

49:45.565 --> 49:48.969
we have to stop 
and press the pause button.

49:48.969 --> 49:51.538
We need to take time to look around.

49:51.538 --> 49:56.309
Jehovah has bejeweled 
our world with daily reminders

49:56.309 --> 50:00.981
of his goodness, his power, 
but most of all, his love for us.

50:02.182 --> 50:06.253
All we have to do is take the time to look.

50:07.721 --> 50:10.357
We are immersed in the goodness of God,

50:10.357 --> 50:13.093
so pause from time to time.

50:13.093 --> 50:16.530
Take a moment to appreciate 
what God is giving you each day.

50:18.465 --> 50:20.567
Contemplate the abundance

50:20.567 --> 50:22.769
and the diversity of life.

50:23.603 --> 50:26.473
Ponder, muse, meditate

50:26.473 --> 50:28.809
on all the works of the true God.

50:28.809 --> 50:30.944
Drink in the awesomeness of the universe

50:30.944 --> 50:33.647
on a starry night.

50:35.215 --> 50:39.319
No two sunrises and no two sunsets

50:39.319 --> 50:41.822
are ever exactly alike.

50:43.390 --> 50:44.858
Look up to the clouds.

50:44.858 --> 50:47.728
What you see is ever changing.

50:47.728 --> 50:51.765
There was nothing exactly like it before, 
nor will there ever be again.

50:53.233 --> 50:56.903
The feeling you will experience 
is a refreshment of the soul;

50:56.903 --> 50:59.272
it’s a reset.

50:59.272 --> 51:02.576
Eyes see only light, 
and ears hear only sound;

51:02.576 --> 51:04.611
but a grateful heart perceives meaning.

51:05.946 --> 51:10.016
We perceive 
that Jehovah created all these things

51:10.016 --> 51:14.020
as a gift for us.

51:14.020 --> 51:18.825
That’s right; each day 
was to be a very special gift,

51:18.825 --> 51:20.861
unique unto itself.

51:20.861 --> 51:22.195
Why?

51:22.195 --> 51:25.098
To make endless life not just special

51:25.098 --> 51:28.335
but amazing, wondrous, and always a joy.

51:30.470 --> 51:33.306
Connecting with Jehovah’s creation

51:33.306 --> 51:36.109
helps to discharge anxiety.

51:36.109 --> 51:38.111
It shifts our attention

51:38.111 --> 51:40.714
to something safe, something enduring,

51:40.714 --> 51:42.849
something outside ourselves.

51:43.817 --> 51:46.853
It helps us to accept life’s uncertainties

51:46.853 --> 51:50.157
by reassuring us 
that we are a part of something larger,

51:50.157 --> 51:52.192
something everlasting,

51:52.192 --> 51:55.629
something immensely important.

51:55.629 --> 52:00.634
Yes, we are a part of God’s purpose.

52:01.701 --> 52:04.037
Gratitude is important

52:04.037 --> 52:07.040
not only because it helps us feel good

52:07.040 --> 52:11.545
but because it inspires us to do good.

52:11.545 --> 52:14.681
A grateful spirit will make you more loving,

52:14.681 --> 52:19.085
more forgiving, 
more feeling, more thoughtful.

52:20.754 --> 52:25.759
Thankfulness is a soil in which joy thrives.

52:25.759 --> 52:30.063
So open your hearts 
to the blessings around you.

52:30.997 --> 52:35.101
Let gratefulness flow 
from the inside out to others.

52:35.101 --> 52:38.271
You too “will become nothing but joyful,”

52:38.271 --> 52:40.774
and that joy will show in your smile,

52:40.774 --> 52:43.143
in your eyes, in your touch,

52:43.143 --> 52:44.511
and in your words.

52:44.511 --> 52:45.645
Why?

52:45.645 --> 52:47.914
Because gratitude

52:47.914 --> 52:50.283
is the ability to experience life,

52:50.283 --> 52:52.819
not as a test, but as a gift.

52:52.819 --> 52:55.055
It will impact every relationship

52:55.055 --> 52:57.591
that you have 
—your family,

52:57.591 --> 52:59.759
your marriage, your work,

52:59.759 --> 53:02.562
even your ministry.

53:02.562 --> 53:05.265
You’ll be in a much better position to make

53:05.265 --> 53:07.500
a real difference in the lives of others.

53:07.500 --> 53:12.072
It will liberate you 
from the prison of self-preoccupation,

53:12.072 --> 53:17.077
and it will replace a critical spirit 
with a sense of appreciation.

53:18.645 --> 53:22.048
So pause regularly

53:22.048 --> 53:25.118
to reflect on what Jehovah has given you.

53:25.118 --> 53:29.155
Give the digital world a break.

53:29.155 --> 53:32.926
Take a walk outside, and don’t just look

53:32.926 --> 53:36.162
—pause and perceive.

53:36.162 --> 53:39.933
Try to count all the blessings 
that you receive each day,

53:39.933 --> 53:44.938
and you will find it easier to cope 
with the trials and the stresses of life.

53:44.938 --> 53:49.009
We are never 
more than one grateful thought away

53:49.009 --> 53:53.113
from increased peace of mind 
and greater peace of heart.

53:53.113 --> 53:57.550
Just remember, pause and reflect.

54:04.691 --> 54:08.028
I think we all agree that we needed that.

54:08.028 --> 54:11.131
We appreciate that effective presentation.

54:11.131 --> 54:14.301
Now, the second 
of our instructors to speak today

54:14.301 --> 54:16.336
is Brother Mark Noumair.

54:16.336 --> 54:18.505
And he’s going to talk on the subject

54:18.505 --> 54:21.808
“The Unsung Legacy.”

54:22.709 --> 54:24.844
Legacy.

54:24.844 --> 54:27.314
The word carries the thought

54:27.314 --> 54:31.851
of passing on something of value

54:31.851 --> 54:34.387
to those that come after you.

54:34.387 --> 54:38.992
But what is an unsung legacy?

54:38.992 --> 54:41.895
It’s a legacy that’s unknown.

54:41.895 --> 54:45.465
So if no one knows about you,

54:45.465 --> 54:50.170
how can you pass on 
anything of value to them?

54:50.170 --> 54:52.706
Can you influence others

54:52.706 --> 54:57.077
if your work is behind the scenes?

54:57.077 --> 54:58.845
Yes.

54:58.845 --> 55:00.914
The Kenites did.

55:00.914 --> 55:04.084
They’re not included 
in the “cloud of witnesses”

55:04.084 --> 55:07.020
in Hebrews chapter 11.

55:07.020 --> 55:09.456
Yet the value of their faith,

55:09.456 --> 55:11.791
what they’ve passed on to you,

55:11.791 --> 55:14.794
is worth meditating on.

55:14.794 --> 55:17.797
They never enjoyed the spotlight.

55:17.797 --> 55:19.799
Yet, in Jehovah’s eyes,

55:19.799 --> 55:23.970
they are so precious and unforgettable.

55:23.970 --> 55:25.972
Let’s do some digging

55:25.972 --> 55:30.477
and unearth the legacy of the Kenites.

55:30.477 --> 55:32.979
And we want you to learn valuable lessons,

55:32.979 --> 55:36.282
especially lessons that will help you

55:36.282 --> 55:39.753
search your hearts and motives.

55:39.753 --> 55:42.655
The first Kenite mentioned in the Bible

55:42.655 --> 55:46.126
is Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law.

55:46.126 --> 55:50.296
When hearing that Jehovah 
freed the Israelites from Egypt,

55:50.296 --> 55:52.532
notice what Jethro said here

55:52.532 --> 55:57.537
—his response— 
at Exodus 18:11.

55:58.872 --> 56:01.441
Jethro says: “Now I know

56:01.441 --> 56:04.377
“that Jehovah 
is greater than all the other gods,

56:04.377 --> 56:06.379
“because of what he did

56:06.379 --> 56:09.816
to those who acted arrogantly 
against his people.”

56:09.816 --> 56:11.584
These are Jethro’s words.

56:11.584 --> 56:15.455
And now in verse 12, 
what he did was offer up sacrifices

56:15.455 --> 56:17.757
to Jehovah God.

56:17.757 --> 56:20.894
You see 
—this Jethro, this Kenite—

56:20.894 --> 56:23.530
he recognized that Jehovah God

56:23.530 --> 56:26.199
was directing the nation of Israel,

56:26.199 --> 56:29.836
and he recognized 
that he was to help Moses.

56:29.836 --> 56:32.105
Jehovah God was using Moses.

56:32.105 --> 56:34.541
Moses had been given this exhausting job

56:34.541 --> 56:37.977
of directing some three million people.

56:37.977 --> 56:40.413
So Jethro said, ‘How can I assist?’

56:40.413 --> 56:43.983
He wanted to support Moses
—support.

56:43.983 --> 56:48.254
So he assisted Moses 
to reach a God-approved solution.

56:48.254 --> 56:50.990
‘Select capable, trustworthy men, Moses,

56:50.990 --> 56:55.728
‘and appoint them as chiefs

56:55.728 --> 56:59.632
over hundreds and fifties and tens’ 
and so forth.

56:59.632 --> 57:02.502
Them, not me 
—them.

57:02.502 --> 57:06.906
You see, Jethro was not looking 
for a position for himself.

57:06.906 --> 57:10.310
He simply gave advice 
to be of support to Moses.

57:10.310 --> 57:11.311
Why?

57:11.311 --> 57:16.116
So that Moses could continue 
to do Jehovah God’s work.

57:16.116 --> 57:18.685
He wanted to be involved in helping.

57:18.685 --> 57:21.454
He saw Jehovah’s blessing on Moses.

57:21.454 --> 57:23.456
He didn’t criticize.

57:23.456 --> 57:27.026
Jethro didn’t sit back and say: 
‘You’re not even a fluent speaker.

57:27.026 --> 57:29.896
‘Who do you think you are, 
trying to manage three million people?

57:29.896 --> 57:32.765
I knew you as a shepherd boy, 
back with me.’

57:32.765 --> 57:34.767
He didn’t do that.

57:34.767 --> 57:36.769
He said, ‘I want to assist.’

57:36.769 --> 57:40.740
So the support of this Kenite 
proved to be invaluable

57:40.740 --> 57:42.742
not just to Moses

57:42.742 --> 57:45.478
but ultimately for the entire nation

57:45.478 --> 57:47.747
that was chosen by God.

57:47.747 --> 57:50.383
So this is your first big lesson.

57:50.383 --> 57:54.120
Like Jethro, 
look for ways to support

57:54.120 --> 57:57.123
and to be selfless.

57:57.123 --> 57:59.125
Don’t look for position.

57:59.125 --> 58:01.761
Positions come and go,

58:01.761 --> 58:04.998
but your value to Jehovah God will not.

58:04.998 --> 58:07.000
That’s what Jehovah is looking for.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.837
He loves your faithful service, not position.

58:10.837 --> 58:13.907
And rather than criticize others, help.

58:13.907 --> 58:16.576
Help your brother succeed at their work.

58:16.576 --> 58:19.112
Let them take the credit.

58:19.112 --> 58:24.117
Drain the venom of position 
and human recognition from your mind.

58:25.084 --> 58:27.086
Jesus said,

58:27.086 --> 58:31.791
“If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.”

58:31.791 --> 58:36.462
So prove to yourself 
and prove to Jehovah God

58:36.462 --> 58:41.467
that you are more 
for the Kingdom than for the glory.

58:41.467 --> 58:43.836
That’s Jethro.

58:43.836 --> 58:46.973
But the legacy of the Kenites continues.

58:46.973 --> 58:50.109
Jethro had a son, Hobab.

58:50.109 --> 58:52.879
Hobab was Moses’ brother-in-law.

58:52.879 --> 58:55.148
So when the time now came for the Israelites

58:55.148 --> 58:57.417
to travel toward the Promised Land,

58:57.417 --> 59:00.853
Moses requested something from Hobab.

59:00.853 --> 59:04.991
And that’s found at Numbers chapter 10

59:04.991 --> 59:09.495
—Numbers 10:31.

59:09.495 --> 59:13.433
Now, at this Moses 
says to Hobab, in verse 31:

59:13.433 --> 59:15.468
“Please do not leave us,

59:15.468 --> 59:18.638
“for you know where we 
should camp in the wilderness,

59:18.638 --> 59:20.907
and you can serve as our guide.”

59:20.907 --> 59:23.309
As the footnote says, our “eyes.”

59:23.309 --> 59:27.247
You see, Moses wanted Hobab to come.

59:27.247 --> 59:30.116
Why? 
He was familiar with the terrain;

59:30.116 --> 59:33.152
he knew where to find water; 
he knew where to find pasturage.

59:33.152 --> 59:35.855
Hobab saw the big picture.

59:35.855 --> 59:38.491
Hobab, come with us; 
serve as our “eyes.”

59:38.491 --> 59:40.793
Use your knowledge;

59:40.793 --> 59:43.696
use your experience

59:43.696 --> 59:45.698
as a scout for the nation.

59:45.698 --> 59:47.900
We need your experience.

59:47.900 --> 59:49.902
Hobab could have stayed home.

59:49.902 --> 59:50.903
Why go?

59:50.903 --> 59:53.573
‘I have a family; I have my friends; 
I have a comfortable life.

59:53.573 --> 59:56.175
‘Why should I throw my lot 
in with some three million people?

59:56.175 --> 59:59.012
I have no idea 
what’s going to happen to you.’

59:59.012 --> 1:00:01.014
But he went.

1:00:01.014 --> 1:00:04.651
Hobab, 
with no apparent reward for himself,

1:00:04.651 --> 1:00:09.455
used his experience to guide the nation

1:00:09.455 --> 1:00:12.725
as they traveled toward the Promised Land.

1:00:12.725 --> 1:00:14.727
Now, what does this mean for you?

1:00:14.727 --> 1:00:16.896
It means something big.

1:00:16.896 --> 1:00:20.133
During the past five months, 
you have become familiar

1:00:20.133 --> 1:00:22.735
with this spiritual terrain

1:00:22.735 --> 1:00:25.938
of the 66 books of the Bible.

1:00:25.938 --> 1:00:27.940
You’ve been given the big picture.

1:00:27.940 --> 1:00:30.610
You got it from Genesis to Revelation

1:00:30.610 --> 1:00:33.846
—history lessons, 
geography lessons, archaeology lessons,

1:00:33.846 --> 1:00:36.115
lesson after lesson, day after day,

1:00:36.115 --> 1:00:38.351
written review after written review.

1:00:38.351 --> 1:00:40.353
You got it.

1:00:40.353 --> 1:00:42.355
Use your experience now.

1:00:42.355 --> 1:00:44.357
Use that knowledge 
—to do what?

1:00:44.357 --> 1:00:47.994
To serve as a guide for others.

1:00:47.994 --> 1:00:50.096
For example,

1:00:50.096 --> 1:00:53.633
when someone faces a crisis of faith,

1:00:53.633 --> 1:00:57.403
they might find it difficult 
to travel this unfamiliar terrain.

1:00:57.403 --> 1:00:59.472
It could be challenging for them.

1:00:59.472 --> 1:01:03.910
Show them from God’s Word 
where they can find spiritual water.

1:01:03.910 --> 1:01:07.180
Where can they get refreshment? 
Where can they get the energy?

1:01:07.180 --> 1:01:10.283
Help them travel that terrain.

1:01:10.283 --> 1:01:13.186
You owe it to them.

1:01:13.186 --> 1:01:17.323
You have been given a beautiful view, 
while being here at school,

1:01:17.323 --> 1:01:19.325
of the organization

1:01:19.325 --> 1:01:23.329
—a unique vista of God’s organization 
that many will never see.

1:01:23.329 --> 1:01:26.499
You will go back to your assignments, 
and many will never experience

1:01:26.499 --> 1:01:28.701
what you’ve been able to experience.

1:01:30.403 --> 1:01:33.473
Share with them 
your memories, your experience.

1:01:33.473 --> 1:01:37.577
Strengthen their confidence 
in Jehovah God’s organization.

1:01:37.577 --> 1:01:41.714
Don’t be stingy 
by holding your knowledge hostage.

1:01:41.714 --> 1:01:45.985
Train two to become better than you.

1:01:45.985 --> 1:01:48.721
Then, they train two,

1:01:48.721 --> 1:01:51.124
and then they train two,

1:01:51.124 --> 1:01:53.726
and they train two.

1:01:53.726 --> 1:01:58.197
Imagine, if you adopt and embrace

1:01:58.197 --> 1:02:01.334
this healthy mind-set,

1:02:01.334 --> 1:02:03.436
you will help forge a path

1:02:03.436 --> 1:02:07.974
toward a strong and unified organization.

1:02:07.974 --> 1:02:10.643
That’s your responsibility.

1:02:10.643 --> 1:02:15.314
So now we have two 
—two generations of Kenites

1:02:15.314 --> 1:02:19.852
who loyally supported 
Jehovah God and his people.

1:02:19.852 --> 1:02:22.722
A legacy had begun.

1:02:22.722 --> 1:02:25.057
Would it continue?

1:02:25.057 --> 1:02:28.361
Well, let’s jump ahead 
to the time of the kings.

1:02:28.361 --> 1:02:31.230
We have 1 Chronicles 2:55

1:02:31.230 --> 1:02:34.467
that identifies another Kenite named Rechab,

1:02:34.467 --> 1:02:37.303
and his son was Jehonadab.

1:02:37.303 --> 1:02:41.040
Jehonadab lived 
during the time period of King Jehu,

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:45.144
when Jehovah God commissioned Jehu 
to go wipe out Baal worship.

1:02:45.144 --> 1:02:47.146
And then Jehonadab comes out.

1:02:47.146 --> 1:02:49.148
He meets Jehu.

1:02:49.148 --> 1:02:52.652
Imagine, he wants to meet him; 
he wants to support Jehu.

1:02:52.652 --> 1:02:55.922
At 2 Kings 10:15, what did Jehu say?

1:02:55.922 --> 1:02:57.957
‘Jehonadab, is your heart with me?’

1:02:57.957 --> 1:02:59.792
‘It is, my heart is with you.’

1:02:59.792 --> 1:03:01.561
‘Then get up into this chariot.’

1:03:01.561 --> 1:03:02.962
He pulled him up in.

1:03:02.962 --> 1:03:04.497
Wonderful!

1:03:04.497 --> 1:03:06.499
Jehonadab wanted to support [Jehu].

1:03:06.499 --> 1:03:11.504
It was a privilege 
for Jehonadab to come out publicly

1:03:11.504 --> 1:03:14.407
and show his loyalty 
for Jehu’s God-given commission

1:03:14.407 --> 1:03:15.575
—a privilege.

1:03:15.575 --> 1:03:18.344
I’m going to be with you.

1:03:18.344 --> 1:03:21.080
When Jehonadab accepted Jehu’s hand,

1:03:21.080 --> 1:03:23.216
imagine, he stepped into that chariot.

1:03:23.216 --> 1:03:24.283
He didn’t get underneath.

1:03:24.283 --> 1:03:25.351
He stood up.

1:03:25.351 --> 1:03:28.588
He was proud to be a part of that process.

1:03:28.588 --> 1:03:30.623
He in effect was saying:

1:03:30.623 --> 1:03:33.392
“Jehu, I’m sticking with you.

1:03:33.392 --> 1:03:35.428
“I’ll do whatever you need.

1:03:35.428 --> 1:03:37.730
“It doesn’t matter what the job is.

1:03:37.730 --> 1:03:39.732
I’m with you.”

1:03:39.732 --> 1:03:44.270
Like Jehonadab, 
be determined to accept the privilege

1:03:44.270 --> 1:03:47.006
of loyally supporting the decisions

1:03:47.006 --> 1:03:50.142
made by God’s visible organization.

1:03:50.142 --> 1:03:53.946
Support those decisions today, tomorrow,

1:03:53.946 --> 1:03:56.048
next week, next month, next year.

1:03:56.048 --> 1:03:57.416
Who knows?

1:03:57.416 --> 1:04:00.686
But you’re going to be 
a part of this, and it’s big.

1:04:02.088 --> 1:04:06.592
You know, from a human standpoint 
the Kenites had no royal lineage,

1:04:06.592 --> 1:04:08.661
no notable accomplishments, no home.

1:04:08.661 --> 1:04:10.830
There’s no country of Kenite.

1:04:10.830 --> 1:04:13.733
They’re easy to miss and overlook.

1:04:13.733 --> 1:04:17.403
Unsung as a people

1:04:17.403 --> 1:04:21.274
but not unseen by Jehovah.

1:04:21.274 --> 1:04:25.611
Jehovah saw these faithful Kenites 
and all they had done for his people,

1:04:25.611 --> 1:04:27.980
and he never forgot them.

1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:30.550
Jehovah didn’t forget them; he loved them.

1:04:30.550 --> 1:04:33.119
How do we know?

1:04:33.119 --> 1:04:36.222
Well, again, 1 Chronicles 2:55 says

1:04:36.222 --> 1:04:39.759
that they are part of the genealogy of Judah.

1:04:39.759 --> 1:04:41.594
They’re tacked on at the end.

1:04:41.594 --> 1:04:43.729
Jehovah said, ‘Welcome to the family.’

1:04:43.729 --> 1:04:45.731
Beautiful!

1:04:45.731 --> 1:04:49.368
First Samuel 15:6 shows 
that Jehovah protected them

1:04:49.368 --> 1:04:51.470
when Saul was going 
against the Amalekites.

1:04:51.470 --> 1:04:53.506
And the Kenites, 
get out of the way.

1:04:53.506 --> 1:04:55.508
Because of your loyal love,

1:04:55.508 --> 1:04:58.110
move out of the way 
so that you don’t get hurt.

1:04:58.110 --> 1:05:00.313
And he rewarded them.

1:05:00.313 --> 1:05:03.182
In Jeremiah’s day, 
he concluded a covenant

1:05:03.182 --> 1:05:05.985
with Jehonadab’s descendants, 
the Rechabites,

1:05:05.985 --> 1:05:10.890
because of their enduring loyalty 
for decades.

1:05:10.890 --> 1:05:15.695
Jehovah declared at Jeremiah 35:19:

1:05:15.695 --> 1:05:19.732
“There will never fail to be 
a descendant of Jehonadab

1:05:19.732 --> 1:05:22.969
the son of Rechab [ever]

1:05:22.969 --> 1:05:25.738
to serve in my presence.”

1:05:25.738 --> 1:05:30.376
Jehovah respected 
the loyal endurance of these Rechabites.

1:05:30.376 --> 1:05:32.411
He promised that they would survive

1:05:32.411 --> 1:05:37.416
the destruction of Jerusalem in 607 B.C.E.

1:05:37.416 --> 1:05:40.786
“There will never fail to be a descendant

1:05:40.786 --> 1:05:42.788
. . . in my presence.”

1:05:42.788 --> 1:05:45.758
Perhaps, just perhaps,

1:05:45.758 --> 1:05:48.995
there were descendants 
of the Kenites in Jesus’ time

1:05:48.995 --> 1:05:53.265
that later became his disciples 
and are in heaven right now.

1:05:53.265 --> 1:05:55.334
Now, we can’t say for a certainty,

1:05:55.334 --> 1:05:57.336
we don’t know.

1:05:57.336 --> 1:05:59.338
But we would not be surprised.

1:06:01.173 --> 1:06:04.677
This is a valuable lesson for you.

1:06:04.677 --> 1:06:07.813
If you’re in a land 
where our work is restricted

1:06:07.813 --> 1:06:11.150
or an area where few know 
the work you are doing,

1:06:11.150 --> 1:06:15.554
you might feel alone 
without an army of support.

1:06:15.554 --> 1:06:18.424
Be assured that Jehovah’s eyes

1:06:18.424 --> 1:06:22.461
are on your enduring loyalty,

1:06:22.461 --> 1:06:26.298
and he so deeply appreciates 
your faithfulness.

1:06:26.298 --> 1:06:28.734
You see, like the Kenites,

1:06:28.734 --> 1:06:32.471
your work 
—it might not be in the spotlight.

1:06:32.471 --> 1:06:36.108
At times, you might feel 
overlooked, unacknowledged,

1:06:36.108 --> 1:06:39.245
maybe unsung by humans.

1:06:39.245 --> 1:06:43.716
But, again, never unseen by Jehovah.

1:06:43.716 --> 1:06:46.986
And just as Jehovah did with the Kenites,

1:06:46.986 --> 1:06:49.155
know that your heavenly Father

1:06:49.155 --> 1:06:52.558
cherishes and treasures everything you do

1:06:52.558 --> 1:06:56.395
and will never forget your faithful service.

1:06:57.830 --> 1:07:00.966
The Kenites teach us what we need to do,

1:07:00.966 --> 1:07:02.968
what you and I,

1:07:02.968 --> 1:07:06.205
what we need to do 
to be approved by Jehovah.

1:07:06.205 --> 1:07:07.206
It’s so precious.

1:07:07.206 --> 1:07:09.241
What do we need to do?

1:07:09.241 --> 1:07:13.312
Nothing spectacular, just be faithful.

1:07:13.312 --> 1:07:15.614
It’s not about fanfare.

1:07:15.614 --> 1:07:19.051
It’s silent resilience.

1:07:20.720 --> 1:07:25.491
The legacy of the Kenites is now yours.

1:07:25.491 --> 1:07:27.993
What will you do with it?

1:07:27.993 --> 1:07:29.995
Be a Jethro.

1:07:29.995 --> 1:07:33.432
Prove that you love 
the Kingdom and your brothers

1:07:33.432 --> 1:07:36.635
more than your position.

1:07:36.635 --> 1:07:38.637
Be a Hobab.

1:07:38.637 --> 1:07:42.108
Use your experience 
to help your brothers find refreshment,

1:07:42.108 --> 1:07:47.113
bolstering their spiritual energy 
to climb those difficult terrains.

1:07:48.114 --> 1:07:50.182
And be a Jehonadab.

1:07:50.182 --> 1:07:52.284
Show your loyal support

1:07:52.284 --> 1:07:55.488
—your loyalty 
for Jehovah and his organization

1:07:55.488 --> 1:07:57.656
by saying, 
“I’ll do whatever you need

1:07:57.656 --> 1:07:59.658
for however long.”

1:07:59.658 --> 1:08:02.762
The job doesn’t matter.

1:08:02.762 --> 1:08:05.397
By imitating the Kenites,

1:08:05.397 --> 1:08:08.801
their example will live on in you

1:08:08.801 --> 1:08:13.806
and their unsung loyal support 
will remain unforgettable.

1:08:21.213 --> 1:08:25.618
Well, we appreciate 
that wise counsel very much.

1:08:26.552 --> 1:08:30.422
What a riveting 
and faith-strengthening program!

1:08:30.422 --> 1:08:32.658
Before we conclude,

1:08:32.658 --> 1:08:36.128
we’d like to share 
these greetings from Bulgaria.

1:08:36.128 --> 1:08:38.931
Bulgaria is a beautiful mountainous country

1:08:38.931 --> 1:08:41.200
in southeastern Europe.

1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:45.538
Individual farms 
are still an important part of life.

1:08:45.538 --> 1:08:48.507
Many people still vint their own wine,

1:08:48.507 --> 1:08:50.776
can their own fruits and vegetables,

1:08:50.776 --> 1:08:54.446
and chop their own firewood 
to prepare for the cold winters.

1:08:56.148 --> 1:09:00.686
In late 1989, when the upheaval 
of Communism shook Bulgaria,

1:09:00.686 --> 1:09:04.957
there were less than 50 publishers 
in the entire country.

1:09:04.957 --> 1:09:09.228
In 1991, 
the first Gilead-trained missionaries

1:09:09.228 --> 1:09:11.063
were assigned there.

1:09:11.063 --> 1:09:16.068
Today, Bulgaria has some 2,500 publishers.

1:09:16.068 --> 1:09:18.671
Let’s visit the congregation in Vratsa,

1:09:18.671 --> 1:09:23.709
a town where houses are built 
right up to the steep mountain cliffs.

1:09:23.709 --> 1:09:27.680
The dramatic rock formations, 
waterfalls, and caves

1:09:27.680 --> 1:09:30.382
attract many tourists.

1:09:30.382 --> 1:09:33.919
The Vratsa Congregation has 43 publishers,

1:09:33.919 --> 1:09:36.689
of which 5 serve as elders.

1:09:36.689 --> 1:09:38.691
The publishers conduct on average

1:09:38.691 --> 1:09:41.126
80 Bible studies each month.

1:09:41.126 --> 1:09:44.697
Witnesses from other European countries 
have moved there

1:09:44.697 --> 1:09:46.699
to help in the ministry.

1:09:46.699 --> 1:09:49.768
The congregation has 14 regular pioneers,

1:09:49.768 --> 1:09:53.038
2 special pioneers, and 2 missionaries.

1:09:54.473 --> 1:09:58.310
In the recent past, 
the brothers and sisters in Vratsa

1:09:58.310 --> 1:10:02.648
could be issued a fine 
just for participating in the preaching work,

1:10:02.648 --> 1:10:06.085
and some were harassed by the police.

1:10:06.085 --> 1:10:10.623
But in October 2017, 
the congregation rejoiced when a local court

1:10:10.623 --> 1:10:15.127
ruled that limiting 
our preaching work is unconstitutional.

1:10:16.262 --> 1:10:18.330
We keep our brothers and sisters

1:10:18.330 --> 1:10:20.599
in Bulgaria in our prayers.

1:10:20.599 --> 1:10:24.370
We love them very much!

1:10:24.370 --> 1:10:27.539
From the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

1:10:27.539 --> 1:10:36.876
this is JW Broadcasting.
