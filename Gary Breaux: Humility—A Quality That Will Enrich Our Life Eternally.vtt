Have you ever considered
who is the greatest example of humility?

00:00:06.652 --> 00:00:09.613 line:10% position:50% align:center
If your answer is Jehovah, you’re correct.

00:00:09.613 --> 00:00:11.115 line:10% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:16.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because every living, intelligent creation
is inferior to him;

00:00:16.078 --> 00:00:20.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet, he chose to
and continues to include others

00:00:20.332 --> 00:00:22.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his activities.

00:00:22.668 --> 00:00:27.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility can be described
as ‘lowliness of mind

00:00:27.464 --> 00:00:32.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being free from pride and arrogance.’

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:35.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person finds happiness

00:00:35.014 --> 00:00:38.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
in including others
in his life and endeavors.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of its many benefits,

00:00:42.062 --> 00:00:44.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
our theme for discussion this month is

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Humility—A Quality
That Will Enrich Our Life Eternally.”

00:00:51.322 --> 00:00:55.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s great measure of humility
became apparent

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:58.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he collaborated
with his only-begotten Son

00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:02.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
and included him
as his “master worker” in creation.

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, as angels were created,

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
these mighty spirit creatures

00:01:09.256 --> 00:01:13.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
imitated the humility
already being shown by Jehovah.

00:01:14.178 --> 00:01:16.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
These faithful angels

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
were free from pride and arrogance.

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:25.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
This resulted in everyone in heaven
enjoying peace for eons of time.

00:01:26.231 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility in heaven is like oil to an engine;

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:33.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
it keeps things running smoothly.

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan was the first one to succumb

00:01:37.117 --> 00:01:39.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the temptation of pride and arrogance,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejecting the godlike quality of humility.

00:01:43.958 --> 00:01:48.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
When he did so,
rebellion and turmoil soon followed.

00:01:49.797 --> 00:01:52.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s important for us to note

00:01:52.091 --> 00:01:55.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the need for humility didn’t arise

00:01:55.928 --> 00:02:00.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of sin,
rebellion, and imperfection.

00:02:00.182 --> 00:02:04.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility existed before these ugly traits.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:07.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s also vital for us to understand

00:02:07.982 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
that while Jehovah is inferior to no one,

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:13.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s not the case with us.

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:18.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows that the quality of humility

00:02:18.075 --> 00:02:20.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us in our imperfect condition.

00:02:20.953 --> 00:02:24.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
it will help us to imitate him,

00:02:24.915 --> 00:02:26.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
to faithfully serve him,

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to survive the end
of this system of things.

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:32.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah knows

00:02:32.131 --> 00:02:35.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humility will enrich our lives today

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:37.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eternally.

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:42.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can see how important
this endearing quality is to Jehovah

00:02:42.725 --> 00:02:47.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we read Psalm 45:3, 4.

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gave these prophetic instructions
to his kingly Son

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:53.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
before the great battle in heaven:

00:02:55.112 --> 00:02:58.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Strap your sword on your side, O mighty one,

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:02.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in your dignity and your splendor.

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:04.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And in your splendor go on to victory;

00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:08.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ride in the cause of truth and humility

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:09.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
and righteousness.”

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
These verses describe Jesus Christ

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:16.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a king riding in battle

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:20.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
to defend truth, humility, and righteousness.

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:24.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest truth he defends

00:03:24.183 --> 00:03:27.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the sanctification
of Jehovah’s great name.

00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:30.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
In connection with righteousness,

00:03:30.314 --> 00:03:33.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
he supports Jehovah’s standards
of right and wrong.

00:03:33.984 --> 00:03:36.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the case of humility,

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:38.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
he restores it to its rightful place

00:03:38.947 --> 00:03:41.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
among all intelligent creation.

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:47.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus has already reaffirmed
these timeless standards in heaven.

00:03:47.664 --> 00:03:50.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon he’ll do the same for the earth,

00:03:50.584 --> 00:03:52.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the commission to save only those

00:03:52.878 --> 00:03:56.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are humble and obedient.

00:03:56.215 --> 00:03:59.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our developing and displaying humility, then,

00:03:59.802 --> 00:04:02.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
is essential to our survival.

00:04:03.555 --> 00:04:06.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you want to know
if you are truly humble at heart,

00:04:06.433 --> 00:04:09.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask yourself,
‘How do others view me?’

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you serve as a congregation elder,

00:04:14.024 --> 00:04:18.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
do your fellow elders
feel comfortable giving you counsel?

00:04:19.363 --> 00:04:22.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was the last time they did so?

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:24.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you react?

00:04:24.368 --> 00:04:26.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re serving as a pioneer,

00:04:26.703 --> 00:04:30.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you endeavor to learn
from those with less experience?

00:04:32.042 --> 00:04:34.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do our loved ones in our family

00:04:34.586 --> 00:04:38.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
feel that we really consider
their opinion on matters?

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:43.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are questions like these important?

00:04:43.554 --> 00:04:46.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because a truly humble person

00:04:46.223 --> 00:04:51.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
will make a realistic assessment of himself
with such questions.

00:04:51.061 --> 00:04:52.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:57.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because humility
is directly related to honesty.

00:04:57.818 --> 00:05:00.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
True humility enables us

00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:03.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see ourselves as we really are

00:05:03.198 --> 00:05:08.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to honestly admit
all of our weaknesses and failures.

00:05:09.538 --> 00:05:12.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,
pride and arrogance

00:05:12.374 --> 00:05:15.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
are directly related to deception.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:20.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
An arrogant person
covers up his weaknesses and failures.

00:05:20.757 --> 00:05:22.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that can only last so long

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:27.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
because eventually ‘pride leads to a crash,’

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:30.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Proverbs 16:18 warns us.

00:05:31.894 --> 00:05:36.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider five ways
that humility enriches our life.

00:05:38.442 --> 00:05:40.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, the Bible clearly teaches

00:05:40.611 --> 00:05:44.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
that humble people receive God’s help.

00:05:44.698 --> 00:05:47.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
One example is David.

00:05:47.284 --> 00:05:50.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
He became a powerful king in Israel.

00:05:50.412 --> 00:05:53.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, notice whom
he attributed his greatness to

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:56.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 18:35:

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:00.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You give me your shield of salvation,

00:06:00.422 --> 00:06:02.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your right hand supports me,

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:05.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your humility makes me great.”

00:06:06.511 --> 00:06:11.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah is humble,
he lowered himself to assist David,

00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:15.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
enabling this humble man
to become a mighty king.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Down to our day, Jehovah delights

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:22.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come to the aid of his humble servants.

00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:27.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you not felt him ‘stoop down,’
as it were, to help you?

00:06:28.867 --> 00:06:32.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second benefit
is that having a humble disposition

00:06:32.704 --> 00:06:34.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
will protect us

00:06:34.706 --> 00:06:38.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just as a heavy coat
can protect us from harsh elements.

00:06:39.544 --> 00:06:44.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also makes our personality
more attractive to Jehovah and to others.

00:06:46.093 --> 00:06:48.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the word picture Peter used

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:51.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 5:5b:

00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:57.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But all of you clothe yourselves
with humility toward one another,

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because God opposes the haughty ones,

00:07:00.607 --> 00:07:03.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he gives undeserved kindness
to the humble ones.”

00:07:05.195 --> 00:07:09.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clothing both protects and dignifies.

00:07:09.157 --> 00:07:13.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re missing an item of clothing
or our clothing is frayed,

00:07:13.495 --> 00:07:15.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
others can surely see it.

00:07:15.914 --> 00:07:19.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, others can usually see

00:07:19.376 --> 00:07:23.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re not fully clothed with humility.

00:07:24.047 --> 00:07:27.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
In contrast,
the more humility we display,

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:31.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more attractive we are
to Jehovah and to others.

00:07:31.805 --> 00:07:34.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like a favorite garment,

00:07:34.308 --> 00:07:37.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility should be our go-to quality

00:07:37.728 --> 00:07:40.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s perfect for any occasion.

00:07:42.065 --> 00:07:44.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
A third benefit of humility

00:07:44.693 --> 00:07:47.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that it fosters teamwork.

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
When coworkers apply Philippians 2:3,

00:07:52.868 --> 00:07:55.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re able to enjoy
productive collaboration.

00:07:56.872 --> 00:07:58.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
That verse says:

00:07:59.875 --> 00:08:03.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
but with humility
consider others superior to you.”

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:14.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we appreciate that everyone
is superior to us in some way,

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:18.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be more inclined
to listen to their suggestions.

00:08:18.352 --> 00:08:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility promotes cooperation,
not competition.

00:08:23.273 --> 00:08:27.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humble people see others
as resources and contributors,

00:08:27.444 --> 00:08:29.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
not rivals.

00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:32.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider a single musician.

00:08:33.158 --> 00:08:38.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
By himself, he can generally only produce
the sound from one instrument.

00:08:38.163 --> 00:08:41.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as a member of an orchestra,

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:44.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire musical performance is enriched.

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:50.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble musician
finds contentment in collaboration,

00:08:50.133 --> 00:08:53.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if that places him in the background.

00:08:53.887 --> 00:08:58.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t aspire to receive
all of the attention of a solo performance

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:03.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to play so loud
that he drowns out his fellow performers.

00:09:04.564 --> 00:09:07.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
One translation renders “humility”

00:09:07.275 --> 00:09:09.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 2:3

00:09:09.778 --> 00:09:12.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be “self-effacing.”

00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:16.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means
to make ourselves inconspicuous,

00:09:16.993 --> 00:09:21.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
working in the background
and avoiding the limelight.

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:25.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s like a photographer
who takes portraits of others

00:09:25.544 --> 00:09:27.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of himself.

00:09:27.671 --> 00:09:30.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as he focuses on others,

00:09:30.382 --> 00:09:35.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
the photographer endeavors
to capture their features in the best light

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:38.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they look their best.

00:09:38.432 --> 00:09:42.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same principle applies
to our sacred service.

00:09:42.018 --> 00:09:44.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
In all aspects of our worship,

00:09:44.729 --> 00:09:48.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s remember
that we’re part of Jehovah’s team.

00:09:48.775 --> 00:09:52.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
By all of us humbly cooperating together,

00:09:52.237 --> 00:09:56.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be useful to Jehovah
in accomplishing his will.

00:09:56.867 --> 00:09:59.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our humility will put others

00:09:59.911 --> 00:10:03.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a favorable light
with God and with others.

00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:07.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
A fourth benefit of humility

00:10:07.919 --> 00:10:11.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that a humble person genuinely enjoys

00:10:11.089 --> 00:10:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeing others make advancement
or receive privileges.

00:10:15.719 --> 00:10:19.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
John the Baptist
is a good example in this regard.

00:10:19.097 --> 00:10:21.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
He humbly acknowledged

00:10:21.099 --> 00:10:24.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus’ ministry
would “keep on increasing”

00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:29.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
as his own work
would “keep on decreasing.”

00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:32.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did John feel about that?

00:10:32.235 --> 00:10:34.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seeing the advancement of Jesus

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:38.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
moved John to say at John 3:29:

00:10:38.533 --> 00:10:41.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My joy has been made complete.”

00:10:43.121 --> 00:10:44.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like John,

00:10:44.789 --> 00:10:48.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
humility allows a brother
to be an overseer at one time

00:10:48.877 --> 00:10:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
and one being overseen at another time.

00:10:53.298 --> 00:10:56.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you have the privilege
to serve as a congregation elder,

00:10:56.885 --> 00:11:01.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you see how this spirit
would benefit your entire elder body?

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
A fifth benefit is that humility helps us

00:11:04.935 --> 00:11:08.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
to endure opposition.

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:12.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
A humble person doesn’t feel
he’s above being reproached.

00:11:12.025 --> 00:11:16.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s able to endure unpleasant situations
and not retaliate

00:11:16.696 --> 00:11:19.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Jehovah permits him to suffer adversity.

00:11:20.909 --> 00:11:23.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the example of Jesus as highlighted

00:11:23.662 --> 00:11:26.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 2:23.

00:11:27.165 --> 00:11:29.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
There it says:

00:11:29.167 --> 00:11:33.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he was being insulted,
he did not insult in return.

00:11:33.588 --> 00:11:37.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he was suffering,
he did not threaten,

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:41.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he entrusted himself
to the One who judges righteously.”

00:11:43.598 --> 00:11:46.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped Jesus to endure?

00:11:46.059 --> 00:11:48.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility.

00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:51.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t think: ‘Do you know who I am?

00:11:51.606 --> 00:11:53.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
I shouldn’t have to suffer like this!’

00:11:55.443 --> 00:11:58.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise,
our maintaining a humble demeanor

00:11:58.738 --> 00:12:02.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
may well serve as a protection for us,

00:12:02.325 --> 00:12:05.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even moving observers
to come to our aid

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
when others oppose us.

00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:13.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve just talked
about five benefits of humility,

00:12:13.086 --> 00:12:15.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there are many others.

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:19.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if we find
that our background or culture

00:12:19.426 --> 00:12:23.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes cultivating humility
especially challenging for us?

00:12:25.015 --> 00:12:27.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this is how you feel,

00:12:27.017 --> 00:12:29.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may be encouraged by the example

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:31.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a Roman army officer introduced to us

00:12:31.855 --> 00:12:33.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Matthew chapter 8.

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Roman centurion

00:12:37.235 --> 00:12:40.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
had direct command of about 100 soldiers.

00:12:40.739 --> 00:12:42.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
He likely had a past littered

00:12:42.907 --> 00:12:46.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
with many acts of violence and bloodshed.

00:12:46.328 --> 00:12:49.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility was likely not a quality associated

00:12:49.789 --> 00:12:51.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
with many officers of this rank.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:56.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the account at Matthew 8:5-8:

00:12:58.006 --> 00:13:01.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he [Jesus] entered Capernaum,

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:05.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“an army officer came to him,
pleading with him and saying:

00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:09.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Sir, my servant
is laid up in the house with paralysis,

00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:12.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he is suffering terribly.’

00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:16.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He said to him:
‘When I get there, I will cure him.’

00:13:16.691 --> 00:13:19.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The army officer replied:

00:13:19.152 --> 00:13:23.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Sir, I am not worthy
to have you come under my roof,

00:13:23.406 --> 00:13:27.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
but just say the word
and my servant will be healed.’”

00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:33.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
The officer’s addressing Jesus twice as “Sir”
was significant,

00:13:33.541 --> 00:13:37.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
since Romans generally despised Jews.

00:13:37.671 --> 00:13:40.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
This army officer also said in verse 8:

00:13:40.965 --> 00:13:43.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am not worthy.”

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:47.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, “I’m not important enough
for you to come under my roof.”

00:13:49.099 --> 00:13:51.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though unnamed in the Scriptures,

00:13:51.393 --> 00:13:56.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
he proved himself
to be an outstanding example of humility.

00:13:56.773 --> 00:13:59.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what Jesus said about this officer

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:01.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 8:10:

00:14:02.696 --> 00:14:04.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Jesus heard that,

00:14:04.489 --> 00:14:07.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was amazed
and said to those following him:

00:14:07.659 --> 00:14:09.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I tell you the truth,

00:14:09.703 --> 00:14:13.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
with no one in Israel
have I found so great a faith.’”

00:14:14.791 --> 00:14:17.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does this account encourage us?

00:14:17.752 --> 00:14:21.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite our past, like the army officer,

00:14:21.464 --> 00:14:24.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us can develop humility.

00:14:24.801 --> 00:14:26.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we do so?

00:14:27.595 --> 00:14:31.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cultivate a desire
to be humble to your very core.

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:36.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Frequently remind yourself
that to please God,

00:14:36.354 --> 00:14:38.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
you must be humble.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:42.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also remember that pride and arrogance

00:14:42.277 --> 00:14:44.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
are traits of Satan.

00:14:44.904 --> 00:14:47.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep the correct perspective

00:14:47.449 --> 00:14:50.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
by meditating on your insignificance

00:14:50.243 --> 00:14:52.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
compared to Jehovah.

00:14:52.662 --> 00:14:54.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
And pray to Jehovah for help

00:14:54.706 --> 00:14:57.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
to display humility as he does.
