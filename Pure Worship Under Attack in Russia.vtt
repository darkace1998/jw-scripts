00:02.085 --> 00:04.953
Welcome to this special update. 


00:04.953 --> 00:08.056
Pure worship is under attack 


00:08.057 --> 00:10.060
in the country of Russia. 


00:10.060 --> 00:12.495
In this program, we will update you 


00:12.495 --> 00:16.432
on our efforts to defend 
God’s precious Word, the Bible, 


00:16.432 --> 00:19.969
from those who 
would seek to ban it in Russia. 


00:19.968 --> 00:23.171
We will interview a brother 
who was present in the courtroom 


00:23.172 --> 00:25.109
for the recent appeal hearing 


00:25.108 --> 00:29.411
regarding the New World Translation 
of the Holy Scriptures. 


00:29.412 --> 00:32.382
We will also update 
you on the court case 


00:32.382 --> 00:36.685
to seize the property 
of our branch office in Russia 


00:36.685 --> 00:38.988
and show you what has recently taken place 


00:38.988 --> 00:43.000
to seize the Assembly Hall complex 
in St. Petersburg.


00:44.360 --> 00:47.997
As you may be aware, 
on December 20, 


00:47.997 --> 00:52.902
the Leningrad Regional Court 
denied our appeal of a decision 


00:52.902 --> 00:56.874
to ban the Russian-language 
New World Translation, 


00:56.873 --> 01:00.000
declaring it an “extremist” publication. 


01:01.110 --> 01:04.080
This is against Russian law. 


01:04.080 --> 01:08.785
Specifically, 
according to an amendment to Article 3 


01:08.785 --> 01:11.487
of the Federal Law on Extremism, 


01:11.487 --> 01:14.124
signed by President Putin himself 


01:14.123 --> 01:16.658
in the fall of 2015: 


01:16.658 --> 01:19.795
“The Bible, the Koran, 


01:19.795 --> 01:22.565
“the Tanakh, and the Kangyur, 


01:22.565 --> 01:26.335
“their contents and quotations from them 


01:26.335 --> 01:32.308
cannot be recognized as extremist materials.” 


01:32.308 --> 01:35.578
With such a clear law like that in force, 


01:35.578 --> 01:38.481
any reasonable person would wonder, 


01:38.482 --> 01:43.419
‘How could a Russian court ban a Bible?’


01:43.418 --> 01:47.256
We are pleased to have 
with us Brother Moses Ajiboye, 


01:47.257 --> 01:50.694
who was present in the courtroom 
for the recent appeal hearing.


01:50.693 --> 01:53.000
Moses, it’s good to see you. 
Welcome.


01:54.297 --> 01:58.034
Thank you, Mark. 
It’s a privilege to be with you.


01:58.033 --> 02:01.036
Now, Moses, 
before we discuss the appeal hearing, 


02:01.037 --> 02:03.707
could you help us 
understand how the proceedings 


02:03.707 --> 02:08.812
against the New World Translation 
have unfolded up until now?


02:08.812 --> 02:10.480
Yes, Mark. 


02:10.480 --> 02:15.485
This case began back on August 13, 2015, 


02:15.485 --> 02:18.555
after a prosecutor filed a claim 


02:18.555 --> 02:22.292
to declare the New World Translation 
in Russian to be “extremist.” 


02:22.292 --> 02:24.594
At the beginning of the trial 


02:24.593 --> 02:27.930
back then in April 2016, 


02:27.930 --> 02:30.032
the prosecutor demanded 


02:30.032 --> 02:33.870
that the court request an “expert” study 


02:33.870 --> 02:37.707
from a panel of “experts” 


02:37.707 --> 02:41.010
who have consistently provided 


02:41.010 --> 02:45.582
biased reports 
against Jehovah’s Witnesses in the past. 


02:45.582 --> 02:49.585
Their so-called studies have been refuted 


02:49.585 --> 02:53.957
by other unbiased scientific experts as well. 


02:53.957 --> 02:57.460
Well, the judge 
then ruled to adjourn the case 


02:57.460 --> 03:01.297
and allow time 
for this “expert” study of the Bible. 


03:01.297 --> 03:05.167
The study was completed 
and submitted to the court 


03:05.167 --> 03:10.940
more than a year later 
on May 22, 2017. 


03:10.940 --> 03:12.942
As expected, 


03:12.942 --> 03:17.247
the biased study 
was full of outrageous statements 


03:17.247 --> 03:19.649
that were not based on the facts. 


03:19.648 --> 03:21.650
The study even concluded 


03:21.650 --> 03:24.320
that the New World Translation 
was not a Bible, 


03:24.320 --> 03:28.057
since it did not say “Bible” on the cover. 


03:28.057 --> 03:31.760
So in late July 2017, 


03:31.760 --> 03:35.932
the court resumed its hearings of the case.


03:35.932 --> 03:40.470
Well, Moses, can you tell us 
what it was like in the courtroom 


03:40.470 --> 03:43.000
when the trial resumed in July?


03:44.307 --> 03:50.714
Over a period of 4 days, 
there were 30 hours of court hearings. 


03:50.713 --> 03:53.883
During that time, 
our attorneys exposed 


03:53.883 --> 03:56.385
the so-called expert study 


03:56.385 --> 04:01.157
and its key claims as unfounded, biased, 


04:01.157 --> 04:04.894
absurd, inconsistent, and invalid. 


04:04.893 --> 04:08.931
Our attorneys proved 
that the New World Translation is consistent 


04:08.932 --> 04:13.569
with other Russian Bible translations 
by having many verses read 


04:13.568 --> 04:18.573
in two or more Bible translations 
for comparison. 


04:18.573 --> 04:22.378
In fact, some 25 Bible passages 


04:22.378 --> 04:24.780
were read in the courtroom.


04:24.780 --> 04:26.815
On one occasion, Mark, 


04:26.815 --> 04:30.052
the judge selected a verse 
in the New World Translation 


04:30.052 --> 04:34.124
that may have appeared 
to him as controversial 


04:34.123 --> 04:38.661
and asked our lawyer to explain it. 


04:38.662 --> 04:42.832
Of course, our lawyer simply asked 
that the verse be read 


04:42.832 --> 04:46.235
in all three different translations. 


04:46.235 --> 04:50.640
And after that, 
they all had the same idea 


04:50.640 --> 04:54.243
and no further explanation was needed. 


04:54.243 --> 04:57.080
One of our attorneys described the scene 


04:57.080 --> 04:59.382
in the courtroom this way, 


04:59.382 --> 05:02.185
and I will quote him, Mark, if I may. 


05:02.185 --> 05:07.190
He said: “Yesterday, 
the judge read a great many scriptures 


05:07.190 --> 05:09.592
“from various translations of the Bible: 


05:09.592 --> 05:13.062
“the New World Translation, 
the synodal translation, 


05:13.062 --> 05:15.832
“the modern translation, and others. 


05:15.832 --> 05:19.235
“Many scriptures were read about family life, 


05:19.235 --> 05:22.705
“raising children, and loving our neighbors. 


05:22.705 --> 05:24.873
“We read Psalm 23 


05:24.873 --> 05:29.011
“in three different translations 
for comparison. 


05:29.012 --> 05:32.582
“The judge himself read all the scriptures. 


05:32.582 --> 05:34.917
“Just imagine the scene: 


05:34.917 --> 05:38.354
“the courtroom, two prosecutors, 


05:38.353 --> 05:41.590
“three attorneys, and the audience. 


05:41.590 --> 05:44.227
“In the center of the table sits the judge 


05:44.227 --> 05:48.732
“with five to seven 
translations of the Bible. 


05:48.732 --> 05:51.500
“The judge opens 
the various Bible translations, 


05:51.500 --> 05:54.670
“reads aloud, and asks questions. 


05:54.670 --> 05:57.107
“It was a stunning picture! 


05:57.107 --> 06:01.777
It reminded us 
of a well-prepared Bible study.”


06:01.777 --> 06:03.947
Well, that’s just incredible, Moses! 


06:03.947 --> 06:06.849
Well, what were some of the ways 


06:06.848 --> 06:09.618
that God’s Word 
was attacked during this hearing, 


06:09.618 --> 06:13.000
and how did our brothers 
put up a defense for the Bible?


06:14.323 --> 06:18.995
Yes, the so-called experts attacked 
the use of God’s holy name, Jehovah, 


06:18.995 --> 06:21.897
in the New World Translation. 


06:21.897 --> 06:25.000
The “expert” study states: 


06:25.000 --> 06:28.772
“In the New World Translation 
of the Holy Scriptures, 


06:28.772 --> 06:33.042
“the dominant factor of the text 
is the ‘Jehovah’ concept. 


06:33.042 --> 06:37.480
“The ‘Jehovah’ concept 
expresses a personified god 


06:37.480 --> 06:40.517
“with such names as ‘Jehovah God,’ 


06:40.517 --> 06:43.854
“‘Jehovah of armies,’ 
‘the King, Jehovah of armies,’ 


06:43.853 --> 06:47.090
“‘the Holy One of Israel,’ et cetera. 


06:47.090 --> 06:51.027
“Thus, in the opinion 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,


06:51.027 --> 06:54.930
“he has the personal name ‘Jehovah.’ 


06:54.930 --> 06:57.867
“So the New World Translation 
of the Holy Scriptures 


06:57.867 --> 07:00.504
“does not qualify as a Christian Bible 


07:00.503 --> 07:05.173
but is an independent text.” 


07:05.173 --> 07:08.243
So in order to expose this attack, 


07:08.243 --> 07:10.311
the lawyers introduced to the court 


07:10.312 --> 07:14.317
ten other Russian Bibles 
that use the name Jehovah. 


07:14.317 --> 07:15.919
They allowed— 


07:15.918 --> 07:18.153
They also showed the court poetry 


07:18.153 --> 07:20.890
by renowned Russian poets 


07:20.890 --> 07:23.860
Tsvetaeva and Pushkin; 


07:23.860 --> 07:28.430
and books by Kuprin, 
Goncharov, and Dostoyevsky; 


07:28.430 --> 07:31.333
and excerpts 
from other classic Russian literature 


07:31.333 --> 07:34.036
where the name Jehovah is used. 


07:34.037 --> 07:38.707
They also pointed to the 19th-century 
Russian-language Makarios Bible, 


07:38.707 --> 07:42.712
produced by Russian Orthodox 
Church translators, 


07:42.712 --> 07:44.980
in which the name Jehovah occurs 


07:44.980 --> 07:49.452
more than 3,500 times.


07:49.452 --> 07:52.755
Oh, Moses, it’s so good 
to hear that the brothers 


07:52.755 --> 07:56.625
were able to defend 
Jehovah’s holy name in the courtroom. 


07:56.625 --> 08:00.597
Well, were the brothers 
able to interview any experts 


08:00.597 --> 08:04.134
who could also defend God’s name? 
defend the Bible?


08:04.133 --> 08:06.135
Yes, Mark, 


08:06.135 --> 08:10.540
the court allowed two experts 
to present testimony. 


08:10.540 --> 08:12.542
Regarding the use of God’s name, 


08:12.542 --> 08:15.579
Professor Mikhail Odintsov, 


08:15.578 --> 08:18.113
a religious scholar well respected in Russia 


08:18.113 --> 08:21.116
who is not one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


08:21.117 --> 08:24.454
confirmed in front of the court 
that the name Jehovah 


08:24.453 --> 08:27.523
has been used 
by other Russian translations 


08:27.523 --> 08:29.525
and translators as well, 


08:29.525 --> 08:33.128
including the translators 
of the official Bible translation 


08:33.128 --> 08:35.531
of the Russian Orthodox Church 


08:35.532 --> 08:39.935
where the divine name, 
Jehovah, occurs some ten times. 


08:39.935 --> 08:43.838
Professor Odintsov read 
two verses from the church Bible 


08:43.838 --> 08:48.743
that contains God’s personal name, Jehovah. 


08:48.743 --> 08:52.080
He also mentioned 
two Orthodox Church translators, 


08:52.080 --> 08:54.217
namely, Pavsky and Makarii, 


08:54.217 --> 08:59.222
who both used God’s name, Jehovah, 
extensively in their translations. 


08:59.222 --> 09:02.492
Professor Odintsov 
gave a thorough explanation 


09:02.492 --> 09:06.695
regarding the history 
and meaning of the name Jehovah 


09:06.695 --> 09:11.533
as well as the long history 
of its use in Bible translation 


09:11.533 --> 09:14.870
and in the literature of Christendom. 


09:14.870 --> 09:19.675
Thus, he completely refuted their attack 


09:19.675 --> 09:22.845
on Jehovah’s name 
in the New World Translation.


09:22.845 --> 09:24.347
Excellent! 


09:24.347 --> 09:28.250
Well, what a powerful defense 
for God’s name, Jehovah! 


09:28.250 --> 09:30.720
Well, now, didn’t you also say, Moses, 


09:30.720 --> 09:35.290
that these so-called experts 
had said that the New World Translation 


09:35.290 --> 09:39.928
was not a Bible because the word 
“Bible” did not appear on the cover?


09:39.928 --> 09:42.931
Yes, Mark, that’s right. 


09:42.932 --> 09:46.669
The study also claimed 
that the New World Translation is not a Bible 


09:46.668 --> 09:51.373
because it does not expressly say 
that it is a Bible. 


09:51.373 --> 09:56.245
However, Professor Odintsov 
explained to the court 


09:56.245 --> 09:59.548
that in line with scientific criteria, 


09:59.548 --> 10:04.386
the words “Scriptures” and “Holy Scriptures” 


10:04.387 --> 10:07.824
are quite appropriate to describe the Bible. 


10:07.823 --> 10:10.458
In addition, 
our lawyers explained to the court 


10:10.458 --> 10:15.163
that they were amazed 
that the court-appointed so-called experts 


10:15.163 --> 10:19.201
claimed to have worked for 287 days 


10:19.202 --> 10:21.237
on their research 


10:21.237 --> 10:23.772
and yet missed the simple fact 


10:23.772 --> 10:28.077
that in the third paragraph 
of the Bible’s Foreword, 


10:28.077 --> 10:31.580
on page 5, it clearly states: 


10:31.580 --> 10:35.985
“This new translation of the Bible.”


10:35.985 --> 10:38.653
Well, that’s just unbelievable, Moses. 


10:38.653 --> 10:42.425
What other arguments 
did these so-called experts 


10:42.425 --> 10:46.895
try to use against God’s Word, the Bible?


10:46.895 --> 10:49.765
Well, the “expert” study also claimed 


10:49.765 --> 10:53.468
that Jehovah’s Witnesses 
do not recognize Jesus Christ 


10:53.468 --> 10:55.503
as the savior of mankind. 


10:55.503 --> 10:58.406
But the first paragraph of the Foreword 


10:58.407 --> 11:01.077
to the New World Translation Russian edition 


11:01.077 --> 11:03.612
says exactly the opposite 


11:03.612 --> 11:06.949
and quotes John 3:16. 


11:06.948 --> 11:09.151
The “experts” also claimed 


11:09.152 --> 11:11.387
that the New World Translation is not a Bible 


11:11.387 --> 11:16.392
because it allegedly has been modified 


11:16.392 --> 11:20.262
to refute the doctrine of the Trinity. 


11:20.262 --> 11:22.264
Yet, our lawyers read 


11:22.263 --> 11:25.066
from the Russian Orthodox 
Church Synodal version, 


11:25.067 --> 11:28.270
two verses from that translation, 


11:28.270 --> 11:31.573
1 Corinthians 11:3, where it says: 


11:31.573 --> 11:33.741
“The head of the Christ is God” 


11:33.742 --> 11:37.880
and John 14:28, where Jesus said: 


11:37.880 --> 11:41.017
“For the Father is greater than I am.” 


11:41.017 --> 11:43.019
So these two verses show 


11:43.018 --> 11:45.620
that the official 
Russian Orthodox Church Bible 


11:45.620 --> 11:49.000
also refutes the Trinity doctrine. 


11:50.525 --> 11:53.362
We could go on and on, Mark. 


11:53.362 --> 11:56.099
But the fact is that the lower court ruled 


11:56.098 --> 11:58.866
to ban the New World Translation, 


11:58.867 --> 12:01.704
and so we appealed to a higher court. 


12:01.703 --> 12:06.541
And the appeal hearing 
was held on December 20, 2017, 


12:06.542 --> 12:08.910
as you rightly said in the beginning.


12:08.910 --> 12:11.447
Well, Moses, 
could you tell us a little bit 


12:11.447 --> 12:14.450
about the appeal hearing 
that took place in December? 


12:14.450 --> 12:16.018
I know you were in the courtroom. 


12:16.018 --> 12:18.153
What was it like?


12:18.153 --> 12:20.421
As during the first trials, 


12:20.422 --> 12:23.559
foreign diplomats from at least four nations 


12:23.558 --> 12:28.063
(Britain, Netherlands, 
Switzerland, and the United States) 


12:28.063 --> 12:32.768
attended the December 20, 2017, 
appeal hearing. 


12:32.768 --> 12:36.571
Again, there were many brothers 
and sisters present in the courtroom 


12:36.572 --> 12:39.909
because they cared so much 
about the New World Translation. 


12:39.908 --> 12:41.910
At the appeal hearing, 


12:41.910 --> 12:45.613
when none of the three so-called experts 


12:45.613 --> 12:50.886
could explain the methods 
they used to carry out their study, 


12:50.887 --> 12:55.000
the court itself intervened 
and ended the questioning of the “experts.” 


12:56.758 --> 13:01.000
In fact, Ms. Kryukova, 
one of the three “experts,” 


13:03.298 --> 13:06.435
made a very revealing statement 


13:06.435 --> 13:09.505
when she said that the only book 


13:09.505 --> 13:12.173
that can be called a Bible 


13:12.173 --> 13:16.245
is one approved 
by the Russian Orthodox Church 


13:16.245 --> 13:20.715
and that “is marked 
‘by the blessing of the patriarch’ 


13:20.715 --> 13:26.855
or that matches word for word 
with such a translation.” 


13:26.855 --> 13:31.527
When asked, Ms. Kryukova 
refused to state why she believed 


13:31.527 --> 13:34.129
that the New World Translation 
is “extremist,” 


13:34.128 --> 13:38.333
calling this a legal question. 


13:38.333 --> 13:41.136
So you see, Mark, 
neither the prosecutors 


13:41.137 --> 13:43.705
nor the so-called experts 


13:43.705 --> 13:47.910
who were questioned 
could cite even one verse 


13:47.910 --> 13:52.782
as an example of “extremism” 
in the New World Translation Bible. 


13:52.782 --> 13:56.519
Thus, again and again 
our attorneys exposed 


13:56.518 --> 14:01.456
the outrageous and false claims 
of these so-called experts. 


14:01.457 --> 14:03.459
Our attorneys presented a total 


14:03.458 --> 14:06.395
of 35 scholarly documents 


14:06.395 --> 14:09.063
containing overwhelming evidence 


14:09.063 --> 14:12.935
to prove that the New World Translation Bible 


14:12.935 --> 14:16.272
is truly the Word of God. 


14:16.272 --> 14:21.010
But these were all ignored by the court. 


14:21.010 --> 14:25.013
So again and again we had the impression, 
sitting there in the courtroom, Mark, 


14:25.013 --> 14:29.083
that the purpose 
of the hearing was not to find out 


14:29.083 --> 14:31.486
the facts, evidence, et cetera, 


14:31.487 --> 14:35.324
but, rather, 
to go through the legal formalities quickly, 


14:35.323 --> 14:37.726
since the decision had already been made 


14:37.727 --> 14:40.964
and must be announced today. 


14:40.963 --> 14:45.033
In fact, 
the judges deliberated 


14:45.033 --> 14:48.303
on the seven hours of testimony 


14:48.303 --> 14:51.340
for only four minutes 


14:51.340 --> 14:55.877
before announcing their decision 
to ban the New World Translation.


14:55.877 --> 15:00.682
Well, Moses, thank you so much 
for sharing this powerful defense 


15:00.682 --> 15:04.320
that our brothers made 
in behalf of Jehovah’s holy name 


15:04.320 --> 15:06.555
and his precious Word, the Bible. 


15:06.555 --> 15:08.823
We appreciate this report so much.


15:08.823 --> 15:10.525
Thank you, Mark. 


15:10.525 --> 15:12.762
It was a privilege 
to be there with the brothers 


15:12.762 --> 15:15.797
in the courtroom in St. Petersburg.


15:15.797 --> 15:18.400
The attack on pure worship in Russia 


15:18.400 --> 15:22.672
includes an outright ban 
on our activities in that land. 


15:22.672 --> 15:25.074
Now the authorities are moving forward 


15:25.073 --> 15:28.710
in seizing properties 
owned by Jehovah’s people. 


15:28.710 --> 15:29.978
For example, 


15:29.978 --> 15:34.750
on December 7, 2017, 
a hearing was held 


15:34.750 --> 15:37.518
in the Sestroretsk District Court 


15:37.518 --> 15:40.688
regarding the seizing 
of the Russia branch property 


15:40.688 --> 15:42.825
at Solnechnoye. 


15:42.825 --> 15:46.328
Brother Richard Devine, 
a member of the board of directors 


15:46.328 --> 15:49.765
of the Watch Tower Bible 
and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, 


15:49.765 --> 15:53.235
had the privilege of being 
in attendance at the hearing. 


15:53.235 --> 15:56.172
Richard, it’s good to see you. 
Welcome.


15:56.172 --> 15:58.707
Thank you, Mark. 
It’s a pleasure to be here.


15:58.707 --> 16:02.577
Could you tell us a little bit 
about the nature of this hearing 


16:02.577 --> 16:04.747
that you went to Russia to attend?


16:04.747 --> 16:06.015
Sure. 


16:06.015 --> 16:09.050
When the Administrative Center 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia 


16:09.050 --> 16:12.120
was declared “extremist” 
late last year by the courts, 


16:12.120 --> 16:14.122
it gave the government the ability 


16:14.122 --> 16:17.025
to seize 
the Administrative Center’s property. 


16:17.025 --> 16:20.395
However, when they tried 
to seize the Bethel complex, 


16:20.395 --> 16:24.400
they found out that it legally belonged, 
not to the Administrative Center, 


16:24.400 --> 16:28.403
but actually to the Watch Tower Bible 
and Tract Society of Pennsylvania 


16:28.403 --> 16:30.405
and that for 17 years, 


16:30.405 --> 16:33.808
the Administrative Center 
had been merely a tenant. 


16:33.808 --> 16:37.813
Since the Pennsylvania Corporation 
hadn’t been banned, 


16:37.813 --> 16:41.816
this created a legal obstacle 
for the government in seizing our property.


16:41.817 --> 16:44.587
So, what argument 
did the government use 


16:44.587 --> 16:48.000
to try to justify the seizure 
of the branch property?


16:49.825 --> 16:53.495
Well, the government was trying to prove 
that the transfer of title of the property 


16:53.495 --> 16:57.398
to the Pennsylvania Corporation 
17 years ago wasn’t valid 


16:57.398 --> 16:59.401
and that the Bethel property 


16:59.402 --> 17:02.170
still really belonged
 to the Administrative Center, 


17:02.170 --> 17:05.707
and therefore it was 
fair game for them to seize it.


17:05.707 --> 17:08.577
Richard, 
can you tell us what it was like 


17:08.577 --> 17:12.000
to be there in the courtroom 
for this very historic hearing?


17:13.115 --> 17:16.518
Well, a couple of things 
really impressed me very much. 


17:16.518 --> 17:20.855
One was the courage of the local brothers 
and sisters who came to the hearing 


17:20.855 --> 17:25.527
despite the ban just to support 
the brothers presenting our case. 


17:25.527 --> 17:30.532
It was truly a remarkable demonstration 
of strong faith and determination. 


17:30.532 --> 17:33.269
The hearing was held 
in a small, drab room 


17:33.268 --> 17:37.705
in Sestroretsk, a town not far 
from the former Bethel facility. 


17:37.705 --> 17:41.042
There was barely room 
for everyone to fit inside. 


17:41.042 --> 17:44.647
Our attorneys and the prosecutors 
were literally two feet apart, 


17:44.647 --> 17:47.415
facing each other over a small table. 


17:47.415 --> 17:50.785
The brothers and sisters 
crammed into any space they could find, 


17:50.785 --> 17:54.122
some even sitting inside the barred cell 


17:54.122 --> 17:56.492
reserved for criminal defendants.


17:56.492 --> 18:00.195
Well now, Richard, what can you 
tell us about the hearing itself? 


18:00.195 --> 18:02.430
What actually took place in the courtroom?


18:02.430 --> 18:05.833
Well, I knew from meeting 
with them the night before 


18:05.833 --> 18:08.770
how well our attorneys 
prepared for this case 


18:08.770 --> 18:10.938
and how hard they worked on it. 


18:10.938 --> 18:12.941
And to see them both


18:12.942 --> 18:15.644
—one a relatively young brother—
courageously stand up 


18:15.643 --> 18:17.880
and defend the interests of Jehovah’s people, 


18:17.880 --> 18:20.215
it was really an amazing sight. 


18:20.215 --> 18:23.152
They had real conviction and passion. 


18:23.152 --> 18:27.155
They demonstrated unequivocally 
that according to Russian law, 


18:27.155 --> 18:30.858
the international business law, 


18:30.858 --> 18:34.596
and the provisions 
of the European Convention on Human Rights 


18:34.597 --> 18:36.899
that they were squarely 
in our favor 


18:36.898 --> 18:40.568
and that to seize our property 
was not only legally wrong 


18:40.568 --> 18:43.271
but it was really morally wrong. 


18:43.272 --> 18:48.277
The prosecutors, on the other hand, 
appeared to be not long out of high school 


18:48.277 --> 18:52.547
and limited themselves to reading 
a few short prewritten statements 


18:52.547 --> 18:55.784
and asked no questions during the hearing.


18:55.783 --> 18:58.386
Well now, Richard, what was it like 


18:58.387 --> 19:02.357
when the decision 
was finally read in the courtroom?


19:02.357 --> 19:05.760
Well, I don’t think the decision 
was really a surprise to anyone. 


19:05.760 --> 19:08.130
However, it seemed to me that the judge 


19:08.130 --> 19:11.098
was very uncomfortable reading that verdict. 


19:11.098 --> 19:13.301
At the end, 
she announced that there would be 


19:13.302 --> 19:15.504
30 days to file an appeal. 


19:15.503 --> 19:18.306
Now, the spirit of the brothers 
and sisters leaving the courtroom 


19:18.307 --> 19:20.309
was somber at first. 


19:20.308 --> 19:23.645
But once we were out in the hallway, 
the conversations got going; 


19:23.645 --> 19:26.415
the brothers and sisters 
began congratulating the attorneys 


19:26.415 --> 19:28.450
for the fine witness they had given. 


19:28.450 --> 19:31.453
Once again, they were all smiling, 
laughing, hugging, 


19:31.453 --> 19:33.655
and even giving little gifts to one another. 


19:33.655 --> 19:37.000
They were once again just happy 
to be together serving Jehovah.


19:38.160 --> 19:40.162
Well, then, what happens now? 


19:40.162 --> 19:42.164
Where do we go from here, Richard?


19:42.163 --> 19:47.001
Well, the brothers are planning 
to file an appeal within the given time. 


19:47.002 --> 19:49.972
And if this first appeal goes against us, 


19:49.972 --> 19:52.240
then the property 
will be seized by the government 


19:52.240 --> 19:54.375
and used for other purposes. 


19:54.375 --> 19:59.380
However, further appeals, possibly even 
to the European Court of Human Rights, 


19:59.380 --> 20:02.050
will be pursued. 


20:02.050 --> 20:05.787
Richard, thank you very, very much 
for giving us that report. 


20:05.787 --> 20:07.789
And even more, 
we want to thank you 


20:07.788 --> 20:11.091
for the courage that you 
demonstrated in going to Russia 


20:11.092 --> 20:13.662
to stand with our brothers 
during that hearing.


20:13.662 --> 20:16.365
It really was my privilege. 
Thank you.


20:16.365 --> 20:19.200
However, 
the seizure of our other properties 


20:19.200 --> 20:22.270
has already begun in Russia. 


20:22.270 --> 20:26.508
For example, 
on December 14, 2017, 


20:26.508 --> 20:28.976
just after 9:00 a.m., 


20:28.977 --> 20:32.414
about 40 people, 
including police and others, 


20:32.413 --> 20:35.683
appeared outside the Assembly Hall 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


20:35.683 --> 20:37.685
in St. Petersburg. 


20:37.685 --> 20:40.522
Some of the men were armed 
with automatic weapons, 


20:40.522 --> 20:43.725
and others had the tools 
needed to forcibly enter 


20:43.725 --> 20:46.462
the locked Assembly Hall compound. 


20:46.462 --> 20:48.997
Thankfully, none of our brothers 


20:48.997 --> 20:52.200
were inside the Assembly Hall 
during this raid. 


20:52.200 --> 20:54.970
Russian news agencies have reported 


20:54.970 --> 20:59.107
that based on the Russian Supreme 
Court ruling earlier this year, 


20:59.107 --> 21:01.610
the government has seized the property 


21:01.610 --> 21:04.312
and has transferred it 
to the neighboring medical center 


21:04.312 --> 21:06.849
for use as a lecture hall. 


21:06.848 --> 21:11.118
They have already posted 
a new sign on the gate.


21:11.118 --> 21:13.588
In addition to these actions, 


21:13.588 --> 21:17.091
you may be wondering 
about our Brother Dennis Christensen 


21:17.092 --> 21:19.260
who has been in pretrial detention 


21:19.260 --> 21:23.232
since May 25, 2017. 


21:23.232 --> 21:28.104
The court has extended 
his pretrial detention several times. 


21:28.103 --> 21:32.673
Most recently, on December 22, 2017, 


21:32.673 --> 21:35.510
the court extended his detention 


21:35.510 --> 21:39.313
until February 23, 2018. 


21:39.313 --> 21:43.485
The authorities are allowing 
Brother Christensen’s wife 


21:43.485 --> 21:45.853
to visit him now twice a month. 


21:45.853 --> 21:49.323
We expect that his trial 
will begin sometime 


21:49.323 --> 21:52.160
in the coming weeks. 


21:52.160 --> 21:54.228
What can we say, brothers, 


21:54.228 --> 21:58.900
about this attack on pure worship in Russia? 


21:58.900 --> 22:03.272
Jehovah foretold 
that during Christ’s presence, 


22:03.272 --> 22:07.175
‘the kings of the earth and high officials 


22:07.175 --> 22:12.180
would take their stand 
against Jehovah and his anointed one.’ 


22:12.180 --> 22:17.185
We find that in Psalm 2:1-3. 


22:17.185 --> 22:21.857
Thus, we are not surprised 
to see this direct attack 


22:21.857 --> 22:23.859
on Jehovah’s name; 


22:23.858 --> 22:26.260
his precious Word, the Bible; 


22:26.260 --> 22:30.265
and his faithful worshippers on this earth. 


22:30.265 --> 22:35.103
We must keep in our minds 
the warning from our Lord Jesus 


22:35.103 --> 22:40.975
when he said at Matthew 10:17-22: 


22:40.975 --> 22:44.145
“Be on your guard against men, 


22:44.145 --> 22:47.515
“for they will hand you over to local courts 


22:47.515 --> 22:50.785
“and they will scourge 
you in their synagogues. 


22:50.785 --> 22:55.723
“And you will be brought 
before governors and kings for my sake, 


22:55.723 --> 22:59.560
“for a witness to them and the nations. 


22:59.560 --> 23:03.665
“However, when they hand you over, 


23:03.665 --> 23:08.670
“do not become anxious 
about how or what you are to speak, 


23:08.670 --> 23:12.840
“for what you are to speak 
will be given you in that hour; 


23:12.840 --> 23:17.012
“for the ones speaking are not just you, 


23:17.012 --> 23:22.017
“but it is the spirit of your Father 
that speaks by you. 


23:22.017 --> 23:26.522
“Further, brother will hand 
brother over to death, 


23:26.522 --> 23:28.957
“and a father his child, 


23:28.957 --> 23:31.894
“and children will rise up against parents 


23:31.893 --> 23:34.361
“and will have them put to death. 


23:34.362 --> 23:37.999
“And you will be hated by all people 


23:37.998 --> 23:40.535
“on account of my name, 


23:40.535 --> 23:44.738
“but the one who has endured to the end 


23:44.738 --> 23:47.108
will be saved.”


23:47.108 --> 23:50.145
Yes, as Jesus said, 


23:50.145 --> 23:55.150
all who endure faithfully 
will ultimately be saved. 


23:55.150 --> 23:57.952
Jehovah stated through his prophet 


23:57.952 --> 24:01.222
at Ezekiel 39:7: 


24:01.222 --> 24:04.292
“The nations will have to know 


24:04.292 --> 24:07.729
that I am Jehovah.” 


24:07.728 --> 24:12.733
Soon, Jehovah will act 
in behalf of all his servants who, 


24:12.733 --> 24:16.638
despite opposition 
and adverse circumstances, 


24:16.638 --> 24:21.643
prove that they are truly 
“a people for his name.”


24:21.643 --> 24:24.278
This is JW Broadcasting 


24:24.278 --> 24:34.506
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
