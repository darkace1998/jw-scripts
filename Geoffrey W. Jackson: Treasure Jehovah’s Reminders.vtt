00:01.583 --> 00:04.486
The theme for our program this month is 


00:04.487 --> 00:07.590
“Treasure Jehovah’s Reminders.” 


00:07.590 --> 00:12.028
And it’s based on Psalm 19:7, 


00:12.028 --> 00:14.430
where we’re told: 


00:14.430 --> 00:18.333
“The reminder of Jehovah is trustworthy, 


00:18.333 --> 00:22.905
making the inexperienced one wise.”


00:22.905 --> 00:27.210
In the original language, 
the word here translated as “reminder” 


00:27.210 --> 00:32.815
comes from a root word meaning 
“to go over again, to repeat.” 


00:32.815 --> 00:37.087
Reminders have always been 
an essential part of Jehovah’s teaching. 


00:37.087 --> 00:40.857
In ancient Israel, 
God’s people continually received 


00:40.857 --> 00:45.062
commandments, 
regulations, and reminders. 


00:45.062 --> 00:47.230
In fact, Jehovah tells us 


00:47.230 --> 00:50.333
that he sent 
his prophets “again and again” 


00:50.333 --> 00:55.738
to repeatedly remind his people 
of their responsibilities.


00:55.738 --> 00:58.741
The apostle Peter 
felt the need to give reminders 


00:58.742 --> 01:02.445
even to those 
who were “well-established in the truth.” 


01:02.445 --> 01:04.413
Notice how he describes this 


01:04.413 --> 01:08.585
at 2 Peter 1:12, 13: 


01:08.585 --> 01:12.122
“For this reason I intend always 


01:12.122 --> 01:14.057
“to remind you of these things, 


01:14.057 --> 01:16.960
“although you know them 
and are well-established 


01:16.960 --> 01:19.095
“in the truth that is present in you. 


01:19.095 --> 01:21.263
“But I consider it right, 


01:21.263 --> 01:23.700
“as long as I am in this tabernacle, 


01:23.700 --> 01:26.000
to stir you with reminders.” 


01:27.270 --> 01:30.340
In verse 15, 
he goes on to give the reason 


01:30.340 --> 01:33.342
why he felt the need 
to give the brothers reminders. 


01:33.342 --> 01:35.379
He says: 


01:35.378 --> 01:40.183
“I will always do my utmost 
so that after my departure, 


01:40.183 --> 01:44.000
you may be able to recall 
these things for yourselves.” 


01:45.053 --> 01:47.990
So Peter was determined 
to help the brothers and sisters


01:47.990 --> 01:51.160
in his day to remember, or recall, 


01:51.160 --> 01:54.330
the teachings they had already learned. 


01:54.330 --> 01:56.432
It shouldn’t come as a surprise, then, 


01:56.432 --> 02:00.137
if today a lot of our teaching 
involves reminders. 


02:00.137 --> 02:04.040
It follows the pattern set 
by Jehovah in ancient Israel 


02:04.040 --> 02:07.443
and with the first-century Christians.


02:07.443 --> 02:10.146
But why do we need reminders? 


02:10.147 --> 02:13.082
Let’s consider three reasons. 


02:13.082 --> 02:17.754
First, let’s look at Psalm 103:2. 


02:17.753 --> 02:19.755
There it says: 


02:19.755 --> 02:22.158
“Let me praise Jehovah; 


02:22.158 --> 02:25.961
may I never forget all that he has done.” 


02:25.962 --> 02:28.264
Why, then, do we need reminders? 


02:28.263 --> 02:31.300
Simply put, because we forget. 


02:31.300 --> 02:33.435
If we had perfect memories, 


02:33.435 --> 02:35.938
we wouldn’t need so many reminders. 


02:35.938 --> 02:39.108
Even in everyday life, 
many of us use little notes


02:39.108 --> 02:41.978
to remind ourselves 
of what we need to do. 


02:41.978 --> 02:44.413
And who of us 
hasn’t seen the need 


02:44.413 --> 02:47.283
for a list of reminders 
when going shopping, 


02:47.283 --> 02:50.151
only to realize when we returned 


02:50.152 --> 02:52.955
that we forgot to get one 
of the important items 


02:52.955 --> 02:54.957
we needed to purchase? 


02:54.957 --> 02:57.994
If reminders are important 
in everyday life, 


02:57.993 --> 02:59.995
how much more so in matters 


02:59.995 --> 03:02.000
that involve our relationship 
with Jehovah.


03:03.633 --> 03:08.000
Let’s read Luke 10:39, 40. 


03:09.005 --> 03:11.540
Speaking of Martha, we are told:


03:11.540 --> 03:14.577
“She also had a sister called Mary, 


03:14.577 --> 03:16.947
“who sat down at the feet of the Lord 


03:16.947 --> 03:19.649
“and kept listening to what he was saying. 


03:19.648 --> 03:21.650
“Martha, on the other hand, 


03:21.650 --> 03:25.000
was distracted
with attending to many duties.” 


03:26.455 --> 03:28.357
What was Martha’s problem? 


03:28.357 --> 03:30.394
She was distracted. 


03:30.393 --> 03:33.528
So the second reason 
why we need reminders 


03:33.528 --> 03:38.133
is that, like Martha, 
at times we too become distracted. 


03:38.133 --> 03:41.070
Although we may already know 
a vital fact, 


03:41.070 --> 03:44.040
that fact might get put 
into the back of our mind, 


03:44.040 --> 03:45.542
figuratively speaking, 


03:45.542 --> 03:48.000
because other matters 
are demanding our attention. 


03:49.845 --> 03:52.782
Satan is the great Distracter. 


03:52.782 --> 03:57.287
He tries to turn our attention away 
from the true issues of our day. 


03:57.287 --> 04:00.990
People in general have become 
more and more distracted 


04:00.990 --> 04:05.027
by entertainment 
and other nonessential matters. 


04:05.027 --> 04:09.499
No wonder that Satan 
has succeeded in misleading so many. 


04:09.498 --> 04:12.000
They don’t even realize 
what has happened.


04:13.335 --> 04:16.805
Reason number three 
is alluded to 


04:16.805 --> 04:20.108
at Matthew 24:45: 


04:20.108 --> 04:23.646
“Who really 
is the faithful and discreet slave 


04:23.647 --> 04:26.415
“whom his master appointed 
over his domestics, 


04:26.415 --> 04:30.587
to give them their food 
at the proper time?” 


04:30.587 --> 04:35.292
Notice that the spiritual food 
is given to us “at the proper time.” 


04:35.292 --> 04:39.195
Our circumstances in life 
are continually changing. 


04:39.195 --> 04:41.197
How often do we hear, 


04:41.197 --> 04:43.499
“That was just what I needed?” 


04:43.498 --> 04:46.868
We’ve all experienced that, 
haven’t we?


04:46.868 --> 04:50.406
So, what are three of the reasons 
why we need reminders? 


04:50.407 --> 04:53.977
One, 
because we tend to forget things. 


04:53.977 --> 04:57.547
Two, 
we often become distracted. 


04:57.547 --> 05:00.784
Three, 
our changed circumstances 


05:00.783 --> 05:04.286
may require a reminder 
of something we already knew 


05:04.287 --> 05:07.857
but didn’t fully need at that time.


05:07.857 --> 05:10.760
So that brings us to the next question: 


05:10.760 --> 05:13.262
What will help us to remember? 


05:13.262 --> 05:17.800
It’s interesting to note 
that Jehovah has used many ways 


05:17.800 --> 05:20.737
to remind his people 
of what they should do. 


05:20.737 --> 05:24.374
At Numbers 10:10, we’re told


05:24.373 --> 05:27.743
that the various festivals 
were given as reminders, 


05:27.743 --> 05:30.000
especially the celebration 
of the Passover. 


05:31.680 --> 05:34.083
That means 
that every time the Israelites 


05:34.083 --> 05:37.086
prepared and celebrated 
one of these festivals, 


05:37.087 --> 05:39.922
they were reminded 
of important matters, 


05:39.922 --> 05:43.225
such as how Jehovah 
provides for his people 


05:43.225 --> 05:46.595
and how he has saved them 
in the past. 


05:46.595 --> 05:48.765
Something similar happens today 


05:48.765 --> 05:51.633
at the commemoration 
of the Lord’s Evening Meal. 


05:51.633 --> 05:55.471
Not only do we hear 
the reminders from God’s Word 


05:55.472 --> 05:58.674
but the act of passing 
the bread and wine 


05:58.673 --> 06:01.676
also serves as an action
that reminds us 


06:01.677 --> 06:04.000
of what Jesus did in our behalf.


06:05.147 --> 06:08.550
But what do we need to do
in order for those reminders


06:08.550 --> 06:11.000
to have a beneficial impact 
on our lives? 


06:12.088 --> 06:17.593
Notice what Psalm 119:99 says. 


06:17.593 --> 06:18.728
It tells us: 


06:18.728 --> 06:22.498
“I have more insight than all my teachers, 


06:22.498 --> 06:26.501
because I ponder over your reminders.” 


06:26.502 --> 06:29.505
Yes, we need to ponder 
over these reminders. 


06:29.505 --> 06:33.275
That means not just 
listening to or reading them, 


06:33.275 --> 06:36.445
but it involves thinking deeply 
about them— 


06:36.445 --> 06:38.647
meditating on their value. 


06:38.647 --> 06:42.017
Just to listen or read  without meditating 


06:42.017 --> 06:45.020
is like looking through the lens 
of a movie camera 


06:45.020 --> 06:47.823
without pressing the record button. 


06:47.823 --> 06:50.460
We see things and hear things, 


06:50.460 --> 06:53.495
but nothing is recorded. 


06:53.495 --> 06:56.765
So we need 
to meditate, visualize, 


06:56.765 --> 06:59.135
and review these reminders. 


06:59.135 --> 07:02.472
This will help us 
to remember what we learn.


07:02.472 --> 07:06.075
But, figuratively speaking, 
there is something else 


07:06.075 --> 07:09.245
that we can do 
to press the record button. 


07:09.245 --> 07:11.747
That means we don’t have to wait 


07:11.747 --> 07:14.050
for someone else 
to give us a reminder. 


07:14.050 --> 07:16.918
We can make our own reminder. 


07:16.918 --> 07:19.655
How can we do so? 


07:19.655 --> 07:21.890
The answer to that question 


07:21.890 --> 07:25.360
is highlighted 
in Jehovah’s instructions to Moses 


07:25.360 --> 07:28.865
as found at Exodus 17:14: 


07:28.865 --> 07:31.500
“Jehovah now said to Moses: 


07:31.500 --> 07:34.403
“‘Write this as a memorial 


07:34.403 --> 07:36.571
“‘[or the footnote says: “reminder”] 


07:36.572 --> 07:39.242
in the book and repeat it to Joshua.’” 


07:39.242 --> 07:41.244
What’s the point? 


07:41.243 --> 07:45.648
Write down new things 
we want to remember. 


07:45.648 --> 07:48.818
Some brothers use a notebook, 
or exercise book, 


07:48.818 --> 07:52.755
to write down a list of interesting points 
that they want to remember. 


07:52.755 --> 07:55.725
Then they look through the book 
from time to time 


07:55.725 --> 07:58.760
to remind themselves of those points. 


07:58.760 --> 08:03.365
Many of us do this with our notes 
from conventions and assemblies. 


08:03.365 --> 08:06.002
Of course, to do that successfully, 


08:06.002 --> 08:08.770
you need to remember 
where you put the notebook. 


08:08.770 --> 08:11.073
Additionally, 
we have to be careful 


08:11.073 --> 08:14.343
that we don’t write down 
every little fact. 


08:14.343 --> 08:19.881
Otherwise, we may become overwhelmed 
with all the information.


08:19.882 --> 08:22.352
We can make 
these notes either on paper 


08:22.352 --> 08:27.257
or electronically using computers 
or electronic devices. 


08:27.257 --> 08:31.194
Whatever system we use, 
let’s make lists of things 


08:31.193 --> 08:33.000
that we want to remember. 


08:34.230 --> 08:38.567
Many brothers have found it good 
to have two separate lists. 


08:38.567 --> 08:41.337
One list could be subjects


08:41.337 --> 08:43.372
—perhaps points that we want to use 


08:43.372 --> 08:46.509
in the ministry or in our own lives. 


08:46.508 --> 08:48.843
Another, scriptures


08:48.843 --> 08:52.000
—explanations that clarify 
the meaning of certain verses.


08:53.715 --> 08:56.485
With regard to notes on scriptures, 


08:56.485 --> 08:59.522
let’s ask a very important question: 


08:59.522 --> 09:03.059
Do you have a study Bible? 


09:03.058 --> 09:05.728
What is a study Bible? 


09:05.728 --> 09:07.796
Perhaps it’s a separate Bible 


09:07.797 --> 09:10.065
to the one you take in the ministry. 


09:10.065 --> 09:12.635
It’s a Bible for you to write in 


09:12.635 --> 09:15.000
so that you’re reminded 
of things that you’ve learned. 


09:16.305 --> 09:20.977
These are some of the things 
we can do with a study Bible: 


09:20.977 --> 09:24.414
Highlight or underline some words or verses. 


09:24.413 --> 09:27.283
That will make it easier to find them again. 


09:27.283 --> 09:31.020
But remember not to make 
too many highlights or marks; 


09:31.020 --> 09:34.190
otherwise, nothing will stand out. 


09:34.190 --> 09:37.693
Write a summary of points and scriptures 
you want to remember 


09:37.693 --> 09:42.598
on the blank pages in the front 
or the back of your Bible. 


09:42.598 --> 09:44.700
Write notes in the margin


09:44.700 --> 09:47.403
—that’s what Gilead students often do. 


09:47.403 --> 09:50.740
Of course, you need 
the right type of pen or pencil 


09:50.740 --> 09:54.477
that won’t bleed through 
to the other side of the page. 


09:54.477 --> 09:57.880
What type of things 
could you write in the margin? 


09:57.880 --> 10:01.550
Perhaps new points 
that you learn while reading magazines 


10:01.550 --> 10:04.187
or attending meetings and assemblies. 


10:04.187 --> 10:07.657
If you learn a new point, ask yourself, 


10:07.657 --> 10:10.092
‘What verse is being explained?’ 


10:10.092 --> 10:14.930
And then write a brief comment 
in the margin next to that verse.


10:14.930 --> 10:16.932
Let’s take an example. 


10:16.932 --> 10:19.935
Perhaps you are reading 
the Sermon on the Mount 


10:19.935 --> 10:24.307
and you get to Matthew 7:24-27. 


10:24.307 --> 10:26.309
That’s the illustration 


10:26.308 --> 10:28.978
about the two men who built houses


10:28.978 --> 10:31.913
—one on sand and the other on rock. 


10:31.913 --> 10:34.916
As you research this 
in Watchtower Library 


10:34.917 --> 10:36.919
or the Research Guide, 


10:36.918 --> 10:38.920
you come across the article 


10:38.920 --> 10:41.657
“Are You Building on Sand or on Rock?” 


10:41.657 --> 10:45.000
in the November 1, 2008, Watchtower. 


10:46.262 --> 10:48.397
What points could you write in the margin 


10:48.397 --> 10:50.867
to help you remember the explanation? 


10:50.867 --> 10:52.935
Well, perhaps you could write: 


10:52.935 --> 10:57.407
Sand equals build on the surface. 


10:57.407 --> 11:02.144
Rock equals dig down deep. 


11:02.143 --> 11:06.481
Digging equals doing and applying. 


11:06.482 --> 11:10.854
You might even put Luke 6:46-48 there. 


11:10.853 --> 11:14.290
Now, if you still have room 
and your writing is small, 


11:14.290 --> 11:16.425
you could add something like this: 


11:16.425 --> 11:20.262
Not hearers only, but doers. 


11:20.262 --> 11:23.632
Both houses in same location, 


11:23.632 --> 11:28.270
same tests, foundations different. 


11:28.270 --> 11:30.840
Now every time 
you read those verses, 


11:30.840 --> 11:34.110
you will be reminded 
of what they mean.


11:34.110 --> 11:36.112
Perhaps like me, 


11:36.112 --> 11:39.249
you’ve had several study Bibles 
over the years. 


11:39.248 --> 11:41.616
I think back to the first one I used. 


11:41.617 --> 11:44.220
It was like this big green Bible. 


11:44.220 --> 11:48.223
Then, later that was replaced 
by another Bible


11:48.223 --> 11:50.658
—this black covered Bible. 


11:50.658 --> 11:52.761
And then, further still, 


11:52.762 --> 11:56.499
we had another Bible
—the Reference Bible. 


11:56.498 --> 11:59.201
And, of course, 
now for most of us, 


11:59.202 --> 12:02.370
we have the large-print Bible.


12:02.370 --> 12:04.807
This does, however, 


12:04.807 --> 12:07.209
highlight a challenge 
we might experience. 


12:07.208 --> 12:09.010
It can be frustrating 


12:09.010 --> 12:11.613
when a new edition 
of the Bible comes out. 


12:11.613 --> 12:13.948
How do you transfer all your study notes 


12:13.948 --> 12:16.018
over to the new Bible? 


12:16.018 --> 12:20.555
Additionally, our beloved study Bible 
may wear out 


12:20.555 --> 12:26.000
or, worse still, be lost, stolen, burned, 
ruined, run over, blown away. 


12:27.763 --> 12:31.933
So that’s the advantage 
of using an electronic list; 


12:31.933 --> 12:34.970
it doesn’t matter 
what type of file you use. 


12:34.970 --> 12:39.475
It can be updated very easily, 
and you can even make copies


12:39.475 --> 12:41.477
—not like the printed copy 


12:41.477 --> 12:45.114
that already has 
the old idea written in the margin. 


12:45.113 --> 12:47.550
Even now in English, 


12:47.550 --> 12:50.318
we have the books 
of Matthew, Mark, and Luke 


12:50.318 --> 12:52.588
in our electronic study Bible 


12:52.588 --> 12:56.158
on jw.org and WOL. 


12:56.158 --> 13:00.028
Later in the program, 
we have some exciting news 


13:00.028 --> 13:03.265
about how JW Library 
will help us in this regard. 


13:03.265 --> 13:06.702
But I’ll leave that for later.


13:06.702 --> 13:11.174
Really, having a study Bible 
is not only helpful 


13:11.173 --> 13:15.376
but it also makes our personal study 
far more interesting. 


13:15.377 --> 13:17.379
How so? 


13:17.378 --> 13:20.950
Every time we read 
or study a publication, 


13:20.950 --> 13:23.952
we’ll find ourselves 
searching for new points 


13:23.952 --> 13:26.000
that we can write 
in our study Bible. 


13:27.188 --> 13:30.591
This way, we’ll be doing 
what the psalmist expressed 


13:30.592 --> 13:34.095
at Psalm 119:111: 


13:34.095 --> 13:36.498
‘We will take Jehovah’s reminders 


13:36.498 --> 13:39.668
‘as our permanent possession 
(or heritage), 


13:39.668 --> 13:50.296
for his reminders 
are the joy of our hearts!’
