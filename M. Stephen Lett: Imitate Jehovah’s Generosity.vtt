Humans are born

00:00:02.815 --> 00:00:06.986 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a strong inclination to imitate.

00:00:06.986 --> 00:00:09.196 line:10% position:50% align:center
In fact, very young infants

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:13.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been observed
imitating facial expressions.

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s amazing!

00:00:15.911 --> 00:00:19.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes me think of an experience
I had some 40 years ago

00:00:19.748 --> 00:00:22.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Susan and I were in the circuit work.

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:26.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister told me
that her little five-year-old son

00:00:26.213 --> 00:00:28.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
was looking in a mirror

00:00:28.257 --> 00:00:32.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
and making various expressions
with his face and eyes.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
His mother asked,
“What are you doing?”

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said,

00:00:38.017 --> 00:00:41.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can’t do like Brother Lett;

00:00:41.187 --> 00:00:43.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll never be a circuit overseer!”

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:47.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m sure he soon learned

00:00:47.902 --> 00:00:50.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
that voluminous facial expressions

00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:53.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not a requirement for circuit work.

00:00:53.574 --> 00:00:56.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, they could be a disadvantage.

00:00:57.494 --> 00:01:02.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the way, thank you
for putting up with me all these years.

00:01:03.876 --> 00:01:07.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does a small child learn to walk,

00:01:07.087 --> 00:01:09.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
feed himself, and talk?

00:01:09.381 --> 00:01:12.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learns by imitating
his parents and others.

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:16.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, there’s one type of imitating

00:01:16.931 --> 00:01:21.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
that does not come
automatically or even easily.

00:01:21.352 --> 00:01:24.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s identified at Ephesians 5:1.

00:01:24.772 --> 00:01:28.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Therefore, become

00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:32.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
imitators of God, as beloved children.”

00:01:33.405 --> 00:01:35.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the word “become.”

00:01:35.533 --> 00:01:39.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are not born as “imitators of God.”

00:01:39.078 --> 00:01:41.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of inherited imperfection,

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:44.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
we aren’t even born with an inclination

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:47.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become an imitator of God.

00:01:47.628 --> 00:01:49.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 8:21 says:

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:53.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the inclination of the heart of man

00:01:53.008 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
is bad from his youth up.”

00:01:56.804 --> 00:01:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, it takes earnest effort

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:02.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become an imitator of God.

00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:07.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s well worth the effort,
and Jehovah will help us.

00:02:07.231 --> 00:02:11.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
What blessings will we personally reap

00:02:11.151 --> 00:02:14.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we become an imitator of God?

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest blessing

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah will see that we
are trying to be like him,

00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:22.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will love us and draw close to us.

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:28.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, the more we learn about Jehovah
and strive to be like him,

00:02:28.544 --> 00:02:30.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more we’ll love him

00:02:30.963 --> 00:02:33.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the closer we’ll draw to him.

00:02:34.842 --> 00:02:37.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cultivating godly qualities

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:40.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
will result
in improved relations with others.

00:02:40.806 --> 00:02:45.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imitating godly qualities
will make us a better person overall.

00:02:45.644 --> 00:02:48.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more we’re like Jehovah,

00:02:48.105 --> 00:02:51.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
the happier we’ll be.

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:53.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how he created us.

00:02:53.986 --> 00:02:58.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are just a few
of the blessings we’ll reap

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we become an imitator of God.

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:04.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our publications,

00:03:04.788 --> 00:03:08.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 40 different qualities of Jehovah

00:03:08.167 --> 00:03:11.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been identified and discussed.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in this discussion,
let’s examine just one.

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:17.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll discuss the theme

00:03:17.843 --> 00:03:21.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Imitate Jehovah’s Generosity.”

00:03:22.681 --> 00:03:27.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Generosity is an aspect of Jehovah’s love.

00:03:27.144 --> 00:03:29.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unquestionably, Jehovah God

00:03:29.521 --> 00:03:33.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the most generous Giver in the universe.

00:03:33.943 --> 00:03:36.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about this.

00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:38.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eons and eons ago,

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God was all alone.

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:45.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even though it’s impossible
for us to comprehend,

00:03:45.412 --> 00:03:49.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wasn’t lonely or lacking anything.

00:03:49.333 --> 00:03:51.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because of love,

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:54.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
he generously chose to share

00:03:54.505 --> 00:03:57.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
the gift of life with others.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:01.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
He decided to become a Father, a Creator.

00:04:01.345 --> 00:04:05.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Logically, he began by creating a Son

00:04:05.015 --> 00:04:09.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom He could directly enjoy fellowship.

00:04:09.186 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we know,
this Son became known as the Word,

00:04:13.107 --> 00:04:15.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah’s Spokesman.

00:04:15.943 --> 00:04:19.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then, at some point in time, again,

00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because of loneliness
or lacking anything,

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of love,

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:28.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
He chose to further expand His family

00:04:28.247 --> 00:04:32.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
by creating millions of angelic sons

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
who could also directly associate with Him.

00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:40.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, amazingly,
further down the stream of time,

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:42.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of love,

00:04:42.386 --> 00:04:46.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
He again chose to expand His family.

00:04:46.098 --> 00:04:49.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
These children were a lower form of life

00:04:49.727 --> 00:04:54.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
but ones who were made in His image
and whom He loved deeply.

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:57.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we’re talking about Adam and Eve

00:04:57.276 --> 00:05:01.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the original parents of all of us.

00:05:01.405 --> 00:05:04.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah had not created them,

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:06.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
none of us would ever have been born.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, life itself

00:05:09.955 --> 00:05:12.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a wonderful, miraculous,

00:05:12.875 --> 00:05:15.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
and generous gift.

00:05:15.377 --> 00:05:17.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without this gift,

00:05:17.212 --> 00:05:21.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t be able to enjoy any
of Jehovah’s other marvelous blessings.

00:05:22.885 --> 00:05:26.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now talk about Jehovah’s generosity

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:28.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to physical gifts.

00:05:29.808 --> 00:05:33.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Every good gift and every perfect present

00:05:33.646 --> 00:05:35.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
is from above.”

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:40.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think for a moment
about the planet we live on.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:43.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created the earth as a beautiful

00:05:43.489 --> 00:05:46.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unique home for us.

00:05:46.075 --> 00:05:50.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has all the right conditions
to sustain life,

00:05:50.454 --> 00:05:55.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the oxygen and water cycles

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
that continually recycle essential resources.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:02.967 line:10% position:50% align:center
If the earth were closer to the sun,

00:06:02.967 --> 00:06:05.427 line:10% position:50% align:center
all the water would boil off

00:06:05.427 --> 00:06:07.888 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the planet would be a barren rock.

00:06:07.888 --> 00:06:12.226 line:10% position:50% align:center
Conversely, if it were farther from the sun,

00:06:12.226 --> 00:06:14.228 line:10% position:50% align:center
the water would freeze

00:06:14.228 --> 00:06:15.771 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the planet would be like

00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:19.400 line:10% position:50% align:center
an uninhabitable iceberg.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.443 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah placed the earth

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:23.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the perfect location,

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:27.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
often called the Goldilocks zone.

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:34.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think, too, about the marvelous gift
of our human bodies.

00:06:34.331 --> 00:06:37.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in our imperfect state,

00:06:37.042 --> 00:06:40.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
as mentioned at Psalm 139:14,

00:06:40.421 --> 00:06:43.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are “wonderfully made.”

00:06:43.716 --> 00:06:46.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it brilliant how our skin

00:06:46.552 --> 00:06:51.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed to heal when we cut,
scrape, or bruise it?

00:06:51.265 --> 00:06:54.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we scratch, scrape, or dent our car,

00:06:54.768 --> 00:06:57.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
does it heal itself?

00:06:57.146 --> 00:06:58.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine

00:06:58.772 --> 00:07:03.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we would look like if every time
we damaged our skin,

00:07:03.152 --> 00:07:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
it just stayed that way?

00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:08.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d begin to look pretty rough

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:11.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
in just a short period of time.

00:07:11.493 --> 00:07:13.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it amazing

00:07:13.704 --> 00:07:17.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the skin allows water to exit the body

00:07:17.875 --> 00:07:20.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the form of perspiration?

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:21.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the same time,

00:07:21.795 --> 00:07:25.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t allow water to enter into the body

00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:27.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we take a bath;

00:07:27.384 --> 00:07:31.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
otherwise, we’d become waterlogged.

00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:34.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ponder for a moment about how food

00:07:34.558 --> 00:07:37.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not only nutritious,

00:07:37.311 --> 00:07:40.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s also delicious.

00:07:40.648 --> 00:07:44.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
This makes fueling our bodies very enjoyable.

00:07:44.526 --> 00:07:46.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could have made eating

00:07:46.904 --> 00:07:49.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
like putting gasoline in a car

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a necessary function

00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:54.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
but void of enjoyment.

00:07:55.829 --> 00:07:59.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of all the tasty varieties of food.

00:07:59.416 --> 00:08:01.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
As just one example,

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:05.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
how many varieties of grapes are there?

00:08:05.965 --> 00:08:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Food
and Agriculture Organization,

00:08:09.385 --> 00:08:11.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are about 10,000

00:08:11.845 --> 00:08:14.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
different grape varieties worldwide.

00:08:15.641 --> 00:08:19.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could have given us
just two varieties

00:08:19.812 --> 00:08:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
—red and green.

00:08:22.398 --> 00:08:26.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why do we have some 10,000 varieties?

00:08:26.193 --> 00:08:30.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Jehovah’s voluminous generosity.

00:08:31.532 --> 00:08:32.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:36.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate Jehovah’s generosity

00:08:36.495 --> 00:08:38.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
in giving physical gifts?

00:08:39.873 --> 00:08:44.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s obvious that Jehovah
has put a lot of thought into his gift-giving

00:08:44.878 --> 00:08:48.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that his gifts
are practical and beneficial.

00:08:49.925 --> 00:08:52.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, we should prayerfully meditate

00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:55.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that our gifts are useful.

00:08:55.806 --> 00:08:58.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not all gifts are practical.

00:08:58.392 --> 00:09:01.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother gave this example:

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
A puppy might make a fine gift

00:09:03.897 --> 00:09:07.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a young one living in a rural setting,

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:10.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s a terrible gift to a Bethelite.

00:09:12.072 --> 00:09:16.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our brother lacks food,
clothing, or shelter,

00:09:16.577 --> 00:09:18.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t just say:

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:23.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go in peace; keep warm and well fed.”

00:09:23.417 --> 00:09:27.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we apply Proverbs 3:27,

00:09:28.088 --> 00:09:29.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says:

00:09:29.214 --> 00:09:33.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not withhold good from those
to whom you should give it

00:09:33.636 --> 00:09:37.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it is within your power to help.”

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:42.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition
to helping brothers in need directly,

00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:44.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can indirectly help them

00:09:44.772 --> 00:09:48.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
by making donations to the worldwide work.

00:09:49.485 --> 00:09:53.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
prayerfully strives to use wisely

00:09:53.364 --> 00:09:58.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
these precious, dedicated funds
to help our dear brothers

00:09:58.202 --> 00:10:03.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’ve been afflicted
by natural or man-made disasters

00:10:03.123 --> 00:10:06.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who urgently need suitable Kingdom Halls

00:10:06.877 --> 00:10:10.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
and assistance in many other ways.

00:10:10.547 --> 00:10:13.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of the need for Kingdom Halls,

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
as just one example,

00:10:15.427 --> 00:10:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
please look at these pictures
from the Philippines.

00:10:19.014 --> 00:10:23.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are six before and after photographs.

00:10:24.895 --> 00:10:28.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do you think
was the individual average cost

00:10:28.524 --> 00:10:31.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
for these six new simplified

00:10:31.735 --> 00:10:34.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
but dignified Kingdom Halls?

00:10:34.697 --> 00:10:38.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty one thousand U.S. dollars.

00:10:39.493 --> 00:10:41.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please think about this:

00:10:41.495 --> 00:10:44.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s physical gifts such as the rain,

00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:49.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
sunshine, and oxygen are recurring.

00:10:49.003 --> 00:10:53.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s one way to imitate
this aspect of Jehovah’s giving?

00:10:54.091 --> 00:10:57.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, 1 Corinthians 16:2 says:

00:10:57.094 --> 00:10:59.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the first day of every week,

00:10:59.513 --> 00:11:04.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each of you should set something aside

00:11:04.101 --> 00:11:06.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to his own means.”

00:11:07.187 --> 00:11:10.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with this Scriptural principle,

00:11:10.232 --> 00:11:14.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
many have chosen
to “set something aside” each month

00:11:14.737 --> 00:11:19.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
by scheduling recurring online donations.

00:11:20.326 --> 00:11:24.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s briefly contemplate
Jehovah’s spiritual gifts,

00:11:24.371 --> 00:11:27.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
which are even more impressive.

00:11:27.333 --> 00:11:29.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the Bible.

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where would we be without it?

00:11:31.962 --> 00:11:36.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lost, hopeless, floundering.

00:11:36.592 --> 00:11:41.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d have to learn by experience
—“the school of hard knocks.”

00:11:41.472 --> 00:11:44.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d need at least two lives to live

00:11:44.933 --> 00:11:47.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one to practice

00:11:47.436 --> 00:11:50.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the second to perform.

00:11:51.231 --> 00:11:54.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, think about the holy spirit.

00:11:54.234 --> 00:11:58.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 14:26 describes it as a helper,

00:11:58.364 --> 00:12:01.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
teacher, and a remembrancer.

00:12:01.784 --> 00:12:04.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the most powerful force
in the universe,

00:12:04.662 --> 00:12:08.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah gives it to us generously.

00:12:08.957 --> 00:12:12.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider for a moment the resurrection hope.

00:12:12.086 --> 00:12:16.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
It strengthens us in times of great distress

00:12:16.507 --> 00:12:19.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when death takes a loved one

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:22.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when we face death ourselves.

00:12:22.638 --> 00:12:26.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m reminded
of the six-year-old girl who said:

00:12:26.225 --> 00:12:30.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Thank you, Jehovah,
for the resurrection hope.

00:12:30.688 --> 00:12:33.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is a very good idea!’

00:12:35.359 --> 00:12:37.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
For our final example,

00:12:37.444 --> 00:12:41.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was Jehovah’s
greatest spiritual gift of generosity?

00:12:42.116 --> 00:12:43.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
The gift of his Son

00:12:43.784 --> 00:12:47.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
to purchase us from sin and death.

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:51.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it wasn’t just any angel
whom Jehovah sent;

00:12:51.333 --> 00:12:55.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was his Firstborn,
his only-begotten Son.

00:12:56.463 --> 00:12:59.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if you were tied to a chair

00:12:59.049 --> 00:13:02.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and forced to watch the torture and execution

00:13:02.594 --> 00:13:05.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your most beloved child?

00:13:05.055 --> 00:13:07.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would be horrible!

00:13:07.808 --> 00:13:10.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah was not tied,

00:13:10.728 --> 00:13:13.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of his great love for us,

00:13:13.731 --> 00:13:16.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
he restrained himself

00:13:16.066 --> 00:13:18.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowed the torture and execution

00:13:18.986 --> 00:13:21.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his most precious Son.

00:13:21.405 --> 00:13:26.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the ultimate example of generosity.

00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:29.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

00:13:29.288 --> 00:13:32.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate Jehovah’s generosity

00:13:32.708 --> 00:13:35.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
in giving spiritual gifts?

00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:39.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way is by being generous
in giving sincere commendation.

00:13:40.966 --> 00:13:43.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you see something good,

00:13:43.552 --> 00:13:46.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
say something good.

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 15:23 says:

00:13:48.766 --> 00:13:51.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A word spoken at the right time

00:13:51.769 --> 00:13:54.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how good it is!”

00:13:55.064 --> 00:13:57.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Words have great power.

00:13:57.858 --> 00:14:00.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate, think of how two words

00:14:00.527 --> 00:14:04.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a convention chairman
can lift thousands of pounds.

00:14:04.907 --> 00:14:06.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are they?

00:14:06.909 --> 00:14:08.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please stand!”

00:14:09.995 --> 00:14:13.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this vein, Proverbs 18:21 says:

00:14:13.374 --> 00:14:16.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Death and life

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:19.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in the power of the tongue.”

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just a few words at the right time

00:14:21.423 --> 00:14:25.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
can make a tremendous difference
in a person’s life.

00:14:25.344 --> 00:14:28.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can cause a depressed one to “stand”

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:31.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a positive hope for the future.

00:14:32.851 --> 00:14:37.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way
is to freely give out forgiveness.

00:14:37.106 --> 00:14:39.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 3:13 reminds us

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘Jehovah freely forgives us’

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:47.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we “must also do the same.”

00:14:47.658 --> 00:14:52.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “freely” in English
means “generously”

00:14:52.037 --> 00:14:55.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can also mean “without charge.”

00:14:55.124 --> 00:14:57.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there someone you can extend

00:14:57.793 --> 00:15:01.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
true forgiveness to in imitation
of our generous God?

00:15:03.132 --> 00:15:07.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, how about generously
giving out knowledge?

00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:10.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we pray for a Bible study

00:15:10.055 --> 00:15:12.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then work in harmony with those prayers

00:15:12.641 --> 00:15:16.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
by searching diligently for a deserving one?

00:15:17.312 --> 00:15:22.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we liberally train others
and share the skills we have in the ministry

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:26.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the maintenance
and construction of theocratic facilities?

00:15:27.531 --> 00:15:31.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
People in general often hoard
the knowledge they have

00:15:31.618 --> 00:15:34.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to protect their job.

00:15:34.413 --> 00:15:36.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Jehovah,

00:15:36.415 --> 00:15:40.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
we gladly share the knowledge
we have with others.

00:15:42.421 --> 00:15:46.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
During our discussion,
we barely scratched the surface

00:15:46.967 --> 00:15:49.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding Jehovah’s generosity

00:15:49.678 --> 00:15:52.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can imitate him.

00:15:52.264 --> 00:15:56.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will learn forever about our great God

00:15:56.643 --> 00:16:00.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can better reflect his qualities.

00:16:00.272 --> 00:16:04.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the meantime,
the more we learn about him

00:16:04.443 --> 00:16:07.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the more closely we can imitate him,

00:16:07.613 --> 00:16:11.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
the richer, happier,

00:16:11.116 --> 00:16:15.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more satisfying our lives will be.

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why?

00:16:17.122 --> 00:16:20.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that’s how he created us.
