00:00.684 --> 00:03.186
Welcome to JW Broadcasting.

00:03.186 --> 00:05.121
In this month’s program,

00:05.121 --> 00:08.391
we will feature the study methods 
that are used in Gilead School.

00:08.391 --> 00:13.430
For a moment, let’s imagine ourselves 
starting our day as a Gilead student.

00:15.799 --> 00:16.900
See you later.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.301
See you, Nathan.

00:35.919 --> 00:36.786
Morning.

00:36.786 --> 00:37.787
Have a good day in class.

00:37.787 --> 00:38.621
Thank you.

00:44.227 --> 00:45.228
Welcome.

00:45.228 --> 00:46.262
How are you?

00:49.299 --> 00:50.633
Good morning.

00:50.633 --> 00:53.369
Hello, Nathan.

00:58.374 --> 00:59.409
Lyubomyr.

00:59.409 --> 01:00.143
Nice to see you.

01:00.143 --> 01:00.810
How are you?

01:00.810 --> 01:01.344
Good.

01:01.344 --> 01:01.945
I am good.

01:01.945 --> 01:02.579
Good to see you.

01:02.579 --> 01:03.713
How was your night?

01:03.713 --> 01:04.881
It was good.

01:04.881 --> 01:06.950
A long night of studying, 
but it was worth it.

01:06.950 --> 01:09.619
I’m really looking forward 
to the lesson this morning.

01:09.619 --> 01:11.888
You know, I agree with you. 
I feel the same.

01:11.888 --> 01:15.125
The information we have been studying 
is really touching my heart.

01:15.458 --> 01:16.760
I know what you mean.

01:16.760 --> 01:18.728
I feel like I’ve become 
more of a spiritual person,

01:18.728 --> 01:21.965
and my relationship with Jehovah 
has become so much stronger.

01:21.965 --> 01:24.634
Good morning everyone. 
Very good to see you all here this morning.

01:25.902 --> 01:29.172
What are the study methods 
that are helping the students grow

01:29.172 --> 01:31.608
in their relationship with Jehovah?

01:31.608 --> 01:35.145
And more importantly, 
how can we apply these methods

01:35.145 --> 01:37.380
in our own personal study?

01:37.380 --> 01:39.716
We’ll find the answers and more.

01:39.716 --> 01:42.385
Here are some 
of the highlights of what’s ahead.

01:42.385 --> 01:44.621
These brothers and sisters describe

01:44.621 --> 01:46.790
how they approach their personal Bible study.

01:46.790 --> 01:49.759
They’re from different parts of the world,

01:49.759 --> 01:52.695
but they share 
many common study techniques.

01:52.695 --> 01:56.699
What questions do they ask 
as they read and meditate on the Bible?

01:56.699 --> 02:01.371
How does their deep study take them 
beyond the basics of Bible understanding?

02:02.972 --> 02:06.876
Young ones, 
are you digging deep into God’s Word now?

02:06.876 --> 02:10.013
How can this help you 
make the truth your own?

02:10.013 --> 02:12.549
And can you succeed even without the support

02:12.549 --> 02:14.784
of those spiritually close to you?

02:14.784 --> 02:17.420
This sister’s experience will show us

02:17.420 --> 02:19.756
the benefits of searching the Bible

02:19.756 --> 02:22.559
as if for hidden treasures.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.863
Can you be ready to make 
a wise choice in matters of conscience?

02:26.863 --> 02:29.599
Do study habits affect 
how well-prepared and well-trained

02:29.599 --> 02:33.303
your conscience is 
for an unexpected situation?

02:33.303 --> 02:35.705
We’ll see how 
the sister in this dramatization

02:35.705 --> 02:38.007
answers these questions.

02:38.007 --> 02:41.611
This is JW Broadcasting for July 2018.

03:01.130 --> 03:04.901
We begin with an archived interview 
of Brother Allan Boyle.

03:04.901 --> 03:08.972
Among his many assignments, 
Brother Boyle spent 37 years

03:08.972 --> 03:11.741
in the Art Department 
at world headquarters.

03:11.741 --> 03:14.110
The beautiful and accurate illustrations

03:14.110 --> 03:16.346
produced there enhance our study,

03:16.346 --> 03:20.717
helping us to visualize 
and meditate on what we are reading.

03:20.717 --> 03:23.987
An assignment 
to create these pictures is exciting,

03:23.987 --> 03:27.156
but it requires 
that a person have spiritual qualities.

03:27.156 --> 03:29.158
Artists collaborate

03:29.158 --> 03:31.794
and must humbly listen 
to each other’s comments.

03:31.794 --> 03:35.064
They must apply direction 
from “the faithful and discreet slave”

03:35.064 --> 03:39.502
to prepare artwork 
that we can take in as spiritual food.

03:39.502 --> 03:41.838
As you’ll hear Brother Boyle describe,

03:41.838 --> 03:45.508
a person must be 
an avid student of the Bible.

03:45.508 --> 03:47.744
Listen to Brother Boyle’s story,

03:47.744 --> 03:51.614
and note what he said was needed 
for him to do his assignment well.

04:07.630 --> 04:10.133
I was born in 1933.

04:10.133 --> 04:14.237
I got to the age of 18, 
and one suppertime

04:14.237 --> 04:17.340
my mother 
had invited the company servant,

04:17.340 --> 04:20.476
as they were called back then, 
to come for supper.

04:20.476 --> 04:22.745
He asked me 
what I was going to do with my life.

04:22.745 --> 04:25.114
I said to him, 
“Well, I’m going to pioneer.”

04:25.114 --> 04:28.284
So three weeks later, 
at the convention in London,

04:28.284 --> 04:33.122
I got baptized and then 
went pioneering six months after that.

04:33.122 --> 04:35.692
I was 21 when I was in the circuit work,

04:35.692 --> 04:37.760
and that was a wonderful experience.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.929
And in those days, 
of course, you didn’t have a car.

04:39.929 --> 04:41.931
I used to have a motorbike.

04:41.931 --> 04:44.701
And I’d go around 
on the motorbike with my briefcase

04:44.701 --> 04:47.937
and my typewriter 
and my clothes in the other case on the back.

04:47.937 --> 04:49.939
Yeah, that was very exciting.

04:49.939 --> 04:53.977
I was invited to go to Gilead, 
and that was wonderfully exciting.

04:53.977 --> 04:56.045
We had 103 in the class.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.047
Little did I know at the time

04:58.047 --> 05:00.717
that I would be sent 
as a missionary to Ireland.

05:09.859 --> 05:12.428
My friend had been invited to go down

05:12.428 --> 05:15.031
to London Bethel to do the artwork there.

05:15.031 --> 05:17.200
I’d always wanted to be in Bethel.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.136
I thought, ‘Well, why don’t I just 
call him up and congratulate him?’

05:20.136 --> 05:23.573
So that’s what I did, 
and he told me that he decided not to go.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.409
So he said: “If you’re 
still interested, why don’t you go?

05:26.409 --> 05:28.411
You know, call them up and let them know.”

05:28.411 --> 05:31.848
So that’s what I did. 
The next morning, I called up London Bethel,

05:31.848 --> 05:36.085
and within a week I was 
in London Bethel doing the graphics work

05:36.085 --> 05:37.754
for the magazines, you know.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.255
It was a wonderful, thrilling experience.

05:41.858 --> 05:44.360
I was in London Bethel for a couple of years,

05:44.360 --> 05:47.997
in 1977 to 1979,

05:47.997 --> 05:51.768
and then Brother Barry invited me 
to come over to Brooklyn Bethel.

05:55.838 --> 06:00.476
You know that you’re doing 
something that’s going to be beneficial

06:00.476 --> 06:02.712
and helpful to other people,

06:02.712 --> 06:05.815
even to people in different 
languages, in different cultures.

06:05.815 --> 06:08.851
A little painting that you do 
is going to help them

06:08.851 --> 06:11.721
to get a memory of something significant.

06:13.556 --> 06:18.061
One of the most beautiful things 
about working in the Art Department

06:18.061 --> 06:22.065
and doing paintings 
is that it makes you do research.

06:22.065 --> 06:24.834
You have to investigate. 
Is this the right time of the day?

06:24.834 --> 06:26.169
Is it night? Is it day?

06:26.169 --> 06:28.171
What did the sky look like?

06:28.171 --> 06:32.008
What was it like 
before the Flood when Noah built the ark?

06:32.008 --> 06:34.710
How did he paint underneath the ark?

06:34.710 --> 06:36.345
How did he waterproof it?

06:36.345 --> 06:38.347
Because that’s 
the most important part, isn’t it?

06:38.347 --> 06:41.250
He used bitumen. 
OK, how did he get underneath the ark?

06:41.250 --> 06:42.885
Maybe he put it on stilts.

06:42.885 --> 06:46.556
You have to come up 
with all these little questions in your mind.

06:51.627 --> 06:54.797
To do the research was very rewarding.

07:16.519 --> 07:18.955
This is a little model of a boat,

07:18.955 --> 07:20.957
and underneath the deck they used to keep

07:20.957 --> 07:23.759
a ballast sack of 110 pounds (50 kg) of sand.

07:23.759 --> 07:27.330
It says in the Scriptures 
that Jesus was asleep on “a pillow.”

07:27.330 --> 07:31.100
Apparently, this was 
the ballast sack that he was asleep on.

07:31.100 --> 07:34.704
And actually, 
in the Kingdom Interlinear translation,

07:34.704 --> 07:37.140
it doesn’t say 
that he was asleep on “a pillow”;

07:37.140 --> 07:39.408
it says he was asleep on “the pillow.”

07:39.408 --> 07:42.445
So apparently, 
back 2,000 years ago in that area,

07:42.445 --> 07:44.447
everybody knew what “the pillow” was.

07:49.585 --> 07:54.056
I remember meeting 
a brother once who’d been to Siberia,

07:54.056 --> 07:58.161
and he’d taken a snapshot 
of somebody’s kitchen in Siberia.

07:58.161 --> 08:00.930
And to my amazement, on the wall

08:00.930 --> 08:03.399
—pinned with drawing pins on the wall—

08:03.399 --> 08:06.402
was one of the pages of the publications

08:06.402 --> 08:08.504
that we produced here at Brooklyn.

08:08.504 --> 08:10.506
And so, remarkably,

08:10.506 --> 08:14.443
it’s wonderful to feel 
that whatever we do here

08:14.443 --> 08:17.313
—if it’s support work, 
if it’s the painting,

08:17.313 --> 08:20.216
and, of course, we need 
a lot of support work for the paintings—

08:20.216 --> 08:22.218
all of what we do here

08:22.218 --> 08:24.453
has an effect upon the brothers and sisters

08:24.453 --> 08:27.757
out there in the world, wherever it might be.

08:27.757 --> 08:31.260
And you really feel 
that your time is well spent.

08:34.330 --> 08:36.832
You’re adorning the Word of truth.

08:36.832 --> 08:41.070
You’re helping other people 
to be taught something from the Bible,

08:41.070 --> 08:43.072
which is going to be to their benefit.

08:45.942 --> 08:49.312
It’s been very rewarding and thrilling

08:49.312 --> 08:53.082
to be in Jehovah’s service, 
and I’ve really enjoyed it.

09:11.534 --> 09:16.072
Allan Boyle finished 
his earthly course in 2016.

09:16.072 --> 09:18.874
Those in the Art Department 
who worked with him

09:18.874 --> 09:23.179
remember his enthusiasm 
and his thorough attention to detail.

09:23.179 --> 09:25.214
What Allan brought to his assignment

09:25.214 --> 09:28.517
was rooted 
in his own personal study of the Bible.

09:28.517 --> 09:30.920
He found it rewarding to do the research

09:30.920 --> 09:33.656
needed to illustrate Bible scenes.

09:33.656 --> 09:36.158
Today, the Writing Department supplies

09:36.158 --> 09:39.362
a team of researchers to assist the artists.

09:39.362 --> 09:42.865
But did you recall 
what Allan said helped his research?

09:42.865 --> 09:47.169
He asked questions 
about the scenes he was painting!

09:47.169 --> 09:50.606
These same kinds of questions 
are part of the study methods

09:50.606 --> 09:52.842
Gilead students learn in class.

09:52.842 --> 09:57.213
And these are the same methods 
that we’ll learn about in this program.

09:58.047 --> 10:00.049
How would you feel

10:00.049 --> 10:02.051
if you received an invitation

10:02.051 --> 10:04.553
to attend the next class of Gilead School?

10:05.187 --> 10:08.824
For many, it has been 
a lifelong dream to attend Gilead.

10:08.824 --> 10:13.029
The course helps students 
keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”

10:13.029 --> 10:18.034
For others, the idea of five months 
of intense study seems intimidating.

10:18.034 --> 10:20.403
We know we need to study,

10:20.403 --> 10:22.972
but we may find 
it a challenge to get the most

10:22.972 --> 10:26.575
out of the time we spend 
reading God’s Word.

10:26.575 --> 10:31.580
In this program, we will discuss 
why study is so important,

10:31.580 --> 10:34.650
what it means to study something,

10:34.650 --> 10:38.454
and how you can get more 
from your study sessions.

10:38.454 --> 10:40.823
Since most cannot attend Gilead,

10:40.823 --> 10:44.493
we will demonstrate 
the method used in Gilead School.

10:45.561 --> 10:50.266
First, why is study so important?

10:50.266 --> 10:55.204
Only by study can we 
keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”

10:55.204 --> 10:57.907
When the apostle Paul penned these words,

10:57.907 --> 11:02.278
he was imprisoned and nearing the end 
of his action-packed life.

11:02.278 --> 11:04.647
He had been the “apostle to the nations”

11:04.647 --> 11:06.382
and had spent his best years

11:06.382 --> 11:09.085
taking the Word of God 
to the then-known world.

11:10.186 --> 11:12.855
As he reflected on the fruits of his labors,

11:12.855 --> 11:17.526
he wrote a letter to his friends 
in the congregation in Philippi in Macedonia.

11:18.694 --> 11:21.697
Inspired by holy spirit, he wrote words

11:21.697 --> 11:25.701
that would aid his brothers 
to gain the prize of eternal life.

11:25.701 --> 11:30.606
These words are found 
at Philippians 2:15, 16.

11:30.606 --> 11:33.275
Let’s read them:

11:33.275 --> 11:37.546
“So that you may come to be 
blameless and innocent,

11:37.546 --> 11:40.783
“children of God 
without a blemish in the midst

11:40.783 --> 11:43.352
“of a crooked and twisted generation,

11:43.352 --> 11:46.989
“among whom you are shining 
as illuminators in the world,

11:46.989 --> 11:51.394
keeping a tight grip on the word of life.”

11:51.394 --> 11:54.163
Imagine the joy Paul felt

11:54.163 --> 11:57.333
when he was reunited 
in the heavenly resurrection

11:57.333 --> 12:00.069
with those who listened to his admonition

12:00.069 --> 12:03.773
to keep “a tight grip on the word of life”!

12:03.773 --> 12:07.042
Whether we have 
the heavenly or earthly hope,

12:07.042 --> 12:10.980
Paul’s words can help us gain 
the prize of eternal life.

12:10.980 --> 12:15.050
They imprint on our hearts and minds 
a basic exhortation

12:15.050 --> 12:20.055
that will lead us through these last days 
and into our everlasting reward.

12:20.055 --> 12:25.060
The question is, Will we remain 
‘blameless and without blemish

12:25.060 --> 12:29.899
in the midst of this crooked 
and twisted generation’ of our day?

12:30.633 --> 12:35.638
Will we rejoice with other faithful servants 
of God in the new world?

12:35.638 --> 12:38.407
We can and we will

12:38.407 --> 12:40.609
if we take to heart Paul’s counsel

12:40.609 --> 12:44.213
to keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”

12:45.448 --> 12:49.452
Next, what does it mean to study?

12:49.452 --> 12:51.821
Stop and contemplate this word picture

12:51.821 --> 12:54.256
for keeping a tight grip.

12:54.256 --> 12:57.493
Imagine a hiker who has slipped near a ledge.

12:57.493 --> 13:02.298
But before falling over the cliff, 
he grabs hold of a tree branch.

13:02.298 --> 13:05.901
How tight do you think 
his grip will be on that branch?

13:05.901 --> 13:08.504
This is not a halfhearted effort.

13:08.504 --> 13:12.808
Likewise, keeping a tight grip 
on the word of life

13:12.808 --> 13:17.813
is not just a mechanical routine, 
nor is it a casual habit.

13:17.813 --> 13:20.683
It requires strenuous effort.

13:20.683 --> 13:25.688
It involves actively living 
by the truths in God’s Word.

13:25.688 --> 13:28.357
To do this, we must understand

13:28.357 --> 13:31.894
more than what God 
expressly commands and condemns.

13:31.894 --> 13:34.763
We must be able to identify principles,

13:34.763 --> 13:38.501
or life lessons, contained in the Bible.

13:38.501 --> 13:41.203
Once identified, we must understand

13:41.203 --> 13:43.706
how to match these valuable truths

13:43.706 --> 13:47.142
to specific situations in our lives.

13:47.142 --> 13:51.247
Then we must allow these principles 
to influence our decisions

13:51.247 --> 13:55.284
and guide our reaction 
to trials and temptations.

13:56.352 --> 13:58.354
Ask yourself,

13:58.354 --> 14:02.525
‘How strong is my grip 
on the word of life?’

14:02.525 --> 14:04.527
To answer that,

14:04.527 --> 14:08.464
let’s consider 
the fundamentals of Bible study.

14:09.532 --> 14:12.635
This is not about old methods or new methods,

14:12.635 --> 14:15.004
nor is it about what device you are using.

14:15.004 --> 14:19.008
This discussion transcends devices.

14:19.008 --> 14:22.344
Study requires active thinking.

14:22.344 --> 14:25.381
In a world of increasing distractions,

14:25.381 --> 14:28.250
this is becoming an even greater challenge.

14:28.250 --> 14:30.653
We’ve often received instant information

14:30.653 --> 14:33.389
that enables us to quickly recite facts,

14:33.389 --> 14:37.326
but this is not the same as active thinking.

14:37.326 --> 14:39.328
Through active thinking,

14:39.328 --> 14:43.432
we draw meaningful conclusions in our hearts.

14:43.432 --> 14:47.670
We are certainly grateful 
for all the study tools we’ve been given.

14:47.670 --> 14:50.339
We should use these to the full.

14:50.339 --> 14:53.075
At the same time, we need to be careful

14:53.075 --> 14:57.947
that these tools do not cause us 
to develop mental laziness.

14:57.947 --> 15:01.216
Devices can help us to access information,

15:01.216 --> 15:04.053
but they can’t think for us.

15:04.053 --> 15:08.557
We must work hard if we are 
to develop new patterns of thinking.

15:08.557 --> 15:13.228
For example, if we study 
The Watchtower on a device,

15:13.228 --> 15:17.299
we can use the hyperlink feature 
to read the Scriptures.

15:17.299 --> 15:21.136
With a simple touch, 
we quickly find and read the verse.

15:21.136 --> 15:23.138
That is good!

15:23.138 --> 15:27.776
If you regularly do this, 
you get a grip on the word of life.

15:27.776 --> 15:32.514
But would you like to get 
a tight grip on the word of life?

15:32.514 --> 15:35.384
To get a tight grip requires more effort

15:35.384 --> 15:39.455
than a swipe of a finger 
and then swiftly moving on.

15:39.455 --> 15:43.792
You need to slow down 
and analyze the material.

15:43.792 --> 15:46.895
Only then will the information you study

15:46.895 --> 15:49.698
become imprinted on your mind and heart,

15:49.698 --> 15:52.201
leaving a clear and distinct impression.

15:53.202 --> 15:57.539
How, then, can I get more out of my study?

15:57.539 --> 16:01.810
Let’s demonstrate a method 
taught during Gilead School.

16:01.810 --> 16:05.014
It involves the use of six questions.

16:05.014 --> 16:09.451
The following poem, written 
by English journalist Rudyard Kipling,

16:09.451 --> 16:12.154
can help guide better thinking:

16:12.454 --> 16:15.791
“I keep six honest serving-men

16:15.791 --> 16:17.960
“(They taught me all I knew);

16:17.960 --> 16:19.862
“Their names are What and Why

16:19.862 --> 16:21.897
“and When and How

16:21.897 --> 16:25.267
and Where and Who.”

16:25.601 --> 16:29.538
When studying God’s Word, 
ask yourself these questions

16:29.538 --> 16:32.408
and then do research in our publications

16:32.408 --> 16:36.745
to get the facts 
and discern the spiritual lessons.

16:36.745 --> 16:39.014
To illustrate how to do this,

16:39.014 --> 16:42.885
let’s open our Bibles to Genesis chapter 49

16:42.885 --> 16:46.221
and look at verses 22 through 25.

16:51.493 --> 16:55.164
First, we ask the when and where.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.266
Now, with some research,

16:57.266 --> 17:01.770
we learn that Jacob 
spoke these words near the end of his life.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.772
He was in Egypt,

17:03.772 --> 17:07.543
but what he described 
takes us back to Canaan some 40 years

17:07.543 --> 17:10.212
when his son Joseph was a young man.

17:10.212 --> 17:13.615
Now we have 
a clearer picture of these verses.

17:13.615 --> 17:18.053
So now, let’s read and analyze verse 22:

17:18.053 --> 17:23.058
“Joseph is the offshoot of a fruitful tree,

17:23.058 --> 17:28.397
a fruitful tree by a spring, 
whose branches extend over the wall.”

17:28.397 --> 17:31.166
“The offshoot of a fruitful tree.”

17:31.166 --> 17:32.901
Who is the “fruitful tree”?

17:32.901 --> 17:35.437
It is Joseph’s father, Jacob.

17:35.437 --> 17:37.806
How was he fruitful?

17:37.806 --> 17:40.175
He bore many children.

17:40.175 --> 17:44.646
Joseph’s “branches extend over the wall.”

17:44.646 --> 17:48.317
As Jacob’s offshoot, 
Joseph is singled out

17:48.317 --> 17:51.653
for a special blessing 
superior to that of his brothers.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.655
Why?

17:53.655 --> 17:57.459
Joseph proved he had 
the qualities needed for leadership.

17:57.459 --> 18:00.629
However, of even greater value 
than his abilities

18:00.629 --> 18:03.699
was his being a spiritual man.

18:03.699 --> 18:06.168
Let’s read verse 23:

18:06.168 --> 18:09.404
“But the archers kept harassing him

18:09.404 --> 18:13.575
and shot at him and kept harboring 
animosity against him.”

18:13.575 --> 18:15.978
“The archers kept harassing him.”

18:15.978 --> 18:17.980
Who are “the archers”?

18:17.980 --> 18:19.982
Joseph’s half brothers.

18:19.982 --> 18:21.116
How?

18:21.116 --> 18:23.285
They shot figuratively at Joseph

18:23.285 --> 18:28.257
—arrows of envy and hatred 
and jealousy were used to attack him.

18:28.257 --> 18:32.361
Now, eventually, 
his brothers sold him into slavery.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.930
Now let’s read verse 24:

18:34.930 --> 18:38.000
“And yet his bow remained in place,

18:38.000 --> 18:41.370
“and his hands stayed strong and agile.

18:41.370 --> 18:44.740
“This was from the hands 
of the powerful one of Jacob,

18:44.740 --> 18:47.609
from the shepherd, the stone of Israel.”

18:47.609 --> 18:49.945
“His bow remained in place.”

18:49.945 --> 18:51.446
How?

18:51.446 --> 18:53.448
Despite the repeated attacks,

18:53.448 --> 18:56.819
Joseph repaid animosity with kindness.

18:56.819 --> 18:59.288
Joseph endured this ill-treatment

18:59.288 --> 19:02.457
and did not weaken in his devotion to God.

19:02.457 --> 19:04.459
Now we ask, How?

19:04.459 --> 19:07.629
How is it that Joseph 
kept a spiritual outlook

19:07.629 --> 19:10.632
despite the harassment and animosity?

19:10.632 --> 19:12.901
Let’s read verse 25:

19:13.235 --> 19:17.306
“He [Joseph] is from the God of your father,

19:17.306 --> 19:21.310
“and he will help you, 
and he is with the Almighty,

19:21.310 --> 19:24.413
“and he will bless you with the blessings 
of the heavens above,

19:24.413 --> 19:26.782
“with the blessings of the deep below,

19:26.782 --> 19:30.219
with the blessings of the breasts and womb.”

19:30.853 --> 19:33.422
“He is with the Almighty.”

19:33.422 --> 19:36.558
Joseph had Jehovah’s help.

19:36.558 --> 19:39.962
The Almighty was by his side through it all.

19:39.962 --> 19:43.665
We’ve used our questions 
to get the facts of the account,

19:43.665 --> 19:45.667
but we’re not done.

19:45.667 --> 19:49.838
Now let’s use them 
to take our study to a spiritual plane.

19:49.838 --> 19:53.408
Next, let’s ask a what question.

19:53.408 --> 19:57.613
What does this account 
teach us about Jehovah?

19:57.613 --> 20:01.984
Jehovah never abandons his loyal servants.

20:01.984 --> 20:06.154
Even in the depths of prison, 
Joseph was not alone.

20:06.154 --> 20:09.558
Jehovah found ways to bless Joseph.

20:09.558 --> 20:12.761
Now make the connection 
to Jehovah’s people today,

20:12.761 --> 20:14.796
including yourself.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.966
Jehovah will never abandon us.

20:17.966 --> 20:22.971
Rather, he shows loyal love 
to all those who serve him whole-souled.

20:22.971 --> 20:27.976
Would Jehovah let Joseph 
remain in prison indefinitely?

20:27.976 --> 20:29.978
No.

20:29.978 --> 20:32.981
At the appointed time, relief came.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.784
Joseph was raised from a prisoner in chains

20:35.784 --> 20:38.020
to the second most powerful man in Egypt

20:38.020 --> 20:41.156
—from prison to palace in one day.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.692
Make the connection to us.

20:43.692 --> 20:46.194
Our trials are temporary.

20:46.194 --> 20:48.597
Jehovah will soon bring relief,

20:48.597 --> 20:52.067
even in unexpected or surprising ways.

20:52.067 --> 20:55.671
Meanwhile, we are never alone;

20:55.671 --> 20:58.340
Jehovah is with us.

20:59.474 --> 21:02.878
Again, let’s ask the question, How?

21:02.878 --> 21:07.149
How does the account 
contribute to the Bible’s theme?

21:07.149 --> 21:10.452
Joseph suffered, but his suffering led

21:10.452 --> 21:13.255
to the survival of Abraham’s offspring,

21:13.255 --> 21:15.657
leading to the Messiah.

21:15.657 --> 21:19.294
Joseph’s account 
is not just a riveting story.

21:19.294 --> 21:21.296
It directly contributed

21:21.296 --> 21:24.833
to the development of Jehovah’s purpose.

21:24.833 --> 21:26.969
Think about this:

21:26.969 --> 21:30.439
In spite of the poor conduct of his brothers,

21:30.439 --> 21:33.909
Joseph forgave them and took the initiative

21:33.909 --> 21:37.245
to improve their relationship with him.

21:37.245 --> 21:42.250
Joseph’s attitude 
was a reflection of Jehovah’s attitude.

21:42.250 --> 21:44.720
With their family reunited,

21:44.720 --> 21:47.522
Jehovah also forgave Joseph’s brothers

21:47.522 --> 21:52.527
and took the initiative 
in restoring their relationship with Himself.

21:52.527 --> 21:57.532
In fact, Jehovah gave Joseph’s brother Judah

21:57.532 --> 22:01.737
the honor of being 
an ancestor of the Messiah.

22:01.737 --> 22:04.206
What are the lessons in this account?

22:04.206 --> 22:06.475
Let’s highlight just one.

22:06.475 --> 22:10.212
Genesis 49:23:

22:10.812 --> 22:13.849
“But the archers kept harassing him

22:13.849 --> 22:17.919
and shot at him and kept harboring 
animosity against him.”

22:18.253 --> 22:21.823
Arrows of animosity were fired at Joseph.

22:21.823 --> 22:25.327
Recall Joseph’s response in verse 24?

22:27.095 --> 22:30.098
“And yet his bow remained in place,

22:30.098 --> 22:33.769
and his hands stayed strong and agile.”

22:33.969 --> 22:37.305
In other words, he did not return fire.

22:37.305 --> 22:39.908
His bow remained in place.

22:39.908 --> 22:44.279
Reflect on the last time 
you were wronged by someone.

22:44.279 --> 22:48.116
How did we react to what we experienced?

22:48.116 --> 22:53.255
Did we seek to vindicate ourselves 
or insist on our rights?

22:53.255 --> 22:57.059
Did we fire arrows of animosity in return,

22:57.059 --> 23:00.829
or did we show mercy and loyal love?

23:00.829 --> 23:05.734
Did our reaction reveal 
that God’s spirit was operative on us?

23:05.734 --> 23:09.805
Like Joseph, we know 
we will have Jehovah’s approval

23:09.805 --> 23:13.108
even if we are wronged or experience trials

23:13.108 --> 23:15.977
that make us feel like we are in prison.

23:15.977 --> 23:18.647
Reflective questions like these

23:18.647 --> 23:21.283
enable us to make the account our own.

23:21.283 --> 23:23.085
It becomes part of us,

23:23.085 --> 23:25.620
part of our way of thinking, 
our way of acting.

23:25.620 --> 23:29.391
This nourishes our relationship with Jehovah.

23:29.391 --> 23:34.396
This type of study rewards us 
not simply with a collection of facts

23:34.396 --> 23:38.366
that impress us today 
and are forgotten tomorrow.

23:38.366 --> 23:42.537
Rather, it leaves us 
with core principles that we remember,

23:42.537 --> 23:46.575
that influence our decisions, 
and that guide our lives.

23:46.575 --> 23:50.412
We tighten our grip on the word of life.

23:51.480 --> 23:54.216
Let’s review the fundamentals of study.

23:54.216 --> 23:58.353
Again, this is not 
about old methods or new methods

23:58.353 --> 24:00.589
or about what device you are using.

24:00.589 --> 24:03.792
This discussion transcends devices.

24:03.792 --> 24:08.530
It’s about basic methods of Bible study.

24:08.530 --> 24:11.366
We can liken these three phases of study

24:11.366 --> 24:15.470
to gathering, sifting, and baking grain.

24:15.470 --> 24:18.406
Gathering is when we read the Bible.

24:18.406 --> 24:22.978
We don’t run through the field 
grabbing just handfuls of grain;

24:22.978 --> 24:26.114
we systematically harvest the field.

24:26.114 --> 24:29.284
Sifting is when we sort out what we gathered,

24:29.284 --> 24:33.955
answering who, what, where, 
when, why, and how to get the facts.

24:33.955 --> 24:36.525
Baking is when we think

24:36.525 --> 24:39.561
—“turning up the heat” in our mind and heart—

24:39.561 --> 24:43.064
something no one else can do for you.

24:43.064 --> 24:47.836
The questions we ask 
can take our study to a spiritual plane.

24:48.803 --> 24:53.808
Most importantly, 
what does this teach me about Jehovah?

24:53.808 --> 24:56.912
How does it contribute to the Bible’s theme?

24:56.912 --> 25:01.249
And the bottom line: 
What is the lesson for me?

25:03.118 --> 25:06.555
Jehovah gave us a mind 
that is begging to learn.

25:06.555 --> 25:11.293
It is a gift with the capacity 
to cultivate thinking ability.

25:11.293 --> 25:14.829
When we make the effort 
to unearth gems from God’s Word,

25:14.829 --> 25:18.200
we find that study 
is rewarding and delightful.

25:18.200 --> 25:21.403
More importantly, our study skills enable us

25:21.403 --> 25:24.573
to keep a tight grip on the word of life.

25:24.573 --> 25:29.211
A tight grip on God’s Word 
will make our life better now

25:29.211 --> 25:32.280
and give us the opportunity 
to continue learning

25:32.280 --> 25:35.450
about our heavenly Father for all eternity.

25:37.953 --> 25:41.623
Joseph’s account 
was an excellent example for us

25:41.623 --> 25:45.360
to demonstrate 
the fundamentals of Bible study.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.362
During our discussion,

25:47.362 --> 25:51.266
we used pictures 
to help bring the account to life.

25:51.266 --> 25:53.935
As we learned 
from Brother Boyle’s interview,

25:53.935 --> 25:57.339
pictures and illustrations 
give us an accurate image

25:57.339 --> 25:59.541
to use in our meditation.

25:59.541 --> 26:01.643
And if there’s a video,

26:01.643 --> 26:05.981
we have yet another way 
to imagine ourselves in the account.

26:05.981 --> 26:09.784
So we’re excited 
to introduce this month’s music video

26:09.784 --> 26:13.888
depicting the trials 
and blessings that Joseph experienced.

26:13.888 --> 26:16.591
It reminds us that, like Joseph,

26:16.591 --> 26:21.096
when we have Jehovah, 
we are never alone.

26:36.077 --> 26:48.356
Abandoned and betrayed, 
Forsaken and alone,

26:50.292 --> 27:03.238
Despair my one companion, 
My heart within me like a stone

27:04.372 --> 27:17.085
With no one here for me, 
No kindly word of care,

27:18.486 --> 27:29.864
Who’ll offer consolation? 
My heavy burden, who can share?

27:29.864 --> 27:37.005
I’m not alone; 
I never was.

27:37.005 --> 27:44.145
I’ll never be, 
And all because

27:44.145 --> 27:51.219
Jehovah knows; 
Jehovah sees.

27:51.219 --> 27:58.226
He hears my prayer; 
He’s here with me.

27:58.226 --> 28:11.239
Whatever comes my way, 
I’m never alone.

28:14.876 --> 28:26.521
Whatever I may lose 
By sticking close to you,

28:29.224 --> 28:42.003
No matter who may fail me, 
I know you’ll never be untrue.

28:43.138 --> 28:57.152
You’re close to me, O God, 
And never far away.

28:57.152 --> 29:08.763
My faith, my hope, reliance​— 
I know you never will betray.

29:08.763 --> 29:15.804
I’m not alone; 
I never was.

29:15.804 --> 29:23.011
I’ll never be, 
And all because

29:23.011 --> 29:29.851
Jehovah knows; 
Jehovah sees.

29:29.851 --> 29:37.125
He hears my prayer; 
He’s here with me.

29:37.125 --> 29:47.168
Whatever comes my way, 
I’m never alone.

29:47.168 --> 29:51.773
I never was.

29:51.773 --> 29:58.179
I’ll never be, 
And all because

29:58.179 --> 30:05.386
Jehovah knows; 
Jehovah sees.

30:05.386 --> 30:12.293
He hears my prayer; 
He’s here with me.

30:12.293 --> 30:29.911
Whatever comes my way, 
I’m never alone.

30:31.980 --> 30:35.083
Have you ever felt as Joseph did?

30:35.083 --> 30:39.754
There were times when Joseph’s life 
was not turning out as he had hoped.

30:40.688 --> 30:44.259
He no doubt wondered 
if he’d ever be set free from prison

30:44.259 --> 30:49.030
or if he’d ever see his father again 
or his younger brother, Benjamin.

30:49.030 --> 30:54.035
But Joseph knew that his God, Jehovah, 
never lost sight of him.

30:54.035 --> 30:57.005
This surely helped him endure.

30:57.005 --> 31:01.709
We could be in a painful situation 
that seems to drag on endlessly.

31:02.610 --> 31:05.380
But when we study 
a Bible account like Joseph’s

31:05.380 --> 31:07.649
—asking the six questions—

31:07.649 --> 31:11.753
we can fully understand 
and apply the lessons in our life.

31:11.753 --> 31:14.789
Then we can build the same faith that he had

31:14.789 --> 31:18.126
—that we too are never alone.

31:19.460 --> 31:21.563
Let’s now listen to brothers and sisters

31:21.563 --> 31:24.666
who are using 
the study methods we’ve discussed.

31:24.666 --> 31:28.736
Some learned them in Gilead School, 
others from Gilead graduates,

31:28.736 --> 31:32.774
or good examples 
in their families and congregations.

31:32.774 --> 31:34.776
They’ve also applied what they learned

31:34.776 --> 31:37.545
from our publications 
about good study habits.

31:37.545 --> 31:39.647
See if any of the ways they study

31:39.647 --> 31:43.851
could help you keep 
“a tight grip” on God’s Word.

31:45.553 --> 31:47.388
The more you study,

31:47.388 --> 31:49.390
the more you understand Jehovah.

31:49.390 --> 31:51.426
The more you understand Jehovah,

31:51.426 --> 31:53.094
the more you love him.

31:53.094 --> 31:54.929
Jehovah clearly tells us:

31:54.929 --> 31:56.965
“My thoughts are not your thoughts.”

31:56.965 --> 31:59.133
So if we want to understand 
Jehovah’s thinking better,

31:59.133 --> 32:01.603
we need to dig deep in our study,

32:01.603 --> 32:04.572
and then we share those thoughts with others.

32:05.607 --> 32:07.642
Personal study is like fuel

32:07.642 --> 32:09.811
that keeps you going.

32:10.645 --> 32:12.947
Personally, I’m not a good student,

32:12.947 --> 32:16.117
but I really learned how to study the Bible.

32:16.117 --> 32:18.620
The Bible came alive during Gilead.

32:18.620 --> 32:22.657
Self-discipline is involved 
—very much.

32:25.326 --> 32:29.797
I overcome the tiredness aspect

32:29.797 --> 32:32.000
of Bible study by not doing it

32:32.000 --> 32:34.268
at a time of day 
when I know I’m going to be tired.

32:34.268 --> 32:37.572
I can be tired for other things later on 
—but not for that.

32:40.174 --> 32:43.011
Each session of my Bible study 
begins with a prayer,

32:43.011 --> 32:47.081
“Please help me recognize 
it is counsel for me,

32:47.081 --> 32:50.918
and then give me the strength 
to work on it.”

32:50.918 --> 32:52.286
I have a color-coded system,

32:52.286 --> 32:54.856
so I know what certain things stand for.

32:55.923 --> 32:57.859
I have a particular color

32:57.859 --> 33:02.864
for Jehovah’s good hand in people’s lives;

33:02.864 --> 33:07.335
I have another color for warning examples;

33:07.335 --> 33:11.739
I have another for fine examples to imitate.

33:23.685 --> 33:26.320
You have to get behind the information,

33:26.320 --> 33:29.957
not just focus on one verse or one chapter.

33:29.957 --> 33:32.627
See who’s involved, the time,

33:32.627 --> 33:35.863
the conditions, how many people are there,

33:35.863 --> 33:38.366
and then you’ll get 
the true meaning of the verse.

33:39.167 --> 33:41.169
John 1:1,

33:41.169 --> 33:42.403
who is “the Word”?

33:44.072 --> 33:46.507
We can go to verse 18.

33:46.507 --> 33:48.342
“Begotten” meant

33:48.342 --> 33:50.978
he had a beginning, 
a time when he started

33:50.978 --> 33:53.347
—when he began—

33:53.347 --> 33:55.550
in heaven with his Father.

33:55.550 --> 33:57.752
That’s where he was.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.990
Philippians 4:6, 7 is a scripture 
that I’ve read many times over.

34:02.990 --> 34:05.426
“The peace of God that excels all thought.”

34:05.426 --> 34:07.428
OK, how do you get that?

34:07.428 --> 34:11.566
It’s from having 
a good relationship with Jehovah.

34:11.566 --> 34:15.336
How is it that God’s peace 
‘guards your heart’?

34:15.336 --> 34:17.905
“By means of Christ Jesus” our Lord.

34:17.905 --> 34:21.743
And I said: “Why by Jesus?

34:21.743 --> 34:25.113
“Because Jesus paid the ransom;

34:25.113 --> 34:30.218
that ransom is what makes possible 
a relationship with Jehovah.”

34:30.218 --> 34:32.386
So it almost goes full circle.

34:57.478 --> 35:00.548
I attended a School for Congregation Elders

35:00.548 --> 35:04.719
that had Gilead graduates as instructors.

35:04.719 --> 35:07.655
One of the methods is to analyze

35:07.655 --> 35:10.892
a certain Bible account 
from different perspectives.

35:10.892 --> 35:14.262
We can’t see 
the whole picture from one angle.

35:15.763 --> 35:17.899
I share my research results 
with Bible students,

35:17.899 --> 35:20.134
and that helps them 
to know Jehovah better,

35:20.134 --> 35:22.470
and it helps them to see 
that what they’re studying

35:22.470 --> 35:25.006
is of practical value.

35:25.006 --> 35:27.675
I had studied up on Jacob;

35:27.675 --> 35:29.977
he wrestled all night

35:29.977 --> 35:32.313
with an angel.

35:32.313 --> 35:35.850
And I wanted to share it 
with some of my friends.

35:35.850 --> 35:40.354
One of the brothers 
that happened to sit around

35:40.354 --> 35:45.293
when this discussion was going on 
came back to me, and he said to me:

35:45.293 --> 35:49.130
“I had concluded my arrangements

35:49.130 --> 35:50.698
“to quit full-time service.

35:50.698 --> 35:53.501
“But after listening to that discussion,

35:53.501 --> 35:56.537
I’ve decided that I’m no longer stopping.”

35:56.537 --> 36:00.641
And that was 
such a wonderful moment for me.

36:00.641 --> 36:04.545
I thanked Jehovah.

36:04.545 --> 36:06.714
When I learned that I 
was going to become a mom,

36:06.714 --> 36:09.817
I said, “Jehovah, if this little one

36:09.817 --> 36:13.487
could love you, 
then I’ll get to keep him forever.”

36:13.487 --> 36:16.824
And I began to teach everything 
I was learning to him.

36:17.491 --> 36:19.894
So it’s a matter

36:19.894 --> 36:22.063
of keeping my faith strong,

36:22.063 --> 36:24.665
and there’s no shortcut.

36:24.665 --> 36:28.402
Every session of study 
that is properly done with good meditation

36:28.402 --> 36:30.404
adds a new pillar

36:30.404 --> 36:33.207
to the strength of our faith.

36:35.576 --> 36:36.944
I look forward to those times 
when I can, you know,

36:36.944 --> 36:39.847
run upstairs by myself 
and just shut everything off,

36:39.847 --> 36:42.583
and it’s just me and Jehovah.

36:44.085 --> 36:46.387
Life today is very unpredictable,

36:46.387 --> 36:50.424
but I’ve come to see that as long as I 
keep a tight grip on God’s Word,

36:50.424 --> 36:53.060
nothing can “separate [me] from God’s love.”

36:54.896 --> 36:58.532
The joy these brothers and sisters get 
from their personal study

36:58.532 --> 37:00.968
is clearly heard in their expressions.

37:00.968 --> 37:02.970
Recall what they said:

37:02.970 --> 37:06.207
“The more you understand Jehovah, 
the more you love him.”

37:06.207 --> 37:09.410
“Study is like fuel that keeps you going.”

37:09.410 --> 37:14.115
And “I can shut everything off, 
and it’s just me and Jehovah.”

37:14.115 --> 37:16.884
We also heard them ask the six questions:

37:16.884 --> 37:20.154
who, what, where, when, why, and how.

37:20.154 --> 37:24.325
They also used tools for research 
and note-taking that works for them.

37:24.325 --> 37:27.328
Is there something you saw 
or that we discussed

37:27.328 --> 37:29.764
that you’d like to add 
to your study routine?

37:29.764 --> 37:31.933
If so, try it out.

37:33.067 --> 37:36.737
Young ones, it’s true 
that the more you understand Jehovah,

37:36.737 --> 37:38.873
the more you love him.

37:38.873 --> 37:42.743
And what a blessing you have 
if your family worships Jehovah with you

37:42.743 --> 37:45.913
and teaches you how to draw close to him.

37:45.913 --> 37:48.649
But some young ones 
have had to build their faith

37:48.649 --> 37:51.519
without their family’s support.

37:51.519 --> 37:55.589
Listen to the experience of Ersi Royer 
from the United States.

37:55.589 --> 38:00.094
What spiritual decision did she face 
at just 14 years old?

38:00.094 --> 38:03.030
And what did she do 
that illustrates the value

38:03.030 --> 38:05.933
of deep personal study?

38:05.933 --> 38:08.569
Growing up,

38:08.569 --> 38:10.571
it wasn’t the typical,

38:10.571 --> 38:13.174
“My mom is a pioneer, my dad is an elder,

38:13.174 --> 38:15.509
and we’re doing great in the congregation.”

38:15.509 --> 38:18.346
My family life wasn’t the best,

38:18.346 --> 38:21.415
so why would I want to do this religion 
that nobody is happy

38:21.415 --> 38:24.018
in our family with?

38:24.018 --> 38:26.520
And I think that can make you feel

38:26.520 --> 38:29.357
very alone or odd

38:29.357 --> 38:31.625
or awkward or secluded.

38:33.227 --> 38:35.329
And at that time, 
I was graduating eighth grade.

38:35.329 --> 38:36.897
There were dances;

38:36.897 --> 38:39.867
friends were hanging out, going to parties.

38:39.867 --> 38:44.538
And I remember thinking: 
‘Wow, these look like really nice kids.

38:44.538 --> 38:47.375
Why aren’t I doing that?’

38:47.375 --> 38:51.379
I hadn’t really delved into the Bible enough 
to answer questions

38:51.379 --> 38:54.615
that I really needed to know.

38:54.615 --> 38:58.419
I went in prayer to Jehovah and said: 
“I’m so sorry, but today I’m not a Witness.

38:58.419 --> 39:02.089
I’m going to try to prove 
everything that I’ve been taught is wrong.”

39:02.089 --> 39:05.826
I asked him that if he’s real,

39:05.826 --> 39:07.428
to help me understand.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.296
So I went in my room

39:09.296 --> 39:10.898
and shut the door.

39:10.898 --> 39:13.000
I got every book off the shelf.

39:13.000 --> 39:15.136
I started off organized,

39:15.136 --> 39:16.470
but by the end of the evening,

39:16.470 --> 39:19.240
I had books 
all over the place with pages open.

39:19.240 --> 39:21.742
The more I kept reading about Jehovah,

39:22.676 --> 39:26.514
the more the next topic would take me 
to then connect the scriptures.

39:26.514 --> 39:28.449
Jesus is linked to Jehovah;

39:28.449 --> 39:31.519
the angels are linked to Jehovah; 
the resurrection is linked to Jehovah.

39:31.519 --> 39:35.489
So you can’t believe in one thing 
and not everything else

39:35.489 --> 39:37.691
if you really want to know the truth.

39:37.691 --> 39:40.161
And so that’s what did it for me,

39:41.028 --> 39:43.297
especially the scripture in Psalms

39:43.297 --> 39:46.200
when it said 
that ‘you saw even the embryo of me.’

39:47.935 --> 39:49.937
And it was an emotional scripture for me

39:49.937 --> 39:52.640
because I thought: 
‘Wow,

39:52.640 --> 39:55.709
‘my parents aren’t doing great 
in the truth right now.

39:55.709 --> 39:58.112
‘But Jehovah found a way to find me,

39:58.112 --> 40:00.281
‘and he knew what I could be.

40:01.949 --> 40:03.884
‘Now I have my answer. 
I don’t have an excuse.

40:03.884 --> 40:06.720
‘Jehovah gave me enough knowledge 
that now I’m responsible.

40:06.720 --> 40:10.191
I now need to act on that 
and show my love in return for him.’

40:11.826 --> 40:14.361
Within a week, I found another sister

40:14.361 --> 40:16.864
in the hall that was really helpful 
in me getting out

40:16.864 --> 40:19.033
in service quite often.

40:19.033 --> 40:22.403
I don’t think to this day she ever knew 
how much I appreciated that.

40:22.403 --> 40:26.607
Although things were declining 
in our family spiritually,

40:26.607 --> 40:28.843
I was able to get baptized.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.845
As I progressed spiritually,

40:30.845 --> 40:32.847
I could see that I did not have

40:32.847 --> 40:35.015
the support of my family,

40:35.015 --> 40:37.585
but I had to trust that Jehovah 
would help me through it.

40:37.585 --> 40:40.354
And at least by the time I got home, 
if there was an issue,

40:40.354 --> 40:43.357
I had the strength of the meeting 
and the brothers and sisters

40:43.357 --> 40:45.926
and joy that they 
couldn’t take away from me.

40:48.395 --> 40:50.764
I remember I came home one day 
with some friends.

40:50.764 --> 40:52.500
It was a nice day

40:52.500 --> 40:54.368
—encouraging, upbuilding.

40:54.368 --> 40:57.671
We pulled into our driveway; 
they dropped me off

40:57.671 --> 40:59.273
and said good-bye.

40:59.273 --> 41:02.109
My parents were really upset

41:02.109 --> 41:04.478
when they came and met me at the door.

41:04.478 --> 41:06.213
They couldn’t fully understand

41:07.181 --> 41:10.885
why I was making my decisions

41:10.885 --> 41:13.187
the way I was 
to serve Jehovah more fully.

41:15.156 --> 41:17.158
We just could not agree

41:17.158 --> 41:21.095
on where my relationship 
with Jehovah was going.

41:21.862 --> 41:26.667
And at that point, 
I left with the clothes on my back.

41:26.667 --> 41:29.336
In a matter of a few minutes,

41:29.336 --> 41:31.739
my life forever changed.

41:37.778 --> 41:40.214
I had a spiritual aunt that took me in,

41:42.149 --> 41:43.884
helped me gather myself together,

41:43.884 --> 41:47.655
and literally fed me, clothed me,

41:47.655 --> 41:50.057
helped me spiritually.

41:50.057 --> 41:53.294
And so then, my support became Jehovah

41:53.294 --> 41:57.164
and the congregation.

41:57.164 --> 42:00.100
I remember that a sister told me years ago,

42:00.100 --> 42:03.804
“Be who you needed when you were young.”

42:03.804 --> 42:06.307
And so when I look at those little ones,

42:06.307 --> 42:08.075
I look at myself and say,

42:08.075 --> 42:10.511
‘How could I have benefited

42:10.511 --> 42:14.181
from someone taking the time for me 
when I was that age?’

42:14.181 --> 42:16.183
I’ve always tried remembering the young ones

42:16.183 --> 42:19.086
—because that’s just part of who I am—

42:19.086 --> 42:22.990
and making sure that they know 
that they’re not alone.

42:22.990 --> 42:25.459
If there is a young one out there 
who isn’t sure

42:25.459 --> 42:27.861
if this is the truth or not,

42:27.861 --> 42:30.764
I would like them to know 
that Jehovah knows

42:30.764 --> 42:32.600
who they are,

42:32.600 --> 42:35.469
and he’s finding a way 
for them to know him.

42:35.469 --> 42:40.474
Jehovah is real, 
he knows them by name,

42:40.474 --> 42:44.645
he wants them to live, 
and he’s fighting for them.

42:44.645 --> 42:49.650
How amazing that young Ersi chose 
to spend an entire day studying

42:49.650 --> 42:54.154
—proving to herself 
that Jehovah knew her and loved her.

42:54.154 --> 42:57.124
But this was no onetime study marathon.

42:57.124 --> 43:00.894
From there, she worked to develop 
the study habits she needed

43:00.894 --> 43:04.665
to endure, grow, 
and become a spiritual person.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.967
She pioneered for several years,

43:06.967 --> 43:09.970
and now serves at Bethel 
with her husband, Jeff.

43:09.970 --> 43:14.675
In my conversation with Ersi, 
she expressed her love for her family

43:14.675 --> 43:17.244
and the hope that someday in the future

43:17.244 --> 43:19.913
she’ll be reunited with them spiritually.

43:21.482 --> 43:23.550
There’s no situation in life

43:23.550 --> 43:26.253
that cannot be handled better than by seeking

43:26.253 --> 43:29.156
Jehovah’s guidance in the Bible.

43:29.156 --> 43:32.326
That’s certainly true 
in matters of conscience.

43:32.326 --> 43:34.328
In these situations,

43:34.328 --> 43:38.299
Jehovah does not tell us 
what to do with a command,

43:38.299 --> 43:43.337
but his Word gives us the principles 
we use to train our conscience.

43:43.337 --> 43:45.472
In this dramatization,

43:45.472 --> 43:48.342
Emma has to make a difficult decision.

43:48.342 --> 43:50.611
How is her conscience involved,

43:50.611 --> 43:54.615
and what steps 
does she take to make her decision?

43:57.384 --> 43:59.386
Every day we make choices

43:59.386 --> 44:02.723
that can affect 
our relationship with Jehovah.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.725
When there’s a clear Scriptural command,

44:04.725 --> 44:06.660
the right choice may seem easy.

44:08.462 --> 44:12.166
But what if there’s not?

44:12.166 --> 44:15.636
How can we be sure 
we’re making a wise decision?

44:17.671 --> 44:20.841
An invitation to our niece’s wedding arrived.

44:22.176 --> 44:25.312
Thomas was excited about it.

44:28.015 --> 44:30.317
I was excited too.

44:32.619 --> 44:34.688
But the ceremony

44:34.688 --> 44:37.157
was being held at a local church.

44:38.258 --> 44:41.995
I wondered if it would still be OK 
for me to attend.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.099
Even though Thomas wasn’t yet willing

44:45.099 --> 44:48.869
to accept a Bible study, 
he gradually softened over the years

44:48.869 --> 44:51.105
since I came into the truth.

44:51.105 --> 44:55.275
I knew he understood why 
I would never enter a church for worship,

44:55.275 --> 44:57.845
but what about attending a wedding?

44:57.845 --> 45:00.147
Jehovah approves of weddings.

45:03.183 --> 45:04.785
That afternoon,

45:04.785 --> 45:06.854
I went to help Amy plan a menu

45:06.854 --> 45:09.857
for the pioneer school lunch coming up.

45:12.626 --> 45:16.530
She noticed I was a bit distracted,

45:16.530 --> 45:19.233
so I told her my concerns about the wedding.

45:19.233 --> 45:22.002
But you’re not thinking of going, are you?

45:22.002 --> 45:25.739
Amy sure had a strong opinion on the matter,

45:25.739 --> 45:29.510
but I didn’t feel 
she really understood my situation.

45:31.745 --> 45:34.214
Although I appreciated her concern,

45:34.214 --> 45:37.017
I felt like she was judging me.

45:39.253 --> 45:42.222
The next day, I decided 
to visit Charlotte and Allan

45:42.222 --> 45:44.425
and ask their advice.

45:46.360 --> 45:48.996
Like me, Charlotte had come into the truth

45:48.996 --> 45:53.934
many years before Allan, 
so they really understood my situation.

45:53.934 --> 45:55.936
Is Amy right?

45:55.936 --> 45:58.572
Would it be wrong to attend the wedding?

45:58.572 --> 46:00.674
What would you do if you were me?

46:01.909 --> 46:04.211
Charlotte explained that in situations

46:04.211 --> 46:06.880
where there’s no specific Bible command,

46:06.880 --> 46:08.882
it becomes a matter of conscience.

46:10.217 --> 46:13.287
And what one person’s conscience allows

46:13.287 --> 46:15.355
may be different from another.

46:17.090 --> 46:19.059
The important thing

46:19.059 --> 46:22.296
is that we make decisions 
that leave us with a good conscience.

46:35.175 --> 46:38.245
But how do I do that?

46:38.245 --> 46:43.050
Dear Emma, it’s really a matter of training.

46:43.050 --> 46:45.986
Allan showed me the scripture 
at Hebrews 5:14,

46:45.986 --> 46:47.988
where the apostle Paul wrote:

46:47.988 --> 46:50.591
“Solid food belongs to mature people,

46:50.591 --> 46:52.593
“to those who through use

46:52.593 --> 46:55.128
“have their powers of discernment trained

46:55.128 --> 46:57.498
to distinguish both right and wrong.”

47:00.834 --> 47:05.072
But Paul didn’t just write those words;

47:05.072 --> 47:09.409
he lived them.

47:09.409 --> 47:13.146
He carefully studied 
the principles in God’s Word.

47:14.581 --> 47:18.018
And as a result, 
he was able to make decisions

47:18.018 --> 47:20.287
that left him with a good conscience.

47:24.324 --> 47:27.794
So even when there’s no stated law 
on a matter,

47:27.794 --> 47:30.030
we can always find a Bible principle

47:30.030 --> 47:33.200
that can give us insight into God’s thinking.

47:36.270 --> 47:40.674
So I made it a matter of prayer, 
and then I got to work.

47:45.312 --> 47:48.215
I researched articles

47:48.215 --> 47:51.652
in the Watch Tower Publications Index 
and the Research Guide.

47:53.353 --> 47:57.958
I found a really good thought 
in chapter 2 of the “God’s Love” book.

48:02.029 --> 48:05.399
I also read about others 
who faced similar situations

48:05.399 --> 48:09.469
and what Bible principles they found helpful.

48:09.469 --> 48:13.040
Then I meditated on all these.

48:20.547 --> 48:23.317
As I kept studying, 
I was able to bring my conscience

48:23.317 --> 48:26.219
in harmony with Jehovah’s spirit,

48:26.219 --> 48:28.322
not just with my heart.

48:39.232 --> 48:42.603
I realized that having 
a Bible-trained conscience

48:42.603 --> 48:46.907
doesn’t mean everyone 
will always think exactly alike

48:46.907 --> 48:48.942
—and that’s OK.

48:48.942 --> 48:53.213
But if we train our conscience 
by applying Bible principles,

48:53.213 --> 48:56.116
it will guide us along in life, 
so that each of us

48:56.116 --> 48:59.286
can remain in God’s love.

49:00.921 --> 49:04.224
What did our sister, Emma, 
do that we can imitate?

49:04.224 --> 49:06.960
When she realized 
that she needed more information,

49:06.960 --> 49:08.762
she got to work!

49:08.762 --> 49:11.565
She studied in order 
to train her conscience

49:11.565 --> 49:15.402
and to make a decision 
that left her conscience clean.

49:15.402 --> 49:18.538
We can do the same 
when a conscience matter comes up.

49:18.538 --> 49:20.574
But we can do more.

49:20.574 --> 49:22.676
We can prepare in advance,

49:22.676 --> 49:27.414
train our conscience on matters 
that do not have clear Bible commands,

49:27.414 --> 49:29.616
and study Bible principles

49:29.616 --> 49:33.220
that teach our conscience 
the rules it should work with.

49:33.220 --> 49:35.389
Then, when we need it, it’s ready.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.858
We can trust it and make decisions

49:37.858 --> 49:41.028
in harmony with a Bible-trained conscience.

49:41.895 --> 49:44.097
We urge you brothers and sisters:

49:44.097 --> 49:47.668
Keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”

49:47.668 --> 49:50.337
That’s what our program has been about.

49:50.337 --> 49:54.174
We learned why 
it’s essential to stay close to God

49:54.174 --> 49:57.878
and to receive his gift of everlasting life.

49:57.878 --> 50:01.214
But what’s more, 
we learned practical ways to do it

50:01.214 --> 50:05.852
using tried and true methods 
of personal Bible study.

50:05.852 --> 50:09.022
We may not have 
an opportunity to attend Gilead

50:09.022 --> 50:11.324
or another theocratic school,

50:11.324 --> 50:16.263
but Jehovah shows all of us 
how to benefit from his written Word.

50:16.263 --> 50:18.999
What an expression of God’s love!

50:20.634 --> 50:22.836
To prepare this month’s program,

50:22.836 --> 50:26.306
our team spent time 
with the Theocratic Schools Department

50:26.306 --> 50:29.976
at the world headquarters facility 
in Patterson, New York.

50:29.976 --> 50:34.281
This has been the home 
for Gilead School since 1995.

50:34.281 --> 50:36.316
And since arriving here,

50:36.316 --> 50:38.985
47 classes have graduated.

50:38.985 --> 50:42.956
Gilead School began 
with its first class in 1943,

50:42.956 --> 50:46.960
and since then, 
close to 9,000 students have been trained.

50:46.960 --> 50:50.197
When students come to class each day,

50:50.197 --> 50:52.966
the writings and models on display

50:52.966 --> 50:55.736
put their mind on spiritual things

50:55.736 --> 50:58.472
as they get ready to study God’s Word.

50:58.472 --> 51:00.907
Isaiah 11:9 says:

51:00.907 --> 51:05.078
“The earth will certainly be filled 
with the knowledge of Jehovah

51:05.078 --> 51:07.080
as the waters cover the sea.”

51:07.080 --> 51:09.816
Our worldwide brotherhood

51:09.816 --> 51:12.753
works in harmony with that prophecy.

51:12.753 --> 51:15.956
It’s fitting then that here in the classroom,

51:15.956 --> 51:19.025
lectures cover every part of the Bible,

51:19.025 --> 51:21.094
exploring background information

51:21.094 --> 51:23.463
to get the sense of the account.

51:23.463 --> 51:25.899
. . . probably still got bruises.

51:25.899 --> 51:28.635
And Paul is telling them, very honestly,

51:28.635 --> 51:31.071
‘we have to enter through many tribulations.’

51:31.071 --> 51:33.206
Can you imagine, you’re sitting there 
and you’re looking at this man

51:33.206 --> 51:35.208
bruised and cut,

51:35.208 --> 51:37.210
and he’s saying,

51:37.210 --> 51:41.815
‘We (you and I) 
have to go through many tribulations.’

51:42.516 --> 51:45.285
Students participate freely,

51:45.285 --> 51:49.689
drawing lessons that they can use 
in their life and assignments.

51:49.689 --> 51:54.594
It impresses me to see 
that the Christian congregation in our time

51:54.594 --> 51:58.498
follows exactly 
the pattern that was used back then.

51:58.498 --> 52:01.368
Studying in the Theocratic Schools’ library

52:01.368 --> 52:03.370
is a cherished part of their day.

52:04.171 --> 52:06.173
In a quiet, relaxed setting,

52:06.173 --> 52:10.710
they associate figuratively 
with “the faithful and discreet slave,”

52:10.710 --> 52:13.180
searching and taking in the spiritual food

52:13.180 --> 52:16.750
that nourishes 
and strengthens their relationship

52:16.750 --> 52:19.886
with their heavenly Father, Jehovah.

52:19.886 --> 52:24.124
Students benefit from the hard work 
of the school instructors.

52:24.124 --> 52:26.259
Under the direction 
of the Teaching Committee

52:26.259 --> 52:28.328
of the Governing Body,

52:28.328 --> 52:31.131
they manage the curriculum 
for Gilead and other schools

52:31.131 --> 52:34.234
that are taught here and in the field.

52:34.234 --> 52:36.970
Through their diligent efforts 
and Jehovah’s blessing,

52:37.871 --> 52:41.141
the Theocratic Schools staff 
count it a privilege

52:41.141 --> 52:44.377
to serve their brothers 
and the Governing Body.

52:44.377 --> 52:48.215
We send you 
our sincere Christian love and greetings.

52:51.818 --> 52:54.454
Thank you for joining us this month.

52:54.454 --> 52:56.623
This is JW Broadcasting

52:56.623 --> 53:05.926
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
