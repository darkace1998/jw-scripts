Imagine the astonished look
on the faces of the apostles.

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:07.824 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The resurrected Jesus stands before them

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:09.826 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the Mount of Olives.

00:00:09.826 --> 00:00:13.029 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Just before he disappears into the clouds,

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus makes this profound declaration,

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:19.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Acts 1:8:

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will receive power
when the holy spirit comes upon you,

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:27.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will be
witnesses of me in Jerusalem,

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:30.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in all Judea and Samaria,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the most distant part of the earth.”

00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an assignment!

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were to preach the good news
of God’s Kingdom

00:00:40.356 --> 00:00:42.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
throughout the earth.

00:00:42.492 --> 00:00:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those disciples must have felt overwhelmed

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:48.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wondered how
such a small band of preachers

00:00:48.832 --> 00:00:51.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could ever get this work done.

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:56.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ten days later, they received
the promised holy spirit,

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:58.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they got to work.

00:00:58.408 --> 00:01:01.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, they faced many challenges.

00:01:01.578 --> 00:01:04.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that did not stop them.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three years passed,
and the preaching work

00:01:06.916 --> 00:01:10.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was expanded to include Gentiles.

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:14.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can read the moving account
in Acts chapter 10.

00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:17.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, an angel of God appears

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the God-fearing army officer Cornelius.

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:23.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, Peter responds
to the leadings of God’s spirit

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:26.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go to the officer’s home.

00:01:26.703 --> 00:01:30.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There, Peter gives
a thorough witness about Jesus

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only to Cornelius

00:01:32.642 --> 00:01:35.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also to his family and friends.

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As he concludes his discourse,

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:43.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peter explains the commission
he received to be an evangelizer.

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:46.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s open to Acts 10:42,

00:01:46.923 --> 00:01:49.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and note the two main aspects

00:01:49.092 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the preaching work started by Jesus:

00:01:52.462 --> 00:01:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, he ordered us to preach to the people

00:01:56.432 --> 00:01:59.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and to give a thorough witness

00:01:59.102 --> 00:02:01.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that this is the one decreed by God

00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:05.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be judge of the living and the dead.”

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:08.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Jesus commanded his disciples

00:02:08.278 --> 00:02:10.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to preach to the people.”

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition, they were
“to give a thorough witness.”

00:02:14.684 --> 00:02:19.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The disciples were to search out
honesthearted, deserving ones.

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:23.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would require a thorough coverage
of their territory.

00:02:23.693 --> 00:02:26.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In spite of vicious persecution,

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christians in the first century
obeyed Jesus’ command

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:33.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach and to bear thorough witness.

00:02:33.102 --> 00:02:35.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by about 60 of our Common Era,

00:02:35.638 --> 00:02:40.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
less than 30 years after the Christians
had received their commission,

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:43.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Paul could write
to the congregation in Colossae

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:48.418 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the good news had been
“preached in all creation under heaven.”

00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:54.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a testimony to the power
of God’s holy spirit

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:56.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the faith, zeal,

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:00.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and determination of those early disciples!

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:04.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the late 1800’s,
a small group of Bible students

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:08.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rose to the challenge
of bearing thorough witness.

00:03:08.938 --> 00:03:13.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
An article in the April 1881 issue
of <i>Zion’s Watch Tower</i>

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:15.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had the thrilling title

00:03:15.378 --> 00:03:19.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wanted 1,000 Preachers.”

00:03:20.483 --> 00:03:23.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, Jehovah’s Witnesses
are bearing witness

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 240 lands.

00:03:25.922 --> 00:03:28.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But doing so has its challenges.

00:03:28.825 --> 00:03:33.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some of those challenges,
and what can we do to meet them?

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of our brothers face
the challenge of long distances,

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:40.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
climate extremes, rough terrain,

00:03:40.536 --> 00:03:43.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and poor travel conditions.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some areas, just getting
to meet people

00:03:46.743 --> 00:03:49.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a challenge.

00:03:49.178 --> 00:03:53.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To add to the challenge,
Revelation 14:6 reminds us

00:03:53.216 --> 00:03:55.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the good news would be declared

00:03:55.218 --> 00:03:59.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people.”

00:04:00.523 --> 00:04:03.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This can require learning a new language

00:04:03.226 --> 00:04:06.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and understanding
different religious, ethnic,

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:08.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cultural backgrounds.

00:04:09.565 --> 00:04:12.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It can mean coping
with unresponsive territories,

00:04:12.135 --> 00:04:16.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
apathy, and poor living conditions.

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:18.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus warned that opposers would try

00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:21.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hinder or stop the preaching work.

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:25.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt you are facing
some form of challenge

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:27.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your local territory.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We cannot begin to give possible solutions

00:04:29.986 --> 00:04:33.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all the obstacles we face today.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it is helpful to learn how others
are coping with their challenges,

00:04:38.194 --> 00:04:40.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this can stimulate our thinking

00:04:40.997 --> 00:04:45.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to identify ways to meet our challenges.

00:04:45.068 --> 00:04:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s focus on three Bible principles
that will help us

00:04:49.105 --> 00:04:52.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry out our ministry successfully:

00:04:53.676 --> 00:04:56.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) Trust in Jehovah,

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:59.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) be flexible,

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:03.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) stay focused.

00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:07.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can trusting in Jehovah help us?

00:05:07.357 --> 00:05:09.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider an example.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:14.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the 1990’s,
Jehovah’s Witnesses in France

00:05:14.364 --> 00:05:17.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
endured an avalanche
of negative media reports.

00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:20.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result of these vicious attacks,

00:05:20.436 --> 00:05:22.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some brothers lost their jobs,

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:26.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Witness children were taunted at school,

00:05:26.109 --> 00:05:30.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching became extremely difficult
in some areas.

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:32.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did they cope?

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:36.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The turning point came in January 1999.

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:39.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body approved
a special campaign

00:05:39.255 --> 00:05:41.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distribute a magazine-size tract

00:05:41.724 --> 00:05:45.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that exposed all of the accusations as false.

00:05:45.962 --> 00:05:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beginning early one Friday morning,
Witnesses throughout France

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:53.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
distributed 12 million copies of the tract

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just three days.

00:05:55.838 --> 00:05:58.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This campaign gave them renewed strength

00:05:58.207 --> 00:06:00.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and boldness to preach.

00:06:00.943 --> 00:06:03.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the 19 years that followed,

00:06:03.212 --> 00:06:06.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a continuous increase
in the number of publishers

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:08.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ranks of regular pioneers

00:06:08.985 --> 00:06:12.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
swelled to over 15,000.

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:17.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you constantly face a barrage
of negative media reports,

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does this mean that you need
a special campaign to meet the challenge?

00:06:22.432 --> 00:06:24.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although the campaign was a stimulus,

00:06:27.403 --> 00:06:29.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
brothers and sisters in France said

00:06:29.605 --> 00:06:33.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that what really gave them
strength and boldness

00:06:33.342 --> 00:06:37.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were the words of 2 Chronicles 32:8.

00:06:37.046 --> 00:06:39.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it.

00:06:39.248 --> 00:06:43.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The setting is in the time
of King Hezekiah of Judah.

00:06:43.653 --> 00:06:45.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people were beaten down

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:50.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the repeated threats
and taunts of the Assyrians.

00:06:50.059 --> 00:06:52.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What strengthened them?

00:06:52.228 --> 00:06:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking about the king of Assyria,
King Hezekiah declared:

00:06:57.900 --> 00:07:01.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With him is an arm of flesh,

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but with us is Jehovah our God to help us

00:07:05.174 --> 00:07:07.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to fight our battles.”

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:09.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the result?

00:07:09.846 --> 00:07:14.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The people were strengthened
by the words of King Hezekiah of Judah.”

00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:19.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just hearing this reminder
that Jehovah would help them

00:07:19.422 --> 00:07:22.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was enough to strengthen the Jews.

00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:25.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah took action and sent an angel

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:28.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to destroy the enemy army.

00:07:28.264 --> 00:07:32.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah use his angels to help us today?

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:36.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Note what we read at Revelation 14:6:

00:07:37.273 --> 00:07:40.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I saw another angel flying in midheaven,

00:07:40.576 --> 00:07:43.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he had everlasting good news to declare

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:46.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those who dwell on the earth,

00:07:46.015 --> 00:07:48.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to every nation and tribe

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:51.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tongue and people.”

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:54.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be sensitive to angelic direction

00:07:54.423 --> 00:07:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the leadings of God’s holy spirit.

00:07:58.794 --> 00:08:01.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you feel moved to make that one last call

00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:05.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to speak to the person
next to you on the bus, do it!

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speak up.

00:08:07.203 --> 00:08:10.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may well be
that an angel is directing you

00:08:10.106 --> 00:08:14.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to one who is “rightly disposed
for everlasting life.”

00:08:15.645 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider the second Bible principle

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will help us to bear thorough witness:

00:08:21.317 --> 00:08:23.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be flexible.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:27.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes just getting to talk to people
can be a challenge.

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To overcome this obstacle,
we need to be flexible.

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takanori and Yumi Takahashi
have served in territories

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:39.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are as different as night and day.

00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:42.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, they visited our studio.

00:08:42.638 --> 00:08:45.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen as they tell us how they have learned

00:08:45.174 --> 00:08:49.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet the challenges
of bearing thorough witness.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takanori and Yumi,

00:08:52.748 --> 00:08:54.784 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
welcome to our studio!

00:08:54.784 --> 00:08:56.452 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for inviting us.

00:08:56.452 --> 00:08:59.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we’re very happy to have you here.

00:08:59.021 --> 00:09:01.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takanori, you and I go back a long way.

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:07.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still remember when you came
into Japan Bethel back in 1977,

00:09:07.096 --> 00:09:11.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we served in the same congregation
for a number of years.

00:09:11.334 --> 00:09:15.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then in 1990, you had
a big change in your life.

00:09:15.438 --> 00:09:17.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to tell us what happened?

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, my twin brother,

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobuaki, was also serving at Bethel.

00:09:23.713 --> 00:09:27.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To our surprise, we were assigned

00:09:27.049 --> 00:09:29.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Papua New Guinea as missionaries.

00:09:29.185 --> 00:09:31.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a big change!

00:09:31.254 --> 00:09:35.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here you are working
in the rural territory of Papua New Guinea.

00:09:35.691 --> 00:09:38.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During your 25 years in Papua New Guinea,

00:09:38.461 --> 00:09:41.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understand that you served
in the missionary field,

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:44.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the circuit work, and also at Bethel.

00:09:44.233 --> 00:09:46.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, Yumi, when did you come into the picture?

00:09:46.936 --> 00:09:51.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Takanori and I were married
in September 1993,

00:09:51.173 --> 00:09:54.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I joined him in the missionary work.

00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:58.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adapting to remote territories such as this
was a challenge.

00:09:59.482 --> 00:10:01.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in order to bear thorough witness,

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:05.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what kind of challenges
did you have to overcome?

00:10:05.655 --> 00:10:08.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people of Papua New Guinea
are very friendly.

00:10:08.724 --> 00:10:12.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They have a deep respect for the Bible.

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:14.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was easy to relax,

00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:16.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
speak to them face-to-face,

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:21.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to read the Scriptures together,
and reason with them.

00:10:21.203 --> 00:10:23.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those don’t sound like challenges.

00:10:23.272 --> 00:10:25.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you face any obstacles?

00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:28.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we preached in the villages,

00:10:28.411 --> 00:10:30.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the response of the local people

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
often depended on the response
of the village chief.

00:10:35.651 --> 00:10:39.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If he listened,
almost the whole village listened.

00:10:39.655 --> 00:10:42.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if his response was negative,

00:10:42.625 --> 00:10:46.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the people would walk away
and hide in the bush.

00:10:46.462 --> 00:10:50.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we would always show respect

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:52.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and approach the village chief first.

00:10:53.869 --> 00:10:58.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This often moved him
to view our visit with favor.

00:10:58.174 --> 00:11:02.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The challenge in the cities
was mainly security.

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:06.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t safe for us to go
into some areas alone

00:11:06.515 --> 00:11:08.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or to visit homes regularly.

00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:13.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we would ask our Bible students
to come to the Kingdom Hall

00:11:13.222 --> 00:11:16.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for their study before the meeting.

00:11:16.726 --> 00:11:21.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a good way to encourage them
to attend meetings.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:25.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s obvious that you enjoyed
your service in Papua New Guinea.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now you’re serving as special pioneers
in the Maihama Congregation

00:11:28.504 --> 00:11:33.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just 20 minutes from downtown Tokyo.

00:11:33.142 --> 00:11:37.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you went from a territory
where people have deep respect for the Bible

00:11:37.179 --> 00:11:41.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a land where less than 1 percent
of the people claim to be Christian.

00:11:41.684 --> 00:11:45.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what other kind of differences
did you find

00:11:45.121 --> 00:11:49.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between your territory in Japan now
and your missionary territory?

00:11:49.258 --> 00:11:52.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, it’s very different.

00:11:52.294 --> 00:11:55.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tokyo Disneyland is in our territory,

00:11:55.564 --> 00:11:57.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and 70 percent of the homes

00:11:57.833 --> 00:12:01.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are in high-security apartment buildings.

00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have to stand in the lobby
in front of the doorman,

00:12:05.474 --> 00:12:09.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
push a button, and speak to a camera.

00:12:09.378 --> 00:12:11.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Coming from Papua New Guinea,

00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:14.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we found it challenging
to work this territory.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:19.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were used to friendly discussions
face-to-face.

00:12:19.422 --> 00:12:22.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we see only the lens of a camera.

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:27.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we have learned
to view the camera as our friend.

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:28.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As your friend?

00:12:28.964 --> 00:12:32.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think most of us find it challenging
to speak to a camera.

00:12:32.601 --> 00:12:35.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how do you overcome this challenge?

00:12:35.371 --> 00:12:38.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that as soon as we push the button,

00:12:38.908 --> 00:12:42.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our face shows up on a screen
inside of the apartment.

00:12:42.545 --> 00:12:46.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We stand an arm’s length from the camera

00:12:46.248 --> 00:12:49.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that our face is framed nicely.

00:12:49.285 --> 00:12:52.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we adjust our volume accordingly,

00:12:52.154 --> 00:12:57.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
taking into consideration the doorman
and others who may be listening.

00:12:57.893 --> 00:12:59.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We say our greeting

00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:03.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about two seconds after we push the button,

00:13:03.499 --> 00:13:07.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just when we know
that they are looking at the monitor.

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our friendly greeting and warm smile

00:13:10.573 --> 00:13:14.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
makes them feel like we
can actually see their face.

00:13:15.878 --> 00:13:19.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prepare a specific appealing introduction

00:13:19.682 --> 00:13:24.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and show them respect and consideration.

00:13:24.153 --> 00:13:29.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The people in our territory
like to be viewed as successful,

00:13:29.158 --> 00:13:31.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not as people who have problems.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we try to focus on positive subjects.

00:13:35.364 --> 00:13:38.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We prepare a variety of subjects

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:43.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they don’t hear
the same message over and over.

00:13:43.105 --> 00:13:47.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like many people, Japanese do not like
to be put on the spot.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:52.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So instead of asking a question
and waiting for them to answer,

00:13:52.915 --> 00:13:56.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we use the teaching method of our tracts

00:13:56.719 --> 00:13:59.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and give three possible answers
for them to choose from.

00:13:59.855 --> 00:14:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, have you had positive results
from this intercom preaching?

00:14:04.727 --> 00:14:07.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since we started to use this method,

00:14:07.796 --> 00:14:11.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the number of not-at-homes has decreased.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And also, when we meet people on the street,

00:14:14.303 --> 00:14:17.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sometimes they say they know us

00:14:17.706 --> 00:14:20.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they saw us on their intercom.

00:14:20.876 --> 00:14:22.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was excellent!

00:14:22.478 --> 00:14:26.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thank you, Takanori and Yumi,
for sharing with us

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:29.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how you have met the challenge
of bearing thorough witness

00:14:29.451 --> 00:14:32.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a variety of territories.

00:14:33.188 --> 00:14:37.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 9:22, 23

00:14:37.526 --> 00:14:39.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—let’s read it.

00:14:40.396 --> 00:14:44.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have become all things
to people of all sorts,

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that I might
by all possible means save some.

00:14:48.537 --> 00:14:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I do all things for the sake
of the good news,

00:14:52.408 --> 00:14:55.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to share it with others.”

00:14:55.978 --> 00:14:57.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Become all things.”

00:14:57.980 --> 00:14:59.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do all things.”

00:14:59.648 --> 00:15:02.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other words, be flexible.

00:15:02.651 --> 00:15:06.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Apply the suggestions
in the meeting workbook.

00:15:06.155 --> 00:15:10.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Get well-acquainted with each tool
in the Teaching Toolbox.

00:15:10.326 --> 00:15:12.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Observe how experienced publishers

00:15:12.828 --> 00:15:15.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pioneers use those tools.

00:15:15.798 --> 00:15:18.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Understand the feelings and circumstances

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of people in the territory.

00:15:20.836 --> 00:15:25.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even in the same territory,
we may need to use a variety of approaches.

00:15:25.841 --> 00:15:28.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, about 40 percent

00:15:28.444 --> 00:15:31.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the apartment buildings
in the Takahashi’s territory

00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not allow the Witnesses
to enter the lobby,

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:39.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so they do public and informal witnessing
to reach those people.

00:15:39.488 --> 00:15:42.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s consider the third Bible principle:

00:15:42.791 --> 00:15:44.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay focused.

00:15:44.893 --> 00:15:47.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 6:22, Jesus said:

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:51.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The lamp of the body is the eye.

00:15:51.634 --> 00:15:54.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If, then, your eye is focused,

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:57.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your whole body will be bright.”

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:03.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keeping our eye focused means
keeping our life simple

00:16:03.012 --> 00:16:06.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to concentrate on spiritual matters.

00:16:06.815 --> 00:16:10.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Distractions take our attention
and energy away

00:16:10.452 --> 00:16:13.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from our responsibility
to bear thorough witness.

00:16:13.555 --> 00:16:17.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we can teach those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life,”

00:16:17.993 --> 00:16:20.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to find them.

00:16:20.329 --> 00:16:24.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We leave no stone unturned
as we search for them at their homes,

00:16:24.667 --> 00:16:27.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the streets, in parks,

00:16:27.102 --> 00:16:30.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in stores, and at the workplace.

00:16:30.673 --> 00:16:34.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no on/off switch
for our preaching work.

00:16:34.977 --> 00:16:38.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our “preaching switch” must be on

00:16:38.847 --> 00:16:41.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at all times.

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:44.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only do we look
for opportunities to preach

00:16:44.953 --> 00:16:48.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we also make opportunities.

00:16:48.057 --> 00:16:51.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if our efforts to find interested ones

00:16:51.026 --> 00:16:53.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not fruitful?

00:16:53.062 --> 00:16:55.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus did not say that every human

00:16:55.497 --> 00:16:58.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must become a disciple before the end comes.

00:16:58.534 --> 00:17:02.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, he said that the end will come

00:17:02.004 --> 00:17:06.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after the good news has been preached
in all the inhabited earth

00:17:06.175 --> 00:17:10.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a witness has been given
to all the nations.

00:17:10.045 --> 00:17:13.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The apostle Paul stayed
focused on his ministry.

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:17.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we imitate his positive attitude

00:17:17.286 --> 00:17:21.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
expressed at Acts 20:24:

00:17:22.224 --> 00:17:25.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Nevertheless, I do not consider my own life

00:17:25.861 --> 00:17:27.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of any importance to me,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:30.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if only I may finish my course

00:17:30.933 --> 00:17:34.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the ministry that I received
from the Lord Jesus,

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to bear thorough witness to the good news

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the undeserved kindness of God.”

00:17:42.411 --> 00:17:46.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The opportunity to bear thorough witness
will soon be over.

00:17:46.915 --> 00:17:50.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May we use the remaining time effectively

00:17:50.252 --> 00:17:52.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to search for deserving ones

00:17:52.621 --> 00:17:56.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to teach them the truth.

00:17:56.225 --> 00:17:58.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imitate the faith of Hezekiah,

00:17:58.694 --> 00:18:01.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and trust in Jehovah;

00:18:01.630 --> 00:18:03.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
learn from the apostle Paul,

00:18:03.899 --> 00:18:06.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and be flexible;

00:18:06.201 --> 00:18:08.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
obey Jesus’ direction,

00:18:08.604 --> 00:18:11.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and stay focused.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then you too can meet the challenge

00:18:14.543 --> 00:18:17.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of bearing “thorough witness.”
