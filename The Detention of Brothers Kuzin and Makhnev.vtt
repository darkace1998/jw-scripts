On June 26, 2019, in Kaluga, Russia,

00:00:13.284 --> 00:00:16.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mass searches were carried out
in the homes of peaceful believers.

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roman Makhnev and Dmitriy Kuzin,

00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were arrested simply
because of their religion.

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:26.630 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I heard a commotion on the street.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I went out,
I saw two masked men in the courtyard.

00:00:30.384 --> 00:00:32.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I took the keys for the gate
and opened the door.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several more men were there.

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:35.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My daughter came out.

00:00:35.973 --> 00:00:37.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was barefoot,

00:00:37.808 --> 00:00:41.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they made her stand next to me
on the courtyard flagstone.

00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:43.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was drizzling.

00:00:43.689 --> 00:00:45.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I asked to let the child put shoes on.

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:47.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said, “Later.”

00:00:47.943 --> 00:00:51.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The believer, Roman Makhnev,

00:00:51.196 --> 00:00:54.241 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was handcuffed, even though in no way

00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:57.328 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was he ever aggressive or disorderly.

00:00:57.328 --> 00:01:00.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the same time,
another group of security forces burst

00:01:00.915 --> 00:01:03.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into Dmitriy and Svetlana Kuzin’s apartment.

00:01:04.335 --> 00:01:06.795 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was here in this room at home,

00:01:06.795 --> 00:01:07.838 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
watering my plants.

00:01:07.838 --> 00:01:10.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard my husband unlocking the door.

00:01:11.091 --> 00:01:14.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I went out of the room
and saw a bunch of people.

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:16.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My husband
had obviously been knocked down

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:18.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
face-first to the tile floor as he came in.

00:01:20.392 --> 00:01:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His hands were
handcuffed behind his back.

00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:25.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet another group
of armed law-enforcement officers

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
raided the home
of 87-year-old Olga Verevkina.

00:01:30.194 --> 00:01:32.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a full SWAT team in camouflage.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.783 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
No warrant was shown.

00:01:35.783 --> 00:01:38.535 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They demanded, “Get up!”

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I said: “I can’t.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:42.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m infirm.”

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My blood pressure went up to 200/115.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to the believers,
during the searches,

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
publications from the Federal List
of Extremist Materials were planted

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:57.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their homes
and their rights were violated.

00:01:57.471 --> 00:02:00.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I heard Dasha scream:
“This was not in my room!

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Explain to me how it got here!”

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:06.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I heard my husband’s voice,
saying, “This was planted.”

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.232 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Just that afternoon,

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:09.775 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was vacuuming under the bed,

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:11.318 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and there was nothing there.

00:02:11.318 --> 00:02:13.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one identified himself.

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:15.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No documents were shown.

00:02:15.781 --> 00:02:19.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The search began at 9:00 in the evening

00:02:19.368 --> 00:02:23.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lasted until about 4:30 in the morning.

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:28.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But for camouflaged security forces

00:02:28.002 --> 00:02:32.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to burst in on old, infirm people

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:34.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that’s unbelievable!

00:02:34.091 --> 00:02:35.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s quite interesting.

00:02:35.926 --> 00:02:38.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In order to deal with an elderly woman,

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our law-enforcement officers
come en masse,

00:02:41.223 --> 00:02:44.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wearing masks, and carrying weapons.

00:02:44.977 --> 00:02:46.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What cowards!

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:51.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these people claim
that they are actually fighting extremism.

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:55.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the searches,
Roman Makhnev and Dmitriy Kuzin

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were taken to the FSB building.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:01.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Papa was taken away,
the only thing I managed to whisper to him

00:03:01.118 --> 00:03:03.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was that I was proud of his integrity.

00:03:03.704 --> 00:03:06.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then they took him away, and I felt sad.

00:03:07.958 --> 00:03:10.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was scared.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they brought Roman to the FSB building,

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:20.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was handcuffed to a radiator

00:03:20.846 --> 00:03:23.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in some sort of utility room

00:03:23.015 --> 00:03:25.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and was kept like this until he was called

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:27.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for questioning in the morning.

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:31.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is noteworthy that several hours earlier,
during the searches,

00:03:31.982 --> 00:03:34.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an ambulance was called for Roman Makhnev.

00:03:35.736 --> 00:03:37.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roman became very ill.

00:03:37.362 --> 00:03:39.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dasha started to scream.

00:03:39.406 --> 00:03:42.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The FSB called an ambulance,
and it came quickly enough.

00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was given medication,
and then he felt better.

00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:50.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roman was arrested on the 26th,
and they didn’t feed him until the 29th.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:54.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roman Makhnev
was given no food for three days.

00:03:54.838 --> 00:03:56.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They said,

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Well, he could eat 
whatever he brought with him.”

00:03:58.383 --> 00:03:59.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Interesting.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:03.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have filed complaints
with various agencies.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On June 28, two days after their arrest,

00:04:06.141 --> 00:04:08.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kaluzhskiy District Court sent

00:04:08.352 --> 00:04:11.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Roman Makhnev and Dmitriy Kuzin
to a detention center.

00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:22.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I hope that people will realize

00:04:22.574 --> 00:04:24.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my dad is not guilty of anything,

00:04:24.326 --> 00:04:25.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he is not a criminal.

00:04:25.869 --> 00:04:28.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, I hope that soon he’ll be back,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we will be together again.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The believers do not agree with the charges,

00:04:32.668 --> 00:04:35.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they intend to seek justice.

00:04:36.296 --> 00:04:40.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t know if we’ll be able to,
but I’m determined to fight

00:04:40.217 --> 00:04:42.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the end to help my husband

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to support him.

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:48.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I very much hope
that common sense will prevail

00:04:50.394 --> 00:04:52.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the authorities will finally realize

00:04:52.437 --> 00:04:55.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not present a threat to society,

00:04:55.774 --> 00:04:57.776 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much less to the State.
