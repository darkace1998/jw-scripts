Welcome!
Welcome!

00:00:05.321 --> 00:00:09.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Welcome to this month’s broadcast!

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:12.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here is a little sample

00:00:12.162 --> 00:00:15.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what will be contained in our program.

00:00:15.665 --> 00:00:18.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll meet brothers and sisters

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:22.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve learned to see
and treat others impartially.

00:00:22.672 --> 00:00:24.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What helped them?

00:00:24.874 --> 00:00:29.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how can all of us
be united in a divided world?

00:00:29.612 --> 00:00:31.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll find out.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:35.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you ever needed
to muster up courage to do what’s right?

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:40.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you enduring disappointment?

00:00:40.023 --> 00:00:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see what we can learn

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the example of Samuel.

00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Jesus showed us
how to see the good in people,

00:00:49.265 --> 00:00:52.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be loving and kind

00:00:52.669 --> 00:00:54.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just like a child.

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:56.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the message

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our new music video.

00:01:00.043 --> 00:01:03.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, there’s much to look forward to

00:01:03.346 --> 00:01:06.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this May 2020 edition

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting®.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Always Rejoice!” is the appealing theme

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:34.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this year’s conventions.

00:01:34.244 --> 00:01:39.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body would like
to give you a preview of the program.

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take a look.

00:01:44.053 --> 00:01:46.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone wants to be happy.

00:01:47.624 --> 00:01:49.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we all face problems,

00:01:49.993 --> 00:01:51.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
problems that are hard to deal with.

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:59.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So can you ever really be happy?

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the 2020 convention
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:02:11.214 --> 00:02:13.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you will learn how to find joy,

00:02:13.316 --> 00:02:15.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even when life is hard,

00:02:18.822 --> 00:02:20.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how God has made it possible

00:02:20.857 --> 00:02:23.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us to be happy now and forever!

00:02:27.797 --> 00:02:31.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happiness might seem
hard to find, but it isn’t!

00:02:32.168 --> 00:02:34.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Come and see for yourself!

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That preview reminds us

00:02:43.746 --> 00:02:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the wonderful convention program
of last year,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the feature Bible drama

00:02:49.886 --> 00:02:53.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about faithful Josiah.

00:02:53.022 --> 00:02:56.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was involved in producing that drama?

00:02:56.626 --> 00:02:59.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch the following video

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:02.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that reveals what transpired

00:03:02.232 --> 00:03:04.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
behind the scenes.

00:03:16.512 --> 00:03:19.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where do you begin an important project

00:03:19.115 --> 00:03:23.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like <i>The Story of Josiah:</i>
<i>Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad? </i>

00:03:23.186 --> 00:03:26.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You begin with prayerful consideration.

00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:31.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a serious responsibility
—part of being loyal to Jehovah and his Word.

00:03:32.428 --> 00:03:36.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, many hours
of careful research goes into the first step:

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
writing a script.

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:43.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The script is then visualized
through a step called storyboarding.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s not just
the script and storyboarding

00:03:49.612 --> 00:03:51.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that requires attention to accuracy.

00:03:52.916 --> 00:03:56.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Costumes must be thoroughly
researched so that their components,

00:03:56.653 --> 00:04:00.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
styles, colors, and even the types of fabric

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:02.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appear as historically accurate as possible.

00:04:05.828 --> 00:04:08.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The production must also
accurately depict the times

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:11.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being represented while making
the best use of donated funds.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:14.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can this be done?

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For <i>The Story of Josiah, </i>

00:04:16.606 --> 00:04:19.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the solution was to film at Bethel locations,

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:22.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the studio spaces at Mount Ebo.

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:26.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Set construction began early in 2018.

00:04:27.684 --> 00:04:31.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The production team designed
and built three flexible sets

00:04:31.187 --> 00:04:33.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that with easy prop adjustments,

00:04:33.923 --> 00:04:36.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could be in multiple locations.

00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:40.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even the exterior Jerusalem city scenes

00:04:40.663 --> 00:04:42.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were filmed indoors.

00:04:50.873 --> 00:04:53.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many brothers and sisters
from local congregations

00:04:53.376 --> 00:04:55.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
served as extras for the crowd scenes.

00:04:57.613 --> 00:05:00.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With an eye to Biblical
and historical accuracy,

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the makeup team transformed the actors

00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:05.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into characters from King Josiah’s time. 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were so many details to get right.

00:05:35.318 --> 00:05:38.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a large portion of the drama,
filming in front of a green screen

00:05:38.488 --> 00:05:43.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enabled the visual effects team
to construct accurate environments digitally.

00:05:46.362 --> 00:05:50.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many layers of character action,
called plates, were assembled

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:52.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with digital environments
to produce complex visuals.

00:06:19.228 --> 00:06:21.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the closing festival scene,

00:06:21.197 --> 00:06:24.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which required 14,000 Israelites

00:06:24.967 --> 00:06:26.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many sheep,

00:06:26.736 --> 00:06:31.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
3D models were made
and duplicated to simulate the large crowd.

00:06:35.645 --> 00:06:39.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In July 2018, the production packed up

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:41.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moved to an outdoor location

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:43.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Watchtower Farms in Wallkill, New York.

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And action!

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In August, the last scene was filmed

00:07:03.306 --> 00:07:05.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
back at the Mount Ebo studio.

00:07:06.642 --> 00:07:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After 45 days of filming

00:07:08.644 --> 00:07:11.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with over 4 terabytes
of footage captured,

00:07:11.481 --> 00:07:13.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the team had finished production.

00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:18.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The project moved to the editing
facilities at Patterson, New York.

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what more could be done
so that the account portrayed 

00:07:25.995 --> 00:07:27.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could touch our hearts?

00:07:29.165 --> 00:07:31.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A colorist applied a look to the overall film

00:07:31.934 --> 00:07:34.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to enhance the picture’s quality and mood.

00:07:34.437 --> 00:07:36.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have to get better.

00:07:36.038 --> 00:07:37.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m afraid of being alone.

00:07:37.807 --> 00:07:40.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Additional sound effects, such as footsteps

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:43.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the sound of dry grass being rustled,

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:47.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were recorded to make the on-screen
action more natural and compelling.

00:07:48.818 --> 00:07:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, the musical soundtrack was composed,

00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:55.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recorded, and added to the movie
to enhance the appeal to our hearts.

00:07:58.127 --> 00:08:01.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The work on <i>The Story of Josiah:</i>
<i>Love Jehovah; Hate What Is Bad</i>

00:08:01.864 --> 00:08:05.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was done to strengthen
Jehovah’s people worldwide.

00:08:06.836 --> 00:08:08.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re not alone.

00:08:08.004 --> 00:08:10.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:08:12.241 --> 00:08:15.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This powerful story also assists parents
as they teach their children

00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:19.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the power of God’s Word and promise.

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:23.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These words that I am commanding you today

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:25.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must be on your heart,

00:08:25.321 --> 00:08:27.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you must inculcate them in your sons

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and speak of them when you sit in your house

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:32.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and when you walk on the road

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:35.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when you lie down and when you get up.”

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:38.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So that it may always go well with you

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and your sons after you,

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you are doing what is good

00:08:44.707 --> 00:08:48.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and right in the eyes of Jehovah your God.”

00:08:49.845 --> 00:08:54.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Story of Josiah </i>has proven
to be yet another example

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how Jehovah continues to provide
abundant spiritual food and support

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:01.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his people worldwide.

00:09:05.828 --> 00:09:09.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That video certainly
brought the Bible account

00:09:09.332 --> 00:09:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to life for us!

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may want to go back and review

00:09:14.136 --> 00:09:17.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the full-feature Bible drama again
from our website.

00:09:19.208 --> 00:09:20.643 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We might mention

00:09:20.643 --> 00:09:22.678 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we’ve had just a few parents

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:25.414 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
write in expressing concern

00:09:25.414 --> 00:09:28.618 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that some of our videos depict scenes

00:09:28.618 --> 00:09:31.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could have an effect on children

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve been protected from anything

00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:37.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even hinting at an act of violence.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:40.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We very much appreciate the concern.

00:09:40.963 --> 00:09:45.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, when portraying a Bible account,

00:09:45.101 --> 00:09:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we cannot ignore the message Jehovah saw fit

00:09:49.138 --> 00:09:51.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preserve in his Word.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t feel comfortable watering down

00:09:54.477 --> 00:09:57.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the inspired insight that Jehovah

00:09:57.246 --> 00:10:01.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has preserved for the benefit
of true worshippers.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, as you’ve observed,

00:10:04.153 --> 00:10:07.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we do so as tastefully as possible.

00:10:07.857 --> 00:10:12.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t show
actual violent acts or bloodshed.

00:10:12.628 --> 00:10:16.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A Scriptural precedent might be found

00:10:16.332 --> 00:10:20.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2 Chronicles 20:13.

00:10:20.102 --> 00:10:23.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehoshaphat was describing

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:25.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a great crowd of enemy nations

00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:30.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were about to launch
an attack against God’s people.

00:10:30.012 --> 00:10:34.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He described
the possible disaster quite graphically,

00:10:34.317 --> 00:10:38.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referring to the possibility
of death by the sword,

00:10:38.087 --> 00:10:41.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by pestilence, or by famine.

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:46.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who was he sharing
this disturbing information with?

00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:51.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Chronicles 20:13 tells us:

00:10:51.634 --> 00:10:55.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Meanwhile, all those of Judah

00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:57.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“were standing before Jehovah,

00:10:57.173 --> 00:10:59.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“along with their little ones,

00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:02.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their wives, and their children.”

00:11:03.713 --> 00:11:07.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wanted all, including the young ones,

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:10.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to understand what was coming.

00:11:10.786 --> 00:11:14.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents likewise need to give their children

00:11:14.657 --> 00:11:16.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a realistic idea

00:11:16.726 --> 00:11:20.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of what we all will face in the near future.

00:11:20.329 --> 00:11:23.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many parents choose
to help their children appreciate

00:11:23.899 --> 00:11:28.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the graphic visual imagery
of a Bible-based video,

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:32.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while at the same time
building trust in Jehovah,

00:11:32.808 --> 00:11:36.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who will be with them in times of distress.

00:11:36.512 --> 00:11:39.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is similar to what they’d do

00:11:39.648 --> 00:11:42.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when reading a graphic Biblical account

00:11:42.752 --> 00:11:45.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to their children from the Scriptures,

00:11:45.721 --> 00:11:48.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as from the book of Revelation.

00:11:48.624 --> 00:11:50.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be assured

00:11:50.926 --> 00:11:53.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we’ll continue to be sensitive

00:11:53.195 --> 00:11:57.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the feelings of you parents
when we produce a video

00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s based on a Bible account

00:11:59.335 --> 00:12:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that includes descriptions of warfare

00:12:02.505 --> 00:12:06.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other incidents of violent actions.

00:12:06.442 --> 00:12:09.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll do so with care,

00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:13.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while not ignoring the powerful details

00:12:13.182 --> 00:12:17.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
depicted in the inspired Word of God.

00:12:19.054 --> 00:12:22.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The theme for this program is

00:12:22.091 --> 00:12:27.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Be Childlike—But Not Childish!”

00:12:28.063 --> 00:12:32.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 14:20

00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:34.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is our theme scripture:

00:12:35.571 --> 00:12:40.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Brothers, do not become
young children in your understanding,

00:12:40.576 --> 00:12:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but be young children as to badness;

00:12:44.814 --> 00:12:48.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and become full-grown in your understanding.”

00:12:49.718 --> 00:12:52.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this single verse,

00:12:52.087 --> 00:12:56.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re told not to be
like a young child in one way

00:12:56.392 --> 00:13:00.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re told to be
like a young child in another way.

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:05.634 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We should not be like a child
when it comes to understanding,

00:13:05.634 --> 00:13:10.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we should be like a child
when it comes to badness.

00:13:10.272 --> 00:13:12.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During this discussion,

00:13:12.975 --> 00:13:16.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s focus on three ways

00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:18.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should not be like a child

00:13:18.414 --> 00:13:22.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then let’s talk about three ways
we should be like a child.

00:13:23.886 --> 00:13:29.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please turn to Hebrews 5:13, 14,

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:34.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and let’s identify negative trait number one

00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:37.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not want to imitate:

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:42.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For everyone who continues to feed on milk

00:13:42.538 --> 00:13:45.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is unacquainted
with the word of righteousness,

00:13:45.708 --> 00:13:48.611 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for he is a young child.

00:13:48.611 --> 00:13:53.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But solid food belongs to mature people,

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:58.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to those who through use
have their powers of discernment trained

00:13:58.254 --> 00:14:01.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to distinguish both right and wrong.”

00:14:02.224 --> 00:14:05.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the negative trait that children have

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is immature feeding habits.

00:14:09.765 --> 00:14:12.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it: Young children

00:14:12.701 --> 00:14:16.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have a tendency to eat what they like

00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:19.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regardless of its nutritional value.

00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:23.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most young ones would be perfectly happy

00:14:23.145 --> 00:14:25.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eating ice cream, candy, cookies,

00:14:25.881 --> 00:14:29.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other sweets for all of their meals.

00:14:29.885 --> 00:14:32.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we ask,

00:14:32.521 --> 00:14:35.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do our spiritual appetites

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and feeding habits reveal about us?

00:14:38.827 --> 00:14:43.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider: How do we spend our free time?

00:14:43.532 --> 00:14:47.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we squander
voluminous hours watching television

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or reading material that provides
little or no spiritual nutrition?

00:14:52.942 --> 00:14:57.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or do we make wise use of our free time

00:14:57.346 --> 00:15:01.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to take in solid spiritual food?

00:15:01.083 --> 00:15:04.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we receive
a new issue of <i>The Watchtower,</i>

00:15:04.653 --> 00:15:09.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do we merely scan through it,
looking at a few highlights,

00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:11.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then do something else?

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we take time
to research deeper spiritual truths

00:15:16.298 --> 00:15:18.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so as to fully understand them?

00:15:18.901 --> 00:15:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do we take time to really meditate?

00:15:21.704 --> 00:15:24.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is not daydreaming.

00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:28.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditation is bridled, focused thought.

00:15:28.811 --> 00:15:32.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pause your reading to ask questions such as:

00:15:32.915 --> 00:15:36.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What does this teach me about Jehovah?

00:15:36.885 --> 00:15:40.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘With whom could I share this information?

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:43.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What’s Jehovah telling me?

00:15:43.425 --> 00:15:48.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How does this fit in with other things
I know about this subject?

00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:52.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I make application?’

00:15:52.101 --> 00:15:55.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 1:25 encourages us

00:15:55.804 --> 00:15:58.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to peer into God’s Word.

00:15:58.507 --> 00:16:01.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to the <i>Reference Bible,</i>

00:16:01.010 --> 00:16:05.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘peer’ literally means to ‘stoop beside.’

00:16:05.514 --> 00:16:09.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To illustrate:
Simply reading through the Bible

00:16:09.718 --> 00:16:14.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be likened to walking quickly
through the world’s greatest museum

00:16:14.323 --> 00:16:19.094 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and periodically glancing
at the various displays.

00:16:19.094 --> 00:16:22.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You will learn something.

00:16:22.097 --> 00:16:25.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But meditatively peering into God’s Word

00:16:25.768 --> 00:16:30.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be likened to stopping
all along the museum route

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:32.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even stooping down

00:16:32.307 --> 00:16:35.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and closely examining from different angles

00:16:35.844 --> 00:16:40.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the artifacts, exhibitions, and displays.

00:16:40.849 --> 00:16:44.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now our knowledge and appreciation

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.757 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to be enhanced much more.

00:16:48.757 --> 00:16:53.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, our spiritual appetite
and feeding habits

00:16:53.729 --> 00:16:57.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reveal much about whether
we have done away

00:16:57.599 --> 00:17:00.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the trait of a young child, namely,

00:17:00.369 --> 00:17:03.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
immature feeding habits.

00:17:04.473 --> 00:17:09.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now please turn to Ephesians 4:14.

00:17:09.478 --> 00:17:14.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s discern from this scripture
negative trait number two

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:17.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we don’t want to imitate:

00:17:18.353 --> 00:17:22.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So we should no longer be children,

00:17:22.024 --> 00:17:26.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“tossed about as by waves
and carried here and there

00:17:26.895 --> 00:17:31.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“by every wind of teaching
by means of the trickery of men,

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:36.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of cunning in deceptive schemes.”

00:17:37.439 --> 00:17:39.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the negative trait?

00:17:39.975 --> 00:17:44.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children are easily tricked, or fooled.

00:17:45.481 --> 00:17:50.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This scripture likens being easily tricked
about what’s right or wrong

00:17:50.486 --> 00:17:54.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to being tossed about
by the waves of the ocean

00:17:54.356 --> 00:17:57.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and blown around by the wind.

00:17:57.326 --> 00:18:02.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think of a piece of wood
floating in a turbulent ocean

00:18:02.331 --> 00:18:05.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a piece of paper in a windstorm,

00:18:05.067 --> 00:18:08.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no stability or direction.

00:18:08.437 --> 00:18:12.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both can be easily maneuvered

00:18:12.307 --> 00:18:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go anywhere—take any position.

00:18:16.378 --> 00:18:19.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s true of very young children

00:18:19.681 --> 00:18:23.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who often can be easily deceived.

00:18:23.452 --> 00:18:26.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, if given a choice

00:18:26.321 --> 00:18:29.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between a shiny coin of little value

00:18:29.324 --> 00:18:33.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and paper money of great value,

00:18:33.462 --> 00:18:37.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the shiny coin will likely be chosen.

00:18:37.633 --> 00:18:39.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here’s the point:

00:18:39.802 --> 00:18:43.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do our spiritual choices
reveal about us?

00:18:44.473 --> 00:18:49.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do our choices in regard to music
and other entertainment,

00:18:49.077 --> 00:18:53.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
clothing, and grooming indicate
that we’re being fooled

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:56.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even slightly by Satan and his world?

00:18:57.786 --> 00:19:00.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, Satan is bent on tricking us,

00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:02.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but Jehovah tells us

00:19:02.991 --> 00:19:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 1 Corinthians 14:20
(the scripture we read earlier):

00:19:08.163 --> 00:19:13.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do not become young children
in your understanding.”

00:19:15.571 --> 00:19:20.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, please turn to Matthew 11:16, 17.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:25.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here we’ll find
the third negative trait of a child

00:19:25.314 --> 00:19:27.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we do not want to imitate:

00:19:29.284 --> 00:19:33.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“With whom will I compare this generation?

00:19:33.121 --> 00:19:37.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is like young children
sitting in the marketplaces

00:19:37.626 --> 00:19:41.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“who call out to their playmates, saying:

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:45.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘We played the flute for you,
but you did not dance;

00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wailed, but you
did not beat yourselves in grief.’”

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was saying that adult people

00:19:55.143 --> 00:19:57.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were acting like children.

00:19:57.846 --> 00:20:01.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Children love to play.

00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:03.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the negative trait of young children

00:20:03.952 --> 00:20:08.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is that they prefer play over responsibility.

00:20:08.957 --> 00:20:12.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about it: The vast majority

00:20:12.794 --> 00:20:15.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the waking hours of a small child

00:20:15.397 --> 00:20:17.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are spent playing

00:20:17.432 --> 00:20:21.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—play, play, and more play.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of their life is fun and games.

00:20:24.706 --> 00:20:27.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later, when the child goes to school,

00:20:27.976 --> 00:20:31.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where does he get the time to do so?

00:20:31.546 --> 00:20:35.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has to take it from his playtime.

00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:39.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, spiritually speaking,
we can ask ourselves,

00:20:39.922 --> 00:20:42.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How far have we progressed

00:20:42.624 --> 00:20:46.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in buying out time from our playtime?’

00:20:46.929 --> 00:20:50.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ephesians 5:16 encourages us

00:20:50.432 --> 00:20:53.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ‘make the best use of our time.’

00:20:53.969 --> 00:20:56.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Literally, according to the footnote,

00:20:56.538 --> 00:20:59.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this scripture is telling us

00:20:59.107 --> 00:21:03.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to ‘buy out the appointed time’

00:21:03.245 --> 00:21:07.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that is, buy it from less important things.

00:21:07.282 --> 00:21:10.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the question for all of us is,

00:21:10.052 --> 00:21:13.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have we bought out
the majority of our playtime

00:21:13.388 --> 00:21:16.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for more important
spiritual responsibilities?

00:21:18.293 --> 00:21:21.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we’ve discussed three negative traits

00:21:21.396 --> 00:21:25.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a young child that we want to avoid.

00:21:25.233 --> 00:21:27.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had time, we could have discussed

00:21:27.836 --> 00:21:30.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
other negative traits to be avoided,

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:35.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as how children tend
to have a short attention span

00:21:35.544 --> 00:21:38.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they’re easily distracted),

00:21:38.313 --> 00:21:42.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their curiosity often gets them into trouble,

00:21:42.651 --> 00:21:47.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they generally
need a lot of time and attention

00:21:47.089 --> 00:21:50.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(they’re high-maintenance).

00:21:50.025 --> 00:21:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now let’s briefly discuss
three positive traits

00:21:54.463 --> 00:21:58.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a young child that we do well to imitate.

00:21:58.467 --> 00:22:01.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Positive characteristic number one

00:22:01.837 --> 00:22:06.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is at 1 Corinthians 14:20,
which we read at the outset.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That scripture tells us

00:22:11.013 --> 00:22:16.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “be young children as to badness.”

00:22:16.852 --> 00:22:20.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the characteristic
that we want to imitate?

00:22:20.455 --> 00:22:23.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children are innocent,

00:22:23.825 --> 00:22:28.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inexperienced, when it comes to badness.

00:22:28.296 --> 00:22:30.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or put another way,

00:22:30.732 --> 00:22:34.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they haven’t done many truly bad things.

00:22:34.403 --> 00:22:38.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like children, we don’t want

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to gain knowledge
or experience in what is bad.

00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:45.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when it comes to pornography,

00:22:45.914 --> 00:22:49.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want no experience whatsoever

00:22:49.584 --> 00:22:54.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in regard to this filthy thing
of Satan’s world.

00:22:54.089 --> 00:22:57.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When it comes to television programs

00:22:57.025 --> 00:23:01.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are designated for a “mature audience,”

00:23:01.496 --> 00:23:04.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember to tell yourself,

00:23:04.366 --> 00:23:07.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I’m not old enough; I’m a young child.’

00:23:09.738 --> 00:23:13.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For positive characteristic number two,

00:23:13.175 --> 00:23:18.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s consider Matthew 18:2-4:

00:23:20.348 --> 00:23:23.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So calling a young child to him,

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:28.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he [Jesus] stood him
in their midst and said:

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:33.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Truly I say to you, unless you turn around

00:23:33.495 --> 00:23:35.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and become as young children,

00:23:35.864 --> 00:23:40.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘you will by no means enter
into the Kingdom of the heavens.

00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:45.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Therefore, whoever
 will humble himself like this young child

00:23:45.407 --> 00:23:50.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the one who is the greatest
in the Kingdom of the heavens.’”

00:23:51.113 --> 00:23:53.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the desirable trait?

00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:57.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children are humble and teachable.

00:23:57.052 --> 00:24:01.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children ask many questions
because they want to learn,

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:06.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but grown-ups
are often hesitant to ask questions.

00:24:06.228 --> 00:24:08.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:24:08.363 --> 00:24:11.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t want to look uninformed.

00:24:11.867 --> 00:24:14.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But acting like we know something

00:24:14.302 --> 00:24:17.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we don’t is actually dishonest

00:24:17.906 --> 00:24:21.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and probably motivated by pride.

00:24:21.409 --> 00:24:23.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The point is,

00:24:23.778 --> 00:24:27.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Don’t be afraid to reveal
what you don’t know.

00:24:27.949 --> 00:24:32.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remain humble and teachable like a child.

00:24:34.089 --> 00:24:38.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s identify
desirable trait number three

00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:43.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by going to Matthew 21:15, 16:

00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:46.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When the chief priests and the scribes

00:24:46.701 --> 00:24:49.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“saw the marvelous things he did

00:24:49.971 --> 00:24:53.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the boys who
were shouting in the temple,

00:24:53.108 --> 00:24:55.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Save, we pray, the Son of David!’

00:24:55.977 --> 00:24:59.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“they became indignant and said to him:

00:24:59.814 --> 00:25:02.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do you hear what these are saying?’

00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:04.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus said to them

00:25:04.252 --> 00:25:07.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Yes. Did you never read this,

00:25:07.189 --> 00:25:10.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘“Out of the mouth of children and infants

00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:12.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you have brought forth praise”?’”

00:25:13.662 --> 00:25:17.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what desirable characteristic
can we identify?

00:25:17.999 --> 00:25:23.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Young children
are exuberant and enthusiastic.

00:25:23.004 --> 00:25:25.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in like manner,

00:25:25.674 --> 00:25:29.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to remain exuberant and expressive

00:25:29.844 --> 00:25:33.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about Jehovah, Jesus,

00:25:33.081 --> 00:25:36.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Kingdom, and other spiritual things.

00:25:36.885 --> 00:25:41.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 145:7 encourages us to “bubble over”

00:25:41.423 --> 00:25:46.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “shout joyfully”
because of these wonderful things.

00:25:46.294 --> 00:25:51.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we never want to lose
that childlike enthusiasm.

00:25:52.534 --> 00:25:57.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, there we have
three desirable traits of a young child

00:25:57.172 --> 00:26:01.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we want to do our utmost to imitate.

00:26:01.142 --> 00:26:04.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had time, we could discuss

00:26:04.112 --> 00:26:06.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
several other positive characteristics,

00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:11.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as how children tend to be trusting,

00:26:11.987 --> 00:26:16.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not prejudiced, and not hypocritical.

00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:21.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now in review, may each of us

00:26:21.896 --> 00:26:25.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayerfully strive not to be childish

00:26:25.767 --> 00:26:30.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to (1) immature feeding habits,

00:26:30.772 --> 00:26:35.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) being easily tricked, or fooled,

00:26:36.478 --> 00:26:41.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) preferring play over responsibility.

00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:44.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,

00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:48.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may each of us
prayerfully strive to be childlike

00:26:48.523 --> 00:26:51.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when it comes to being 

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:56.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(1) innocent and inexperienced
concerning badness,

00:26:56.398 --> 00:27:00.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(2) humble and teachable,

00:27:00.702 --> 00:27:06.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and (3) exuberant and enthusiastic

00:27:06.041 --> 00:27:09.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about spiritual things!

00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:13.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible contains many accounts

00:27:13.848 --> 00:27:16.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of faithful men and women.

00:27:16.318 --> 00:27:19.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can learn from their examples.

00:27:19.354 --> 00:27:22.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:27:22.390 --> 00:27:26.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
notice what a family learns from Samuel.

00:27:35.437 --> 00:27:37.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samuel was only my age

00:27:37.439 --> 00:27:40.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah spoke to him.

00:27:45.547 --> 00:27:48.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He respected Eli,
but he had to stand up for what was right.

00:27:59.194 --> 00:28:01.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I never thought that I’d have
to do something similar.

00:28:04.833 --> 00:28:08.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I loved my brother,
and I always wanted to be like him.

00:28:10.138 --> 00:28:12.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those pictures of him partying with kids

00:28:12.507 --> 00:28:15.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from school showed
he was living a double life.

00:28:18.913 --> 00:28:21.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I didn’t want to get him in trouble.

00:28:30.258 --> 00:28:32.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I knew I had to say something.

00:28:46.741 --> 00:28:50.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I told him he had to tell Mom and Dad.

00:28:52.347 --> 00:28:54.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He warned me not to tell.

00:29:01.589 --> 00:29:03.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Samuel was courageous

00:29:03.958 --> 00:29:06.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “did not hide anything,”

00:29:17.105 --> 00:29:19.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “Jehovah himself was with him.”

00:29:23.912 --> 00:29:25.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t hide this.

00:29:29.117 --> 00:29:31.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talking to my parents wasn’t easy,

00:29:35.056 --> 00:29:37.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I knew it was the right thing to do.

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we were proud of Danny.

00:29:48.670 --> 00:29:50.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But . . .

00:29:51.172 --> 00:29:53.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . at the time,
we were a little distracted.

00:29:54.509 --> 00:29:58.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe, somehow it
was all just a misunderstanding.

00:30:10.959 --> 00:30:13.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We needed to know what was going on.

00:30:26.374 --> 00:30:28.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We just wanted to help him.

00:30:37.318 --> 00:30:40.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t help but blame ourselves
for what was happening.

00:30:50.498 --> 00:30:53.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we thought back to Samuel’s example.

00:30:57.839 --> 00:31:01.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samuel, you need to listen to us.

00:31:01.009 --> 00:31:04.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re getting old, Samuel,
and your sons are not like you.

00:31:04.579 --> 00:31:06.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They cheat, and they take bribes.

00:31:06.915 --> 00:31:10.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They bend Jehovah’s rules

00:31:10.485 --> 00:31:12.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any way they please.

00:31:12.887 --> 00:31:17.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even faithful Samuel had sons
who deviated from Jehovah’s standards.

00:31:25.366 --> 00:31:27.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We wanted to help our son.

00:31:28.736 --> 00:31:31.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Samuel didn’t alter his course

00:31:31.372 --> 00:31:33.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah stood by him,

00:31:33.875 --> 00:31:37.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we knew that if we did things His way,

00:31:39.547 --> 00:31:41.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’d stand by us.

00:32:04.839 --> 00:32:08.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you see the loyalty
the younger son showed

00:32:08.576 --> 00:32:12.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by bringing the matter
to the attention of his parents?

00:32:12.947 --> 00:32:16.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you also notice
the loyalty the parents showed

00:32:16.751 --> 00:32:20.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by going to the elders for assistance?

00:32:20.355 --> 00:32:24.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the parents
were able to talk to the elders,

00:32:24.092 --> 00:32:26.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we hope that the older son

00:32:26.628 --> 00:32:29.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was able to get the help he needed

00:32:29.097 --> 00:32:34.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that the discipline
brought him to his senses.

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:37.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Has your child left Jehovah?

00:32:37.405 --> 00:32:39.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you blame yourself?

00:32:39.841 --> 00:32:42.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, remember

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:45.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah stood by faithful Samuel,

00:32:45.246 --> 00:32:47.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and He will stand by you.

00:32:47.749 --> 00:32:50.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll help you endure.

00:32:52.387 --> 00:32:54.956 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another challenge we face today

00:32:54.956 --> 00:32:57.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is remaining united

00:32:57.425 --> 00:33:00.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a deeply divided world.

00:33:00.495 --> 00:33:04.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the 1950’s and 1960’s,

00:33:04.232 --> 00:33:07.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
racial tensions in the United States

00:33:07.502 --> 00:33:10.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
greatly intensified.

00:33:10.271 --> 00:33:14.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How were Jehovah’s people
affected during that period?

00:33:14.275 --> 00:33:18.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how did they maintain unity?

00:33:18.246 --> 00:33:21.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look for the answers to those questions

00:33:21.716 --> 00:33:24.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the following report.

00:33:42.603 --> 00:33:44.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My mother always said,

00:33:44.605 --> 00:33:47.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah did not intend
for all of us to look alike.”

00:33:50.545 --> 00:33:52.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In those early days,

00:33:52.647 --> 00:33:56.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would work every house in the county

00:33:56.317 --> 00:34:00.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—black families, white families, any color.

00:34:00.021 --> 00:34:04.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At school, there was pressure there

00:34:04.158 --> 00:34:08.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be involved with the racial activity.

00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:12.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We would hear
about the problems and the issues.

00:34:12.667 --> 00:34:15.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It would be in the news,
and you would know

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:18.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what was going on in the South.

00:34:18.706 --> 00:34:20.742 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Some may wonder,

00:34:20.742 --> 00:34:25.546 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
‘How is it that our people,

00:34:26.714 --> 00:34:29.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘that is, Jehovah’s Witnesses,
black and white,

00:34:29.984 --> 00:34:34.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘could maintain such unity

00:34:34.422 --> 00:34:38.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the world around them
was falling apart?’

00:34:38.025 --> 00:34:39.994 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I grew up in central New York

00:34:39.994 --> 00:34:41.996 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—Utica, New York.

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:46.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I remember
in the <i>Kingdom Ministry</i><i> </i><i> </i>back in 1956,

00:34:46.534 --> 00:34:50.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there were articles
about serving where the need is great.

00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:53.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They needed some of the black friends
to serve in the South.

00:34:56.277 --> 00:34:58.346 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I married my husband, Earl McGee, 

00:34:58.346 --> 00:34:59.947 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on June 2, 1956.

00:35:01.783 --> 00:35:05.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we were married,
Brother T. J. Sullivan gave a talk

00:35:05.186 --> 00:35:09.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the Hallandale convention
on serving where the need is greater.

00:35:10.024 --> 00:35:13.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He encouraged not only families but,

00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:15.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said, newly married couples.

00:35:15.463 --> 00:35:18.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we planned for it,
and he wrote the branch.

00:35:18.699 --> 00:35:21.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were assigned to Florida,

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:24.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then in 1962,
we started in the circuit work.

00:35:24.272 --> 00:35:26.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our first circuit was in Alabama,

00:35:26.641 --> 00:35:30.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was not integrated.

00:35:30.711 --> 00:35:34.916 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We served together, Edna and I did,

00:35:34.916 --> 00:35:37.318 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the pioneer work by assignment.

00:35:37.318 --> 00:35:42.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The last assignment was
the Society assigning us

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:45.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to North Carolina and then
from there to the circuit work.

00:35:45.893 --> 00:35:50.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the first circuit,
which was in the Carolinas and Georgia,

00:35:50.832 --> 00:35:53.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were assigned to Gilead.

00:35:56.804 --> 00:36:01.809 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I got married on April 23, 1949.

00:36:02.977 --> 00:36:04.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been in full-time service

00:36:04.979 --> 00:36:07.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
70 years with my wife.

00:36:07.014 --> 00:36:09.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was assigned

00:36:09.016 --> 00:36:11.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Circuit 18 in Alabama.

00:36:14.488 --> 00:36:17.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My first circuit assignment
was in Mississippi.

00:36:17.758 --> 00:36:20.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It had the reputation

00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:23.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the worst state
in the Union for race relations.

00:36:23.865 --> 00:36:27.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then after we got there,
there were three civil rights workers

00:36:27.201 --> 00:36:31.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were killed in Philadelphia, Mississippi.

00:36:31.305 --> 00:36:34.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was our circuit.

00:36:34.275 --> 00:36:37.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those were the things we had to deal with.

00:36:39.981 --> 00:36:42.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were busy in our ministry,

00:36:42.516 --> 00:36:45.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so it didn’t bother us very much.

00:36:45.386 --> 00:36:48.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The black worked the black,
and the white worked the white.

00:36:50.558 --> 00:36:55.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we just obeyed the customary law
of staying segregated.

00:36:57.064 --> 00:37:02.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lots of movements were happening,
and people were, you know, very hostile.

00:37:03.037 --> 00:37:05.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When there was a march or any tension

00:37:05.706 --> 00:37:08.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where we were serving there in Alabama,

00:37:08.075 --> 00:37:11.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wouldn’t go
to the town on Saturday afternoon

00:37:11.913 --> 00:37:15.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do street witnessing
because if there was a rally

00:37:15.216 --> 00:37:18.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something going on,
we would just stay in the neighborhood.

00:37:18.719 --> 00:37:22.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A lot were what they
used to call back then Freedom Riders,

00:37:22.323 --> 00:37:24.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
people getting on buses going south,

00:37:24.926 --> 00:37:27.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and people coming in to register voters.

00:37:27.762 --> 00:37:30.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The fact is,
some of the civil rights organizations

00:37:30.564 --> 00:37:33.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were set up in Mississippi
and going pretty strong.

00:37:33.567 --> 00:37:36.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So as a result, they would think

00:37:36.370 --> 00:37:38.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that because we were active
in going door to door,

00:37:38.839 --> 00:37:41.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could just incorporate civil rights issues

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:44.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things like that into our work.

00:37:44.111 --> 00:37:48.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of our classmates in the 27th class

00:37:48.115 --> 00:37:51.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a black brother, a fellow student,

00:37:51.185 --> 00:37:53.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we became very close friends there.

00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:57.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After we left Gilead,
we were going to our assignments

00:37:57.892 --> 00:38:00.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we stopped at a convention in Alabama.

00:38:00.895 --> 00:38:04.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the convention was segregated

00:38:04.799 --> 00:38:07.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one race on one side
and one race on another.

00:38:07.969 --> 00:38:10.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was very difficult
—painful—

00:38:10.471 --> 00:38:14.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for us not to be able
to closely associate with our dear friend.

00:38:14.875 --> 00:38:18.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we had this talk show on the television.

00:38:18.913 --> 00:38:22.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The circuit overseer and I went
and also a Catholic priest

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and an Episcopal minister.

00:38:24.952 --> 00:38:27.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Episcopal minister, a young minister,

00:38:27.588 --> 00:38:30.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
asked what were we doing
about the marching.

00:38:30.391 --> 00:38:34.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I told him that we weren’t doing
anything about the marching.

00:38:34.895 --> 00:38:36.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that showed a contrast.

00:38:36.897 --> 00:38:39.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m black, and he’s white.

00:38:39.433 --> 00:38:42.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t stopping
their marching to help us preach

00:38:42.103 --> 00:38:44.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the good news of the Kingdom,
so we weren’t going to stop

00:38:44.772 --> 00:38:47.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching the good news
of the Kingdom to help them march.

00:38:48.743 --> 00:38:53.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers always
were interested in each other.

00:38:53.414 --> 00:38:58.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So if there was a black congregation
and a white congregation,

00:38:58.252 --> 00:39:02.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had interest and fellow feeling for both.

00:39:02.023 --> 00:39:06.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The rule was we were not to meet together,
and we couldn’t meet together.

00:39:06.527 --> 00:39:10.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we could talk to one another,
and we could visit one another.

00:39:10.164 --> 00:39:13.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I think there was
great support on both sides,

00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:17.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
black and white brothers, back in those days.

00:39:17.638 --> 00:39:20.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had a problem
getting a facility, for example,

00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:24.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’d have contacts
and they could get certain things done.

00:39:24.011 --> 00:39:27.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, basically, we worked together.

00:39:27.548 --> 00:39:29.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation started integrating

00:39:29.617 --> 00:39:34.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after certain civil rights laws were passed.

00:39:34.388 --> 00:39:38.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had a big meeting of all the elders,

00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:41.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we worked out the territory assignments

00:39:41.228 --> 00:39:43.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whatever else was necessary

00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:47.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have integrated congregations.

00:39:47.001 --> 00:39:49.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some friends would feel,

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe rightly so at the time,

00:39:52.306 --> 00:39:56.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be
some violence if we integrated.

00:39:56.911 --> 00:39:59.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There probably were
some Kingdom Halls damaged

00:39:59.413 --> 00:40:01.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and things like that as a result.

00:40:01.482 --> 00:40:03.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the fact is,

00:40:03.584 --> 00:40:06.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was integration
going on in other places

00:40:06.187 --> 00:40:10.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—in the schools and things like that
and in the universities and colleges.

00:40:10.257 --> 00:40:14.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so it was obvious that if they
could do it, then we even more so.

00:40:14.528 --> 00:40:17.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The process of integration

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:20.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was successful

00:40:20.067 --> 00:40:23.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it was under Jehovah’s direction.

00:40:23.871 --> 00:40:25.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Both black and white,

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:28.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had the same thing in common:

00:40:28.209 --> 00:40:30.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved Jehovah.

00:40:30.511 --> 00:40:33.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And despite us,

00:40:33.781 --> 00:40:38.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah got it done for us
and brought us together.

00:40:38.419 --> 00:40:42.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have been unified ever since.

00:40:43.624 --> 00:40:46.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone could see that we were united.

00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:49.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother was working from door to door,

00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:53.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
black and white, and a lady
came to the door (white),

00:40:53.934 --> 00:40:56.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she said she was happy

00:40:56.971 --> 00:41:00.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see this unity take place.

00:41:00.441 --> 00:41:04.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had looked forward to it for a long time.

00:41:04.078 --> 00:41:07.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have formed, with Jehovah’s help

00:41:07.948 --> 00:41:10.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of his holy spirit,

00:41:10.618 --> 00:41:12.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a worldwide brotherhood.

00:41:12.653 --> 00:41:15.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Granted, they have their imperfections,

00:41:15.122 --> 00:41:17.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it is a brotherhood

00:41:17.291 --> 00:41:20.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and something to be truly marveled at.

00:41:21.495 --> 00:41:24.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers began to feel

00:41:24.398 --> 00:41:26.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what we knew was true:

00:41:26.834 --> 00:41:30.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re all one organization.

00:41:30.104 --> 00:41:31.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They began to feel it.

00:41:31.572 --> 00:41:33.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They began to experience it.

00:41:33.641 --> 00:41:37.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We loved Jehovah,
and we loved our brothers,

00:41:37.478 --> 00:41:40.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so there you have it.

00:41:40.014 --> 00:41:43.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How could you fail to have unity

00:41:43.517 --> 00:41:47.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah had drawn you together?

00:41:49.123 --> 00:41:52.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan is the prime one to divide people.

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus died for the whole world of mankind,

00:41:57.932 --> 00:42:00.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so who would that exclude?

00:42:00.134 --> 00:42:02.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one.

00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:10.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice what helped
our brothers maintain unity

00:42:10.477 --> 00:42:12.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during that difficult time?

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:16.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First: Despite prevailing customs,

00:42:16.850 --> 00:42:20.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers
—black and white—

00:42:20.154 --> 00:42:23.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
supported each other, helped each other,

00:42:23.891 --> 00:42:28.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked together
to advance Kingdom interests.

00:42:28.128 --> 00:42:32.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second: They remained focused on the ministry

00:42:32.733 --> 00:42:37.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and did not get involved
with social movements.

00:42:37.438 --> 00:42:40.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted all to know that God’s Kingdom

00:42:40.641 --> 00:42:43.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the only solution to mankind’s problems,

00:42:43.711 --> 00:42:47.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the plague of prejudice

00:42:47.381 --> 00:42:49.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and racial inequality.

00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:54.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third: They demonstrated love for Jehovah

00:42:54.121 --> 00:42:56.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and love for the brothers.

00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:58.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Benford said,

00:42:58.959 --> 00:43:02.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How could you fail to have unity

00:43:02.463 --> 00:43:05.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jehovah had drawn you together?”

00:43:07.368 --> 00:43:11.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Impartiality, humility,

00:43:11.005 --> 00:43:15.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
kindness—these are godly qualities

00:43:15.175 --> 00:43:17.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and childlike qualities

00:43:17.444 --> 00:43:21.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our new music video illustrates.

00:43:31.659 --> 00:43:41.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus kindly showed us
That we must be as young ones,

00:43:41.568 --> 00:43:52.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remembering that in a world of pride,
We need a heart just like a child.

00:43:52.513 --> 00:44:01.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We value others, seeing what God sees
through his impartial eyes.

00:44:01.155 --> 00:44:14.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to love one another,

00:44:14.234 --> 00:44:24.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes just seeing
the good in each other.

00:44:24.278 --> 00:44:35.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to be full of kindness,

00:44:35.522 --> 00:44:46.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes
not focused on what could divide us.

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:55.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we’re getting older
In a world that’s getting colder,

00:44:55.976 --> 00:45:07.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We easily could question others’ ways,
Their motives, and the things they say.

00:45:07.421 --> 00:45:17.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And seeing others as above us
is rare this day and age.

00:45:17.931 --> 00:45:28.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to love one another,

00:45:28.809 --> 00:45:39.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes
just seeing the good in each other.

00:45:39.086 --> 00:45:50.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to be full of kindness,

00:45:50.431 --> 00:46:00.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes
not focused on what could divide us.

00:46:00.674 --> 00:46:07.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be just like a child.

00:46:07.181 --> 00:46:13.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While we keep growing,
Serving Jehovah,

00:46:13.921 --> 00:46:19.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And finding joy in 
The part we’re playing,

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:25.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must remember
That in a world of pride,

00:46:25.199 --> 00:46:30.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need a heart like that of a child.

00:46:50.858 --> 00:47:02.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to love one another,

00:47:02.436 --> 00:47:12.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes
just seeing the good in each other.

00:47:12.613 --> 00:47:23.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just like a child,
we want to be full of kindness,

00:47:23.390 --> 00:47:33.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With our eyes
not focused on what could divide us.

00:47:33.934 --> 00:47:40.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be just like a child.

00:47:41.909 --> 00:47:44.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a beautiful song!

00:47:44.945 --> 00:47:49.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need a childlike heart more than ever.

00:47:49.716 --> 00:47:52.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many parts of the world,

00:47:52.085 --> 00:47:54.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s customary to judge people

00:47:54.488 --> 00:47:57.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the basis of their race or age

00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:59.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or by how much money they have.

00:47:59.793 --> 00:48:01.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our next segment,

00:48:01.895 --> 00:48:04.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll hear from brothers and sisters

00:48:04.398 --> 00:48:09.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have successfully
resisted such influences.

00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:25.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I grew up in a country where people judge you
according to the color of your skin.

00:48:25.118 --> 00:48:28.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was black, white, mixed race,

00:48:28.355 --> 00:48:31.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we all kept separate.

00:48:34.561 --> 00:48:39.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to learn,
not to see color, but to see people.

00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:43.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though it’s such a multicultural area,

00:48:43.337 --> 00:48:46.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there is still this prejudice that exists.

00:48:46.073 --> 00:48:49.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve witnessed times
where ones from another country

00:48:49.876 --> 00:48:54.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are often left isolated or are treated
in a way that they’re not welcome here.

00:48:54.481 --> 00:48:58.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we’re not careful, these attitudes
could creep into the congregation.

00:48:58.652 --> 00:49:00.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could have isolated groups

00:49:00.887 --> 00:49:03.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of cultures that maybe would stick together.

00:49:05.492 --> 00:49:07.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the area where I grew up,

00:49:07.561 --> 00:49:11.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
young ones show great respect for older ones.

00:49:11.264 --> 00:49:15.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Older ones, however,
do not give much importance to young people.

00:49:18.171 --> 00:49:20.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This attitude, or culture,

00:49:20.173 --> 00:49:25.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a major impact on recommendations
of young ones as elders in the congregation.

00:49:25.178 --> 00:49:29.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might say, ‘In my opinion, he is too young

00:49:29.916 --> 00:49:32.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be appointed as an elder
in the congregation.’

00:49:34.287 --> 00:49:39.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this area, people sort of open up to you
when you appear rich.

00:49:39.092 --> 00:49:41.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In some areas, they would even wonder

00:49:41.628 --> 00:49:45.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you are doing there
if you don’t have the right kind of looks

00:49:45.465 --> 00:49:47.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in terms of what you can afford to wear,

00:49:47.567 --> 00:49:51.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what kind of car you can afford to drive,
what your profession is.

00:49:51.705 --> 00:49:55.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we brought that with us
into the Christian congregation,

00:49:55.142 --> 00:49:57.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then what Solomon mentions

00:49:57.544 --> 00:50:00.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be the case
—that we actively seek the friendship

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:04.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those whom we regard to be rich
and abandon those who are poor.

00:50:04.751 --> 00:50:07.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I like the example in Galatians of Peter.

00:50:07.621 --> 00:50:11.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He grew up in an area
where there was a lot of prejudice.

00:50:11.425 --> 00:50:14.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t something
that he overcame straightaway.

00:50:14.227 --> 00:50:17.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If I’m not careful,
I think it would be easy for me

00:50:17.731 --> 00:50:21.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to slide back and see people
as a different race,

00:50:21.902 --> 00:50:26.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that would affect the way I view
my brothers and sisters in the congregation.

00:50:26.173 --> 00:50:30.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article mentions
that when we use the Bible,

00:50:30.811 --> 00:50:33.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it helps us to make changes.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:36.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to constantly look at ourselves

00:50:36.516 --> 00:50:38.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can continue to make progress.

00:50:41.521 --> 00:50:45.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the article, it mentioned
about ‘opening our hearts wide’

00:50:45.325 --> 00:50:47.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whether it’d be
working with them in the ministry

00:50:47.928 --> 00:50:50.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or having them over socially,

00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:53.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just from the same group
that we might be comfortable with,

00:50:53.934 --> 00:50:56.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but actually with different ones
from different backgrounds.

00:50:58.605 --> 00:51:01.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Timothy was still a young man,
but the apostle Paul

00:51:01.875 --> 00:51:05.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had given him heavy responsibility
in the congregation.

00:51:05.879 --> 00:51:10.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The article mentions that ‘the Scriptures
do not give an exact age

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:14.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for recommendation of brothers
as ministerial servants or elders.’

00:51:22.662 --> 00:51:26.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recommending a younger brother
as an elder in the congregation

00:51:26.066 --> 00:51:28.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been a great blessing to us.

00:51:31.638 --> 00:51:34.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the article, there was a little phrase

00:51:34.641 --> 00:51:37.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that has become a guiding principle for me.

00:51:37.144 --> 00:51:40.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not judge
our relationship with him

00:51:40.580 --> 00:51:42.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by what we possess.

00:51:42.649 --> 00:51:45.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when I meet new brothers and sisters

00:51:45.519 --> 00:51:48.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for a moment I’m tempted

00:51:48.088 --> 00:51:51.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to judge, or view, them

00:51:51.658 --> 00:51:55.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to those sentiments
as to whether they are rich or poor,

00:51:55.095 --> 00:51:57.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that principle comes into my mind.

00:51:57.898 --> 00:52:01.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My focus, therefore,
shifts to who they really are

00:52:01.835 --> 00:52:05.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in terms of their devotion to Jehovah
—their faith.

00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:08.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is what we build friendships on.

00:52:08.441 --> 00:52:11.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have friends
from different cultures, different races.

00:52:11.912 --> 00:52:14.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I don’t see them as color,

00:52:14.881 --> 00:52:17.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I see my brother or my sister.

00:52:17.751 --> 00:52:19.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got the most amazing friendships

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with ones
from different backgrounds and cultures

00:52:22.522 --> 00:52:25.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something I will always, always cherish.

00:52:31.698 --> 00:52:36.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our congregation
is a wonderful place for everybody.

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:39.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no emphasis
on who is rich and who is poor.

00:52:39.773 --> 00:52:44.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Friendships are built
on the basis of our love for Jehovah.

00:53:01.494 --> 00:53:03.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month’s program

00:53:03.496 --> 00:53:07.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouraged us to be childlike.

00:53:07.067 --> 00:53:09.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned from the encouraging example

00:53:09.536 --> 00:53:12.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of servants of Jehovah in the past.

00:53:13.506 --> 00:53:16.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that love for Jehovah

00:53:16.009 --> 00:53:19.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our brothers unites us,

00:53:19.012 --> 00:53:22.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even during times of social unrest.

00:53:23.550 --> 00:53:26.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were reminded that, like a child,

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we want to be impartial,

00:53:29.322 --> 00:53:31.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving, and kind.

00:53:33.226 --> 00:53:35.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we heard expressions from brothers

00:53:35.562 --> 00:53:37.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have learned to treat others fairly

00:53:37.998 --> 00:53:40.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
no matter their race, age,

00:53:40.233 --> 00:53:43.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wealth, or anything else

00:53:43.403 --> 00:53:45.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could divide them.

00:53:46.406 --> 00:53:51.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s time for our video postcard,

00:53:51.344 --> 00:53:55.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which comes to us
from the Czech Republic, also called Czechia.

00:53:55.782 --> 00:53:57.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Czechia is a land

00:53:57.951 --> 00:54:01.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of deep forests, farmland, vineyards,

00:54:01.988 --> 00:54:05.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as medieval castles,
towns, and cities.

00:54:05.558 --> 00:54:10.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Prague, the capital, was established
more than a thousand years ago.

00:54:10.363 --> 00:54:14.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has a rich religious history.

00:54:14.067 --> 00:54:17.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s name can be found
on many churches

00:54:17.003 --> 00:54:19.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and structures.

00:54:19.239 --> 00:54:24.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Czechia is home
to more than 15,000 Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:54:24.210 --> 00:54:28.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are 32 congregations in Prague.

00:54:28.782 --> 00:54:31.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the Prague-Dejvice Congregation,

00:54:31.918 --> 00:54:34.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which has 84 publishers,

00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including 13 regular pioneers.

00:54:37.090 --> 00:54:40.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their territory is large and diverse.

00:54:40.860 --> 00:54:44.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They preach in the historic center of Prague

00:54:44.664 --> 00:54:49.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in neighborhoods, parks,
and on university campuses.

00:54:49.336 --> 00:54:52.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The congregation includes
a Spanish-speaking group,

00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:55.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with 12 publishers,

00:54:55.442 --> 00:54:58.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of which 8 are regular pioneers.

00:54:58.211 --> 00:55:00.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This group serves the entire city.

00:55:02.449 --> 00:55:06.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zbynek and Jarmila Bucifal

00:55:06.686 --> 00:55:10.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped to secretly produce Bible literature

00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:12.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the Communist regime,

00:55:12.392 --> 00:55:16.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the work
of Jehovah’s Witnesses was banned.

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Zbynek was forced

00:55:19.866 --> 00:55:22.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work in a coal mine
for remaining neutral

00:55:22.235 --> 00:55:26.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and refusing to serve in the military.

00:55:26.806 --> 00:55:29.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After the regime change,

00:55:29.976 --> 00:55:32.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he served as a circuit overseer.

00:55:33.613 --> 00:55:38.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters
in the Prague-Dejvice Congregation

00:55:38.518 --> 00:55:42.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their warm, loving greetings

00:55:42.622 --> 00:55:44.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to all of you.

00:55:45.792 --> 00:55:48.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Earlier, we showed you a preview

00:55:48.962 --> 00:55:52.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this year’s “Always Rejoice!” conventions.

00:55:52.832 --> 00:55:56.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But would you like a glimpse
of this year’s feature Bible drama,

00:55:56.669 --> 00:56:01.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which brings to life the story
of courageous Nehemiah?

00:56:02.142 --> 00:56:04.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy!

00:56:07.614 --> 00:56:10.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Far from Israel lived a Jew

00:56:10.450 --> 00:56:11.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whom the king of Persia

00:56:11.885 --> 00:56:13.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trusted with his life.

00:56:15.155 --> 00:56:17.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He believed his people were carrying

00:56:17.157 --> 00:56:19.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on pure worship in Jerusalem

00:56:19.893 --> 00:56:21.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—until one day . . .

00:56:25.865 --> 00:56:29.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:56:29.335 --> 00:56:31.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.

00:56:33.873 --> 00:56:36.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the people ignore God’s Law.

00:56:48.588 --> 00:56:50.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rebuilding the walls was only the beginning.

00:56:50.857 --> 00:56:53.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have many powerful enemies.

00:56:53.693 --> 00:56:55.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I recommend we turn

00:56:55.462 --> 00:56:58.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the accusation of sedition against Nehemiah.

00:56:58.164 --> 00:56:59.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah is far away in Shushan.

00:56:59.833 --> 00:57:01.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who is going to tell him?

00:57:01.367 --> 00:57:03.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is my province!

00:57:03.236 --> 00:57:05.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Out here, I decide what to do.

00:57:05.038 --> 00:57:07.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have a right to live where I choose,

00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so do you.

00:57:09.008 --> 00:57:11.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They would need help to face what

00:57:11.244 --> 00:57:12.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was about to come next.

00:57:12.879 --> 00:57:14.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every man must find 

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his own joy, and I intend to find mine.

00:57:18.051 --> 00:57:19.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why should you complain

00:57:19.385 --> 00:57:20.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when everyone else approves?

00:57:21.788 --> 00:57:23.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we let mere threats

00:57:23.223 --> 00:57:24.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
frighten us into stopping, they will have

00:57:24.557 --> 00:57:25.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
achieved their goal.

00:57:25.758 --> 00:57:26.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you going to wait

00:57:26.926 --> 00:57:28.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until they start killing us?

00:57:28.194 --> 00:57:30.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re powerless to stop this.
