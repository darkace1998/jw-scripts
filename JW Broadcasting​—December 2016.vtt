00:01.417 --> 00:03.920
Welcome to our program! 


00:03.920 --> 00:07.523
Here are just a few of the things
we can look forward to:


00:07.523 --> 00:11.861
Can the lure of fame 
draw us away from Jehovah? 


00:11.862 --> 00:14.597
How does this brother
feel about the decisions


00:14.597 --> 00:16.767
he made as a young person? 


00:16.767 --> 00:19.269
What does his story teach us


00:19.268 --> 00:22.805
about how to use our
God-given abilities and talents?


00:22.805 --> 00:27.310
Throughout the organization, young brothers
and sisters are reaching out


00:27.310 --> 00:29.612
to do more in Jehovah’s service. 


00:29.612 --> 00:33.182
Their spirituality and youthful energy


00:33.182 --> 00:35.352
are helping to advance 
the Kingdom work. 


00:35.352 --> 00:38.989
But how is showing respect
for experienced brothers


00:38.988 --> 00:42.525
an important part
of any theocratic assignment?


00:42.525 --> 00:45.595
We’ll also hear
from young brothers and sisters


00:45.595 --> 00:47.597
from around the world. 


00:47.597 --> 00:52.169
Why is their relationship with Jehovah
so important to them? 


00:52.168 --> 00:56.000
What do they do to build
and maintain their spirituality? 


00:57.073 --> 01:00.943
And we’ll consider
even more ways Christian youths


01:00.943 --> 01:05.148
are setting a beautiful example
for our worldwide brotherhood. 


01:05.148 --> 01:10.000
This is JW Broadcasting
for December 2016!


01:30.072 --> 01:32.409
During the past five years,


01:32.408 --> 01:35.611
over 1.3 million faithful ones


01:35.612 --> 01:37.680
have symbolized their dedication 


01:37.680 --> 01:40.048
to Jehovah by water baptism. 


01:40.048 --> 01:44.486
That’s an average 
of over 700 each day. 


01:44.487 --> 01:47.390
And among those
courageously taking their stand


01:47.390 --> 01:50.293
for true worship
are thousands of children,


01:50.293 --> 01:53.295
teenagers, and young adults. 


01:53.295 --> 01:55.298
Young brothers and sisters,


01:55.298 --> 01:58.100
we know it is not always easy 


01:58.100 --> 02:01.070
to serve Jehovah
and live up to your dedication. 


02:01.070 --> 02:02.572
Like older ones,


02:02.572 --> 02:07.110
you need to be encouraged
and strengthened spiritually. 


02:07.110 --> 02:10.747
With that in mind,
our theme this month is


02:10.747 --> 02:15.117
“Young Ones, ‘Become an Example
to the Faithful Ones.’”


02:15.117 --> 02:18.387
It is based on the inspiring true-life story


02:18.387 --> 02:21.859
of a young Christian named Timothy.


02:21.858 --> 02:24.360
Before we discuss Timothy’s example, 


02:24.360 --> 02:28.130
did you know that the Bible
specifically foretold


02:28.130 --> 02:33.002
that many young people would take 
sides with Jehovah in our time? 


02:33.002 --> 02:36.439
Let’s look at this at Psalm 110:3. 


02:36.438 --> 02:38.675
And as we read it together, 


02:38.675 --> 02:43.680
note how young ones are having a share 
in fulfilling this prophecy.


02:43.680 --> 02:47.050
Notice the first part of verse 3,


02:47.050 --> 02:49.385
David sang: 


02:49.385 --> 02:52.455
“Your people will offer themselves willingly


02:52.455 --> 02:55.692
on the day of your military force.” 


02:55.692 --> 02:59.629
According to this prophecy, Jesus,
the Messianic King, 


02:59.628 --> 03:03.398
would have a large army
of willing supporters. 


03:03.398 --> 03:07.903
Since 1914, millions have carefully
investigated the facts


03:07.903 --> 03:11.000
and chosen to side 
with Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. 


03:12.142 --> 03:15.144
But where do young ones
come into this picture?


03:15.143 --> 03:17.913
The rest of the verse continues:


03:17.913 --> 03:22.051
“In splendid holiness, 
from the womb of the dawn, 


03:22.052 --> 03:25.955
“you have your company of young men


03:25.955 --> 03:28.858
just like dewdrops.” 


03:28.858 --> 03:33.195
Here, the prophecy refers to a “company,”
or group, of young ones. 


03:33.195 --> 03:38.802
They also would study the evidence
and support God’s Kingdom.


03:38.802 --> 03:41.270
How many young people
did Jehovah foresee


03:41.270 --> 03:43.272
supporting true worship? 


03:43.272 --> 03:47.577
We get an idea by the comparison 
made to dewdrops. 


03:47.577 --> 03:50.880
Have you have ever gone outside
early in the morning


03:50.880 --> 03:55.083
and noticed a light, sparkling coating
of water on the ground? 


03:55.083 --> 03:57.453
That may have been dew. 


03:57.453 --> 04:01.823
Jehovah designed our atmosphere so that,
under certain conditions,


04:01.823 --> 04:04.226
when the temperature
cools during the night,


04:04.227 --> 04:07.430
a blanket of moisture
forms on the ground. 


04:07.430 --> 04:12.602
That coating is made up
of a multitude of little drops.


04:12.602 --> 04:17.574
Young ones,
what does dew have to do with you? 


04:17.573 --> 04:21.910
In the Bible, dew is connected
with blessing and abundance. 


04:21.910 --> 04:24.447
Dewdrops are also refreshing,


04:24.447 --> 04:27.217
life-sustaining, and numerous. 


04:27.217 --> 04:30.185
Now, remember in Psalm 110:3, 


04:30.185 --> 04:33.355
Jehovah was looking ahead to our time. 


04:33.355 --> 04:36.392
And what did he see? 


04:36.392 --> 04:40.397
The September 15, 2002,
Watchtower on page 8


04:40.397 --> 04:42.399
explained it this way: 


04:42.398 --> 04:45.335
“Just like refreshing dewdrops, 


04:45.335 --> 04:49.572
“many young men and women
cheerfully serve God


04:49.572 --> 04:51.975
and assist their fellow worshipers.”


04:51.975 --> 04:56.245
Today, there are so many mature,


04:56.245 --> 04:59.848
bright, happy young ones
in the Christian congregation


04:59.848 --> 05:04.820
that they are like countless dewdrops
that sparkle in the morning sun. 


05:04.820 --> 05:07.990
You faithful children, teenagers,


05:07.990 --> 05:11.527
and young adults who have dedicated
your life to Jehovah


05:11.527 --> 05:14.064
or who are working toward that goal


05:14.063 --> 05:16.898
are living proof that Jehovah’s confidence


05:16.898 --> 05:19.868
in young people was never misplaced. 


05:19.868 --> 05:24.000
He cherishes you very much and so do we.


05:25.342 --> 05:29.512
Of course, knowing
that Jehovah has confidence in us


05:29.512 --> 05:31.680
can be very encouraging. 


05:31.680 --> 05:35.452
But what if doubts or negative thoughts 


05:35.452 --> 05:37.454
tend to bring us down? 


05:37.453 --> 05:40.856
On occasion,
a young Witness might wonder,


05:40.857 --> 05:44.760
‘Does anyone other
than Jehovah notice me? 


05:44.760 --> 05:48.000
Does my example really matter to others?’


05:49.632 --> 05:51.634
To address these questions,


05:51.633 --> 05:55.070
let’s now consider Timothy’s example. 


05:55.070 --> 05:57.073
Open your Bible, please,


05:57.073 --> 06:02.678
to our theme text at 1 Timothy 4:12. 


06:02.678 --> 06:05.881
When you find it, 
you might want to bookmark the verse


06:05.882 --> 06:09.785
because we want to first
understand the setting.


06:09.785 --> 06:12.000
How old was Timothy at this time? 


06:13.222 --> 06:15.459
Often, when thinking of Timothy, 


06:15.458 --> 06:19.728
I picture a teenager or a young man
in his early twenties. 


06:19.728 --> 06:21.930
And when he
first started traveling with Paul,


06:21.930 --> 06:23.933
he was about that age. 


06:23.933 --> 06:28.470
But several years passed 
before Paul wrote letters to Timothy. 


06:28.470 --> 06:31.307
So by the time
First Timothy was written,


06:31.307 --> 06:34.844
Timothy was likely in his early thirties.


06:34.843 --> 06:37.113
Now, what do you think? 


06:37.113 --> 06:42.085
Was Timothy young or old? 


06:42.085 --> 06:45.020
Some of you younger ones
may be thinking to yourselves,


06:45.020 --> 06:48.557
‘If he was over 30,
then he was old!’ 


06:48.557 --> 06:51.760
But remember,
a much older man like Paul


06:51.760 --> 06:54.463
would say that Timothy was quite young. 


06:54.463 --> 06:58.366
In fact, notice the expression
he uses when writing to Timothy.


06:58.367 --> 07:02.905
First Timothy 4:12, Paul says:


07:02.905 --> 07:07.910
“Never let anyone
look down on your youth. 


07:07.910 --> 07:12.148
“Instead, become an example 
to the faithful ones 


07:12.148 --> 07:15.551
“in speaking, in conduct, in love,


07:15.552 --> 07:18.000
in faith, in chasteness.” 


07:19.255 --> 07:24.260
Paul called Timothy a youth
and urged him to be a good example. 


07:24.260 --> 07:28.798
While Timothy may have been
in his early thirties at this time,


07:28.798 --> 07:31.533
remember that he 
was taught about Jehovah


07:31.533 --> 07:33.568
from the time he was a baby,


07:33.568 --> 07:37.005
and he did well in the truth
as a young person. 


07:37.005 --> 07:40.710
In fact, when he was still a teenager
or in his early twenties, 


07:40.710 --> 07:44.580
the elders recommended him
to serve as a missionary with Paul. 


07:44.580 --> 07:48.483
So, in effect, 
Paul here is urging Timothy


07:48.483 --> 07:53.990
to continue to be 
a good example for others.


07:53.990 --> 07:56.000
What else do we know about Timothy? 


07:57.727 --> 08:00.964
He was not proud, or haughty. 


08:00.963 --> 08:05.300
He likely did not view himself
as some amazing example. 


08:05.300 --> 08:10.205
I’m sure he never dreamed
that one day Christians all over the world


08:10.205 --> 08:15.310
would study his life in detail
so as to imitate his faith. 


08:15.310 --> 08:20.315
Timothy was modest
—and this despite his privileges. 


08:20.315 --> 08:24.553
Paul’s words may indicate
that Timothy was somewhat shy. 


08:24.553 --> 08:26.388
Like many of us,


08:26.388 --> 08:30.860
he may have battled with feelings
of self-doubt on occasion.


08:30.860 --> 08:34.930
Based on this information,
let’s do something interesting now. 


08:34.930 --> 08:39.468
Let’s use our imagination
to visualize Timothy, 


08:39.468 --> 08:41.670
an elder in his early thirties, 


08:41.670 --> 08:44.540
coming to give a Scriptural talk
in the congregation. 


08:44.540 --> 08:46.308
Got the picture? 


08:46.308 --> 08:49.278
In your mind,
please look at Timothy


08:49.278 --> 08:51.880
and then look at the audience.


08:51.880 --> 08:54.450
Who do we see? 


08:54.450 --> 08:56.952
Many in attendance are old enough


08:56.952 --> 09:00.122
to be Timothy’s parents
or grandparents. 


09:00.122 --> 09:02.459
How do you think Timothy felt? 


09:02.458 --> 09:04.326
Super confident? 


09:04.327 --> 09:09.165
Are you visualizing him proudly walking
into the meeting place, saying:


09:09.165 --> 09:13.102
“I sure wish my friends back
in Lystra could see me now. 


09:13.102 --> 09:17.374
Look at the crowds
that come to hear me speak!” 


09:17.373 --> 09:21.000
No, that’s not the Timothy we know. 


09:22.043 --> 09:25.513
It’s much more likely that Timothy, 
like most of us,


09:25.513 --> 09:29.418
rehearsed his presentation
over and over again. 


09:29.418 --> 09:32.255
He probably prayed constantly, 


09:32.255 --> 09:36.492
and he probably still got nervous,
like all of us. 


09:36.492 --> 09:39.729
And remember,
Timothy did not have the benefit


09:39.728 --> 09:42.865
of theocratic schools like we do today.


09:42.865 --> 09:44.767
In summary, 


09:44.767 --> 09:47.737
what can we say about Timothy? 


09:47.737 --> 09:50.607
Like so many of you, 


09:50.607 --> 09:54.477
he was an example
of faith and obedience. 


09:54.477 --> 09:57.947
He was exceptional
in displaying Christian qualities, 


09:57.947 --> 10:00.617
such as modesty and humility. 


10:00.617 --> 10:04.420
But Timothy was a person
with normal human feelings,


10:04.420 --> 10:06.188
like all of us. 


10:06.188 --> 10:09.358
Though he had a rich,
happy life in Jehovah’s service,


10:09.358 --> 10:13.061
life in the old world
brought real tests and challenges. 


10:13.062 --> 10:16.565
Timothy also dealt 
with frequent cases of sickness, 


10:16.565 --> 10:19.702
and he was imprisoned for a time. 


10:19.702 --> 10:22.305
Some of you in various countries


10:22.305 --> 10:25.808
can relate to those bitter experiences. 


10:25.808 --> 10:28.510
But Timothy endured. 


10:28.510 --> 10:33.015
Was he some “super Christian”
with superpowers? 


10:33.015 --> 10:38.988
No, but he did
prove to be a super example!


10:38.988 --> 10:41.923
How does all of this
help you Christian youths


10:41.923 --> 10:44.193
who have taken the commendable step


10:44.193 --> 10:47.396
to dedicate your lives to Jehovah? 


10:47.397 --> 10:52.134
We just read how Paul told Timothy
to let no one look down on his youth. 


10:52.133 --> 10:55.503
A few of you may be thinking,


10:55.503 --> 10:58.540
‘I wish someone would tell my parents


10:58.540 --> 11:02.077
‘or my elders not to look down on me. 


11:02.077 --> 11:05.614
They still treat me like a little kid.’ 


11:05.613 --> 11:08.683
If that’s the case, 
we feel for you. 


11:08.683 --> 11:13.000
No progressive young one
wants to be treated as if he were a child. 


11:14.357 --> 11:18.627
But let’s look again at 1 Timothy 4:12. 


11:18.627 --> 11:22.030
Is the apostle Paul speaking
to the congregation, 


11:22.030 --> 11:25.533
to parents, or to the elders?


11:25.533 --> 11:28.370
“Never let anyone look down


11:28.370 --> 11:31.040
“on your youth. 


11:31.040 --> 11:35.277
“Instead, become an example
to the faithful ones in speaking,


11:35.277 --> 11:40.615
in conduct, in love,
in faith, in chasteness.” 


11:40.615 --> 11:42.885
It’s clear, isn’t it? 


11:42.885 --> 11:45.553
Paul said your youth. 


11:45.553 --> 11:48.000
He was speaking only to Timothy.


11:49.158 --> 11:54.163
Young ones, by extension,
what is Jehovah saying to each of you? 


11:54.163 --> 11:59.168
It’s this: To gain and maintain
the respect of faithful ones,


11:59.168 --> 12:04.073
you have to work
at proving yourself as a Christian. 


12:04.073 --> 12:08.443
The key is not wanting or hoping
that others will respect you. 


12:08.443 --> 12:12.415
Rather, it’s earning such respect
by setting a good example


12:12.415 --> 12:14.283
in all areas of life. 


12:14.283 --> 12:15.918
If you do that, 


12:15.918 --> 12:19.000
then no one will have any legitimate reason
to look down on your youth. 


12:20.622 --> 12:26.795
Doesn’t it make sense
that we gain respect by earning it?


12:26.795 --> 12:29.932
We are confident
that you young ones are trying hard


12:29.932 --> 12:33.602
to live by Christian principles at school
and in the neighborhood. 


12:33.602 --> 12:39.342
But in verse 12, did you notice
who Timothy was to be an example to? 


12:39.342 --> 12:41.644
To “the faithful ones.” 


12:41.643 --> 12:45.580
Are you an example to Christians,
both younger and older, 


12:45.580 --> 12:48.417
in your congregation 
and in your circuit? 


12:48.417 --> 12:52.154
If you work on Kingdom Hall
construction projects or at Bethel,


12:52.153 --> 12:56.325
are you an example
to your fellow workers?


12:56.325 --> 13:01.097
Well, what are some specific ways
you can become an example 


13:01.097 --> 13:03.565
to all of these “faithful ones”? 


13:03.565 --> 13:07.035
In our theme text, 
Timothy was first directed


13:07.035 --> 13:10.472
to become an example in speaking. 


13:10.472 --> 13:13.809
On this topic,
I’ll never forget an illustration


13:13.808 --> 13:18.813
used in the “Young People Ask” article
from the January 2012 Awake! 


13:18.813 --> 13:22.350
It quoted a young man,
James, who said:


13:22.350 --> 13:27.355
“Once you squeeze toothpaste out,
you can’t put it back in the tube. 


13:27.355 --> 13:29.458
“The same is true with our words. 


13:29.458 --> 13:33.000
Once we say something hurtful, 
we can’t take it back.” 


13:34.197 --> 13:37.232
God’s Word agrees with James.


13:37.232 --> 13:42.572
Note what it says at Ephesians 4:29. 


13:42.572 --> 13:44.674
It tells us:


13:44.673 --> 13:48.710
“Let a rotten word
not come out of your mouth,


13:48.710 --> 13:52.347
“but only what is good
for building up as the need may be, 


13:52.347 --> 13:56.819
to impart what is beneficial
to the hearers.” 


13:56.818 --> 13:59.255
For some years now,
those getting baptized 


13:59.255 --> 14:01.623
have been encouraged 
to complete a study of the book,


14:01.623 --> 14:04.158
“Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.” 


14:04.158 --> 14:09.498
Chapter 12 is entitled
“Speak What ‘Is Good for Building Up.’” 


14:09.498 --> 14:13.601
On page 140, 
there is a box with five questions


14:13.602 --> 14:16.405
that can help us evaluate our speech. 


14:16.405 --> 14:18.240
For example: 


14:18.240 --> 14:22.812
“When was the last time I offered
someone specific commendation? 


14:22.812 --> 14:27.817
“Do I express my respect for others
by saying please and thank you? 


14:27.817 --> 14:31.887
“In conversation,
do I speak mainly about myself,


14:31.887 --> 14:36.292
or am I also interested
in the thoughts and feelings of others?”


14:36.292 --> 14:39.295
Young ones, 
over the next few days,


14:39.295 --> 14:43.665
why not review that box on page 140, 
look up the scriptures,


14:43.665 --> 14:47.268
and think about what Jehovah is saying? 


14:47.268 --> 14:50.940
Then apply what you learn to your speech. 


14:50.940 --> 14:54.108
Doing this will draw you closer to Jehovah


14:54.108 --> 14:57.746
and help you to become
an even better example


14:57.747 --> 14:59.000
to the faithful ones.


15:00.715 --> 15:03.385
The second area
mentioned in our theme text


15:03.385 --> 15:06.622
is becoming an example in conduct. 


15:06.622 --> 15:10.125
Of course,
upbuilding speech would be empty


15:10.125 --> 15:14.597
or hypocritical
if our conduct was questionable. 


15:14.597 --> 15:16.599
Think again about Timothy. 


15:16.598 --> 15:20.901
It wasn’t enough for him to give comments
and talks at the meetings


15:20.902 --> 15:23.072
or preach from door to door. 


15:23.072 --> 15:26.009
Later in the same letter,
Paul reminded Timothy


15:26.008 --> 15:29.945
that he needed to treat older men
and women as fathers and mothers;


15:29.945 --> 15:34.000
younger men and women
were to be treated as brothers and sisters. 


15:35.483 --> 15:38.420
Second Peter 3:11


15:38.420 --> 15:42.290
provides a similar urgent reminder
about our conduct. 


15:42.290 --> 15:44.293
Let’s read that together. 


15:44.293 --> 15:48.363
Again, that’s 2 Peter 3:11.


15:48.363 --> 15:50.365
There it tells us: 


15:50.365 --> 15:54.803
“Since all these things
are to be dissolved in this way, 


15:54.803 --> 15:57.706
“consider what sort of people
you ought to be


15:57.707 --> 16:01.077
in holy acts of conduct.” 


16:01.077 --> 16:03.245
Let’s think about that. 


16:03.245 --> 16:08.150
For a person’s conduct to be holy
from Jehovah’s perspective,


16:08.150 --> 16:10.852
he or she must be morally clean. 


16:10.852 --> 16:13.989
While physical cleanness
is on the outside, 


16:13.988 --> 16:18.000
moral cleanness is on the inside
—in our thoughts and desires. 


16:19.293 --> 16:22.130
Is being morally clean really important? 


16:22.130 --> 16:24.132
Think about it this way. 


16:24.132 --> 16:28.304
When eating a meal, 
would you be content to eat from a bowl


16:28.303 --> 16:31.306
that had been washed
only on the outside? 


16:31.307 --> 16:32.975
Of course not! 


16:32.975 --> 16:35.177
We want to eat from clean dishes


16:35.177 --> 16:38.680
—dishes that are
thoroughly clean inside and out. 


16:38.680 --> 16:43.685
So when we wash dishes,
we wash the outside and the inside. 


16:43.685 --> 16:46.788
Similarly, 
Jehovah expects his servants


16:46.788 --> 16:49.825
to be clean through and through. 


16:49.825 --> 16:53.395
And because Jehovah
—the perfect reader of hearts—


16:53.395 --> 16:57.867
will soon dissolve, yes,
eliminate this dirty system of things, 


16:57.867 --> 17:00.000
it’s urgent that we do so.


17:01.070 --> 17:03.805
This means
that we have to work very hard


17:03.805 --> 17:07.042
so that nothing unclean
enters our mind. 


17:07.042 --> 17:09.579
That means firmly rejecting


17:09.578 --> 17:12.480
so-called fun
and exciting entertainment,


17:12.480 --> 17:16.118
which features sex,
violence, or spiritism. 


17:16.118 --> 17:20.588
At 1 Corinthians 14:20, 
the Bible tells us


17:20.588 --> 17:25.293
that we should become
like “young children as to badness.” 


17:25.293 --> 17:27.528
No matter our age, 


17:27.528 --> 17:30.131
we don’t need and we don’t want


17:30.132 --> 17:33.635
any experience 
with the wickedness of this world. 


17:33.635 --> 17:37.105
Rather, 
we keep the inside of the dish, 


17:37.105 --> 17:40.175
our mind and heart,
clean at all times. 


17:40.175 --> 17:44.112
And when we do so,
our exemplary conduct


17:44.112 --> 17:48.850
pleases Jehovah and it strengthens
our faithful brothers and sisters. 


17:48.850 --> 17:51.920
Really, it’s the only way
to respect ourselves


17:51.920 --> 17:54.623
and to gain the respect of others.


17:54.623 --> 17:58.093
Our theme text at 1 Timothy 4:12


17:58.093 --> 18:00.295
goes on to mention other areas


18:00.295 --> 18:04.165
where we can make steady progress
in becoming an example,


18:04.165 --> 18:08.270
such as in love, in faith,
and in chasteness. 


18:08.270 --> 18:10.672
During your personal study,


18:10.672 --> 18:14.275
that is, your personal time
with your best Friend, Jehovah,


18:14.275 --> 18:17.745
why not examine these areas
in more detail? 


18:17.745 --> 18:20.982
The treasures you gain
from such a study project


18:20.982 --> 18:25.000
can last a lifetime
—an everlasting lifetime.


18:26.322 --> 18:28.490
So, what have we learned? 


18:28.490 --> 18:30.992
In fulfillment of Bible prophecy,


18:30.992 --> 18:34.930
a large company of young people 
from around the world


18:34.930 --> 18:38.400
are taking a stand
with Jehovah and Jesus. 


18:38.400 --> 18:41.670
That includes all of you. 


18:41.670 --> 18:45.573
Like dewdrops,
you’re not only abundant in number


18:45.573 --> 18:48.443
but you sparkle in our congregations. 


18:48.443 --> 18:51.446
Your presence is very refreshing. 


18:51.447 --> 18:56.352
So please,
don’t look down on your youth. 


18:56.352 --> 18:58.954
Rather, rejoice in your youth! 


18:58.953 --> 19:03.000
Yes, “become an example 
to the faithful ones”!


19:04.092 --> 19:06.262
In the following dramatization, 


19:06.262 --> 19:09.130
a young brother is doing
just what we’ve discussed. 


19:09.130 --> 19:11.933
He’s becoming an example
to faithful ones


19:11.933 --> 19:15.003
and working hard
at the assignments he is given. 


19:15.003 --> 19:18.306
But there’s something he lacks


19:18.307 --> 19:20.575
—a quality that would make him


19:20.575 --> 19:22.912
even more valuable to Jehovah


19:22.912 --> 19:25.000
and to the congregation.


19:46.468 --> 19:50.000
Before the meeting starts, 
I need to get things ready.


19:53.542 --> 19:55.544
I’m Ben. 


19:55.543 --> 19:58.546
And as a ministerial servant, 


19:58.547 --> 20:01.000
I can do a lot 
to help the congregation.


20:06.755 --> 20:10.000
And that night 
I was given another assignment. 


20:11.993 --> 20:15.663
Brother Richards asked if I could help him 
update the territory maps 


20:15.663 --> 20:19.000
and organize our schedules 
for public witnessing.


20:20.268 --> 20:25.840
I think the brothers know 
I can modernize all of this.


20:25.840 --> 20:29.443
Brother Richards said to talk 
to Brother Bello, first. 


20:29.443 --> 20:32.000
He was the service overseer for years. 


20:34.415 --> 20:35.583
Great idea! 


20:35.583 --> 20:39.000
But I can already imagine 
the possibilities.


20:42.690 --> 20:46.000
By that weekend, 
I had almost finished. 


20:50.098 --> 20:54.000
I couldn’t believe the outdated ways
our records were kept. 


20:56.572 --> 20:59.000
This is going to be way better 
for the congregation. 


21:00.475 --> 21:03.000
And who knows 
what else could be improved?


21:09.283 --> 21:13.755
I thought I had everything ready 
to show Brother Richards.


21:13.755 --> 21:17.825
He liked the new ideas, 
but then he asked me, 


21:17.825 --> 21:20.000
“What did Brother Bello think?” 


21:22.097 --> 21:25.434
Oh, Brother Bello! 
I forgot. 


21:25.433 --> 21:27.468
I should have asked him, 


21:27.468 --> 21:31.000
but at this point, 
did it really matter?


21:33.108 --> 21:37.980
Brother Richards suggested 
we read about Elisha. 


21:37.980 --> 21:40.582
When the older Elijah’s work was ending, 


21:40.582 --> 21:43.585
Elisha stuck close to his teacher. 


21:43.585 --> 21:47.522
Urged to stay behind, 
Elisha repeatedly said: 


21:47.522 --> 21:52.160
“As surely as Jehovah is living 
and as you are living, 


21:52.160 --> 21:55.000
I will not leave you.”


21:58.800 --> 22:01.135
Until the moment Elijah left, 


22:01.135 --> 22:04.000
Elisha wanted to learn from him. 


22:15.117 --> 22:18.120
Like a son asking his father, 


22:18.120 --> 22:21.357
he wanted a double portion 
of Elijah’s spirit 


22:21.357 --> 22:24.000
to continue the work he started. 


22:26.362 --> 22:29.130
And Elisha’s first miracle 


22:29.130 --> 22:33.000
was the same as Elijah’s last: 


22:34.068 --> 22:39.573
dividing the Jordan 
with Elijah’s official garment.


22:39.573 --> 22:43.678
Everything Elisha did 
revealed his respect 


22:43.678 --> 22:47.000
for the experienced man Elijah.


22:48.417 --> 22:51.000
I wasn’t finished 
with my new assignment after all. 


22:54.088 --> 22:58.000
There was a lot I needed to learn 
from Brother Bello.


22:59.493 --> 23:01.930
He really understood
our preaching territory 


23:01.930 --> 23:03.000
and the people who live here. 


23:06.602 --> 23:08.604
He liked my ideas, 


23:08.603 --> 23:12.000
but everything he showed me 
made them even better.


23:28.690 --> 23:32.000
I can do a lot 
to help the congregation. 


23:34.395 --> 23:37.265
And I pray that Jehovah 
lets me do even more 


23:37.265 --> 23:40.768
with the gifts he gave me 


23:40.768 --> 23:45.000
and with the wisdom 
of experienced men.


23:54.682 --> 23:58.954
Ben had good ideas to improve
the work he’d been assigned,


23:58.953 --> 24:03.225
but he also learned to respect
the experience of older brothers. 


24:03.225 --> 24:06.995
You too may have ideas
to benefit your assignment, 


24:06.995 --> 24:11.567
whether in the congregation,
at Bethel, or on a construction project. 


24:11.567 --> 24:16.204
Like Ben, seek the wisdom
of experienced brothers and sisters


24:16.203 --> 24:18.506
who did the assignment before you. 


24:18.507 --> 24:21.877
Find out why they did things
a certain way. 


24:21.877 --> 24:24.479
What were the challenges
they faced? 


24:24.478 --> 24:28.015
What direction and resources
influenced their efforts? 


24:28.015 --> 24:31.720
How can their experience
help you succeed? 


24:31.720 --> 24:34.755
You’ll see the wisdom
in what may at first


24:34.755 --> 24:37.292
look like outdated methods. 


24:37.292 --> 24:40.529
Speak respectfully
of their past work,


24:40.528 --> 24:45.200
and you’ll reflect how Jehovah
treasures what they did for Him.


24:45.200 --> 24:49.570
Jehovah will, in turn,
bless the work of your hands.


24:49.570 --> 24:53.275
What else will bring
Jehovah’s blessing? 


24:53.275 --> 24:57.612
He draws close
to spiritually-minded people. 


24:57.612 --> 25:01.082
Young Christians all over the world
are experiencing


25:01.082 --> 25:05.487
the benefits of maintaining
a close relationship with God.


25:05.487 --> 25:09.124
Each of you faces
a unique set of circumstances


25:09.123 --> 25:12.826
that make it difficult 
to be a spiritually-minded youth. 


25:12.827 --> 25:16.532
So we interviewed young Witnesses
from different lands


25:16.532 --> 25:20.000
to find out what they do
to keep growing spiritually.


25:21.770 --> 25:25.340
Our relationship with Jehovah 
can start when we’re young. 


25:25.340 --> 25:27.608
For me, it was the example 
that others set 


25:27.608 --> 25:30.011
of putting Jehovah first 


25:30.012 --> 25:32.514
and the happiness 
that came as a result, 


25:32.513 --> 25:35.450
as well as being 
in that sort of environment


25:35.450 --> 25:38.787
that really helped me
to want to reach out 


25:38.787 --> 25:41.000
as well as be available 
for those opportunities. 


25:42.357 --> 25:44.359
And once we do
give our life to Jehovah, 


25:44.358 --> 25:47.528
it’s amazing to see the blessings 
that he has in store for us. 


25:47.528 --> 25:50.131
But in order to build that relationship, 


25:50.132 --> 25:52.034
we need to read God’s Word; 


25:52.033 --> 25:53.901
we also need to pray to him.


25:53.902 --> 25:55.504
The more you
get to know him, 


25:55.503 --> 25:58.071
the more appealing things 
you learn about him. 


25:58.072 --> 26:01.375
That makes you not want to lose him
as your friend. 


26:01.375 --> 26:03.545
I always knew it was the truth 


26:03.545 --> 26:06.313
and that I wanted 
to serve Jehovah forever. 


26:06.313 --> 26:10.085
But I needed to reassure myself 
of certain aspects, 


26:10.085 --> 26:13.322
so I did some research projects 
with my parents, 


26:13.322 --> 26:16.892
using the Creator book and some items 
from the Bible Teach book. 


26:16.892 --> 26:19.660
After that, 
it only became more obvious. 


26:19.660 --> 26:21.663
And I was certain that I wanted it 


26:21.663 --> 26:24.765
and that I was ready to get baptized.


26:24.765 --> 26:26.935
To strengthen
my relationship with Jehovah, 


26:26.935 --> 26:29.703
I read the Bible daily
and I pray. 


26:29.703 --> 26:33.206
Especially when 
there is no one around or it’s quiet, 


26:33.207 --> 26:35.844
I talk to Jehovah 
with all my heart at that time. 


26:35.843 --> 26:39.680
Making myself available 
for spiritual opportunities 


26:39.680 --> 26:43.385
was a little bit difficult for me at first, 
but I didn’t give up. 


26:43.385 --> 26:46.888
After my baptism, 
I became a ministerial servant, 


26:46.888 --> 26:49.523
and I also served 
almost two years in Bethel. 


26:49.523 --> 26:51.760
And now I’m a regular pioneer 


26:51.760 --> 26:54.000
in Hpado 
in a Karen-speaking congregation. 


26:56.765 --> 26:59.633
I didn’t know or speak 
the Karen S’gaw language, 


26:59.633 --> 27:02.903
so the local brothers helped me 
to learn not only how to speak 


27:02.903 --> 27:05.000
but also how to read.


27:07.875 --> 27:09.943
Prayers 
are important to strengthen 


27:09.943 --> 27:11.946
my relationship with Jehovah. 


27:11.947 --> 27:13.949
For me, it’s like talking 


27:13.948 --> 27:16.250
to a friend, 
and that’s always helpful. 


27:16.250 --> 27:18.620
He’s someone real to me, 


27:18.620 --> 27:20.000
and I fully trust 
that he listens to me. 


27:21.890 --> 27:24.425
I support the elders by helping 
with the cleaning of the hall, 


27:24.425 --> 27:28.162
serving as an attendant, 
handling microphones, 


27:28.162 --> 27:31.000
as well as helping 
the congregation spiritually. 


27:32.133 --> 27:35.736
When I share Jehovah’s promises
of eternal life with others, 


27:35.737 --> 27:38.072
I too am encouraged. 


27:38.072 --> 27:41.509
I’m constantly remembering 
what Jehovah promises, 


27:41.508 --> 27:44.811
and that motivates me 
to keep preaching.


27:44.812 --> 27:47.249
There’s a family 
in our congregation 


27:47.248 --> 27:48.950
who took me into their home 


27:48.950 --> 27:52.000
and served 
as my spiritual parents. 


27:57.658 --> 27:59.660
Through our family worship, 


27:59.660 --> 28:02.000
they helped me 
to progress spiritually.


28:07.435 --> 28:11.672
The elderly ones in our congregation 
have been helping me a lot. 


28:11.672 --> 28:14.175
First, they’re good examples. 


28:14.175 --> 28:17.178
They also remind me 
to keep my eye simple. 


28:17.178 --> 28:20.381
Despite their limited circumstances 
because of age, 


28:20.382 --> 28:24.352
they are determined 
to serve Jehovah God. 


28:24.352 --> 28:26.554
And that made me 
reflect on my situation. 


28:26.553 --> 28:28.556
I’m very young. 


28:28.557 --> 28:31.000
What prevents me from doing 
the things that they do?


28:32.193 --> 28:34.195
Before I
began pioneering, 


28:34.195 --> 28:36.865
I used to sell fish
seven days a week, 


28:36.865 --> 28:38.833
but now I sell fish four days a week, 


28:38.833 --> 28:42.000
so three days are available for pioneering. 


28:43.337 --> 28:46.640
To be able to be available 
for spiritual opportunities, 


28:46.640 --> 28:49.000
I closely associate 
with my congregation. 


28:51.478 --> 28:54.048
I offer some older ones 
a ride to the meetings


28:54.048 --> 28:56.000
or in the preaching work. 


28:58.318 --> 29:01.188
The reason I’m doing this 
is because I want to give 


29:01.188 --> 29:05.000
my youth and energy
to Jehovah God.


29:06.227 --> 29:09.197
When I was at school, 
I would conduct Bible studies 


29:09.197 --> 29:11.934
with some of my classmates. 


29:11.933 --> 29:15.000
In time, they joined me 
in serving Jehovah. 


29:16.537 --> 29:19.707
When I think about being with them 
in the future Paradise, 


29:19.707 --> 29:22.877
it gives me deep joy.


29:22.877 --> 29:25.247
I have the privilege
of studying with a deaf girl


29:25.247 --> 29:27.682
who lives two hours
from where I live. 


29:27.682 --> 29:29.417
We have to walk all the way. 


29:29.417 --> 29:32.254
She is very happy 
with what she’s learning, 


29:32.253 --> 29:34.255
and her family is very supportive. 


29:34.255 --> 29:36.523
So knowing that Jehovah
is helping her 


29:36.523 --> 29:40.000
and I have a part in it, 
it’s just priceless.


29:41.362 --> 29:42.964
Auxiliary pioneering 
definitely helped me


29:42.963 --> 29:45.900
because it was like a stepping stone 
to regular pioneering. 


29:45.900 --> 29:49.270
The ministry definitely gives you 
the opportunity 


29:49.270 --> 29:52.040
to be able 
to work closely with Jehovah. 


29:52.040 --> 29:54.075
And then it— 
By doing that, you’re reaffirming 


29:54.075 --> 29:56.077
your faith in what 
you already believe in, 


29:56.077 --> 29:59.814
and then you’re drawing closer 
to Jehovah in friendship.


29:59.813 --> 30:03.450
Having jw.org and the broadcast 


30:03.450 --> 30:06.220
has definitely drawn me 
closer to our brothers 


30:06.220 --> 30:08.388
and sisters but also to Jehovah as well.


30:08.388 --> 30:12.060
Just by nature, 
I feel like I’m more of a timid person, 


30:12.060 --> 30:14.962
so going door to door 
can be a little scary. 


30:14.962 --> 30:17.065
But seeing other young ones 
in different parts of the world 


30:17.065 --> 30:20.168
that are enduring 
very difficult circumstances


30:20.168 --> 30:21.268
and living conditions 


30:21.268 --> 30:23.671
and yet are still giving 
their best to Jehovah 


30:23.672 --> 30:25.674
is so encouraging for me. 


30:25.673 --> 30:29.000
And it helps me to keep going on 
and give Jehovah my best as well.


30:30.478 --> 30:34.981
When I think personally 
about all the avenues of service 


30:34.982 --> 30:37.652
that we can have a hand in today, 


30:37.652 --> 30:41.322
there are so many that are exciting


30:41.322 --> 30:44.592
—whether it be pioneering 
in a foreign country, 


30:44.592 --> 30:47.129
serving where the need is great, 


30:47.128 --> 30:49.596
even serving at Bethel. 


30:49.597 --> 30:52.534
Unless we “taste and see 
that Jehovah is good,” 


30:52.533 --> 30:54.201
unless we put ourself out there 


30:54.202 --> 30:57.205
and are available 
to try that at least once, 


30:57.205 --> 31:00.007
we’ll never know 
what it would be like 


31:00.007 --> 31:01.675
to really serve Jehovah. 


31:01.675 --> 31:04.878
And in doing that, 
you will see how Jehovah 


31:04.878 --> 31:07.000
does want the best life for us.


31:13.187 --> 31:15.624
Those young ones
and others like them


31:15.623 --> 31:18.726
are developing the same
spiritual qualities


31:18.727 --> 31:21.195
that Paul saw in Timothy. 


31:21.195 --> 31:25.098
Read along with me and see
how Paul described Timothy


31:25.098 --> 31:28.936
at Philippians chapter 2
starting at verse 20:


31:28.937 --> 31:33.642
“For I have no one else
of a disposition like his


31:33.642 --> 31:36.644
“who will genuinely care
for your concerns. 


31:36.643 --> 31:39.446
“For all the others are seeking
their own interests,


31:39.447 --> 31:41.682
“not those of Jesus Christ. 


31:41.682 --> 31:44.385
“But you know the proof
he gave of himself, 


31:44.385 --> 31:46.487
“that like a child with a father


31:46.487 --> 31:49.924
he slaved with me
to advance the good news.”


31:49.923 --> 31:53.493
What is it that Paul 
saw in Timothy? 


31:53.493 --> 31:57.631
He saw his spiritual disposition,
or attitude. 


31:57.632 --> 32:01.869
He observed his genuine interest
in his brothers and sisters. 


32:01.868 --> 32:05.806
Timothy really desired
to do God’s will 


32:05.807 --> 32:09.177
even though others were seeking
their personal interests. 


32:09.177 --> 32:12.280
And Timothy earned
his fellow worshippers’ respect


32:12.280 --> 32:14.782
by working with older
and more experienced Christians,


32:14.782 --> 32:16.952
like Paul, in the ministry. 


32:16.952 --> 32:20.120
When you
spiritually-minded young ones


32:20.120 --> 32:24.492
cultivate that beautiful
Timothy-like disposition,


32:24.492 --> 32:27.595
you make Jehovah’s heart rejoice.


32:27.595 --> 32:30.798
Of course,
putting Kingdom interests first


32:30.798 --> 32:35.268
and the needs of others 
ahead of our own is not always easy. 


32:35.268 --> 32:38.005
We know there are real temptations


32:38.005 --> 32:41.508
that can lead a young person
away from Jehovah. 


32:41.508 --> 32:43.610
When others
outside the congregation


32:43.610 --> 32:46.313
recognize our abilities
and talents,


32:46.313 --> 32:49.483
we could begin to seek
“great things” for ourselves, 


32:49.483 --> 32:52.120
perhaps fame and recognition. 


32:52.120 --> 32:55.423
In this interview, 
Brother Edgardo Franco


32:55.423 --> 32:58.058
relates how this desire 
caused him


32:58.058 --> 33:01.761
to turn his back on Jehovah.


33:01.762 --> 33:06.100
So, if the Devil tempted Jesus, 


33:06.100 --> 33:08.837
don’t you think 
he will try to tempt us 


33:08.837 --> 33:12.000
in order to jeopardize 
our relationship with God?


33:13.640 --> 33:15.643
This is the best contract 
we’ve ever offered you. 


33:15.643 --> 33:17.378
Listen, I’ll get you a plan 


33:17.378 --> 33:19.380
so you can attend 
your religious meetings during the week. 


33:19.380 --> 33:22.000
Just do the concert 
for us on the weekend!


33:25.953 --> 33:27.955
People always ask me, 


33:27.955 --> 33:30.000
“Why did you leave 
the music world?”


33:31.625 --> 33:33.627
When I was still a boy, 


33:33.627 --> 33:37.000
I had dreams 
about becoming a famous singer. 


33:38.332 --> 33:40.334
Then I learned the truth, 


33:40.333 --> 33:44.305
but I never fully removed 
those dreams from my heart. 


33:44.305 --> 33:48.877
And then I started listening 
to some bad influences from my past, 


33:48.877 --> 33:51.312
and they got me hooked. 


33:51.312 --> 33:55.000
Then they reeled me 
into the recording studio. 


33:56.817 --> 33:58.820
The lyrics in the songs


33:58.820 --> 34:01.000
—they really bothered 
my conscience. 


34:02.890 --> 34:05.727
So they offered me 
some liquor to loosen me up, 


34:05.727 --> 34:08.997
and then I started 
to feel more comfortable. 


34:08.997 --> 34:12.234
I started singing, 
and they liked what they were hearing. 


34:12.233 --> 34:15.936
And those songs ended up 
all over the radio stations. 


34:15.937 --> 34:18.539
It was as if Satan 
gave me a trophy 


34:18.538 --> 34:21.041
for abandoning Jehovah.


34:21.042 --> 34:25.000
I became addicted to the applause.


34:27.282 --> 34:29.384
Everything looks so beautiful, 


34:29.383 --> 34:31.451
but when you’re on top


34:31.452 --> 34:34.222
—when you’re really at the top 
of Satan’s world—


34:34.222 --> 34:36.457
there’s nothing beautiful there.


34:36.457 --> 34:37.959
I was an actor, 


34:37.958 --> 34:39.693
and when the cameras 
turned on, 


34:39.693 --> 34:42.530
my face and my smile 
turned on too. 


34:42.530 --> 34:44.532
But when I would get back
to the hotel, 


34:44.532 --> 34:46.534
it was a huge letdown. 


34:46.533 --> 34:48.701
There was no applause


34:48.702 --> 34:52.000
—just that silence 
that tormented my conscience.


34:55.477 --> 34:58.245
So basically, you had to find 


34:58.245 --> 35:00.948
other distractions,
and one of those for me 


35:00.948 --> 35:03.216
was the slot machine. 


35:03.217 --> 35:06.820
And, of course, casinos 
don’t just come with slot machines.


35:06.820 --> 35:10.423
They also expose you 
to prostitution and alcohol.


35:10.423 --> 35:13.226
My conscience would ask, 


35:13.227 --> 35:15.797
‘What are you doing here?’


35:15.797 --> 35:18.565
I remember those times on tour, 


35:18.565 --> 35:21.402
from my limousine, 
I’d see the brothers preaching, 


35:21.402 --> 35:23.770
and that would always touch my heart. 


35:23.770 --> 35:26.007
I would say to myself, ‘Wow! 


35:26.007 --> 35:28.509
‘Jehovah trained you 
to be doing that, 


35:28.508 --> 35:30.478
and look at what you’re doing!’ 


35:30.478 --> 35:32.780
That really cut deep into my heart.


35:32.780 --> 35:36.000
The road back to the truth was, 
really, very hard. 


35:37.452 --> 35:41.522
Every time I was going to retire, 
I’d say, “This is it!” 


35:41.522 --> 35:45.292
But then there would always be 
a bigger contract. 


35:45.292 --> 35:47.629
I had to make drastic decisions.


35:47.628 --> 35:49.696
But finally I said: 


35:49.697 --> 35:52.132
“I don’t care what they offer me. 


35:52.132 --> 35:54.335
“I have to return to Jehovah. 


35:54.335 --> 35:56.370
“I have to fulfill the vow 


35:56.370 --> 35:58.805
“I made to him 
when I was a young man, 


35:58.805 --> 36:01.342
when I dedicated my life to him.”


36:01.342 --> 36:04.779
So I prayed to Jehovah 
very earnestly and said: 


36:04.778 --> 36:07.615
“Jehovah, 
I need to return to you. 


36:07.615 --> 36:09.950
“I need to return 
to your loving arms. 


36:09.950 --> 36:12.953
“Satan has ripped me 
away from you. 


36:12.953 --> 36:15.000
Please help me.” 


36:16.557 --> 36:20.060
I remember that before I went 
in to that first meeting, 


36:20.060 --> 36:23.965
I told Jehovah, “Please give me a sign 
that you will take me back.” 


36:23.965 --> 36:26.867
And there was 
an elderly sister there. 


36:26.867 --> 36:29.704
She gave me a great big hug 


36:29.703 --> 36:32.138
and said, “Welcome back, son!” 


36:32.138 --> 36:34.141
And she took my hand 


36:34.142 --> 36:37.412
and sat by me 
during the entire meeting.


36:37.412 --> 36:41.000
I had betrayed Jehovah, 
but I thank— 


36:43.918 --> 36:46.353
I thank the brothers 


36:46.353 --> 36:50.256
because Jehovah 
put brothers at every turn. 


36:50.257 --> 36:52.827
They showed me with the Bible 


36:52.827 --> 36:54.829
how far I had strayed 


36:54.828 --> 36:57.498
from the paths of the true God, 


36:57.498 --> 37:00.835
and everything you do 
has consequences. 


37:00.835 --> 37:04.505
I have asked Jehovah many times 
to forgive me for all the things 


37:04.505 --> 37:06.573
I have done
—and the brothers too—


37:06.573 --> 37:09.743
all the people 
I offended by my actions.


37:09.743 --> 37:11.745
All those trophies I won


37:11.745 --> 37:13.847
—every last one of them—


37:13.847 --> 37:15.917
are there collecting dust. 


37:15.917 --> 37:18.085
But Jehovah has given me 


37:18.085 --> 37:20.722
a different kind of trophy 
in his organization


37:20.722 --> 37:24.625
—helping others to dedicate 
their lives to him. 


37:24.625 --> 37:28.262
That’s something no one 
can take away from you.


37:28.262 --> 37:30.264
We don’t all 
have to learn the hard way. 


37:30.263 --> 37:32.266
We have to keep enduring 


37:32.267 --> 37:35.704
and never turn 
our backs on Jehovah. 


37:35.703 --> 37:38.000
That’s the worst mistake 
anyone could make. 


37:39.273 --> 37:42.810
We know that it’s Jehovah 
who gives us our talents, 


37:42.810 --> 37:46.313
so we should use them 
all in his service. 


37:46.313 --> 37:50.383
I have found happiness, 
and that gives me 


37:50.383 --> 37:52.753
a glow that’s not just 
for the cameras. 


37:52.753 --> 37:56.000
Everyone who knows me 
can see it.


38:02.397 --> 38:04.599
Brother Franco enjoys serving


38:04.598 --> 38:08.101
as both a regular pioneer
and congregation elder. 


38:08.102 --> 38:10.470
He feels privileged
to shepherd young people


38:10.470 --> 38:14.075
facing some of the same temptations
he experienced. 


38:14.075 --> 38:19.047
He often relates a favorite scripture
from Proverbs 8:35. 


38:19.047 --> 38:21.882
Referring to wisdom,
that scripture says: 


38:21.882 --> 38:25.252
“For the one finding me
will find life, 


38:25.252 --> 38:28.122
and he receives approval
from Jehovah.”


38:28.122 --> 38:30.124
Brothers and sisters, 


38:30.123 --> 38:33.726
Jehovah does want us to find life, 


38:33.727 --> 38:37.565
and he wants us to be successful
in our spiritual pursuits. 


38:37.565 --> 38:39.567
In this Bethel morning worship,


38:39.567 --> 38:42.804
Brother Robert Luccioni
discusses how we can reach


38:42.803 --> 38:46.340
the potential that Jehovah knows
we have.


38:46.340 --> 38:49.643
Our text today is very encouraging 
as it reminds us, 


38:49.643 --> 38:51.978
through this example of Amos, 


38:51.978 --> 38:54.615
that Jehovah notices the potential 


38:54.615 --> 38:56.617
of each one of his servants. 


38:56.617 --> 38:59.520
In fact, one of the comments 
from today’s text states: 


38:59.520 --> 39:02.457
“Even though we may
 lack self-confidence, 


39:02.457 --> 39:06.194
“Jehovah can help us 
go beyond our perceived limits 


39:06.193 --> 39:09.563
and reach goals that we 
would not have imagined.” 


39:09.563 --> 39:12.566
See, Jehovah knows our potential. 


39:12.567 --> 39:14.735
But you note from that statement, 


39:14.735 --> 39:18.472
this is also a reminder 
that we have to put forth effort 


39:18.472 --> 39:20.474
to reach our potential. 


39:20.473 --> 39:24.545
You see, if we’re not careful, 
we can sabotage our own efforts 


39:24.545 --> 39:27.682
to reach the potential 
that Jehovah sees in us. 


39:27.682 --> 39:31.485
How’s that possible? 
Well, let’s look at three examples.


39:31.485 --> 39:34.122
Number one: 
We can limit potential 


39:34.122 --> 39:38.359
by not throwing ourselves 
into what we are asked to do. 


39:38.358 --> 39:40.693
Now, we may remember 
the account of Jehoash 


39:40.693 --> 39:44.331
the king of Israel 
there in 2 Kings chapter 13, 


39:44.332 --> 39:47.735
when he visited 
the prophet Elisha who was dying. 


39:47.735 --> 39:52.473
And you notice there 
at 2 Kings 13:17 


39:52.473 --> 39:56.143
that Elisha 
notes Jehoash’s potential. 


39:56.143 --> 39:58.411
You notice he says there 
that: “You will 


39:58.412 --> 40:02.349
strike down Syria . . . 
until you finish it off.” 


40:02.348 --> 40:04.351
See, he noted the potential 


40:04.352 --> 40:06.554
that he had to finish off Syria. 


40:06.553 --> 40:08.555
But then what happens? 


40:08.555 --> 40:12.693
Well, you remember that’s where 
Elisha tells the king 


40:12.693 --> 40:15.763
to beat the arrows 
on the ground three times or—  


40:15.763 --> 40:17.965
beat it on the ground, 
and he only does it three times. 


40:17.965 --> 40:20.700
Notice what happens in verse 19: 


40:20.700 --> 40:22.703
“At that the man of the true God 


40:22.703 --> 40:24.905
“grew indignant at him and said: 


40:24.905 --> 40:28.408
“‘You should have struck the ground 
five or six times! 


40:28.408 --> 40:30.945
“‘Then you 
would have struck down Syria 


40:30.945 --> 40:32.947
“‘until you finished it off, 


40:32.947 --> 40:35.015
“‘but now 
you will strike down Syria 


40:35.015 --> 40:37.017
only three times.’” 


40:37.017 --> 40:38.752
What happened? 


40:38.752 --> 40:42.022
Well, you see, by not throwing himself 
into what he was asked to do


40:42.022 --> 40:44.024
—showing zeal for his assignment—


40:44.023 --> 40:46.293
he would only 
have limited success. 


40:46.293 --> 40:50.163
Jehoash limited his own potential.


40:50.163 --> 40:52.431
Number two: 
We can limit our potential 


40:52.432 --> 40:57.037
by focusing on our inadequacies 
or our insecurities. 


40:57.037 --> 41:00.507
The account that drives that home 
for me is that of Moses. 


41:00.507 --> 41:03.044
If you look in Exodus chapter 3, 


41:03.043 --> 41:06.913
and in this account we know 
it’s not due to lack of zeal, 


41:06.913 --> 41:09.450
but, rather, 
Moses’ own insecurities 


41:09.450 --> 41:13.287
that nearly caused him to limit 
how he was used by Jehovah. 


41:13.287 --> 41:15.289
So we know in Exodus chapter 3, 


41:15.288 --> 41:18.425
he received a very weighty assignment
—going to Pharaoh. 


41:18.425 --> 41:21.295
And notice what happens 
in verse 11, 


41:21.295 --> 41:23.630
Exodus 3:11. 


41:23.630 --> 41:26.433
It says: “However, 
Moses said to the true God: 


41:26.433 --> 41:28.768
“‘Who am I that I 
should go to Pharaoh 


41:28.768 --> 41:31.305
and bring the Israelites 
out of Egypt?’” 


41:31.305 --> 41:32.640
Now, that’s a normal reaction.


41:32.640 --> 41:33.973
We probably would have felt 
the same way. 


41:33.973 --> 41:36.576
‘Jehovah, are you sure 
you have the right person here?’ 


41:36.577 --> 41:38.579
And Jehovah says, ‘No. 
I do. 


41:38.578 --> 41:40.580
I will be with you.’ 


41:40.580 --> 41:43.050
You look on in verse 13, it says: 


41:43.050 --> 41:45.118
“But Moses said to the true God: 
‘Suppose I 


41:45.118 --> 41:47.186
“‘go to [Israel] and say to them, 


41:47.187 --> 41:49.524
“‘“The God of your forefathers 
has sent me to you,” 


41:49.523 --> 41:51.525
“‘and they say to me, 
“What is his name?” 


41:51.525 --> 41:53.427
What should I say to them?’” 


41:53.427 --> 41:55.429
Jehovah says, ‘No problem,’ 
and He explains His name


41:55.428 --> 41:57.565
—even tells him 
what His name means


41:57.565 --> 42:00.733
and how that power 
will be behind him. 


42:00.733 --> 42:03.403
Chapter 4, verse 1: 


42:03.403 --> 42:06.673
“However, Moses answered: 
‘But suppose they do not believe me 


42:06.673 --> 42:09.075
“‘and do not listen to my voice, 
for they will say,


42:09.075 --> 42:11.078
“Jehovah did not appear to you.”’” 


42:11.078 --> 42:13.113
‘No problem, Moses. 
What’s in your hand?’ 


42:13.113 --> 42:14.215
It’s where he has the staff. 


42:14.215 --> 42:16.350
He shows him miracles 
that he can perform to show 


42:16.350 --> 42:18.352
that Jehovah is behind him. 


42:18.352 --> 42:20.354
Look at verse 10: 


42:20.353 --> 42:23.123
“Moses now said to Jehovah: 
‘Pardon me, Jehovah, 


42:23.123 --> 42:25.858
“‘but I have never been a fluent speaker, 
neither in the past 


42:25.858 --> 42:27.861
“‘nor since you have spoken 
to your servant, 


42:27.862 --> 42:31.065
for I am slow of speech 
and slow of tongue.’” 


42:31.065 --> 42:33.800
‘OK, Moses, 
who created the mouth? 


42:33.800 --> 42:36.537
I’ll speak for you. 
Don’t worry about it.’ 


42:36.537 --> 42:38.539
Look at verse 13: 


42:38.538 --> 42:40.840
“But he said: ‘Pardon me, 
Jehovah, please send 


42:40.840 --> 42:42.910
anyone whom you 
want to send.’” 


42:42.910 --> 42:45.378
And notice what it says 
in verse 14: 


42:45.378 --> 42:49.650
“Then Jehovah’s anger 
blazed against Moses.” 


42:49.650 --> 42:52.252
‘Fine, you know, I’m going 
to just send somebody else.’ 


42:52.252 --> 42:54.855
But, you see, thankfully, 
Moses got the point 


42:54.855 --> 42:57.925
and he jumped into the assignment 
and was used further by Jehovah. 


42:57.925 --> 42:59.593
But what happened here? 


42:59.593 --> 43:03.363
You notice, Moses got caught up 
worrying about his inadequacies, 


43:03.363 --> 43:05.898
worrying about all the things 
that could go wrong. 


43:05.898 --> 43:07.968
Jehovah was saying, 
‘Just get moving, 


43:07.968 --> 43:10.170
and I will take care 
of the rest.’ 


43:10.170 --> 43:12.472
Jehovah saw that
Moses had the potential 


43:12.472 --> 43:14.275
to carry out this assignment; 


43:14.275 --> 43:17.912
however, 
Moses was limiting himself.


43:17.912 --> 43:20.580
Number three: 
We can limit our own potential 


43:20.580 --> 43:24.718
by becoming paralyzed by fear
—fear of failure. 


43:24.718 --> 43:27.655
If you turn to the account 
in Numbers chapter 13, 


43:27.655 --> 43:30.923
we notice that this 
is what happened to the ten spies. 


43:30.923 --> 43:32.926
And it’s very interesting, 


43:32.927 --> 43:35.929
a phrase they used when they 
came back from spying out the land. 


43:35.928 --> 43:39.000
Numbers chapter 13, 
and look at verse 33. 


43:41.468 --> 43:44.605
It says: 
“And there we saw the Nephilim, 


43:44.605 --> 43:47.440
“the sons of Anak, 
who [were] from the Nephilim, 


43:47.440 --> 43:51.245
and in comparison 
we seemed like grasshoppers,” 


43:51.245 --> 43:55.748
and notice, “both to us 
and to them.” 


43:55.748 --> 43:58.918
You see, they ran into these 
sons of Anak who were giants,


43:58.918 --> 44:01.121
men of extraordinary size 
who inhabited


44:01.122 --> 44:02.455
the mountainous region of Canaan,


44:02.455 --> 44:05.292
and it was understandable 
that these enemies of Jehovah 


44:05.292 --> 44:07.929
viewed the Israelites 
as puny grasshoppers. 


44:07.928 --> 44:11.131
‘You can just squash them
—no competition.’ 


44:11.132 --> 44:13.800
But, you know, the ten spies 


44:13.800 --> 44:16.737
saw themselves the same way. 


44:16.737 --> 44:19.340
And, see, their view 
of themselves in this situation 


44:19.340 --> 44:21.675
paralyzed them with fear 
and caused them 


44:21.675 --> 44:24.010
to demoralize the entire nation.


44:24.010 --> 44:26.547
But now, in contrast, 
we think of the account of David, 


44:26.547 --> 44:30.350
who as a young man 
also encountered a giant, Goliath. 


44:30.350 --> 44:34.287
And remember, Goliath also saw David 
as a defenseless little boy 


44:34.287 --> 44:37.357
and as a grasshopper, 
if you will. 


44:37.357 --> 44:39.894
But did David see himself 
the same way? 


44:39.893 --> 44:42.730
No, he said: ‘You are coming to me 
with sword and spear. 


44:42.730 --> 44:45.698
I am coming to you 
with the name of Jehovah.’ 


44:45.698 --> 44:49.436
You see, David did not allow himself 
to be paralyzed by fear. 


44:49.437 --> 44:53.507
He trusted in Jehovah, 
and David lived up to the potential 


44:53.507 --> 44:55.842
that Jehovah saw in him.


44:55.842 --> 44:57.845
So, what’s the lesson for us? 


44:57.845 --> 44:59.847
Well, the lesson is that this illustrates


44:59.847 --> 45:02.382
—these accounts illustrate—
that sometimes we can be 


45:02.382 --> 45:04.519
our own worst enemy at times. 


45:04.518 --> 45:07.186
See, lack of zeal
—not throwing ourself into the work, 


45:07.187 --> 45:09.189
as in the case of Jehoash; 


45:09.188 --> 45:13.026
or our own insecurities, 
as in the case of Moses; 


45:13.027 --> 45:16.497
or fear of failure, 
as in the case of the ten spies


45:16.497 --> 45:21.235
—can cause us to limit
the potential that Jehovah sees in us.


45:21.235 --> 45:23.403
So, what do we do? 


45:23.403 --> 45:27.140
Well, Jehovah’s words to Gideon 
remind us of what we could do, 


45:27.140 --> 45:30.610
and we invite you 
to turn to Judges chapter 6. 


45:30.610 --> 45:33.480
And you remember 
that for seven years 


45:33.480 --> 45:37.217
the Midianites 
oppressed the nation of Israel, 


45:37.217 --> 45:40.487
and Jehovah’s angel appears
to Gideon and says that He is going 


45:40.487 --> 45:43.057
to deliver Israel
out of this wicked nation. 


45:43.057 --> 45:45.092
How could he possibly succeed? 


45:45.092 --> 45:47.094
We read the account, 
and Gideon saw himself 


45:47.093 --> 45:49.763
as the least significant 
one of his father’s house. 


45:49.763 --> 45:52.833
And he said his father’s house 
was the least significant family 


45:52.833 --> 45:54.835
of the tribe of Manasseh. 


45:54.835 --> 45:58.772
But yet Jehovah saw 
the potential that Gideon had. 


45:58.772 --> 46:01.509
And what did Jehovah 
tell him to do? 


46:01.508 --> 46:05.000
Look at Judges 6:14. 


46:06.913 --> 46:09.716
It says: 
“Jehovah faced him and said: 


46:09.717 --> 46:12.987
“‘Go with the strength you have, 


46:12.987 --> 46:16.290
“‘and you will save Israel 
out of Midian’s hand. 


46:16.290 --> 46:18.958
Is it not I who [sent] you?’” 


46:18.958 --> 46:20.960
Interesting. 


46:20.960 --> 46:24.097
‘Go with the strength 
you have. 


46:24.097 --> 46:26.334
‘I know you cannot do it 
on your own strength. 


46:26.333 --> 46:30.203
‘Just get moving; 
throw everything you can into it; 


46:30.203 --> 46:33.673
and I, Jehovah, 
will make up the difference.’ 


46:33.673 --> 46:35.675
You see, 
that’s what Jehovah is saying, 


46:35.675 --> 46:38.212
and that’s exactly what happened.


46:38.212 --> 46:41.282
So may we be determined 
to do the same. 


46:41.282 --> 46:43.750
We know that none of us 
accomplish Jehovah’s work 


46:43.750 --> 46:46.153
on our own strength, 
on our own wisdom,


46:46.153 --> 46:47.420
on our own abilities. 


46:47.420 --> 46:49.422
But when we receive an assignment, 


46:49.422 --> 46:51.825
we need to just start moving. 


46:51.825 --> 46:55.362
Do not let our inadequacies 
paralyze us. 


46:55.362 --> 46:58.565
Do not let fear of failure 
paralyze us. 


46:58.565 --> 47:01.668
Throw ourselves into the work. 
Have a zeal for the work. 


47:01.668 --> 47:04.938
Go with the strength 
that you have. 


47:04.938 --> 47:08.741
Trust in Jehovah 
to make up the difference, 


47:08.742 --> 47:13.980
and you will live up to the potential 
that Jehovah sees in you.


47:13.980 --> 47:18.585
What excellent counsel for all of us, 
and especially for young ones


47:18.585 --> 47:21.455
with a life of service to God
ahead of them. 


47:21.455 --> 47:25.492
That life with Jehovah
can be everlasting! 


47:25.492 --> 47:27.494
That is our firm hope. 


47:27.493 --> 47:30.296
Until then, will you remain loyal,


47:30.297 --> 47:34.400
resist what the world offers you, 
and reach your potential?


47:34.400 --> 47:38.305
Imagine your life
100 years from now. 


47:38.305 --> 47:42.175
Will you regret the decades
you gave to Jehovah? 


47:42.175 --> 47:45.245
Will anything you endured
in Satan’s system


47:45.245 --> 47:48.348
slow you down
from gaining life’s prize? 


47:48.348 --> 47:51.251
Some of our brothers and sisters
can already look back


47:51.252 --> 47:54.254
that far and answer
those questions. 


47:54.253 --> 47:57.023
Sister Alma Miller’s family
learned the truth


47:57.023 --> 47:59.291
when she was ten years old. 


47:59.292 --> 48:01.995
She was baptized in 1937


48:01.995 --> 48:06.633
and is now 107 years old. 


48:06.633 --> 48:10.636
To her, just about everyone
is a young person. 


48:10.637 --> 48:14.742
See the encouraging effect
her loving and faithful example 


48:14.742 --> 48:18.000
has on young ones 
in her congregation.


48:22.983 --> 48:25.218
People often tell me, 


48:25.218 --> 48:27.520
“Why, I never talked to a person 


48:27.520 --> 48:30.223
that was 107 years old.” 


48:30.223 --> 48:32.491
And I tell them, 
“You know what? 


48:32.492 --> 48:34.000
I never did either.”


48:36.597 --> 48:38.599
I would describe Alma 


48:38.598 --> 48:41.000
as probably the most energetic 


48:41.000 --> 48:44.705
100-plus-year-old lady 
that I’ve ever met.


48:44.705 --> 48:46.340
She has, pretty much, 


48:46.340 --> 48:49.610
the whole theocratic history 
in her mind that she carries with her. 


48:49.610 --> 48:51.878
So you can ask her anything 
about the organization, 


48:51.878 --> 48:53.313
and she can be able to tell you about it 


48:53.313 --> 48:56.015
because she’s even met
a lot of those people.


48:56.015 --> 48:59.820
We read about it, but she lived it. 
She’s amazing. 


48:59.820 --> 49:03.000
Even though she’s 107, 
she has an incredible memory.


49:04.758 --> 49:07.660
I go back quite a ways. 


49:07.660 --> 49:10.463
When I was very young, 
ten years old, 


49:10.463 --> 49:15.000
we saw the “Photo-Drama of Creation.” 


49:16.470 --> 49:19.238
And it was just packed with people. 


49:19.238 --> 49:23.143
They were even standing in the back. 


49:23.143 --> 49:27.246
We were so thrilled. 
We never forgot it. 


49:27.247 --> 49:31.000
And we realized 
that we found the truth. 


49:32.252 --> 49:34.822
My father left the church 


49:34.822 --> 49:38.059
and he became 
one of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


49:38.058 --> 49:42.795
and they were called Bible Students 
at that time. 


49:42.795 --> 49:46.567
In the early days, 
we went to special conventions, 


49:46.567 --> 49:49.402
and some places, 
they had a big field 


49:49.402 --> 49:52.905
where they put the cars 
and they set up their tents. 


49:52.905 --> 49:56.075
They even named different streets. 


49:56.075 --> 49:59.000
It was just like a little city. 


50:00.113 --> 50:04.250
I was really thrilled 
to see Brother Rutherford speak 


50:04.250 --> 50:07.000
at the conventions I attended. 


50:08.022 --> 50:12.625
I got married to Harold Miller in 1931. 


50:12.625 --> 50:15.828
That was when the depression 
was going on, 


50:15.828 --> 50:18.331
and times were very difficult. 


50:18.332 --> 50:21.835
Everything was scarce. 


50:21.835 --> 50:24.503
There were no jobs to be had. 


50:24.503 --> 50:26.940
Food was rationed. 


50:26.940 --> 50:29.175
People were really hungry. 


50:29.175 --> 50:32.345
And they moved in any little shack 


50:32.345 --> 50:37.000
that they could just to get by. 


50:38.218 --> 50:40.520
We didn’t have anything. 


50:40.520 --> 50:44.457
And we couldn’t drive the car, 


50:44.457 --> 50:48.062
so we used to have a little white horse


50:48.062 --> 50:51.999
—the name was Lou. 


50:51.998 --> 50:56.503
And we went out witnessing 
with the horse and buggy. 


50:56.503 --> 51:01.000
She took us all over the place, 
far distances.


51:02.242 --> 51:05.412
They would take this buggy, 
and they would go 


51:05.412 --> 51:07.514
20-30 miles in one direction;


51:07.513 --> 51:09.581
20-30 miles the other direction. 


51:09.582 --> 51:11.585
All the hard work that they put forth 


51:11.585 --> 51:15.000
has resulted 
in several congregations in the area.


51:17.523 --> 51:21.260
We used to carry that magazine bag 


51:21.260 --> 51:24.597
when we were witnessing
for awhile there. 


51:24.597 --> 51:27.400
And so we put it
around the horse’s neck, 


51:27.400 --> 51:31.738
so the horse was taking part 
in our witnessing. 


51:31.738 --> 51:34.573
People knew 
who was coming when they saw 


51:34.573 --> 51:38.511
the little white horse
come into their yard. 


51:38.512 --> 51:41.080
Sometimes it was cold, 


51:41.080 --> 51:44.317
and I remember wearing two coats. 


51:44.317 --> 51:46.854
Yeah, it was tiresome, 


51:46.853 --> 51:49.755
but we were young.


51:49.755 --> 51:53.058
They would just go out 
regardless of rain or shine 


51:53.058 --> 51:55.561
or whatever was going on at the time, 
and they didn’t have a car. 


51:55.562 --> 51:57.630
And to me, that’s amazing 
because we get so used to 


51:57.630 --> 51:59.867
the conveniences
—I guess you could call it—


51:59.867 --> 52:01.869
the coffee breaks, 
the cars, and everything. 


52:01.868 --> 52:05.000
It’s like, well, 
if Alma can do it, surely I can do it.


52:06.438 --> 52:09.341
One time,
Harold went out witnessing, 


52:09.342 --> 52:12.479
and 50 years later, 
he talked to the same man. 


52:12.478 --> 52:15.481
He said, “50 years ago, 


52:15.482 --> 52:19.319
“there was a young guy 
that came through here 


52:19.318 --> 52:21.320
“riding on horseback 


52:21.320 --> 52:24.757
and telling people that,” 
he said, 


52:24.757 --> 52:27.327
“I think it’s ‘Armaggigon,’ 


52:27.327 --> 52:29.629
he said was coming soon.” 


52:29.628 --> 52:32.598
And he remembered 
Harold riding horseback 


52:32.598 --> 52:34.901
50 years ago in that territory, 


52:34.902 --> 52:37.000
and he got there again. 


52:38.137 --> 52:41.509
And that happened 
a couple times more. 


52:41.508 --> 52:45.000
So it was a long life of witnessing.


52:49.815 --> 52:52.652
Alma is so zealous for the ministry. 


52:52.652 --> 52:55.655
She does not like not-at-homes. 


52:55.655 --> 52:58.592
She wants to talk to people.


52:58.592 --> 53:00.827
Yeah, I enjoy the ministry. 


53:00.827 --> 53:05.000
I go out as much as I can 
in my old age. 


53:06.365 --> 53:09.602
We want to help the people 
to see the truth. 


53:09.602 --> 53:12.000
There’s no greater joy. 


53:16.175 --> 53:19.278
I try to read the publications, 


53:19.278 --> 53:22.000
so I have a reading machine. 


53:24.183 --> 53:27.020
The letters come right out of the screen, 


53:27.020 --> 53:30.890
and I can study all my lessons. 


53:30.890 --> 53:33.000
I would be lost without it. 


53:34.995 --> 53:38.565
It helps me to keep up 
in present truth.


53:38.565 --> 53:42.000
What does dedication mean? 


53:43.002 --> 53:45.072
Sister Miller, please.


53:45.072 --> 53:47.740
Dedication means that. . .


53:47.740 --> 53:50.410
Some young ones might be concerned 
about what they should do 


53:50.410 --> 53:52.412
with their life, 
what choices they should make. 


53:52.412 --> 53:54.414
Well, here we see an example 
of somebody who has served Jehovah 


53:54.413 --> 53:56.583
for over 100 years. 


53:56.583 --> 53:59.318
And we see that she’s happy 
and has no regrets with her life. 


53:59.318 --> 54:02.000
And that’s an example 
that we want to imitate.


54:03.257 --> 54:06.259
Well, giving my life to Jehovah, 


54:06.258 --> 54:09.000
that’s the best thing 
I could do for myself. 


54:11.230 --> 54:14.833
If I have any advice 
for young ones today, 


54:14.833 --> 54:18.000
I would say 
to keep on in the truth. 


54:19.338 --> 54:23.175
They have a whole world before them 


54:23.175 --> 54:25.345
to serve Jehovah


54:25.345 --> 54:30.000
—something that endures forever.


54:31.117 --> 54:33.354
Wasn’t that encouraging? 


54:33.353 --> 54:36.321
With all the videos we use
in our worship today, 


54:36.322 --> 54:40.494
it’s also interesting that 
Sister Miller’s introduction to the truth


54:40.493 --> 54:43.663
was the “Photo-Drama of Creation.” 


54:43.663 --> 54:47.566
That was a photographic slide 
and motion picture production, 


54:47.567 --> 54:52.339
complete with color and sound,
which first showed in 1914. 


54:52.338 --> 54:56.075
You might enjoy learning more
about that historic presentation


54:56.075 --> 54:58.545
as a personal study project.


54:58.545 --> 55:03.550
Sister Miller has experienced
much in her 107 years. 


55:03.550 --> 55:07.520
She’s endured economic depression,
health problems,


55:07.520 --> 55:11.825
and the loss of family and friends,
including her dear husband. 


55:11.825 --> 55:15.295
But as we saw, 
Jehovah has blessed her


55:15.295 --> 55:18.230
with a spiritual family
in the congregation. 


55:18.230 --> 55:21.600
At the same time,
those interviewed with Sister Miller


55:21.600 --> 55:24.937
are enjoying a close friendship
with someone older.


55:24.937 --> 55:28.074
Even very young ones
are finding friends


55:28.073 --> 55:30.610
among older brothers and sisters. 


55:30.610 --> 55:35.348
David, age nine, wrote this
in his letter to the Governing Body:


55:35.348 --> 55:38.485
“I like to listen to older ones. 


55:38.485 --> 55:41.220
“I just used to have
a circle of friends, 


55:41.220 --> 55:46.225
but now I feel more comfortable
going and talking to older ones.” 


55:46.225 --> 55:48.293
It’s no surprise, then,


55:48.293 --> 55:51.430
that in the latest
Become Jehovah’s Friend video, 


55:51.430 --> 55:54.733
Sophia learns that you’re never 
too young


55:54.733 --> 55:58.000
or too old 
to be someone’s friend.


56:20.260 --> 56:22.362
Sister Elsa,


56:22.362 --> 56:24.397
did you paint these?


56:24.397 --> 56:26.399
I did.


56:26.398 --> 56:27.866
They’re amazing! 


56:27.867 --> 56:29.369
How long
have you been drawing?


56:29.368 --> 56:32.138
As long as I can remember. 


56:32.138 --> 56:34.706
It’s my way
of being able to share


56:34.707 --> 56:36.844
all the stories of my life.


56:36.843 --> 56:39.245
Could you show me?


56:39.245 --> 56:41.447
Yes, of course!


56:41.447 --> 56:44.984
I remember a time when I was young
and in East Germany. 


56:44.983 --> 56:48.688
We weren’t allowed to do our work
as Jehovah’s Witnesses;


56:48.688 --> 56:50.690
we were under ban.


56:50.690 --> 56:54.060
I helped in copying
our Watchtower magazines by hand


56:54.060 --> 56:56.062
and then hiding them in food.


56:56.062 --> 56:57.864
You did?


56:57.863 --> 56:58.831
Yes! 


56:58.832 --> 57:03.235
We’d then send the food
to our brothers who were in prison.


57:03.235 --> 57:06.738
I was also asked to help
in distributing Bible literature


57:06.738 --> 57:10.476
to our congregations 
as an underground messenger.


57:10.477 --> 57:11.477
Wow!


57:11.477 --> 57:15.000
Time passed and then things 
started getting better in Berlin.


57:16.448 --> 57:19.851
Shortly after, 
I immigrated to New York. 


57:19.852 --> 57:23.000
And I met my darling husband.


57:25.192 --> 57:27.694
Wow, that was a great story!


57:27.693 --> 57:29.028
Thank you. 


57:29.028 --> 57:31.763
But I’m sure you have stories. 


57:31.763 --> 57:33.466
What do you like to draw?


57:33.467 --> 57:36.069
Well, actually, here! 


57:36.068 --> 57:39.138
This was the time
when Caleb and I went to the park,


57:39.138 --> 57:41.306
and we met a little girl there.


57:41.307 --> 57:43.744
I’m glad I reached out that day. 


57:43.743 --> 57:48.000
Lasting friends can be of any age
when they love Jehovah.


57:52.718 --> 57:56.788
Elsa and Sophia already share
much in common


57:56.788 --> 57:59.291
and are likely 
to become good friends.


57:59.292 --> 58:01.829
We’re pleased to announce that


58:01.828 --> 58:06.365
this new Become Jehovah’s Friend lesson
is available


58:06.365 --> 58:10.000
on Video on Demand
under the “Children” category.


58:11.437 --> 58:13.940
You parents and family heads


58:13.940 --> 58:18.043
are doing all you can 
to teach your children from infancy


58:18.043 --> 58:21.080
to love Jehovah
and to become his friend. 


58:21.080 --> 58:23.583
As they grow,
you also teach them


58:23.583 --> 58:26.385
how to study and pray
on their own. 


58:26.385 --> 58:30.088
You know they need
these spiritual skills. 


58:30.088 --> 58:34.293
Young ones, remember that
your personal study time


58:34.293 --> 58:37.030
is when you 
can ask Jehovah for help


58:37.030 --> 58:39.765
with what you 
are personally experiencing, 


58:39.765 --> 58:43.803
and that study time 
has other good effects.


58:43.803 --> 58:46.105
As this music video tells us,


58:46.105 --> 58:50.000
“Study Makes You Strong”!


58:55.482 --> 59:01.487
Since we could crawl, 
our family studied it all.


59:01.487 --> 59:07.394
Even though small, 
we understood what we were learning.


59:07.393 --> 59:13.231
Father would read to me 
before I would sleep.


59:13.232 --> 59:19.172
Now I am taller; 
I still keep up with that routine.


59:19.172 --> 59:25.379
And when I’m by myself, 
I take that book down off the shelf.


59:25.378 --> 59:30.048
I remember what the scripture said 
that I would need so I could stand firm.


59:30.048 --> 59:32.051
Study makes you strong,


59:32.052 --> 59:36.889
Just like a tree that’s planted 
by a river stream.


59:36.888 --> 59:38.123
Study makes you strong.


59:38.123 --> 59:42.795
Your leaves just won’t dry out 
and everything succeeds.


59:42.795 --> 59:43.963
Study makes you strong,


59:43.963 --> 59:48.601
Just like a tree that’s planted 
its roots down deep.


59:48.602 --> 59:49.802
Study makes you strong.


59:49.802 --> 59:57.000
You’ll grow so big and tall 
there’s nothing you won’t see.


59:59.812 --> 1:00:05.250
What will I say when a big chance 
comes my way?


1:00:05.250 --> 1:00:11.723
What will my classmates say 
if I don’t follow with them?


1:00:11.723 --> 1:00:17.963
All of the information’s 
here on display.


1:00:17.963 --> 1:00:24.603
I’m not afraid, 
because I learned this as an infant.


1:00:24.603 --> 1:00:29.775
ʹCause when I’m by myself, 
I take that book down off the shelf.


1:00:29.775 --> 1:00:34.513
I remember what the scripture said 
that I would need so I could stand firm.


1:00:34.513 --> 1:00:36.515
Study makes you strong,


1:00:36.515 --> 1:00:41.453
Just like a tree that’s planted 
by a river stream.


1:00:41.453 --> 1:00:42.621
Study makes you strong.


1:00:42.622 --> 1:00:47.360
Your leaves just won’t dry out 
and everything succeeds.


1:00:47.360 --> 1:00:48.527
Study makes you strong,


1:00:48.527 --> 1:00:53.199
Just like a tree that’s planted 
its roots down deep.


1:00:53.198 --> 1:00:54.466
Study makes you strong.


1:00:54.467 --> 1:01:03.000
You’ll grow so big and tall 
there’s nothing you won’t see.


1:01:04.210 --> 1:01:16.355
Every word that’s helping me
Could contain the very key


1:01:16.355 --> 1:01:26.898
To offer just the help 
and encouragement somebody needs.


1:01:26.898 --> 1:01:39.411
Study makes you strong.
Study makes you strong.


1:01:39.412 --> 1:01:51.557
Study makes you strong.
Study makes you strong.


1:01:51.557 --> 1:01:53.059
Study makes you strong,


1:01:53.058 --> 1:01:57.930
Just like a tree that’s planted 
by a river stream.


1:01:57.930 --> 1:01:59.165
Study makes you strong.


1:01:59.165 --> 1:02:03.903
Your leaves just won’t dry out 
and everything succeeds.


1:02:03.903 --> 1:02:05.036
Study makes you strong,


1:02:05.037 --> 1:02:09.942
Just like a tree that’s planted 
its roots down deep.


1:02:09.942 --> 1:02:11.044
Study makes you strong.


1:02:11.043 --> 1:02:20.000
You’ll grow so big and tall 
there’s nothing you won’t see.


1:02:22.455 --> 1:02:25.792
Study does make us strong! 


1:02:25.792 --> 1:02:29.762
As depicted in the music video,
the Bible reading and study habits


1:02:29.762 --> 1:02:32.465
that the young sister 
started with her family


1:02:32.465 --> 1:02:35.200
became her own personal habits. 


1:02:35.200 --> 1:02:39.238
When a challenging situation or opportunity
to give a witness came along, 


1:02:39.238 --> 1:02:44.176
she already knew how to research 
what she needed from the Scriptures. 


1:02:44.177 --> 1:02:47.880
Our prayer is that all of you 
young brothers and sisters


1:02:47.880 --> 1:02:51.383
grow spiritually strong
in the same way 


1:02:51.383 --> 1:02:55.386
and become examples
to faithful ones everywhere.


1:02:55.387 --> 1:02:58.690
That brings us 
to our video postcard


1:02:58.690 --> 1:03:01.093
from faithful brothers and sisters. 


1:03:01.093 --> 1:03:06.000
This month we visit beautiful Austria,
in Central Europe. 


1:03:14.073 --> 1:03:18.978
Brother C.T. Russell
first visited Austria in 1891. 


1:03:18.978 --> 1:03:21.246
He returned in 1911 to plant


1:03:21.247 --> 1:03:25.619
further seeds of Kingdom truth 
in the capital city, Vienna. 


1:03:25.618 --> 1:03:29.455
Today, there are more than 21,000
active publishers


1:03:29.455 --> 1:03:33.058
among the eight million
who live in Austria.


1:03:33.058 --> 1:03:35.861
One of the 301 congregations


1:03:35.862 --> 1:03:39.032
is the German-language congregation
in Uderns. 


1:03:39.032 --> 1:03:44.070
They preach in a territory 
of alpine mountains and valleys. 


1:03:44.070 --> 1:03:48.340
Some farms are as high in elevation
as 1,700 meters,


1:03:48.340 --> 1:03:51.043
or more than 5,500 feet. 


1:03:51.043 --> 1:03:55.548
But difficult terrain does not slow
the Kingdom message. 


1:03:55.548 --> 1:03:57.850
The 48 publishers there 


1:03:57.850 --> 1:04:01.000
recently reported conducting
51 Bible studies.


1:04:02.153 --> 1:04:05.925
We thank them for showing us
another encouraging example


1:04:05.925 --> 1:04:08.627
of the brotherly love that unites


1:04:08.627 --> 1:04:11.000
God’s people worldwide.


1:04:15.535 --> 1:04:18.370
They send us their Christian love
and greetings,


1:04:18.370 --> 1:04:24.000
and we send our love in return,
along with prayers for Jehovah’s favor.


1:04:26.378 --> 1:04:29.048
We thank you for joining us,


1:04:29.048 --> 1:04:32.518
and we look forward 
to an encouraging program next month. 


1:04:32.518 --> 1:04:34.553
From Brooklyn, New York,


1:04:34.553 --> 1:04:48.885
this is JW Broadcasting!
