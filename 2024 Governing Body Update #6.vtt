00:00:02.189 --> 00:00:04.608 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome, brothers and sisters!

00:00:05.317 --> 00:00:07.027 line:10% position:50% align:center
Since our last report,

00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:10.197 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’ve had seven more special conventions.

00:00:10.614 --> 00:00:13.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were held
in Philadelphia, United States;

00:00:13.993 --> 00:00:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sofia, Bulgaria;

00:00:16.495 --> 00:00:18.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suva, Fiji;

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lyon, France;

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:24.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asunción, Paraguay;

00:00:24.712 --> 00:00:26.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tampa, United States;

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:29.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.

00:00:30.593 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 16,000 delegates

00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:36.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveled from 101 countries

00:00:36.348 --> 00:00:38.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend these conventions.

00:00:38.893 --> 00:00:40.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a combined peak attendance

00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:42.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
of over 98,000.

00:00:43.188 --> 00:00:46.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
And 859 were baptized.

00:00:47.276 --> 00:00:52.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Paraguay, there are currently
about 11,500 publishers.

00:00:52.573 --> 00:00:54.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nearly 2,000 delegates

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:56.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
were invited
to attend the special convention.

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remarkably, though,
the peak attendance

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
was 28,617!

00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:07.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, there’s much potential for growth.

00:01:07.004 --> 00:01:09.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:12.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
293 were baptized
at this convention alone!

00:01:12.927 --> 00:01:16.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the largest baptism
at one location in the history 

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:18.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our work in Paraguay.

00:01:19.308 --> 00:01:22.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has truly blessed
these special conventions.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two more remain for 2024,

00:01:26.148 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we look forward
to 19 special conventions

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the 2025 series.

00:01:33.656 --> 00:01:35.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a brief legal update.

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:39.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
On September 17, 2024,

00:01:39.203 --> 00:01:41.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
the 17 judges

00:01:41.121 --> 00:01:44.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Grand Chamber
of the European Court of Human Rights

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:47.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
ruled in favor of Sister Pindo Mulla,

00:01:47.878 --> 00:01:51.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was given blood transfusions in Spain
against her wishes.

00:01:52.841 --> 00:01:57.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite our sister’s clear
oral and written refusal,

00:01:57.054 --> 00:02:00.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
a judge in Spain
allowed doctors to proceed.

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:05.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Grand Chamber concluded
that this violated her rights.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:10.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
It confirmed that patients
have the fundamental right

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:12.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
to choose their own medical care.

00:02:13.195 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
What makes this decision
especially significant

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:20.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that it was issued by the Grand Chamber
of the European Court of Human Rights.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Grand Chamber issues decisions

00:02:23.914 --> 00:02:26.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
only when a case
is considered to be groundbreaking.

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:32.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, this decision
obligates 46 countries in Europe

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
to respect patients’ health-care choices.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re grateful
to the Grand Chamber for this decision.

00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:44.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Above all, we thank Jehovah
for this legal victory,

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will benefit
all of our brothers and sisters in Europe

00:02:47.146 --> 00:02:50.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they make
informed medical decisions.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:55.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
This significant ruling
reminds us how vital it is

00:02:55.237 --> 00:02:58.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discuss our personal medical choices
with our doctor

00:02:58.907 --> 00:03:02.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to put these choices in writing,
just as our faithful sister did.

00:03:03.954 --> 00:03:07.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
During this month, September 2024,

00:03:07.374 --> 00:03:11.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve all been involved
in a global campaign to start Bible studies

00:03:11.378 --> 00:03:13.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
using the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  brochure.

00:03:14.715 --> 00:03:19.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a joy to be united
with our brothers and sisters worldwide

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this campaign!

00:03:21.722 --> 00:03:23.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note a couple of experiences.

00:03:24.725 --> 00:03:29.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hannelore is an 84-year-old
pioneer sister in Austria.

00:03:29.938 --> 00:03:32.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of her health,
she can’t preach from door to door

00:03:32.524 --> 00:03:34.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
for long periods of time.

00:03:35.152 --> 00:03:37.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, she decided
to offer a Bible course

00:03:37.863 --> 00:03:41.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
to people who had responded positively
to her visits before.

00:03:42.785 --> 00:03:45.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
She thought of six people
and visited them.

00:03:45.537 --> 00:03:48.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was very happy
to demonstrate the Bible course

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:50.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all six people.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result?

00:03:51.877 --> 00:03:55.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
All six agreed to continue
the course in the coming days.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:00.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Philippines,
while witnessing from house to house,

00:04:00.052 --> 00:04:02.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
two publishers
approached a woman named Josie

00:04:02.596 --> 00:04:04.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was doing laundry
in front of her apartment.

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:09.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Josie was busy,
she told the publishers to talk instead

00:04:09.812 --> 00:04:12.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
to her adult son and nephew
who were inside.

00:04:12.898 --> 00:04:16.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Using the direct approach, the publishers
started a Bible study right away

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:19.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
with both the son and the nephew.

00:04:20.614 --> 00:04:23.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the Bible study was being demonstrated,

00:04:23.617 --> 00:04:27.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Josie’s niece also joined in the discussion

00:04:27.204 --> 00:04:29.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the publishers
offered her a Bible study,

00:04:29.206 --> 00:04:31.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
which she readily accepted.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now with three persons
involved in the initial Bible study session,

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Josie became more curious

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:41.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also wanted
to join in the conversation.

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:44.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
Josie too accepted a Bible study.

00:04:44.805 --> 00:04:48.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, before the two publishers
ended the initial study session,

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:52.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
a fifth family member, Josie’s daughter,

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:54.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
was moved to ask
what they were discussing.

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:58.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Taking advantage
of yet another opportunity,

00:04:58.277 --> 00:05:02.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
the publishers offered her a Bible study,
which she immediately accepted.

00:05:02.406 --> 00:05:06.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
In all, five family members
from one household

00:05:06.285 --> 00:05:10.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
accepted the offer to have a Bible study
using the direct approach.

00:05:11.623 --> 00:05:15.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Jehovah has blessed our efforts

00:05:15.502 --> 00:05:18.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer Bible studies during the campaign.

00:05:19.298 --> 00:05:22.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we want to continue
to focus on starting Bible studies.

00:05:23.302 --> 00:05:25.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:05:25.095 --> 00:05:27.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t lose the momentum
of this campaign!

00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:29.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ride the wave of enthusiasm.

00:05:29.474 --> 00:05:33.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to offer Bible studies
at every appropriate opportunity.

00:05:34.855 --> 00:05:36.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us to do so?

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:42.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although public witnessing
is an important aspect of our ministry

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:44.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Bible studies sometimes result,

00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:48.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
we encourage all to share regularly
in the house-to-house work.

00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:51.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember, we will have better results

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:54.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we call at times
when people are more likely to be home.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:59.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
This gives us more opportunities
to start conversations

00:05:59.254 --> 00:06:01.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
that lead to Bible studies.

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:05.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not try the direct approach
when it seems appropriate?

00:06:06.595 --> 00:06:08.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
While sharing in the ministry one evening,

00:06:08.931 --> 00:06:12.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
a brother in Germany spoke with a man
who is about 35 years old.

00:06:13.477 --> 00:06:15.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brother asked him,

00:06:15.437 --> 00:06:18.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When did you last read the Bible?”

00:06:19.149 --> 00:06:21.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man replied, “This morning.”

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:25.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
They talked about
why the Bible is valuable,

00:06:25.447 --> 00:06:28.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
using Micah 4:3, 4 as an example.

00:06:29.076 --> 00:06:32.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, they discussed lesson 01
of the <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i> brochure.

00:06:33.497 --> 00:06:37.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man’s children were present
and read the Bible verses aloud.

00:06:38.168 --> 00:06:41.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man agreed to start the Bible course.

00:06:41.713 --> 00:06:43.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition, many have started studies

00:06:43.715 --> 00:06:46.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
by witnessing informally to relatives,

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:49.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
neighbors, coworkers,
shopkeepers, and so forth.

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:52.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Tanzania, a sister named Elizabeth

00:06:52.557 --> 00:06:56.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
started four new studies
during the first days of the campaign.

00:06:57.062 --> 00:06:59.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
One was with a woman
who has a small café

00:06:59.314 --> 00:07:01.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
across the street from the Kingdom Hall.

00:07:02.067 --> 00:07:05.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elizabeth frequently stopped
in her shop for tea

00:07:05.028 --> 00:07:07.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
or to purchase small items,

00:07:07.155 --> 00:07:10.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she decided to offer her a study
using the direct approach.

00:07:11.785 --> 00:07:14.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
They watched the video
<i>Welcome to Your Bible Study,</i>

00:07:14.413 --> 00:07:16.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the woman was delighted.

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “We should start right now!”

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:22.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
She also included
her daughter and her niece

00:07:22.254 --> 00:07:24.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the demonstration of the study.

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:26.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elizabeth was so pleased

00:07:26.508 --> 00:07:29.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she also attended
a congregation meeting.

00:07:30.762 --> 00:07:34.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
When asked what she thought of the meeting,
the woman said:

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:37.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That’s what I love
about Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:07:37.269 --> 00:07:39.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They study the Bible.

00:07:39.855 --> 00:07:43.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I go to other churches,
they just sing and preach

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:45.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but don’t study the Bible.

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:47.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I really loved it.

00:07:47.112 --> 00:07:49.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will try to come regularly.”

00:07:49.781 --> 00:07:53.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy to hear
these positive experiences.

00:07:53.744 --> 00:07:56.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our time in the ministry is valuable,

00:07:56.663 --> 00:07:58.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to use it wisely.

00:07:59.916 --> 00:08:02.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
As 1 Corinthians 9:26 says:

00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:06.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, the way I am running
is not aimlessly;

00:08:06.048 --> 00:08:10.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
the way I am aiming my blows
is so as not to be striking the air.”

00:08:11.136 --> 00:08:14.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love to give Jehovah our best.

00:08:15.766 --> 00:08:18.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to having
a regular share in the house-to-house work,

00:08:18.769 --> 00:08:20.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
what else can help us?

00:08:22.272 --> 00:08:25.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some areas,
publishers have many return visits.

00:08:26.943 --> 00:08:29.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
But perhaps
we need to consider prayerfully

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:31.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
if our return visits are productive.

00:08:33.325 --> 00:08:36.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are such individuals growing
in their love of the truth?

00:08:37.454 --> 00:08:39.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do they truly appreciate our visits?

00:08:41.124 --> 00:08:43.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they interested in a Bible study?

00:08:44.336 --> 00:08:47.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
If not, perhaps we are “striking the air.”

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might be best to redirect our efforts.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:55.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those individuals will have
another opportunity to hear the good news

00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:57.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the territory is worked again.

00:08:57.933 --> 00:09:02.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, balance, patience,
and discernment are needed.

00:09:03.563 --> 00:09:07.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we want to be sure
we are making the best use of our time.

00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:10.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, we might ask ourselves,

00:09:10.445 --> 00:09:13.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Are my Bible students making progress?’

00:09:15.158 --> 00:09:16.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayerfully consider:

00:09:17.619 --> 00:09:20.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they accepting Bible truths?

00:09:21.623 --> 00:09:23.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they beginning
to apply what they learn

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:25.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to make changes where needed?

00:09:27.003 --> 00:09:29.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have they begun to attend
congregation meetings?

00:09:30.424 --> 00:09:33.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they speaking with others
about what they learn?

00:09:34.302 --> 00:09:37.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they are not progressing, it would be best
to spend our time and energy

00:09:37.931 --> 00:09:42.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeking out those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

00:09:43.353 --> 00:09:47.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
So brothers and sisters,
let’s continue to offer Bible studies

00:09:47.149 --> 00:09:49.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
at every opportunity!

00:09:50.485 --> 00:09:52.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
In many places around the world,

00:09:52.487 --> 00:09:55.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re seeing an increase of Bible studies

00:09:55.449 --> 00:09:57.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tremendous growth.

00:09:58.285 --> 00:10:00.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, at a recent convention
in Madagascar

00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:04.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
with over 21,000 in attendance,

00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:07.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
419 were baptized.

00:10:08.712 --> 00:10:13.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, the Philippines reports
that during the 2024 service year,

00:10:13.175 --> 00:10:15.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
they had 5 percent growth.

00:10:16.386 --> 00:10:18.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s been the result?

00:10:18.722 --> 00:10:23.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the first time, they reported
more than 260,000 publishers.

00:10:23.768 --> 00:10:27.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
The number of studies
has grown to over 252,000,

00:10:27.814 --> 00:10:32.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 12,201 were baptized
during the service year;

00:10:33.278 --> 00:10:37.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
120 new congregations
and 15 new circuits were formed!

00:10:37.115 --> 00:10:39.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazing!

00:10:40.035 --> 00:10:42.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wherever you may live,

00:10:42.245 --> 00:10:46.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
we think of Jesus’ words at John 4:35:

00:10:48.251 --> 00:10:51.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Lift up your eyes and view the fields,

00:10:51.004 --> 00:10:53.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they are white for harvesting.”

00:10:54.382 --> 00:10:56.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, Jesus said to his disciples

00:10:56.426 --> 00:10:59.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 9:37, 38:

00:11:00.597 --> 00:11:04.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yes, the harvest is great,

00:11:04.601 --> 00:11:06.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the workers are few.

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:09.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore,
beg the Master of the harvest

00:11:09.856 --> 00:11:12.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
to send out workers into his harvest.”

00:11:13.276 --> 00:11:16.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fields are certainly
“white for harvesting”

00:11:16.196 --> 00:11:18.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
in many places around the world.

00:11:19.157 --> 00:11:21.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, that raises the question,

00:11:21.993 --> 00:11:24.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we
individually expand our share

00:11:24.955 --> 00:11:26.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the preaching and teaching work?

00:11:27.832 --> 00:11:30.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, we each
have different circumstances.

00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:34.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
But could you look
for opportunities to serve

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:36.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
as an auxiliary pioneer?

00:11:38.218 --> 00:11:40.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you reach out
and become a regular pioneer?

00:11:41.346 --> 00:11:44.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re already pioneering, could you serve
where there is a greater need,

00:11:44.766 --> 00:11:46.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even in another land?

00:11:48.353 --> 00:11:50.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you considered applying to attend

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers?

00:11:54.734 --> 00:11:57.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some graduates of that school
are used as temporary special pioneers,

00:11:57.988 --> 00:12:00.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
special pioneers,

00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:02.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
circuit overseers, and missionaries.

00:12:03.451 --> 00:12:08.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, there are so many opportunities
to reach out in Jehovah’s service

00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:11.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to our own
individual circumstances.

00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:14.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book <i>Organized to Do Jehovah’s Will</i>,
chapter 10,

00:12:14.713 --> 00:12:18.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
discusses many ways
we can expand our ministry.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:22.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we test Jehovah out in this way,

00:12:22.387 --> 00:12:24.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be certain of his blessing.

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:28.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we discussed?

00:12:28.977 --> 00:12:32.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep the momentum
of our special campaign going.

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:36.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to offer Bible studies
at every opportunity.

00:12:37.986 --> 00:12:41.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also discussed
the thrilling increases we’re seeing

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:43.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
in many parts of the world.

00:12:44.451 --> 00:12:46.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all continue to pray

00:12:46.494 --> 00:12:50.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘the Master sends out
more workers into the harvest.’

00:12:50.874 --> 00:12:53.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
And may we continue to do our personal best

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:56.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach and teach
“the good news of the Kingdom.”

00:12:57.714 --> 00:13:00.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be assured that we cherish

00:13:00.508 --> 00:13:03.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
each and every one of you
dear brothers and sisters.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:07.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:09.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.
