When I say the words “holy” and “holiness,”

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:06.723 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what comes to your mind?

00:00:06.723 --> 00:00:10.427 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many think of words like “clean” and “pure.”

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s change the question a little.

00:00:12.896 --> 00:00:15.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who comes to your mind?

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:18.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely, you think of Jehovah.

00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:21.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might also picture
Jesus Christ and the holy angels.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:25.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you think of imperfect humans?

00:00:25.608 --> 00:00:28.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can humans be described as holy?

00:00:28.211 --> 00:00:30.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:34.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know this because humans
were created in God’s image.

00:00:34.217 --> 00:00:36.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as we can reflect godly qualities

00:00:36.886 --> 00:00:39.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—such as love, kindness, and self-control—

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:42.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can reflect holiness.

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:46.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How seriously should we take holiness?

00:00:46.396 --> 00:00:48.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no small matter.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:52.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, the world around us
is increasing in badness.

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second Timothy 3:13 warns

00:00:56.206 --> 00:00:59.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that ‘wicked men
would advance from bad to worse.’

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:02.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Undoubtedly, before the end,

00:01:02.011 --> 00:01:05.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan’s efforts
to promote wickedness will intensify.

00:01:05.782 --> 00:01:09.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we must intensify our efforts

00:01:09.419 --> 00:01:13.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be holy and reject all badness.

00:01:13.823 --> 00:01:18.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who do you think are Satan’s primary targets?

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:20.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are.

00:01:20.497 --> 00:01:24.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and the demons are
like a pack of hungry lions

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking to devour us.

00:01:26.503 --> 00:01:28.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being a publisher of the good news

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:32.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a privilege that Satan seeks to attack.

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:36.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you a parent with children?

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think Satan
wants you to become unclean?

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:01:42.085 --> 00:01:44.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows that devouring a family head

00:01:44.754 --> 00:01:47.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could weaken an entire family.

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:49.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the congregation,

00:01:49.425 --> 00:01:52.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan would love to devour
you dear pioneers,

00:01:52.562 --> 00:01:55.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ministerial servants, and elders.

00:01:55.398 --> 00:01:59.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you in the circuit work?
a missionary? a Bethelite?

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a sacred privilege!

00:02:02.605 --> 00:02:07.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But remember, it also means
that we have a big target on our back.

00:02:07.544 --> 00:02:09.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan and the demons would love

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:13.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to penetrate our clean and holy position.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doing so could impact
the Kingdom work

00:02:16.452 --> 00:02:18.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or stumble others.

00:02:18.521 --> 00:02:22.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we can’t be complacent.

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:24.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must intensify our efforts

00:02:24.794 --> 00:02:27.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reject all badness.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thus, holiness is a vital topic!

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To that end,
the theme for this month’s program

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:39.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is “Perfecting Holiness in the Fear of God.”

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s based on 2 Corinthians 7:1.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To begin, we need to better understand

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Source of holiness, Jehovah God.

00:02:51.354 --> 00:02:54.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As we read the Bible, we see that holiness

00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:59.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is an important quality
that Jehovah wants us to know about him.

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:01.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible contains many verses

00:03:01.798 --> 00:03:06.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that associate God’s name
with the words “holy” and “holiness.”

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:08.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please open your copy of the Bible

00:03:08.738 --> 00:03:12.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to one example in Isaiah chapter 6.

00:03:12.508 --> 00:03:16.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll start at Isaiah 6:1.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now imagine that you’re the prophet Isaiah,

00:03:21.017 --> 00:03:23.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who received a divine vision.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What would you have seen and heard?

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read verses 1 to 3:

00:03:29.926 --> 00:03:33.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the year that King Uzziah died,

00:03:33.396 --> 00:03:38.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I saw Jehovah sitting
on a lofty and elevated throne,

00:03:38.401 --> 00:03:41.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the skirts
of his robe filled the temple.

00:03:41.537 --> 00:03:44.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Seraphs were standing above him;

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“each had six wings.

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:50.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Each covered his face with two
and covered his feet with two,

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and each of them would fly about with two.

00:03:53.716 --> 00:03:56.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And one called to the other:

00:03:56.152 --> 00:04:00.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Holy, holy, holy is Jehovah of armies.

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:03.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole earth is filled with his glory.’”

00:04:04.427 --> 00:04:07.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah was likely filled with awe.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 2 indicates that he saw seraphs,

00:04:11.034 --> 00:04:14.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spirit creatures evidently of very high rank.

00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:17.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do we learn from their song?

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:21.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their repeating the word “holy” three times

00:04:21.177 --> 00:04:25.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
teaches us that Jehovah
is holy to the superlative degree.

00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:29.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one else is as holy as he is.

00:04:29.652 --> 00:04:33.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what exactly is holiness?

00:04:33.122 --> 00:04:35.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to be holy?

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:37.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s dig deeper.

00:04:37.427 --> 00:04:39.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can do so with a helpful tool found

00:04:39.996 --> 00:04:42.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the revised <i>New World Translation. </i>

00:04:42.565 --> 00:04:45.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you don’t have
the revised edition in your language,

00:04:45.668 --> 00:04:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll share the key point in just a moment.

00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:50.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the revised printed edition,

00:04:50.707 --> 00:04:55.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the glossary is located
several pages after Revelation

00:04:55.445 --> 00:04:58.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and immediately after
the “Bible Words Index.”

00:04:58.715 --> 00:05:01.751 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The topics are arranged alphabetically.

00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:06.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please find the entry
for “Holy; Holiness.”

00:05:06.422 --> 00:05:09.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are using <i>JW Library®, </i>

00:05:09.826 --> 00:05:13.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
here are two ways to get to the glossary.

00:05:13.262 --> 00:05:16.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the app, go to the Bible.

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:18.468 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then at the top of the screen,

00:05:18.468 --> 00:05:21.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tap on the magnifying glass
to start a search.

00:05:21.771 --> 00:05:24.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then type in the word “holy.”

00:05:24.607 --> 00:05:27.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon you’ll see an entry from the glossary.

00:05:27.377 --> 00:05:29.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tap on that.

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:32.081 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Another way is to go to Publications

00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:34.117 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and then Books.

00:05:34.117 --> 00:05:38.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From there you can open the glossary
and find the entry for “holy.”

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:40.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ready?

00:05:40.623 --> 00:05:42.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read it:

00:05:42.625 --> 00:05:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A quality possessed inherently by Jehovah;

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a state of absolute
moral purity and sacredness.

00:05:52.035 --> 00:05:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When referring to humans, animals, things,

00:05:55.805 --> 00:05:58.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“places, time periods, and activities,

00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:01.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the original Hebrew word conveys the thought

00:06:01.144 --> 00:06:03.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of separateness, exclusiveness,

00:06:03.713 --> 00:06:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or sanctification to the holy God;

00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:10.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a state of being set aside
for Jehovah’s service.

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:13.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:06:13.322 --> 00:06:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the words rendered ‘holy’ and ‘holiness’

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“likewise denote separation to God.

00:06:19.328 --> 00:06:22.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The words are also used to refer

00:06:22.265 --> 00:06:27.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to purity in one’s personal conduct.”

00:06:28.037 --> 00:06:29.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did we learn?

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:32.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’re reminded that Jehovah is pure

00:06:32.775 --> 00:06:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the absolute sense.

00:06:34.777 --> 00:06:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean that holiness

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:40.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a quality that he possesses inherently?

00:06:40.316 --> 00:06:42.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s illustrate.

00:06:42.351 --> 00:06:46.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider the words “human” and “imperfect.”

00:06:46.722 --> 00:06:50.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, those two words naturally go together.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:52.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imperfection is within all of us

00:06:52.995 --> 00:06:55.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and affects everything we do.

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:58.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now consider another set of words

00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:01.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that consistently go together:

00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:05.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah” and “holy.”

00:07:05.041 --> 00:07:07.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Holiness permeates Jehovah.

00:07:07.944 --> 00:07:11.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He doesn’t have to perfect
holiness like we do.

00:07:11.581 --> 00:07:15.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything about him
is inherently clean,

00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:17.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pure, and upright.

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:22.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a contrast
Jehovah’s holiness is to the world around us!

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:24.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, virtually everything

00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:27.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about human society alienated from God

00:07:27.997 --> 00:07:29.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is polluted in some way,

00:07:29.999 --> 00:07:34.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either by inherited imperfection
or by outright wickedness.

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:39.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah
is completely removed from sinfulness.

00:07:39.308 --> 00:07:41.944 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll never be polluted by badness.

00:07:41.944 --> 00:07:45.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll never turn corrupt,
immoral, or abusive.

00:07:45.948 --> 00:07:49.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he’s absolutely holy,

00:07:49.986 --> 00:07:52.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’s completely reliable.

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:57.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This means that Jehovah is the ideal Father.

00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:01.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How encouraging and reassuring!

00:08:01.264 --> 00:08:05.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s holiness is beautiful.

00:08:05.168 --> 00:08:07.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think about the physical world.

00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:11.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do you feel about beautiful things?

00:08:11.174 --> 00:08:15.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you drawn to them or repelled by them?

00:08:15.178 --> 00:08:18.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, look at these landscapes.

00:08:18.748 --> 00:08:21.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do they make you feel?

00:08:21.217 --> 00:08:24.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to spend time here?

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you see yourself walking here,

00:08:26.923 --> 00:08:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
filling your lungs with clean, fresh air?

00:08:30.693 --> 00:08:32.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or how about drinking

00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from a river of pure, crystal-clear water?

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:40.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How we yearn to live in such conditions!

00:08:40.703 --> 00:08:42.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we will!

00:08:42.738 --> 00:08:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But have you ever wondered what it is

00:08:45.441 --> 00:08:48.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about these images that’s so appealing?

00:08:48.344 --> 00:08:52.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Simply put, everything is pure and clean.

00:08:52.915 --> 00:08:56.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand, if these same locations

00:08:56.619 --> 00:09:00.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were filled with garbage, graffiti, and smog,

00:09:00.823 --> 00:09:03.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would you still want to be there?

00:09:03.526 --> 00:09:05.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likely not.

00:09:05.661 --> 00:09:09.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pollution and filth are not attractive.

00:09:09.232 --> 00:09:11.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the point?

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:14.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re naturally drawn to beauty.

00:09:14.904 --> 00:09:19.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Beauty is associated with things
that are clean, pure, and bright.

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:22.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how Jehovah

00:09:22.945 --> 00:09:26.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wants us to view his holiness.

00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:30.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Meditating on this aspect
of God’s personality

00:09:30.086 --> 00:09:33.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
draws us closer to him.

00:09:33.356 --> 00:09:35.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And though he hates all sin,

00:09:35.925 --> 00:09:40.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his Word confirms that he doesn’t hate us.

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:42.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this stirs within us

00:09:42.665 --> 00:09:46.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a desire to perfect holiness.

00:09:47.703 --> 00:09:52.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now open to 2 Corinthians 7:1,

00:09:52.108 --> 00:09:54.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our theme scripture.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:57.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though Paul wrote this to one congregation,

00:09:57.179 --> 00:09:59.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah preserved it for us.

00:09:59.482 --> 00:10:01.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says:

00:10:01.517 --> 00:10:04.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, since we have these promises,

00:10:04.553 --> 00:10:08.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“beloved ones, let us cleanse ourselves

00:10:08.991 --> 00:10:12.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of every defilement of flesh and spirit,

00:10:12.995 --> 00:10:17.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
perfecting holiness in the fear of God.”

00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:22.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The concluding part of the verse
serves as the basis for our theme.

00:10:22.571 --> 00:10:26.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it mean to perfect something?

00:10:26.442 --> 00:10:28.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to one dictionary,

00:10:28.711 --> 00:10:33.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “perfect” means
“to bring to a state of supreme excellence,”

00:10:33.182 --> 00:10:37.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “rid of faults,” to “improve” or “refine.”

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:41.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As an example, perhaps you enjoy a hobby

00:10:41.791 --> 00:10:46.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like drawing, taking photographs,
or playing an instrument.

00:10:46.228 --> 00:10:49.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If an expert in that field told you

00:10:49.265 --> 00:10:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that you should <i>perfec</i><i>t </i> your talent,

00:10:52.268 --> 00:10:54.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would he mean?

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:58.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, he’s confirming
that you have some experience already.

00:10:58.974 --> 00:11:01.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, he’s telling you:

00:11:01.777 --> 00:11:05.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have what it takes
to be even better in the future.

00:11:05.715 --> 00:11:09.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can see your potential!”

00:11:09.285 --> 00:11:13.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, perfecting a hobby takes time.

00:11:13.022 --> 00:11:15.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true of our holiness.

00:11:15.858 --> 00:11:19.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book
<i>Word Pictures in the New Testament</i><i> </i><i> </i>notes

00:11:19.662 --> 00:11:22.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the word “perfecting”

00:11:22.164 --> 00:11:24.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 2 Corinthians 7:1

00:11:24.967 --> 00:11:29.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
means “not a sudden attainment
of complete holiness,

00:11:29.138 --> 00:11:32.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but a continuous process.”

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:36.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Jehovah, the expert in holiness

00:11:36.645 --> 00:11:40.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our best Friend, is appealing to us.

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, he’s saying:

00:11:42.852 --> 00:11:46.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I see your potential!

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘You have what it takes
to make progress in holiness.

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:53.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep working to perfect it!’

00:11:53.863 --> 00:11:57.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does such an appeal touch your heart?

00:11:57.433 --> 00:11:59.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We could ask ourselves,

00:11:59.602 --> 00:12:04.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is there an area in my life
where I can refine my holiness?’

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, consider the matter
of physical cleanness.

00:12:09.445 --> 00:12:13.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chapter 8 of the book
<i>How to Remain in God’s Love </i>

00:12:13.382 --> 00:12:16.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discusses the need to glorify Jehovah

00:12:16.452 --> 00:12:18.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by keeping our body and clothing,

00:12:18.854 --> 00:12:23.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our home and surroundings,
and our place of worship clean.

00:12:23.392 --> 00:12:28.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being physically clean
benefits us and those around us.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:32.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More important, it honors our Holy Father.

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:38.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But our personal cleaning program
must go below the surface.

00:12:38.274 --> 00:12:41.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In our theme text, Jehovah urges us

00:12:41.343 --> 00:12:45.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “cleanse ourselves
of every defilement of flesh and spirit.”

00:12:45.915 --> 00:12:49.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This involves every aspect of our lives.

00:12:49.785 --> 00:12:52.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, something we read in the Bible

00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:55.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that we hear at a meeting may warn us

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our thoughts need further refinement.

00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:02.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps we detect
a tendency toward materialism.

00:13:02.832 --> 00:13:05.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or we realize that our precious time

00:13:05.367 --> 00:13:08.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is being consumed by social media,

00:13:08.103 --> 00:13:11.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
surfing the Internet, or playing video games.

00:13:11.974 --> 00:13:16.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Ephesians 4:23, 24, we’re urged

00:13:16.178 --> 00:13:20.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “continue to be made new
in [our] dominant mental attitude”

00:13:20.549 --> 00:13:24.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to “put on the new personality.”

00:13:24.220 --> 00:13:26.288 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So our challenge might be

00:13:26.288 --> 00:13:30.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a deeply ingrained,
negative personality trait.

00:13:30.693 --> 00:13:34.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A sister named Cristina admitted:

00:13:34.063 --> 00:13:38.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I often find myself
looking enviously at others.

00:13:38.167 --> 00:13:42.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I compare what they have
with what I don’t have.”

00:13:42.438 --> 00:13:46.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these are just a few examples.

00:13:46.242 --> 00:13:49.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And these may not be our weaknesses,

00:13:49.945 --> 00:13:52.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the lesson is clear:

00:13:52.047 --> 00:13:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of us need to keep examining ourselves.

00:13:55.618 --> 00:13:57.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, brothers and sisters,

00:13:57.653 --> 00:14:01.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we identify a personal weakness,

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:03.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what should we do?

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:05.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For illustration purposes,

00:14:05.661 --> 00:14:10.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s use the example
of Cristina and her battle with envy.

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A three-step program

00:14:12.835 --> 00:14:16.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to change our dominant mental attitude

00:14:16.906 --> 00:14:20.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was published on page 11 of the June 2019

00:14:20.543 --> 00:14:22.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
study edition of <i>The Watchtower. </i>

00:14:22.978 --> 00:14:26.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the first thing Cristina should do?

00:14:26.348 --> 00:14:30.553 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Step 1: She needs to talk to Jehovah,

00:14:30.553 --> 00:14:32.588 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
admitting that she recognizes

00:14:32.588 --> 00:14:34.623 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the need to change.

00:14:34.623 --> 00:14:36.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If she prays regularly

00:14:36.759 --> 00:14:40.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for Jehovah
to “put within [her] a new spirit,”

00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:42.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our holy God will help her.

00:14:42.731 --> 00:14:46.435 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Step 2: She needs to meditate

00:14:46.435 --> 00:14:48.470 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so as to examine herself

00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:50.506 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the mirror of God’s Word.

00:14:50.506 --> 00:14:53.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, she might think deeply

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:57.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the fact that “love is not jealous”

00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “does not look for its own interests.”

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:04.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would help Cristina to hate envy.

00:15:04.053 --> 00:15:06.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Step 3:

00:15:06.188 --> 00:15:09.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She needs to assess her relationships

00:15:09.358 --> 00:15:12.161 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and choose good association.

00:15:12.161 --> 00:15:15.030 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Could it be that negative gossip,

00:15:15.030 --> 00:15:17.666 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
either in person or online,

00:15:17.666 --> 00:15:20.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is shaping her thinking?

00:15:20.002 --> 00:15:24.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

Yes, Jehovah’s blessing
upon Cristina’s personal efforts

00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:33.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will enable her to perfect holiness.

00:15:33.248 --> 00:15:37.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These three steps can help us do the same.

00:15:39.054 --> 00:15:42.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s now review our key points.

00:15:42.391 --> 00:15:47.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, wickedness
is going “from bad to worse,”

00:15:47.196 --> 00:15:52.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we need to intensify
our efforts to be holy.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:57.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, since Jehovah
is the Source of holiness,

00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:01.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everything about him
is clean, pure, and upright.

00:16:01.577 --> 00:16:04.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This beautiful quality draws us to him

00:16:04.947 --> 00:16:08.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and moves us to be holy.

00:16:08.183 --> 00:16:10.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third and most important,

00:16:10.753 --> 00:16:13.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah appeals to us

00:16:13.789 --> 00:16:18.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “cleanse ourselves
of every defilement of flesh and spirit.”

00:16:18.727 --> 00:16:22.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we accept Jehovah’s help

00:16:22.297 --> 00:16:26.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and work to perfect holiness in God’s fear.
