00:00:01.272 --> 00:00:02.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:09.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll meet a brother who overcame
a troubled and violent childhood

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
and found genuine love and peace
among Jehovah’s people.

00:00:13.784 --> 00:00:17.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn how couples can make
good decisions and work together,

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:20.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when they don’t see eye to eye.

00:00:21.959 --> 00:00:25.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our music video
will remind us of why it’s important

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:30.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stop and reflect on every precious minute
we have with our loved ones.

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to this month’s edition
of JW Broadcasting.®

00:00:55.242 --> 00:00:57.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know what the future holds.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:02.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible prophecy clearly indicates
that we are living in “the last days.”

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:03.918 line:10% position:50% align:center
We understand what events

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.377 line:10% position:50% align:center
will lead to Armageddon

00:01:05.377 --> 00:01:07.796 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the arrival of God’s new world.

00:01:08.797 --> 00:01:12.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we do not know the exact events

00:01:12.217 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ll experience personally.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you might wonder:

00:01:18.432 --> 00:01:20.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will I experience a natural disaster?

00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And if so, what kind of disaster?

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:27.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How will persecution affect me?

00:01:27.524 --> 00:01:29.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will I end up in prison?

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I get older, who will care for me?’

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:37.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever asked yourself
similar questions?

00:01:37.993 --> 00:01:42.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has this uncertainty
made you anxious or fearful?

00:01:44.124 --> 00:01:47.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such feelings can make it hard
to think clearly.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
But these feelings can go away

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we realize that we are well-prepared.

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:56.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you remember the feature drama
from the 2023 convention,

00:02:01.308 --> 00:02:04.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Commit Your Way to Jehovah”?</i>

00:02:04.228 --> 00:02:08.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
It illustrated how following
the organization’s direction

00:02:08.607 --> 00:02:12.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
saved lives during times of political unrest.

00:02:15.072 --> 00:02:18.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is there anything else we can do

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be fully equipped for tomorrow?

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely.

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:27.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
we are preparing ourselves every day.

00:02:27.668 --> 00:02:29.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s review what we’re already doing

00:02:29.878 --> 00:02:34.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
and why we really have no reason
to be fearful or anxious.

00:02:36.927 --> 00:02:38.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
The apostle Peter wrote his letters

00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:43.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
during times of trials and instability.

00:02:43.017 --> 00:02:46.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters of the first century

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:50.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
knew they were living in the last days
of the Jewish system of things.

00:02:51.316 --> 00:02:55.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Based on Jesus’ warning,
they expected personal challenges.

00:02:55.988 --> 00:02:59.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, they did not know
exactly when and how

00:02:59.867 --> 00:03:02.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
these events would affect them.

00:03:03.746 --> 00:03:08.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was impossible for them
to plan for every possibility.

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Peter, who was getting older,

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have wondered
how he and other elderly ones

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be cared for later in life.

00:03:20.012 --> 00:03:23.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
He may have perceived
that aging and declining health

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
could create uncertainty and fear in some.

00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:32.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t that sound a lot like the situation
we’re in today?

00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:39.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did the apostle Peter
recommend in view of future uncertainties?

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Peter 1:13, he said:

00:03:44.286 --> 00:03:47.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So brace up your minds for activity;

00:03:48.957 --> 00:03:51.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“keep your senses completely;

00:03:52.753 --> 00:03:56.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“set your hope on the undeserved kindness

00:03:56.173 --> 00:04:00.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be brought to you
at the revelation of Jesus Christ.”

00:04:01.178 --> 00:04:05.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
So did Peter tell the brothers and sisters
to stockpile money or supplies?

00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:06.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
No!

00:04:07.768 --> 00:04:12.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
He encouraged them to strengthen
their faith and trust in Jehovah.

00:04:13.524 --> 00:04:16.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are no uncertainties for Jehovah.

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:21.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had promised to protect the Christians
in the first century,

00:04:21.406 --> 00:04:23.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he would provide salvation.

00:04:25.369 --> 00:04:27.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 13,

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
what are the three things Peter
encouraged Christians to do?

00:04:32.709 --> 00:04:37.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) “Brace up your minds for activity,”

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:42.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) “keep your senses completely,”

00:04:43.137 --> 00:04:47.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) “set your hope
on the undeserved kindness.”

00:04:47.808 --> 00:04:50.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at each point and see

00:04:50.102 --> 00:04:53.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
what helps us to be
fully equipped for tomorrow.

00:04:56.275 --> 00:05:00.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, Peter tells us
to ‘brace up our minds for activity.’

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Brace up” means to be ready for activity.

00:05:05.325 --> 00:05:06.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
What kind of activity?

00:05:08.162 --> 00:05:10.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among other forms of activity,

00:05:10.414 --> 00:05:13.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what Peter wrote
a little later in his letter

00:05:13.792 --> 00:05:16.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 2:9:

00:05:16.545 --> 00:05:19.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You should declare abroad
the excellencies’ of the One

00:05:19.965 --> 00:05:23.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
who called you out of darkness
into his wonderful light.” 

00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:28.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first century,
Christians were active in telling others

00:05:28.807 --> 00:05:31.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
the good news about Jesus Christ.

00:05:32.311 --> 00:05:34.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do the same today.

00:05:34.313 --> 00:05:36.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re active in the ministry,

00:05:36.148 --> 00:05:39.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
sharing the good news
that Jesus is King in heaven,

00:05:39.401 --> 00:05:42.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we speak about the hope for all.

00:05:44.198 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how does sharing
in this activity prepare us

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:50.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the uncertainties of tomorrow?

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talking to others
about our hope for the future

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:58.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthens our own conviction and faith.

00:05:59.671 --> 00:06:02.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
This ministry keeps us focused,

00:06:02.299 --> 00:06:05.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we see the positive changes
in those we teach.

00:06:06.929 --> 00:06:10.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing in this activity
deepens our gratitude

00:06:10.807 --> 00:06:13.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being part of Jehovah’s family.

00:06:14.853 --> 00:06:18.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has this gratitude motivated you
to be active in the ministry?

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:25.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe your circumstances
even allow you to share in full-time service.

00:06:26.114 --> 00:06:28.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
By being active,

00:06:28.325 --> 00:06:31.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
you show Jehovah that his Kingdom

00:06:31.495 --> 00:06:34.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the most important thing in your life.

00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:37.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah promises

00:06:37.334 --> 00:06:41.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
to care for those who put his Kingdom first.

00:06:41.088 --> 00:06:43.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are in his protective hands;

00:06:43.757 --> 00:06:48.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is no need to be anxious or fearful.

00:06:48.595 --> 00:06:51.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, being active in the ministry

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:56.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the first step toward
being prepared for tomorrow.

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, the apostle Peter tells us

00:07:01.108 --> 00:07:04.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘keep our senses completely.’

00:07:04.611 --> 00:07:08.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means being balanced in our thinking.

00:07:09.283 --> 00:07:13.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, we are able
to evaluate matters properly,

00:07:13.412 --> 00:07:15.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
come to the right conclusions,

00:07:15.872 --> 00:07:18.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make good decisions.

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t this what we want?

00:07:21.628 --> 00:07:25.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we make good decisions,
especially when we face

00:07:25.507 --> 00:07:27.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
unexpected events in our life?

00:07:29.553 --> 00:07:34.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Developing Christian qualities
helps us keep our senses.

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:38.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,
Peter mentions one important quality

00:07:38.312 --> 00:07:40.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Peter 2:9:

00:07:40.397 --> 00:07:44.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, then, Jehovah knows how to rescue people

00:07:44.359 --> 00:07:46.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
of godly devotion out of trial.”

00:07:47.738 --> 00:07:50.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what quality can help us to keep

00:07:50.615 --> 00:07:54.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
our senses completely
and make good decisions?

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:56.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s godly devotion.

00:07:56.204 --> 00:08:00.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means being loyal to Jehovah
and doing what he asks.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:02.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this not what we promised to do

00:08:02.836 --> 00:08:06.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we dedicated our lives to him
and got baptized?

00:08:06.965 --> 00:08:09.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, and since then,

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:13.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve made many decisions
to follow his directions,

00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:15.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
which often come through his organization.

00:08:16.933 --> 00:08:20.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some changes were easy;
others were hard,

00:08:20.687 --> 00:08:25.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we did not fully understand
the direction or agree with it.

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:30.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of a time when you made
a difficult change for Jehovah?

00:08:31.782 --> 00:08:33.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you later see how

00:08:33.784 --> 00:08:37.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
following his direction led to good results?

00:08:37.788 --> 00:08:41.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your love for Jehovah and your deep devotion

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:44.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
to him helped you to make wise decisions.

00:08:46.046 --> 00:08:47.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the point?

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:52.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doing what Jehovah asks us today

00:08:52.135 --> 00:08:55.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only brings good results now

00:08:55.138 --> 00:08:58.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also prepares us for tomorrow.

00:08:58.517 --> 00:09:03.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
It ensures that when
we’re faced with a critical situation,

00:09:03.146 --> 00:09:06.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will naturally follow
Jehovah’s directions.

00:09:07.776 --> 00:09:10.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t this the best way
to prepare for the future?

00:09:10.987 --> 00:09:15.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
you may remember Sister Margaret Wyrick,

00:09:15.242 --> 00:09:17.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had to flee from wildfires.

00:09:18.161 --> 00:09:20.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
She learned from Jehovah’s organization

00:09:20.288 --> 00:09:24.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
how important it is to obey
those directing traffic.

00:09:24.418 --> 00:09:27.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although she wanted to drive a different way,

00:09:27.921 --> 00:09:30.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
she followed directions and was safe.

00:09:31.883 --> 00:09:35.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her godly devotion was evident.

00:09:35.345 --> 00:09:37.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what prepared her for the future

00:09:37.764 --> 00:09:40.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ultimately saved her life.

00:09:41.101 --> 00:09:45.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Peter said we must ‘keep our senses.’

00:09:45.605 --> 00:09:47.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:09:47.232 --> 00:09:51.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
By cultivating qualities like godly devotion.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:54.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
This allows us to make good decisions

00:09:54.573 --> 00:09:57.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and experience Jehovah’s care.

00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:03.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the third point
that Peter mentioned at 1 Peter 1:13?

00:10:04.624 --> 00:10:07.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tells us to ‘set our hope

00:10:07.961 --> 00:10:10.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the undeserved kindness.’

00:10:10.046 --> 00:10:13.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Peter trying to say?

00:10:13.049 --> 00:10:15.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can these two elements,

00:10:15.635 --> 00:10:19.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
hope and undeserved kindness,

00:10:19.014 --> 00:10:21.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to prepare for tomorrow?

00:10:23.101 --> 00:10:26.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we are reminded
of the stabilizing effect

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
that hope can have on us.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hope is compared to an anchor

00:10:31.234 --> 00:10:34.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
that keeps a ship secure during a storm.

00:10:35.906 --> 00:10:38.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we become anxious about what

00:10:38.116 --> 00:10:41.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might have to endure tomorrow

00:10:41.411 --> 00:10:46.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
(persecution, disaster, or health issues),

00:10:46.416 --> 00:10:49.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t we feel like we’re in a storm?

00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:52.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without hope,

00:10:52.506 --> 00:10:55.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
we might easily lose our balance.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:01.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter encourages us here
to see beyond the uncertainties

00:11:01.473 --> 00:11:04.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
and focus on what is certain,

00:11:04.976 --> 00:11:08.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
solid, and secure.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hope, our view of future blessings,

00:11:12.067 --> 00:11:14.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
stabilizes us.

00:11:15.362 --> 00:11:18.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that Peter
made a connection between

00:11:18.907 --> 00:11:21.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
hope and undeserved kindness?

00:11:22.702 --> 00:11:26.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hope that we have is a gift from Jehovah,

00:11:26.873 --> 00:11:30.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus’ resurrection
is the basis for our hope.

00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:34.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more we reflect on this,

00:11:34.172 --> 00:11:37.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
the stronger our gratitude and hope become.

00:11:38.927 --> 00:11:43.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
This grateful attitude
influences our daily life.

00:11:43.473 --> 00:11:44.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:11:45.725 --> 00:11:48.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, notice the mindset

00:11:48.645 --> 00:11:52.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter mentioned at 1 Peter 2:11:

00:11:53.316 --> 00:11:58.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Beloved, I urge you as foreigners
and temporary residents

00:11:58.154 --> 00:12:01.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to keep abstaining from fleshly desires,

00:12:01.575 --> 00:12:03.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
which wage war against you.”

00:12:04.744 --> 00:12:08.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our daily choices show that we do not belong

00:12:08.748 --> 00:12:12.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this world or seek its protection.

00:12:12.252 --> 00:12:14.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are residents of God’s Kingdom.

00:12:16.339 --> 00:12:19.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter reminds us to be different.

00:12:20.302 --> 00:12:21.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
For instance,

00:12:21.511 --> 00:12:26.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are different because of our view
of material things.

00:12:26.016 --> 00:12:30.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Materialism, a fleshly desire,
has affected people around us,

00:12:30.478 --> 00:12:34.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many would sacrifice everything
for material things.

00:12:36.693 --> 00:12:38.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:12:38.111 --> 00:12:42.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people are overly concerned
about their financial future.

00:12:43.825 --> 00:12:47.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
While it’s the course of wisdom
to do some planning,

00:12:48.622 --> 00:12:52.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
excessive worry
about material needs later in life

00:12:52.042 --> 00:12:55.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
may cause some
to put undue pressure on children

00:12:55.879 --> 00:13:00.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other family members
to pursue a secular career.

00:13:02.093 --> 00:13:05.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is common in some cultures,

00:13:05.096 --> 00:13:08.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it can affect us if we’re not careful.

00:13:09.476 --> 00:13:13.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might feel pressured to imitate others.

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:17.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this could even affect
our friendship with Jehovah

00:13:17.692 --> 00:13:21.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what others in our family can do for him.

00:13:23.573 --> 00:13:25.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following interview,

00:13:25.575 --> 00:13:29.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how parents living in such a culture

00:13:29.162 --> 00:13:31.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
chose to prepare for the future.

00:13:34.793 --> 00:13:37.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hong Kong is an international city,

00:13:38.004 --> 00:13:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it is known
for having high property prices.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.843 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was a teacher,

00:13:43.843 --> 00:13:45.553 line:10% position:50% align:center
and as a teacher,

00:13:45.553 --> 00:13:48.223 line:10% position:50% align:center
I advised my students to study hard

00:13:49.224 --> 00:13:51.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and choose majors that could help them

00:13:51.434 --> 00:13:55.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
find a job with a higher income
and a stable future.

00:13:57.482 --> 00:13:59.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before I learned the truth,

00:13:59.484 --> 00:14:02.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also hoped that our children
could have a better future

00:14:02.612 --> 00:14:05.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
by getting a good job when they grew up.

00:14:05.448 --> 00:14:08.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way,
they could also support us financially.

00:14:10.787 --> 00:14:12.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being Christian parents in the truth,

00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:15.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
we didn’t want them
to neglect their studies in school

00:14:15.917 --> 00:14:18.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we also wanted them to know
about the Bible.

00:14:19.754 --> 00:14:23.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we started studying the Bible
with them and took them to meetings

00:14:23.341 --> 00:14:25.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped them to preach to others.

00:14:27.387 --> 00:14:31.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since they were young,
I emphasized the blessings from God

00:14:31.307 --> 00:14:34.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we should always give thanks to him.

00:14:34.018 --> 00:14:36.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when one of my sons told me,

00:14:36.187 --> 00:14:40.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dad, I want to pioneer,” I was thrilled,
and I said, “You should do it!”

00:14:41.943 --> 00:14:46.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when I heard that he wanted to pioneer
and work part-time,

00:14:46.156 --> 00:14:49.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worried about how
that would affect our income.

00:14:49.743 --> 00:14:52.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, we never had a problem.

00:14:52.203 --> 00:14:55.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really saw how Jehovah blessed us.

00:14:55.957 --> 00:14:59.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
The amount of money that we earned
was more than enough, and I felt cared for

00:14:59.794 --> 00:15:02.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provided for by Jehovah.

00:15:02.964 --> 00:15:07.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
When my eldest son told me
that he wanted to stop his current studies

00:15:07.635 --> 00:15:11.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and start learning a construction trade,
I was disappointed.

00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:13.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought that even students
who didn’t do well

00:15:13.433 --> 00:15:15.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
could do that job and that that type of work 

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be physically harder for him.

00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:21.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he explained to us
that being a construction worker

00:15:21.232 --> 00:15:24.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be useful now
and forever in the new world.

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:28.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
I eventually respected his decision.

00:15:29.699 --> 00:15:33.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
We taught our children to put Jehovah first,
but when it came

00:15:33.578 --> 00:15:35.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
to putting it into practice,

00:15:35.955 --> 00:15:38.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed to respect
the decision made by my son.

00:15:41.419 --> 00:15:43.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to make it possible
for our whole family to pioneer,

00:15:45.006 --> 00:15:47.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
we needed to simplify our lives.

00:15:47.425 --> 00:15:51.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
During family worship,
we discussed ways to reduce expenses

00:15:51.262 --> 00:15:54.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that everyone in the family
was on the same page.

00:15:54.265 --> 00:15:57.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed that we did not lack anything

00:15:57.268 --> 00:16:00.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that the whole family
could all share the burden of our expenses.

00:16:03.608 --> 00:16:07.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our children are now all grown up,
and they willingly serve Jehovah.

00:16:08.446 --> 00:16:12.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am so grateful to Jehovah
because they have come

00:16:12.033 --> 00:16:14.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love him with their whole heart.

00:16:15.411 --> 00:16:17.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are all so happy!

00:16:18.957 --> 00:16:21.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am thankful to Jehovah every time

00:16:21.751 --> 00:16:24.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see the smiling faces of my family.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:27.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have clearly felt

00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:30.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah
always takes care of his servants.

00:16:31.427 --> 00:16:35.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like it says at Matthew 6:33,

00:16:35.765 --> 00:16:38.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we ‘keep seeking first God’s Kingdom

00:16:38.184 --> 00:16:42.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his righteousness,’
Jehovah will take care of us.

00:16:42.647 --> 00:16:45.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if our prayers
are according to God’s will

00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:47.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we try our best,

00:16:47.902 --> 00:16:50.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will undoubtedly bless our efforts.

00:16:50.989 --> 00:16:54.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, I have strong faith

00:16:54.033 --> 00:16:56.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hope for our future ahead.

00:16:59.247 --> 00:17:02.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being different can be challenging,

00:17:02.709 --> 00:17:05.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
but wasn’t it encouraging
to see how this couple

00:17:05.253 --> 00:17:09.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
resisted cultural expectations and pressure?

00:17:10.174 --> 00:17:13.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, they agreed
with their children’s desire

00:17:13.595 --> 00:17:17.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue goals in Jehovah’s service,

00:17:17.056 --> 00:17:19.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they supported them.

00:17:20.268 --> 00:17:23.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Strengthening our friendship with Jehovah

00:17:23.688 --> 00:17:26.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the best preparation for tomorrow.

00:17:26.691 --> 00:17:29.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
And whether Jehovah ultimately uses children

00:17:29.903 --> 00:17:32.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
to care for their parents

00:17:32.363 --> 00:17:35.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
or provides help in another way,

00:17:36.492 --> 00:17:41.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will stick to his promise
to care for us.

00:17:43.374 --> 00:17:47.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be fully equipped for tomorrow,

00:17:47.003 --> 00:17:50.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
we set our hope with gratitude on our God

00:17:51.966 --> 00:17:53.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the God we trust.

00:17:54.302 --> 00:17:55.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this discussion,

00:17:56.429 --> 00:18:00.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you find that you are already
doing these things?

00:18:00.016 --> 00:18:01.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likely so.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:04.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore,

00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:08.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not have any reason
to be overly anxious or fearful

00:18:08.733 --> 00:18:13.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
about future trials or other uncertainties.

00:18:13.071 --> 00:18:18.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
We face the future with confidence

00:18:18.076 --> 00:18:21.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we are fully equipped for tomorrow.

00:18:25.041 --> 00:18:28.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are also fully equipped for the ministry.

00:18:29.379 --> 00:18:33.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have the tools and training
we need to reach all kinds of people

00:18:33.925 --> 00:18:37.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even those who are not religious.

00:18:38.513 --> 00:18:43.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we preach to people
like that more effectively?

00:18:43.851 --> 00:18:48.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn in this episode
of <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron.”</i>

00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:50.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hello!

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am Akihiro.

00:18:51.609 --> 00:18:54.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is “<i>Iron Sharpens Iron.</i>”

00:19:04.539 --> 00:19:06.582 line:10% position:50% align:center
Have you ever been in the ministry

00:19:06.582 --> 00:19:09.043 line:10% position:50% align:center
and just as you’re starting a conversation,

00:19:09.043 --> 00:19:11.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
the individual stops you and says,

00:19:11.462 --> 00:19:13.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m not religious”?

00:19:13.715 --> 00:19:16.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did you react?

00:19:16.050 --> 00:19:20.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you freeze up, unsure of what to say?

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:22.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know it’s happened to me.

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this episode of <i>“Iron Sharpens Iron,” </i>

00:19:26.811 --> 00:19:29.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to discuss three tips

00:19:29.355 --> 00:19:32.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us reach the hearts
of nonreligious people.

00:19:34.068 --> 00:19:36.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what comes to your mind

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:39.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you hear the word “nonreligious”?

00:19:41.117 --> 00:19:44.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might assume this means
that the person doesn’t believe in God.

00:19:44.829 --> 00:19:49.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the truth is that although the person
may not belong to an organized religion,

00:19:49.709 --> 00:19:52.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
they might very well have a belief in God

00:19:52.378 --> 00:19:55.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in a higher power.

00:19:55.131 --> 00:19:58.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we don’t want to make assumptions.

00:19:59.886 --> 00:20:04.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lesson 9 of our brochure
<i>Love People—Make Disciples</i>  says:

00:20:05.058 --> 00:20:08.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Empathy moves us to care about people,

00:20:08.144 --> 00:20:10.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just about our message.”

00:20:10.855 --> 00:20:14.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s focus on letting the person
express themselves

00:20:14.776 --> 00:20:18.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then empathizing with their situation.

00:20:20.573 --> 00:20:25.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about three tips we can use
to do that with nonreligious people:

00:20:26.871 --> 00:20:30.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) be positive,

00:20:30.249 --> 00:20:34.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) listen with understanding,

00:20:34.587 --> 00:20:39.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) share information
that addresses their needs.

00:20:40.134 --> 00:20:43.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s see how we can apply these tips.

00:20:44.889 --> 00:20:49.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, with so many crazy things
happening in the world right now,

00:20:49.018 --> 00:20:52.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
a lot of people feel like world peace
is an impossible dream.

00:20:52.522 --> 00:20:53.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s your opinion?

00:20:55.775 --> 00:20:59.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
If this is about religion,
I’m not interested.

00:21:01.781 --> 00:21:05.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone is free to believe what he wants.

00:21:06.244 --> 00:21:10.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is important
is not a bunch of rules and rituals

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
but believing in God from our hearts.

00:21:14.877 --> 00:21:16.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s my opinion.

00:21:17.839 --> 00:21:19.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
I agree.

00:21:19.924 --> 00:21:23.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Believing in God from our heart
is very important.

00:21:24.345 --> 00:21:26.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t mind,

00:21:26.472 --> 00:21:30.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
may I ask you why
you’re not interested in religion?

00:21:32.395 --> 00:21:34.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
I used to belong to a religion,

00:21:35.731 --> 00:21:40.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the hypocrisy I saw
just completely turned me off.

00:21:42.405 --> 00:21:45.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so sorry you experienced that.

00:21:46.868 --> 00:21:50.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can understand why you feel the way you do.

00:21:52.957 --> 00:21:56.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
If religion cannot be of much help,

00:21:56.669 --> 00:22:00.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
where do you turn to for reliable guidance
during these tough times?

00:22:04.719 --> 00:22:05.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, . . .

00:22:08.931 --> 00:22:13.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how well our sisters
put our first two tips into practice?

00:22:14.729 --> 00:22:18.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sisters maintained a positive spirit,

00:22:18.649 --> 00:22:21.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
even after the householder told them

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:24.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wasn’t interested in religion.

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
This gave the householder
the opportunity to speak

00:22:27.617 --> 00:22:30.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowed our sisters
to apply our second tip:

00:22:30.786 --> 00:22:33.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
listen with understanding.

00:22:33.873 --> 00:22:37.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
They listened as the man expressed himself.

00:22:37.084 --> 00:22:40.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
That allowed them to understand
where he was coming from

00:22:40.379 --> 00:22:44.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then to respond empathetically
and keep the conversation going.

00:22:45.843 --> 00:22:50.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if you meet someone
who doesn’t believe in God at all?

00:22:52.058 --> 00:22:54.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a look.

00:22:56.771 --> 00:22:59.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a beautiful season, isn’t it?

00:22:59.315 --> 00:23:01.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love the lavender

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
—so beautiful.

00:23:02.818 --> 00:23:06.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, yeah, I love it too.

00:23:06.656 --> 00:23:08.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
The color is lovely, isn’t it?

00:23:08.658 --> 00:23:11.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is!

00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:14.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, to me,

00:23:14.288 --> 00:23:19.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
flowers are like an amazing gift from God.

00:23:20.586 --> 00:23:23.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever wondered if there is a God?

00:23:25.716 --> 00:23:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
A God?

00:23:28.052 --> 00:23:32.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it would be nice if there were,

00:23:32.431 --> 00:23:35.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I don’t believe in God.

00:23:36.519 --> 00:23:39.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, many feel the same way you do.

00:23:40.356 --> 00:23:42.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you don’t mind me asking,

00:23:42.984 --> 00:23:47.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
have you ever wondered
why some people do believe in God?

00:23:49.949 --> 00:23:51.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Honestly, I have,

00:23:53.744 --> 00:23:57.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I haven’t found a reasonable answer.

00:24:01.043 --> 00:24:05.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once again,
our sister maintained a positive spirit

00:24:05.214 --> 00:24:09.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wasn’t put off by the woman stating
that she doesn’t believe in God.

00:24:10.803 --> 00:24:14.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, she sought further understanding

00:24:14.473 --> 00:24:18.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
by asking a simple yet genuine question,

00:24:18.769 --> 00:24:22.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever wondered
why some people do believe in God?

00:24:24.025 --> 00:24:27.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you see how the woman relaxed

00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:31.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
when she realized that the sister
was actually interested in understanding her

00:24:31.532 --> 00:24:34.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was willing to continue the conversation?

00:24:35.703 --> 00:24:38.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if the person is willing to talk

00:24:38.873 --> 00:24:41.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the opportunity arises,

00:24:41.083 --> 00:24:43.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can apply our third tip:

00:24:43.294 --> 00:24:47.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
share information that addresses their needs.

00:24:47.506 --> 00:24:49.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
With our last householder,

00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:53.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do we have in our library
of publications that we could share with her?

00:24:54.972 --> 00:24:57.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could share one of the brochures

00:24:57.183 --> 00:24:59.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our Teaching Toolbox
that addresses creation

00:25:01.896 --> 00:25:05.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
or, if they are available in your language,

00:25:05.733 --> 00:25:09.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
a video from the series <i>Was It Designed? </i>

00:25:10.321 --> 00:25:13.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
or <i>Viewpoints on the Origin of Life.</i>

00:25:14.658 --> 00:25:18.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s make it our goal to be more familiar

00:25:18.287 --> 00:25:21.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all the tools Jehovah has given us.

00:25:23.292 --> 00:25:26.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every year there are nonreligious people

00:25:26.879 --> 00:25:29.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
who become Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:25:30.466 --> 00:25:33.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have reason to be positive

00:25:33.719 --> 00:25:36.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we speak to those
not interested in religion.

00:25:38.557 --> 00:25:41.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we listen with understanding

00:25:42.228 --> 00:25:44.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when appropriate

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:48.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
share information that addresses their needs,

00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:50.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be doing our best

00:25:50.778 --> 00:25:54.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach the hearts of nonreligious people.

00:25:56.075 --> 00:25:59.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
These tips have helped me in my ministry,

00:26:01.163 --> 00:26:04.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “as iron sharpens iron,”

00:26:04.417 --> 00:26:06.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope they help you too.

00:26:07.503 --> 00:26:10.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never underestimate
how the hearts of our neighbors

00:26:10.881 --> 00:26:14.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be moved when we listen
to them with empathy

00:26:14.427 --> 00:26:16.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
and show we really care.

00:26:16.846 --> 00:26:20.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even those who seem unlikely
to listen to our message

00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:24.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be touched by God’s Word
and the genuine love we show.

00:26:25.771 --> 00:26:30.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s exactly what happened
to a young man named Lucas Lakra.

00:26:30.067 --> 00:26:31.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here is his story.

00:26:43.330 --> 00:26:45.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was a bully.

00:26:47.042 --> 00:26:49.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
I used to steal from others,

00:26:50.838 --> 00:26:53.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was very, very angry.

00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:57.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inside, I had feelings of taking revenge.

00:26:57.761 --> 00:27:01.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted revenge.

00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:08.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
I spent my childhood
in a small city of India.

00:27:09.064 --> 00:27:10.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
My family was very poor.

00:27:12.151 --> 00:27:15.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents both had the habit of drinking.

00:27:15.988 --> 00:27:18.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, they had fights at home.

00:27:18.574 --> 00:27:20.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father would beat my mother with wood,

00:27:21.785 --> 00:27:25.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes he would beat us too.

00:27:25.748 --> 00:27:28.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
So me and my siblings would run and hide

00:27:28.792 --> 00:27:30.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the outside toilets,

00:27:30.794 --> 00:27:35.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we would wait there until the shouting

00:27:35.132 --> 00:27:37.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fighting would stop.

00:27:40.304 --> 00:27:44.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day I saw my father; he was full drunk.

00:27:46.977 --> 00:27:48.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was very small,

00:27:48.896 --> 00:27:51.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe six years old,

00:27:51.732 --> 00:27:54.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was playing near the house.

00:27:55.986 --> 00:27:59.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
My uncle came to the house,
screaming at my father.

00:28:00.324 --> 00:28:02.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
I ran to see what was happening,

00:28:02.993 --> 00:28:05.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
but there was nothing I could do

00:28:05.538 --> 00:28:08.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
when in front of my own eyes,

00:28:08.582 --> 00:28:10.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
my father was murdered.

00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:23.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, I was taken away from my mother
to work as a servant.

00:28:24.974 --> 00:28:26.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
They treated me terribly,

00:28:26.725 --> 00:28:29.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
with punches and kicks.

00:28:29.687 --> 00:28:31.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
They even strangled me once.

00:28:34.525 --> 00:28:36.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
I missed my mother.

00:28:36.902 --> 00:28:38.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt so alone.

00:28:39.738 --> 00:28:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother was suffering from cancer.

00:28:42.992 --> 00:28:45.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked them many times
that I wanted to go and see my mother,

00:28:46.245 --> 00:28:47.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they wouldn’t let me go.

00:28:48.497 --> 00:28:52.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started crying;
I said, “I want to go home.”

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they said,

00:28:55.754 --> 00:28:59.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Going now will be of no use

00:28:59.967 --> 00:29:02.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
because your mother
has already been dead for four days.”

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:06.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
I cried a lot.

00:29:09.935 --> 00:29:12.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could not see my mother one last time.

00:29:15.733 --> 00:29:19.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of this made me feel so angry inside.

00:29:19.361 --> 00:29:22.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was always fighting,
bullying, and stealing.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, I was thrown out of the house.

00:29:27.786 --> 00:29:30.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time a relative took me in.

00:29:31.123 --> 00:29:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed her daughter

00:29:32.875 --> 00:29:34.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
would go somewhere every Sunday,

00:29:34.918 --> 00:29:37.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this made me very curious.

00:29:37.463 --> 00:29:40.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I asked her where she would go,

00:29:40.049 --> 00:29:42.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she said: “To Bible meetings.”

00:29:44.887 --> 00:29:48.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her daughter also told me
that a couple would come every Friday

00:29:48.891 --> 00:29:50.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
to study the Bible with her.

00:29:53.312 --> 00:29:55.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
She invited me to join her if I wanted,

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I decided to sit in on her study.

00:30:03.781 --> 00:30:06.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was impressed
with the brothers studying with her.

00:30:07.701 --> 00:30:09.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were so kind.

00:30:09.453 --> 00:30:12.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
They cared a lot and showed love

00:30:12.539 --> 00:30:14.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was not seen in churches.

00:30:16.502 --> 00:30:20.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion,
I found myself running again.

00:30:22.049 --> 00:30:23.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this time,

00:30:23.592 --> 00:30:27.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was running to the Kingdom Hall
to see my new family.

00:30:27.596 --> 00:30:30.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about ten kilometers away (6 mi).

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I had no money to go by vehicle,

00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:34.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
so instead I went by foot.

00:30:34.812 --> 00:30:37.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
But every step was worth it

00:30:37.564 --> 00:30:41.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
because at the meeting,
I really felt Jehovah’s love

00:30:41.318 --> 00:30:43.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the brothers and sisters.

00:30:44.988 --> 00:30:47.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
As my study slowly progressed,

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
I began to realize

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I am not an orphan.

00:30:52.454 --> 00:30:55.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is with me; he is my Father.

00:31:01.171 --> 00:31:04.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, I was able
to throw all my burdens

00:31:04.675 --> 00:31:06.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
on my Father, Jehovah,

00:31:06.677 --> 00:31:08.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I started to have peace of mind.

00:31:10.139 --> 00:31:12.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I dedicated my life to Jehovah.

00:31:13.851 --> 00:31:18.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
On December 26, 1998, I was baptized.

00:31:18.689 --> 00:31:20.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
After my baptism,

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:23.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to give Jehovah my best.

00:31:24.611 --> 00:31:28.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, me and my wife, Julian,
are so happy to be

00:31:28.741 --> 00:31:30.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
in full-time service together.

00:31:30.492 --> 00:31:32.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thanks to Jehovah,

00:31:32.286 --> 00:31:36.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have enjoyed
a variety of assignments as a couple.

00:31:41.128 --> 00:31:43.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
My past cannot be erased.

00:31:43.922 --> 00:31:45.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neither can I stop these memories

00:31:45.674 --> 00:31:48.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
from coming into my mind.

00:31:50.262 --> 00:31:54.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah has completely changed my life.

00:31:55.309 --> 00:31:57.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
I no longer feel anger

00:31:57.352 --> 00:32:00.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the need for revenge anymore.

00:32:02.566 --> 00:32:04.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there is no need to feel orphaned.

00:32:05.486 --> 00:32:08.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
Give yourselves completely
to the hands of Jehovah.

00:32:08.781 --> 00:32:10.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s your Father.

00:32:10.115 --> 00:32:11.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will take care of you.

00:32:11.575 --> 00:32:13.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[He] will never leave you.”

00:32:15.704 --> 00:32:19.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lakra’s story
shows how learning the truth

00:32:19.374 --> 00:32:22.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
really is life-changing.

00:32:22.127 --> 00:32:25.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even feelings of intense anger and revenge

00:32:25.422 --> 00:32:29.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
can give way to real peace of mind.

00:32:29.009 --> 00:32:32.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Lucas, all of us appreciate
the way Jehovah teaches us

00:32:32.763 --> 00:32:35.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deal with difficulties in life

00:32:35.766 --> 00:32:38.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
—including in our family life.

00:32:39.478 --> 00:32:43.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are married,
have you ever found yourself in a situation

00:32:43.357 --> 00:32:48.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you and your mate
just don’t see things the same way?

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you’re not alone,
and you’ll appreciate the suggestions

00:32:52.741 --> 00:32:56.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this episode of <i>For a Happy Marriage.</i>

00:33:11.844 --> 00:33:14.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve found that special someone.

00:33:16.932 --> 00:33:20.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t believe how compatible you are!

00:33:27.442 --> 00:33:32.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, you soon discover that “compatible”
does not mean “identical.”

00:33:37.202 --> 00:33:39.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible describes a husband and wife

00:33:39.496 --> 00:33:41.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
as complements,

00:33:41.498 --> 00:33:43.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
not competitors.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
A complement completes
what another may lack.

00:33:47.004 --> 00:33:51.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means your differences
can strengthen your marriage.

00:33:57.890 --> 00:34:02.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, with two imperfect people,

00:34:04.897 --> 00:34:07.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
disagreements will happen,

00:34:13.655 --> 00:34:16.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they don’t have to become arguments.

00:34:21.788 --> 00:34:25.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the two of you don’t see a matter
in the same way

00:34:25.542 --> 00:34:29.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
—for example, how to manage money—

00:34:29.963 --> 00:34:31.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
what should you do?

00:34:33.008 --> 00:34:37.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should you insist until you get your way?

00:34:52.277 --> 00:34:54.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
say nothing at all?

00:35:00.452 --> 00:35:05.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a better way
to work through the occasional difference

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:07.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
before it becomes a conflict.

00:35:12.547 --> 00:35:14.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
A Bible principle states:

00:35:14.925 --> 00:35:17.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let each one keep seeking,

00:35:17.094 --> 00:35:19.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not his own advantage,

00:35:19.221 --> 00:35:21.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that of the other person.”

00:35:23.183 --> 00:35:26.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may need to set aside
your cherished point of view

00:35:26.144 --> 00:35:28.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and really try to see the value

00:35:28.522 --> 00:35:31.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your mate’s perspective.

00:35:31.191 --> 00:35:32.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,

00:35:32.567 --> 00:35:36.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
seek his or her advantage, not your own.

00:35:38.615 --> 00:35:41.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take each issue one at a time.

00:35:42.744 --> 00:35:45.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may be able to resolve
most of your differences

00:35:45.706 --> 00:35:47.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meet in the middle.

00:35:47.749 --> 00:35:49.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
With practice,

00:35:49.251 --> 00:35:51.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will learn to tackle your disagreements,

00:35:51.336 --> 00:35:53.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
not each other.

00:35:57.426 --> 00:36:01.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a skill you will work at
for a lifetime,

00:36:01.888 --> 00:36:03.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
since we all change as we age.

00:36:05.058 --> 00:36:06.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:36:06.226 --> 00:36:10.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
what if your viewpoints differ
on how to care for aging parents?

00:36:41.178 --> 00:36:43.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Start with your common ground.

00:36:43.346 --> 00:36:48.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to the financial cost,
consider the cost to your time, health,

00:36:48.226 --> 00:36:52.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and relationship with each other
and with God.

00:36:55.233 --> 00:36:58.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recognize the merits
of your spouse’s viewpoint.

00:37:00.572 --> 00:37:02.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even if your differences cannot be solved

00:37:02.991 --> 00:37:05.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a mutual compromise,

00:37:05.494 --> 00:37:08.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
conceding and supporting
will be a win for your friendship.

00:37:10.707 --> 00:37:14.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might also agree
to discuss the question again

00:37:14.044 --> 00:37:17.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a later date
or if circumstances change.

00:37:19.674 --> 00:37:22.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if you don’t always agree,

00:37:22.677 --> 00:37:25.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can still work as a team.

00:37:25.931 --> 00:37:28.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Different viewpoints broaden your horizons,

00:37:28.433 --> 00:37:30.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
add color to your marriage,

00:37:30.644 --> 00:37:35.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the end,
draw you closer to one another.

00:37:37.067 --> 00:37:39.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are three questions to discuss

00:37:39.402 --> 00:37:41.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help you handle situations

00:37:41.571 --> 00:37:44.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your marriage where viewpoints differ.

00:37:44.574 --> 00:37:46.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
If it’s convenient,

00:37:46.243 --> 00:37:49.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
pause this video now and really talk.

00:37:53.458 --> 00:37:57.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
What practical advice
for handling difficulties in ways

00:37:57.546 --> 00:38:01.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can make
your marriage stronger and happier!

00:38:02.551 --> 00:38:06.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether married or single,
we all encounter times

00:38:06.096 --> 00:38:08.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
when someone we know is experiencing

00:38:08.431 --> 00:38:11.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
serious illness or emotional distress.

00:38:12.602 --> 00:38:14.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you feel a deep desire

00:38:14.771 --> 00:38:17.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
to provide them with relief and support?

00:38:18.733 --> 00:38:20.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this Morning Worship program,

00:38:20.777 --> 00:38:23.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Harold Corkern
highlights the importance

00:38:23.697 --> 00:38:26.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
of consoling others.

00:38:27.617 --> 00:38:29.619 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our text today highlights

00:38:29.619 --> 00:38:32.414 line:10% position:50% align:center
the importance of consoling,

00:38:32.414 --> 00:38:36.042 line:10% position:50% align:center
which basically conveys the idea to soothe,

00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:39.671 line:10% position:50% align:center
encourage, uplift, fortify.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:43.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
It also encourages us to “support the weak.”

00:38:43.884 --> 00:38:47.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the basic meaning of that expression,
“support the weak,”

00:38:47.012 --> 00:38:50.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “to hold fast” to, “cleave to,”

00:38:50.932 --> 00:38:53.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
the person who’s needing assistance.

00:38:54.477 --> 00:38:57.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing that, we are certainly
imitating Jehovah, aren’t we?

00:38:57.939 --> 00:39:00.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 34:18, it says:

00:39:00.567 --> 00:39:03.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is close to the brokenhearted.

00:39:03.778 --> 00:39:05.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[He’s right there.]

00:39:05.197 --> 00:39:08.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saves those who are crushed in spirit.”

00:39:08.825 --> 00:39:11.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lifts up those who are depressed.

00:39:11.953 --> 00:39:15.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what can help us
to imitate Jehovah to the best of our ability

00:39:15.832 --> 00:39:20.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
in consoling, supporting,
and doing all of that with patience?

00:39:21.421 --> 00:39:23.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one thing that will certainly help

00:39:23.423 --> 00:39:26.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the relationship between
the one giving the assistance

00:39:26.718 --> 00:39:28.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the one receiving it.

00:39:28.762 --> 00:39:32.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
If there’s friendship there,
it makes a big difference

00:39:32.474 --> 00:39:36.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the one receiving
the help feels comfortable.

00:39:36.019 --> 00:39:39.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may have something
very embarrassing or sensitive to talk about.

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:44.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
And doing so with a true,
trusted friend makes it a lot easier.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if the one rendering
the assistance is a friend,

00:39:48.615 --> 00:39:52.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
then it doesn’t come across
like he’s interrogating

00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
or he’s investigating something,

00:39:54.704 --> 00:39:58.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
but rather,
he’s showing genuine interest.

00:39:59.751 --> 00:40:01.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, building up an understanding

00:40:01.753 --> 00:40:05.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the background of each other
certainly helps, doesn’t it?

00:40:05.006 --> 00:40:07.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what friends do.

00:40:07.008 --> 00:40:10.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
We understand a lot about that person,
don’t we?

00:40:10.762 --> 00:40:12.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
what could build up

00:40:12.847 --> 00:40:16.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
our desire to be consoling,

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be supportive,
and to do it with patience?

00:40:19.896 --> 00:40:21.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
The background.

00:40:21.898 --> 00:40:25.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are just a few examples
of background that can motivate us

00:40:25.986 --> 00:40:27.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do just what our text says today.

00:40:28.780 --> 00:40:30.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here they are.

00:40:30.407 --> 00:40:32.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did they grow up in a dysfunctional family?

00:40:34.077 --> 00:40:36.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was one of their parents an alcoholic?

00:40:37.914 --> 00:40:41.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the mother or father
abandon them when they were young?

00:40:43.003 --> 00:40:45.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did a beloved family member
turn against the truth,

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is he now a bitter opposer?

00:40:48.633 --> 00:40:51.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
There could be many other reasons.

00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:55.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
But such background
gives us not only the desire to help

00:40:56.641 --> 00:41:00.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the willingness
and the ability to do it in a way

00:41:00.437 --> 00:41:02.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will be most helpful.

00:41:03.356 --> 00:41:07.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, one thing we have to keep in mind
about the variety of things

00:41:07.193 --> 00:41:09.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
that require assistance

00:41:09.446 --> 00:41:13.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
is based on something
that’s said at Romans 8:22.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we invite you to open your Bibles there

00:41:16.286 --> 00:41:20.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Romans 8:22.

00:41:20.123 --> 00:41:24.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this will help us to appreciate
that regardless of the problem,

00:41:24.753 --> 00:41:27.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is a common reason for it.

00:41:27.172 --> 00:41:29.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Romans 8:22,

00:41:29.341 --> 00:41:31.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul is talking about the bad effects

00:41:31.509 --> 00:41:34.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have come from Adam’s sin.

00:41:34.846 --> 00:41:36.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here’s what he says:

00:41:36.848 --> 00:41:39.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For we know that all creation

00:41:39.517 --> 00:41:41.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“keeps on groaning together

00:41:41.936 --> 00:41:45.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
and being in pain together until now.”

00:41:46.775 --> 00:41:50.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
That pain and groaning
as descendants of Adam

00:41:50.945 --> 00:41:54.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
can manifest itself in physical ailments

00:41:54.074 --> 00:41:58.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like heart trouble, diabetes,
cancer, or others—

00:41:58.953 --> 00:42:01.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s not limited to physical ailments.

00:42:02.832 --> 00:42:06.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emotional and mental issues also arise

00:42:06.336 --> 00:42:10.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of being descendants of Adam.

00:42:10.173 --> 00:42:13.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so just as we’d never look down on
or condemn someone

00:42:13.593 --> 00:42:15.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had a physical ailment,

00:42:15.595 --> 00:42:19.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
we would never want to do that
with someone who’s going through

00:42:19.265 --> 00:42:22.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
an emotional issue,
such as depression

00:42:22.102 --> 00:42:24.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
or another mental illness.

00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:28.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one of the things
that we’d want to do for those,

00:42:28.733 --> 00:42:31.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of what their needs may be,

00:42:31.236 --> 00:42:35.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to use the Scriptures
and to be a good shepherd.

00:42:35.448 --> 00:42:38.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sisters can help other sisters.

00:42:38.243 --> 00:42:39.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Friends can help friends.

00:42:39.869 --> 00:42:44.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders, of course, have that responsibility
to help everyone too.

00:42:44.707 --> 00:42:48.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, now, there’s something that we need
to keep in mind when we’re trying to help.

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:53.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s recorded for us at Proverbs 12:18.

00:42:53.675 --> 00:42:57.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we invite you to turn there
—Proverbs 12:18.

00:42:57.095 --> 00:43:00.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to help;
we want to console.

00:43:00.181 --> 00:43:02.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
We do not want to hurt.

00:43:02.267 --> 00:43:04.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 12:18 says:

00:43:04.352 --> 00:43:08.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thoughtless speech
is like the stabs of a sword,

00:43:08.815 --> 00:43:12.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the tongue of the wise is a healing.”

00:43:13.445 --> 00:43:18.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our desire is to console,
to support, to uplift, to cheer up

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:20.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not to make the matter worse.

00:43:20.952 --> 00:43:24.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
So thoughtful speech is a key.

00:43:25.498 --> 00:43:30.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, just to illustrate how much pain
can be caused if that’s not done,

00:43:30.336 --> 00:43:33.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice the expressions
of one of our Christian sisters

00:43:33.965 --> 00:43:36.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
who went through a period of depression.

00:43:36.009 --> 00:43:37.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said this:

00:43:38.344 --> 00:43:41.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One lesson I’ll never forget,

00:43:41.598 --> 00:43:43.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I learned empathy.

00:43:43.850 --> 00:43:47.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before,
I used to think that all you had to do

00:43:47.103 --> 00:43:50.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was to pump yourself up and get going,

00:43:50.106 --> 00:43:54.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so I never had much fellow feeling
for others who were sick.

00:43:54.736 --> 00:43:56.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I know.

00:43:56.821 --> 00:44:00.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When some of the friends told me
to ‘snap out of it,’

00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there wasn’t anything
that I wanted to do more,

00:44:03.703 --> 00:44:07.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but at that point I had no control.

00:44:07.457 --> 00:44:10.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their comments really hurt.”

00:44:11.002 --> 00:44:12.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how sad!

00:44:12.629 --> 00:44:14.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
In an effort to help,

00:44:14.714 --> 00:44:18.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
we unintentionally can inflict more pain

00:44:18.218 --> 00:44:20.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
by thoughtless speech.

00:44:20.678 --> 00:44:23.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us
to prevent thoughtless speech?

00:44:23.348 --> 00:44:25.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we can consider these questions

00:44:25.975 --> 00:44:27.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on Bible principles:

00:44:28.978 --> 00:44:32.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is what I’m about to say true,

00:44:32.524 --> 00:44:35.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
kind, necessary?

00:44:36.319 --> 00:44:38.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would I feel if someone said that to me?

00:44:39.906 --> 00:44:41.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will it show respect?

00:44:42.534 --> 00:44:45.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is this the right setting
to even bring it up at all?

00:44:46.871 --> 00:44:51.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thinking before we speak
can do a lot to do healing

00:44:51.709 --> 00:44:54.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than to inflict more pain.

00:44:54.546 --> 00:44:58.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this connection,
in helping depressed ones,

00:44:58.049 --> 00:45:00.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
patience is required.

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:02.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you’ve experienced this:

00:45:02.262 --> 00:45:03.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone who’s depressed

00:45:03.888 --> 00:45:07.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
may pour out their feelings
with great feeling and intensity.

00:45:08.309 --> 00:45:09.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
We listen.

00:45:09.727 --> 00:45:11.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
We offer encouragement.

00:45:11.521 --> 00:45:13.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then a short time later,

00:45:13.523 --> 00:45:16.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re back with the same intense feelings
and concerns

00:45:16.901 --> 00:45:19.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
—as if they had never been discussed before.

00:45:20.488 --> 00:45:23.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Patience is required to keep consoling

00:45:23.908 --> 00:45:26.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to keep supporting.

00:45:26.286 --> 00:45:29.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
In doing so, we would imitate Jehovah.

00:45:29.038 --> 00:45:32.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Lamentations 3:22, 23,

00:45:32.166 --> 00:45:35.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible says about Jehovah:

00:45:35.169 --> 00:45:38.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is because of Jehovah’s loyal love

00:45:38.339 --> 00:45:40.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that we have not come to our finish,

00:45:40.717 --> 00:45:43.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for his mercies never end.

00:45:43.886 --> 00:45:46.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are new each morning;

00:45:46.681 --> 00:45:49.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
your faithfulness is abundant.”

00:45:50.310 --> 00:45:54.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives us help every day.

00:45:54.063 --> 00:45:56.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
And though it’s not easy,

00:45:56.065 --> 00:45:58.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to be just as patient

00:45:58.234 --> 00:46:02.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just as consoling
and just as helpful as Jehovah.

00:46:04.282 --> 00:46:09.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after listening
and offering thoughtful Scriptural advice

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
(the Scriptures are powerful),

00:46:11.164 --> 00:46:15.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes something more than that
is needed for someone who’s depressed.

00:46:15.043 --> 00:46:17.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we say that?

00:46:17.128 --> 00:46:20.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 5:31, Jesus said this:

00:46:20.506 --> 00:46:25.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Those who are healthy
do not need a physician,

00:46:25.178 --> 00:46:28.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
but those who are ill do.”

00:46:29.641 --> 00:46:33.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Depression may not be
because of some temporary disappointment

00:46:33.269 --> 00:46:36.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a temporary feeling of being low
or discouragement.

00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:39.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might be more clinical.

00:46:39.567 --> 00:46:44.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
It might have been inherited
as part of a family trait or weakness.

00:46:45.531 --> 00:46:48.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
And scriptures alone,
although very valuable,

00:46:48.910 --> 00:46:51.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not be all the help they need.

00:46:51.788 --> 00:46:53.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases,

00:46:53.414 --> 00:46:56.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
seeking medical attention
is the course of wisdom

00:46:56.709 --> 00:47:00.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and perhaps in some cases even medication.

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:04.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if a person is in that situation,
what should they do?

00:47:05.176 --> 00:47:08.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve been helped,
but they’re still needing more help.

00:47:08.554 --> 00:47:11.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, with humility and modesty,

00:47:11.516 --> 00:47:13.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
recognizing their limitations,

00:47:13.976 --> 00:47:16.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
they will seek the help they need

00:47:16.145 --> 00:47:19.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not only spiritually but medically.

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s one thing about it:
Living in these last days,

00:47:23.945 --> 00:47:26.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
all of us are going to go
through periods of time

00:47:26.447 --> 00:47:28.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we need encouragement.

00:47:28.449 --> 00:47:32.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, we may be encouraging
somebody today,

00:47:32.286 --> 00:47:34.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
and next week, we need it.

00:47:35.873 --> 00:47:37.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why the apostle Paul

00:47:37.875 --> 00:47:41.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Thessalonians 5:11 said:

00:47:41.504 --> 00:47:44.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep encouraging one another

00:47:44.841 --> 00:47:47.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and building one another up,

00:47:47.552 --> 00:47:50.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as you are in fact doing.”

00:47:51.764 --> 00:47:55.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if we do that,
then we can help each other

00:47:55.351 --> 00:47:58.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
endure through these last days
to the point where,

00:47:58.563 --> 00:48:00.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
as foretold by Isaiah:

00:48:00.815 --> 00:48:03.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No [one] will say: ‘I am sick’”

00:48:03.317 --> 00:48:07.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
—either spiritually, mentally,
emotionally, or physically.

00:48:07.238 --> 00:48:10.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in line with today’s text,

00:48:10.408 --> 00:48:13.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us keep up with what we’re doing

00:48:13.077 --> 00:48:16.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“speak consolingly to those
who are depressed,

00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:20.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
support the weak,
be patient toward all.”

00:48:22.003 --> 00:48:25.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing it is
to have spiritual brothers and sisters

00:48:25.882 --> 00:48:30.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ‘keep encouraging and building
one another up’ during these last days!

00:48:31.804 --> 00:48:36.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video,
 titled <i>Every Minute,</i>

00:48:36.517 --> 00:48:38.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
is about just that.

00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:59.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our life
is like a mist that appears;

00:48:59.791 --> 00:49:05.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a moment of time,
it’s gone.

00:49:05.838 --> 00:49:13.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our love
is like the warm summer sun;

00:49:13.221 --> 00:49:23.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let it shine on the ones we love
while there’s time.

00:49:23.773 --> 00:49:30.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could take it all for granted,
let time just slip away,

00:49:30.613 --> 00:49:37.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
And forget to love
the ones I love right now.

00:49:37.411 --> 00:49:44.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could put off till tomorrow
what I can do today,

00:49:44.252 --> 00:49:50.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I never want regrets
to bring me down.

00:49:50.341 --> 00:50:01.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’m counting ev’ry minute
and making ev’ry minute count.

00:50:10.194 --> 00:50:18.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I see
so much beauty around,

00:50:18.244 --> 00:50:24.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the love
that Jehovah has shown,

00:50:24.542 --> 00:50:32.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I know
that I want to give to him

00:50:32.383 --> 00:50:42.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ev’ry hour, ev’ry minute of life
that I own.

00:50:42.310 --> 00:50:49.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could take it all for granted,
let time just slip away,

00:50:49.358 --> 00:50:56.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
And forget to show
my love for him right now.

00:50:56.157 --> 00:51:03.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could put off till tomorrow
what I can do today,

00:51:03.039 --> 00:51:09.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I never want regrets
to bring me down.

00:51:09.629 --> 00:51:20.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’m counting ev’ry minute
and making ev’ry minute count.

00:51:22.975 --> 00:51:30.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right ahead
is a beautiful new world

00:51:30.608 --> 00:51:36.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Jehovah wants to share.

00:51:36.822 --> 00:51:43.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our time
is a gift that we can give.

00:51:43.829 --> 00:51:51.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
So until that day is here,

00:51:51.545 --> 00:51:58.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
I won’t take it all for granted
or let time slip away

00:51:58.386 --> 00:52:05.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or forget to love
the ones I love right now.

00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:12.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
I won’t put off till tomorrow
all that I can do today,

00:52:12.066 --> 00:52:18.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
’Cause I never want regrets
to bring me down.

00:52:18.489 --> 00:52:31.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why I’m counting ev’ry minute
and making ev’ry minute count.

00:52:36.757 --> 00:52:39.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this program,
we’ve learned about many of the things

00:52:39.635 --> 00:52:43.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can do to prepare our spiritual go bag.

00:52:43.097 --> 00:52:46.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help us
to be fully equipped for the future.

00:52:47.977 --> 00:52:51.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can preach zealously
to people of all sorts,

00:52:53.983 --> 00:52:57.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
cultivate qualities
that bring peace to our family life,

00:52:58.904 --> 00:53:00.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build our trust in Jehovah

00:53:00.906 --> 00:53:03.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
by reflecting on the blessings he’s given us.

00:53:04.994 --> 00:53:08.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of those blessings
is our worldwide brotherhood.

00:53:08.414 --> 00:53:11.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every month,
we get to meet another part

00:53:11.042 --> 00:53:14.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
of that brotherhood
through our video postcard.

00:53:14.462 --> 00:53:19.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this month,
we’re going to the western edge of Europe

00:53:19.175 --> 00:53:21.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to the Azores archipelago.

00:53:22.511 --> 00:53:25.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Azores
are a chain of nine volcanic islands

00:53:25.890 --> 00:53:28.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 1,600 kilometers,

00:53:28.893 --> 00:53:31.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
or 1,000 miles, west of Portugal.

00:53:31.937 --> 00:53:35.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here vineyards and plantations meet

00:53:35.191 --> 00:53:37.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
steep emerald peaks,

00:53:37.526 --> 00:53:40.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
crater lakes, and hot springs.

00:53:40.696 --> 00:53:43.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
Steam and volcanic gases escape

00:53:43.115 --> 00:53:46.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the earth
through vents called fumaroles.

00:53:46.744 --> 00:53:49.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the island of São Miguel,

00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:52.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
this brother prepares
a local dish in a fumarole,

00:53:52.625 --> 00:53:55.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
letting it cook for up to seven hours.

00:53:55.878 --> 00:53:58.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thanks to their subtropical climate,

00:53:58.547 --> 00:54:02.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Azores produce
an abundance of pineapples,

00:54:02.301 --> 00:54:06.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
oranges, bananas, and tea.

00:54:07.765 --> 00:54:11.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers enjoy
making beautiful crafts from local resources,

00:54:12.394 --> 00:54:14.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as fish scales.

00:54:14.814 --> 00:54:17.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they enjoy preparing regional foods

00:54:17.983 --> 00:54:22.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
like these <i>bolo lêvedo</i>  cakes,
which can be found at any meal.

00:54:24.490 --> 00:54:29.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first seeds of truth
were planted here in the early 20th century

00:54:29.453 --> 00:54:33.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
by Azoreans who learned the truth
in the United States

00:54:33.165 --> 00:54:36.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
and shared what they learned
with relatives and friends back home.

00:54:38.337 --> 00:54:42.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite decades of Church-led opposition,

00:54:42.049 --> 00:54:45.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
publishers have always found sheeplike ones.

00:54:47.012 --> 00:54:50.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, there are more than 800 publishers

00:54:50.474 --> 00:54:53.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 15 congregations in the Azores.

00:54:54.395 --> 00:54:57.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers conduct
more than 500 Bible studies.

00:54:57.815 --> 00:55:01.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Memorial attendance was more than twice
the number of Witnesses here.

00:55:03.612 --> 00:55:08.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
The good news is preached in both Portuguese
and Portuguese Sign Language.

00:55:10.035 --> 00:55:13.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is
the Santa Cruz das Flores Congregation.

00:55:13.706 --> 00:55:16.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has 17 publishers.

00:55:16.125 --> 00:55:20.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their territory includes
the islands of Flores and Corvo.

00:55:21.547 --> 00:55:24.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the Azores,
our brothers and sisters

00:55:24.216 --> 00:55:27.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Santa Cruz das Flores Congregation

00:55:27.011 --> 00:55:29.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you their warm love and greetings.

00:55:29.847 --> 00:55:34.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we send our love to all of you as well.

00:55:34.351 --> 00:55:37.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:55:37.354 --> 00:55:40.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
