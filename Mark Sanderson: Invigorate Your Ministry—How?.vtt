00:01.283 --> 00:04.786
To set the stage 
for the experiences in our program, 


00:04.787 --> 00:07.824
I’d like to talk to you 
for a few minutes on the theme 


00:07.823 --> 00:11.895
“Invigorate Your Ministry—How?” 


00:11.895 --> 00:14.330
You dear brothers and sisters are having 


00:14.330 --> 00:16.332
a regular share in the preaching work, 


00:16.332 --> 00:18.669
and just think of the results. 


00:18.668 --> 00:19.935
Each year, 


00:19.935 --> 00:23.840
about two billion hours 
are spent in the ministry. 


00:23.840 --> 00:26.743
Millions of Bible studies are conducted, 


00:26.743 --> 00:31.113
and those being baptized 
number into the hundreds of thousands. 


00:31.113 --> 00:33.416
If you are a Kingdom publisher, 


00:33.417 --> 00:37.120
you have had a share 
in those thrilling statistics. 


00:37.120 --> 00:40.257
But there’s a potential danger. 


00:40.257 --> 00:42.925
With so much to do in our life


00:42.925 --> 00:46.897
—not just in the ministry 
but also with secular work, 


00:46.897 --> 00:50.982
family responsibilities, 
for some, even health issues—


00:50.982 --> 00:53.704
we can get into a rut. 


00:53.703 --> 00:56.571
It’s not always easy to detect at first, 


00:56.572 --> 00:58.909
because in this age of technology 


00:58.908 --> 01:01.745
we always feel busy. 


01:01.745 --> 01:04.513
But what consumes our day? 


01:04.513 --> 01:06.850
Watch this one-minute video, 


01:06.850 --> 01:10.853
and try to detect what’s going on 
in the life of one brother. 


01:10.853 --> 01:13.055
His life is in a rut. 


01:13.055 --> 01:16.000
Try to figure out why. 


02:29.532 --> 02:32.769
Would you say 
that this brother’s life is in a rut? 


02:32.768 --> 02:34.903
Oh, he’s active all day


02:34.903 --> 02:37.340
—he always has something to do. 


02:37.340 --> 02:42.212
But it’s as if his mind 
has been kidnapped by his devices. 


02:42.212 --> 02:46.115
Have you ever had 
the experience of reading an e-mail 


02:46.115 --> 02:48.852
while someone 
is trying to tell you something? 


02:48.852 --> 02:50.854
It can be embarrassing 


02:50.853 --> 02:53.221
when you realize 
that they’ve asked you a question, 


02:53.222 --> 02:55.225
and they’re waiting for an answer, 


02:55.225 --> 02:57.393
but you have no idea what they asked. 


02:57.393 --> 02:59.395
It’s embarrassing, right? 


02:59.395 --> 03:05.502
But what if the person 
who is trying to speak to you is Jehovah? 


03:05.502 --> 03:08.004
Even though we aren’t doing anything wrong, 


03:08.003 --> 03:12.441
our daily routine 
can occupy our attention so much 


03:12.442 --> 03:17.880
that we are not able to hear 
the refreshing words of Jehovah. 


03:17.880 --> 03:20.383
That can happen to any one of us. 


03:20.383 --> 03:24.486
Even our spiritual activity 
can get into a rut. 


03:24.487 --> 03:27.824
One Christian sister described it this way: 


03:27.823 --> 03:30.025
“I would go out in service, 


03:30.025 --> 03:33.495
“go to meetings, study, pray 


03:33.495 --> 03:36.532
“—but I did it all on automatic control, 


03:36.532 --> 03:39.000
never feeling anything.” 


03:40.068 --> 03:42.538
Have you ever felt that way? 


03:42.538 --> 03:45.241
Do you see 
all the happy servants of Jehovah 


03:45.242 --> 03:48.712
whose experiences 
appear on JW Broadcasting, 


03:48.712 --> 03:50.714
and you say to yourself: 


03:50.713 --> 03:52.848
‘Why can’t I find that joy? 


03:52.848 --> 03:55.718
Why is my ministry in a rut?’ 


03:55.718 --> 03:58.721
Perhaps you feel 
like a remote-control train 


03:58.722 --> 04:01.490
that goes around and around on a track, 


04:01.490 --> 04:05.262
working the same territory, 
with the same partner, 


04:05.262 --> 04:07.930
saying the same thing at each door. 


04:07.930 --> 04:12.102
Of course, there’s nothing wrong 
with being in a good routine. 


04:12.102 --> 04:16.072
But being in a rut can sap our energy 


04:16.072 --> 04:18.909
and take the joy out of our service. 


04:18.908 --> 04:23.178
We could even come to view 
our ministry as boring. 


04:23.178 --> 04:27.683
Of course, we feel invigorated 
when we get good results: 


04:27.683 --> 04:30.381
We meet an interested person 
when going from door to door 


04:30.382 --> 04:32.222
—we’re invigorated! 


04:32.222 --> 04:34.624
An inactive person approaches the cart 


04:34.623 --> 04:37.060
and wants to get in touch 
with the local congregation 


04:37.060 --> 04:39.062
—we’re even more invigorated! 


04:39.062 --> 04:42.699
We start a Bible study 
—we’re on top of the world! 


04:42.698 --> 04:44.700
I’m sure you’ll agree, 


04:44.700 --> 04:48.437
all those outcomes 
are good reasons for joy. 


04:48.437 --> 04:51.975
The problem is 
that we’re not always in control 


04:51.975 --> 04:54.043
of getting those outcomes. 


04:54.043 --> 04:57.366
In real life, 
we may spend an entire morning 


04:57.367 --> 05:00.850
in the door-to-door work 
without meeting an interested person. 


05:00.850 --> 05:02.852
We may spend months 


05:02.852 --> 05:06.222
making return visits 
without starting a study. 


05:06.222 --> 05:10.960
And once again, 
our ministry can get into a rut. 


05:10.960 --> 05:12.945
Now, don’t misunderstand. 


05:12.945 --> 05:15.415
It’s not that we’re doing anything wrong, 


05:15.415 --> 05:20.018
but we’re not getting 
the full joy out of doing what’s right. 


05:20.018 --> 05:22.238
Of course, Satan would love it 


05:22.238 --> 05:25.558
if our service to Jehovah 
were to fall into a rut. 


05:25.558 --> 05:28.961
He would love it if we lost our joy. 


05:28.962 --> 05:32.465
If we lose our joy, we lose hope, 


05:32.465 --> 05:34.467
we lose strength, 


05:34.467 --> 05:38.487
and we might even begin 
to feel like giving up. 


05:38.487 --> 05:41.057
The point is this, brothers and sisters: 


05:41.057 --> 05:45.260
If you feel that your ministry 
has fallen into a rut, 


05:45.260 --> 05:48.363
don’t be discouraged and don’t give up. 


05:48.363 --> 05:51.683
There are ways 
that we can invigorate our ministry 


05:51.683 --> 05:54.570
and serve Jehovah with renewed joy.


05:54.570 --> 05:56.338
To illustrate that: 


05:56.338 --> 05:57.896
Maybe you’ve had 


05:57.897 --> 06:00.649
the frustrating experience 
of locking yourself 


06:00.648 --> 06:03.000
out of your house or apartment. 


06:04.232 --> 06:07.032
Of course, with a key, 
opening the door is simple. 


06:07.032 --> 06:10.470
A locked door 
might seem like an obstacle, 


06:10.470 --> 06:13.000
but it isn’t if you have the key. 


06:14.057 --> 06:17.127
And the same is true 
with invigorating our ministry. 


06:17.127 --> 06:19.345
If we’ve fallen into a rut 


06:19.345 --> 06:23.315
and if we’ve lost 
that feeling of joy in our service, 


06:23.315 --> 06:28.220
there are a number of keys 
that can help us unlock the door. 


06:28.220 --> 06:30.490
Let’s look at one.


06:30.490 --> 06:36.015
Open your Bible 
to 1 Corinthians 16:8, 9. 


06:36.015 --> 06:38.480
Now, in these verses, 


06:38.480 --> 06:42.602
the apostle Paul was presented 
with a key of opportunity, 


06:42.602 --> 06:45.639
and he used it to open a door. 


06:45.638 --> 06:49.798
First Corinthians 16:8, 9 says: 


06:49.798 --> 06:52.461
“But I am remaining in Ephesus 


06:52.462 --> 06:55.030
“until the Festival of Pentecost, 


06:55.030 --> 06:58.802
“because a large door that leads to activity 


06:58.802 --> 07:01.637
has been opened to me.” 


07:01.637 --> 07:04.624
Here, the apostle Paul found a key, 


07:04.623 --> 07:07.993
and it didn’t require 
moving to another location. 


07:07.993 --> 07:11.996
In this case, 
the key was to stay where he was 


07:11.997 --> 07:17.002
and to take full advantage 
of an opportunity right before him. 


07:17.002 --> 07:21.474
Sometimes, the key 
to getting out of a rut in our ministry 


07:21.473 --> 07:26.178
is to take advantage of opportunities 
we have right where we are. 


07:26.178 --> 07:30.498
For example, 
have you considered auxiliary pioneering 


07:30.498 --> 07:32.768
or regular pioneering? 


07:32.768 --> 07:34.946
What about learning a foreign language 


07:34.947 --> 07:39.475
with the goal of helping 
a nearby group or congregation? 


07:39.475 --> 07:44.263
Opening one door often leads 
to other doors of opportunity. 


07:44.263 --> 07:48.901
For example, 
a brother named Jacob wrote this: 


07:48.902 --> 07:53.397
“When I was seven, 
many of my classmates were Vietnamese. 


07:53.397 --> 07:55.792
“I wanted to tell them about Jehovah, 


07:55.792 --> 07:59.162
“so after a while 
I made plans to learn their language. 


07:59.162 --> 08:01.230
“For the most part, 


08:01.230 --> 08:04.330
“I learned by comparing 
the English and Vietnamese editions 


08:04.330 --> 08:06.202
“of The Watchtower. 


08:06.202 --> 08:10.674
“I also made friends in a nearby 
Vietnamese-language congregation. 


08:10.673 --> 08:14.043
“When I was 18, I started pioneering. 


08:14.043 --> 08:17.213
“Later, I attended 
the Bible School for Single Brothers. 


08:17.213 --> 08:20.933
“This helped me 
with my present pioneer assignment, 


08:20.933 --> 08:25.136
“where I am the only elder 
in a Vietnamese-language group. 


08:25.137 --> 08:29.664
“Many Vietnamese people are amazed 
that I have learned their language. 


08:29.663 --> 08:34.063
“They invite me in, 
and often I can study the Bible with them. 


08:34.063 --> 08:37.433
Some have progressed to baptism.” 


08:37.433 --> 08:42.455
The point is, 
our ministry is what we make it. 


08:42.455 --> 08:45.123
If we allow ourselves to remain in a rut, 


08:45.123 --> 08:47.141
it will be boring. 


08:47.142 --> 08:50.014
If we use our keys 
and if we take advantage 


08:50.013 --> 08:52.648
of opportunities that present themselves, 


08:52.648 --> 08:57.035
we will invigorate our ministry 
and give it new meaning. 


08:57.035 --> 09:01.440
This doesn’t always involve 
putting in more time in the ministry. 


09:01.440 --> 09:05.260
It could mean that we 
simply ‘make the best use of our time’ 


09:05.260 --> 09:09.265
as Ephesians 5:16 says. 


09:09.265 --> 09:11.747
In fact, there’s a saying: 


09:11.747 --> 09:15.387
“Don’t work harder; work smarter.” 


09:15.387 --> 09:17.490
The key to working smarter 


09:17.490 --> 09:20.275
could be as simple 
as switching things up a bit. 


09:20.275 --> 09:22.278
For example: 


09:22.278 --> 09:26.948
Could we work with different publishers 
instead of the same one all the time? 


09:26.948 --> 09:29.885
Could we try a different approach 
to our presentation, 


09:29.885 --> 09:34.090
perhaps making better use 
of the Bible or our videos? 


09:34.090 --> 09:37.058
Could we engage 
in other aspects of the ministry, 


09:37.058 --> 09:40.000
such as cart witnessing 
or phone witnessing? 


09:41.030 --> 09:44.217
Could we use our time 
more effectively to reach people 


09:44.217 --> 09:47.514
when they’re most likely to be home? 


09:47.513 --> 09:50.438
Here’s something else 
we could do to unlock a door 


09:50.438 --> 09:52.725
and invigorate our ministry. 


09:52.725 --> 09:59.000
Open your Bible to Acts 16:9, 10. 


10:00.482 --> 10:02.469
Now, here the apostle Paul found 


10:02.468 --> 10:06.238
a unique way to unlock 
a door to greater joy. 


10:06.238 --> 10:09.341
Acts 16:9, 10 says: 


10:09.342 --> 10:13.345
“And during the night 
a vision appeared to Paul 


10:13.345 --> 10:17.750
“—a Macedonian man 
was standing there urging him and saying: 


10:17.750 --> 10:21.653
“‘Step over into Macedonia and help us.’ 


10:21.653 --> 10:24.106
“As soon as he had seen the vision, 


10:24.107 --> 10:26.630
“we tried to go into Macedonia, 


10:26.630 --> 10:29.845
“drawing the conclusion 
that God had summoned us 


10:29.845 --> 10:32.000
to declare the good news to them.” 


10:33.215 --> 10:37.218
Notice, Paul didn’t think of all the reasons 


10:37.218 --> 10:39.721
he couldn’t step into Macedonia. 


10:39.722 --> 10:41.724
No, he took action 


10:41.723 --> 10:44.960
as soon as he was presented 
with the opportunity. 


10:44.960 --> 10:49.965
Paul unlocked the door 
to invigorate his ministry. 


10:49.965 --> 10:53.902
Sometimes we think 
that only those who are young 


10:53.902 --> 10:57.907
can reach out to pioneer 
or to serve where the need is greater. 


10:57.907 --> 11:01.414
But that’s not always the case. 


11:01.413 --> 11:06.448
You parents may be able to unlock 
a door of opportunity for yourselves, 


11:06.448 --> 11:11.453
and think of the example 
you set for your children when you do so. 


11:11.453 --> 11:16.458
That’s what a mother named Tara discovered: 


11:16.458 --> 11:19.695
“I started pioneering 
when my youngest daughter 


11:19.695 --> 11:22.498
was in elementary school,” she says. 


11:22.498 --> 11:24.566
“It was important to me 


11:24.567 --> 11:27.937
“that my children see me serving Jehovah 


11:27.937 --> 11:32.000
to the best of my ability 
as I encouraged them to reach out.” 


11:33.363 --> 11:35.376
Tara’s husband, Anthony, 


11:35.377 --> 11:38.080
saw the effect 
that his wife’s pioneering had 


11:38.080 --> 11:41.167
and, in time, 
he too joined the ranks. 


11:41.167 --> 11:43.402
This is what he said: 


11:43.402 --> 11:45.420
“When Tara became a pioneer, 


11:45.420 --> 11:47.690
“it made an immediate impact 


11:47.690 --> 11:50.625
“on daughters number one and number two, 


11:50.625 --> 11:53.028
“and they became pioneers. 


11:53.028 --> 11:55.013
“When I became a pioneer, 


11:55.013 --> 11:57.983
“daughters number three 
and number four followed. 


11:57.983 --> 12:01.853
“I wish I had pursued 
full-time service sooner, 


12:01.853 --> 12:07.710
as it made a huge impact 
on the spirituality of the family.” 


12:07.710 --> 12:09.978
I can relate to this experience 


12:09.978 --> 12:13.381
because of the good example of my parents. 


12:13.382 --> 12:16.085
My mother was baptized in Canada 


12:16.085 --> 12:19.505
in 1940 when she was 16. 


12:19.505 --> 12:23.425
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
had just been banned in Canada. 


12:23.425 --> 12:25.660
Her father had already died, 


12:25.660 --> 12:28.663
and her mother was opposed at that time. 


12:28.663 --> 12:31.200
The brothers had very little money, 


12:31.200 --> 12:35.037
but they encouraged 
my mother to pursue spiritual goals. 


12:35.037 --> 12:37.022
With that encouragement, 


12:37.022 --> 12:39.925
she started pioneering in 1942 


12:39.925 --> 12:43.345
while the ban was still on in Canada. 


12:43.345 --> 12:47.833
In 1947, she was invited 
to become a special pioneer 


12:47.833 --> 12:50.168
in the province of Quebec. 


12:50.168 --> 12:53.371
At that time, 
special pioneers were required 


12:53.372 --> 12:57.694
to spend 200 hours 
each month in the ministry. 


12:57.693 --> 13:01.646
With basically no money 
and no family support, 


13:01.647 --> 13:03.915
she accepted that assignment. 


13:03.915 --> 13:07.580
This picture was taken 
when she and her pioneer partner 


13:07.580 --> 13:10.430
were boarding the train to Quebec. 


13:10.430 --> 13:12.692
Whenever I see this picture, 


13:12.692 --> 13:16.612
it reminds me 
of the intrepid spirit that my mother had 


13:16.612 --> 13:20.482
—not being afraid 
to take on a challenging assignment, 


13:20.482 --> 13:24.287
but putting complete trust in Jehovah. 


13:24.287 --> 13:28.424
That spirit encourages me even to this day. 


13:28.423 --> 13:31.060
My father has that same spirit. 


13:31.060 --> 13:35.363
In the summer of 1976, 
when I was 11 years old, 


13:35.363 --> 13:39.435
a new arrangement was announced 
at our district convention 


13:39.435 --> 13:41.670
—auxiliary pioneering. 


13:41.670 --> 13:44.105
You could be an auxiliary pioneer 


13:44.105 --> 13:48.277
if you could devote 60 hours 
in one month to the ministry. 


13:48.277 --> 13:52.882
The month of October 1976 
had five weekends. 


13:52.882 --> 13:56.135
My father encouraged 
our whole congregation 


13:56.135 --> 13:58.837
to try auxiliary pioneering that month. 


13:58.837 --> 14:02.274
So many brothers and sisters, including me, 


14:02.273 --> 14:05.310
decided to get a taste of pioneering. 


14:05.310 --> 14:07.880
It was a wonderful experience 


14:07.880 --> 14:10.495
that I will never forget. 


14:10.495 --> 14:14.912
Parents, your good example 
will help your children 


14:14.912 --> 14:19.945
to have a living ministry 
of their own that they will love. 


14:19.945 --> 14:23.695
Brothers and sisters, 
if you find yourself in a rut, 


14:23.695 --> 14:26.048
there is no reason to stay there. 


14:26.048 --> 14:30.218
We’ve discussed several ways 
to reinvigorate our ministry, 


14:30.218 --> 14:41.146
and with Jehovah’s help 
we will be successful.
