00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:03.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:06.027 line:10% position:50% align:center
Since our last update,

00:00:06.027 --> 00:00:09.239 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’ve had five more special conventions.

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:11.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were held in the following locations:

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prague, Czech Republic;

00:00:14.953 --> 00:00:17.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Helsinki, Finland;

00:00:17.456 --> 00:00:20.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
Budapest, Hungary;

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reykjavik, Iceland;

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Zurich, Switzerland.

00:00:25.464 --> 00:00:28.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Delegates came from over 30 countries.

00:00:28.718 --> 00:00:32.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a joy to see
the love and unity of Jehovah’s people.

00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:37.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
A total of 578 were baptized
at these conventions.

00:00:39.521 --> 00:00:43.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
A highlight
of the special convention in Iceland

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:46.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the release of the complete
<i>New World Translation</i>  in Icelandic.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
The rich spiritual food
at this year’s convention

00:00:51.326 --> 00:00:54.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
refreshes and strengthens us

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:56.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep declaring the good news.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, as we think about the ministry,

00:01:00.753 --> 00:01:04.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have in mind the new service year
that’s approaching rapidly.

00:01:05.007 --> 00:01:08.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’ll remember
that beginning September 1,

00:01:08.428 --> 00:01:11.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will have an exciting worldwide campaign

00:01:11.264 --> 00:01:13.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offer Bible studies.

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:16.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good for us to begin preparing now.

00:01:17.938 --> 00:01:20.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the campaign,
we’ll offer Bible studies

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
to as many people as possible,

00:01:23.193 --> 00:01:25.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
using the <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i> brochure.

00:01:26.822 --> 00:01:30.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
For that month,
auxiliary pioneers will have the option

00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:33.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
of choosing either a 15-hour requirement

00:01:33.496 --> 00:01:35.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a 30-hour requirement.

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:38.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not take a few minutes this week

00:01:38.377 --> 00:01:41.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
to look at your schedule for September?

00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:45.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayerfully consider if you can expand
your ministry that month.

00:01:46.802 --> 00:01:50.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also have something
very encouraging to share with you.

00:01:50.848 --> 00:01:53.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
On Sunday, July 28,

00:01:53.184 --> 00:01:57.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
we reached a special landmark
with regard to Bible translation.

00:01:58.231 --> 00:02:00.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>New World Translation</i>

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:03.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
is now available in whole or in part

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 300 languages.

00:02:06.323 --> 00:02:08.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

00:02:08.993 --> 00:02:13.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have so many exciting things happening
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:02:15.208 --> 00:02:17.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now for the rest of our update,

00:02:17.961 --> 00:02:22.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to speak with you
about an important topic:

00:02:22.341 --> 00:02:25.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
the need to remain focused on God’s Kingdom

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the real solution to mankind’s problems.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:33.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
This vital truth helps us to stay neutral

00:02:33.144 --> 00:02:35.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the world’s political issues.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year’s regional convention

00:02:39.234 --> 00:02:41.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to keep this point in mind.

00:02:41.903 --> 00:02:45.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the convention, we get to enjoy Episode 1

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
of <i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

00:02:48.577 --> 00:02:51.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminds us how
the appearance of the Messiah

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:53.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
was such good news.

00:02:54.834 --> 00:02:57.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jesus’ arrival on the earth,

00:02:57.295 --> 00:03:01.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
all the promises of God
would now come true through him.

00:03:02.551 --> 00:03:04.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what would these promises include?

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:10.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
That the real solution to mankind’s problems
—God’s Kingdom—

00:03:10.017 --> 00:03:13.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be established with Jesus as King.

00:03:15.231 --> 00:03:18.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
What qualities does Jesus manifest as King?

00:03:19.235 --> 00:03:21.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 9:6, 7

00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
prophetically describes Jesus this way:

00:03:25.367 --> 00:03:28.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For a child has been born to us,

00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:30.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a son has been given to us;

00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:34.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the rulership will rest on his shoulder.

00:03:34.335 --> 00:03:37.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His name will be called Wonderful Counselor,

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To the increase
of his rulership and to peace,

00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:46.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there will be no end,

00:03:46.807 --> 00:03:49.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
“on the throne of David and on his kingdom

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to establish it firmly
and to sustain it

00:03:53.522 --> 00:03:55.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through justice and righteousness,

00:03:55.983 --> 00:03:59.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from now on and forever.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
The zeal of Jehovah of armies will do this.”

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:07.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
These verses show us that Jesus’ rulership

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:12.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
is characterized by peace,
justice, and righteousness.

00:04:13.085 --> 00:04:16.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his rulership will continue forever.

00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
How reassuring that is!

00:04:20.635 --> 00:04:22.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re grateful to know that God’s Kingdom

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:25.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
is already established in heaven.

00:04:25.432 --> 00:04:28.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is already the <i>real, </i>permanent<i> </i>solution

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all of the problems of the human family.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:36.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we need to keep
this reality clearly in mind.

00:04:37.403 --> 00:04:39.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:04:39.238 --> 00:04:41.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because the times we live in

00:04:41.407 --> 00:04:44.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
can make it challenging
to keep focused on God’s Kingdom

00:04:44.953 --> 00:04:48.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the real solution to all of our problems.

00:04:49.666 --> 00:04:52.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are many things
that divide the world today.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s so much unrest and many conflicts.

00:04:57.425 --> 00:05:00.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s constant effort
to make people take sides

00:05:00.845 --> 00:05:04.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
on political questions and even elections.

00:05:05.225 --> 00:05:09.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it’s estimated
that billions of people

00:05:09.604 --> 00:05:12.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nearly half the earth’s population—

00:05:12.024 --> 00:05:14.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
live in countries where there will be

00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:18.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
or have been political elections this year.

00:05:19.866 --> 00:05:22.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also see an increase of nationalism

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
and patriotic ceremonies,
including in schools.

00:05:27.374 --> 00:05:31.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even sporting events
can stir up nationalistic divisions.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of these things
are in the news every day.

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world is facing unprecedented problems,

00:05:42.223 --> 00:05:46.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and imperfect humans
have many ideas on how to solve them.

00:05:48.021 --> 00:05:50.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:05:50.273 --> 00:05:53.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do we view these divisive topics?

00:05:54.153 --> 00:05:57.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we don’t get involved in politics.

00:05:58.073 --> 00:06:00.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
We remember Jesus’ words

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:03.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
at John 18:36, where he said:

00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:07.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My Kingdom is no part of this world.”

00:06:08.585 --> 00:06:13.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, we give
our wholehearted allegiance to that Kingdom

00:06:13.423 --> 00:06:17.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and do not become involved
in the politics of this world.

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Romans 13:1, 2 indicate

00:06:22.975 --> 00:06:24.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the secular authorities

00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:28.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“stand placed
in their relative positions by God.”

00:06:29.774 --> 00:06:32.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we appreciate and deeply respect

00:06:32.986 --> 00:06:35.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
the role that governments have today.

00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:41.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is in harmony with Jesus’ words
recorded at Matthew 22:21,

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:44.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
where he said:
“Pay back, therefore,

00:06:44.332 --> 00:06:48.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Caesar’s things to Caesar,
but God’s things to God.”

00:06:50.005 --> 00:06:51.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
So while we show honor

00:06:51.923 --> 00:06:55.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
to those who hold positions of authority
in the government,

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:59.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t get involved
in political issues or debates,

00:06:59.598 --> 00:07:04.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how right or just
a particular cause may seem.

00:07:05.605 --> 00:07:10.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
We “keep on . . . seeking first
[God’s] Kingdom and his righteousness.”

00:07:11.903 --> 00:07:15.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that is the real solution,

00:07:15.324 --> 00:07:20.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we don’t take sides
on the world’s issues, even mentally.

00:07:20.246 --> 00:07:24.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t favor one candidate
or political party over another,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
regardless of whether they seem
to support or oppose our interests.

00:07:30.715 --> 00:07:34.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
We keep focused on the <i>real</i>  solution

00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:38.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
—God’s Kingdom in the hands of Christ Jesus.

00:07:40.517 --> 00:07:43.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us to protect our neutrality?

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll briefly mention two ways:

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:50.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we can spend more time

00:07:50.153 --> 00:07:53.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>focusing</i>  on the solution
than on the problem.

00:07:54.282 --> 00:07:57.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
And second, we can spend more time

00:07:57.202 --> 00:08:00.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>talking </i> about the solution than the problem.

00:08:01.915 --> 00:08:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss the first way.

00:08:04.627 --> 00:08:06.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can help us to spend more time

00:08:06.963 --> 00:08:10.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
focusing on the solution
rather than the problem?

00:08:11.634 --> 00:08:14.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daily Bible reading and meditation.

00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:18.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
That will help us
to keep our spiritual armor intact.

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:20.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we safeguard our heart

00:08:20.936 --> 00:08:23.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
by limiting how much time we spend

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:28.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
listening to or reading news
and social media websites,

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
which can leave us anxious,
depressed, and even exhausted.

00:08:33.658 --> 00:08:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
A second way we can protect our neutrality

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to spend more time
talking about the solution than the problem.

00:08:42.876 --> 00:08:46.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it true that our speech
indicates what’s in our heart?

00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:50.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if we freely express strong opinions

00:08:50.802 --> 00:08:54.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding this world’s elections, wars,
or other political matters?

00:08:55.849 --> 00:09:00.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Might that indicate
that our neutrality has weakened?

00:09:01.438 --> 00:09:04.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
This could be like
a warning indicator light on a car.

00:09:05.484 --> 00:09:07.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our speech might indicate

00:09:07.486 --> 00:09:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we need to give
our neutrality some attention.

00:09:12.158 --> 00:09:14.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best way to talk about the solution

00:09:14.828 --> 00:09:17.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by preaching the good news
of God’s Kingdom.

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
This helps us to stay focused.

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:26.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re convinced that Jehovah
will remedy all injustices that we face.

00:09:27.633 --> 00:09:31.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Preaching helps us
to keep our hope clear in mind.

00:09:31.262 --> 00:09:36.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hope is an anchor
that stabilizes us during turbulent times.

00:09:37.102 --> 00:09:42.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
It prevents us from drifting away
from Jehovah or his organization.

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we continue to do all these things,

00:09:46.403 --> 00:09:51.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll remain neutral
regarding this world’s politics

00:09:51.409 --> 00:09:55.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll stay focused on the real solution

00:09:55.872 --> 00:09:57.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
—God’s Kingdom.

00:09:59.459 --> 00:10:02.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
is sharing these important reminders

00:10:02.963 --> 00:10:05.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Satan, “the ruler of this world,”

00:10:05.465 --> 00:10:09.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
is pressuring Jehovah’s people
like never before.

00:10:10.304 --> 00:10:13.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Devil wants us
to take sides on these issues.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:19.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we do, we are no longer neutral.

00:10:20.482 --> 00:10:22.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could even find ourselves

00:10:22.567 --> 00:10:26.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
taking a stand against Jehovah
and against his Kingdom.

00:10:27.614 --> 00:10:29.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
In effect, we could be acting

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:33.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
as though we think the Devil
has the solution to our problems.

00:10:33.579 --> 00:10:35.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never would we want that to happen!

00:10:36.791 --> 00:10:39.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, dear brothers and sisters,

00:10:39.043 --> 00:10:43.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is a matter that requires
our careful and prayerful attention.

00:10:45.467 --> 00:10:49.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help us keep
the real solution clearly in mind,

00:10:49.263 --> 00:10:53.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
make it a priority to have a personal
or Family Worship study project

00:10:53.809 --> 00:10:56.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the topic of neutrality.

00:10:57.271 --> 00:10:59.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are a few ideas:

00:10:59.732 --> 00:11:02.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the book <i>Scriptures for Christian Living</i>,

00:11:03.194 --> 00:11:04.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could review the information

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
about “Governments.”

00:11:07.074 --> 00:11:10.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find this publication in <i>JW Library</i>®,

00:11:10.411 --> 00:11:13.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to the Library tab,

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:17.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Publications, then Books.

00:11:18.753 --> 00:11:20.630 line:10% position:50% align:center
Another idea is to review

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:22.465 line:10% position:50% align:center
the October 2023

00:11:22.465 --> 00:11:24.801 line:10% position:50% align:center
<i>Watchtower </i> study article entitled

00:11:24.801 --> 00:11:27.012 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Are You ‘Ready to Obey’?”

00:11:28.096 --> 00:11:32.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
The March 2019 edition of JW Broadcasting®

00:11:32.017 --> 00:11:34.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
had an excellent discussion about neutrality.

00:11:35.563 --> 00:11:37.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find this in <i>JW Library,</i>

00:11:37.732 --> 00:11:39.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
go to the Library tab,

00:11:39.567 --> 00:11:44.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Video, JW Broadcasting,

00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:47.492 line:10% position:50% align:center
and then look under Monthly Programs.

00:11:47.492 --> 00:11:50.078 line:10% position:50% align:center
Or on jw.org,

00:11:50.078 --> 00:11:53.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
search for “March 2019 broadcast.”

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:56.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, on jw.org

00:11:56.961 --> 00:11:58.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you search “Neutrality,”

00:11:58.504 --> 00:11:59.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll find many other

00:11:59.964 --> 00:12:01.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
helpful videos and articles.

00:12:03.927 --> 00:12:07.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can be sure that Jehovah’s heart rejoices

00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:11.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see millions of people
from all nations of the earth

00:12:11.185 --> 00:12:14.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
united in worshipping him, remaining neutral,

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:18.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
and declaring the real solution
to mankind’s problems

00:12:18.651 --> 00:12:21.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the good news of God’s Kingdom.

00:12:22.530 --> 00:12:27.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
please know that we love you all very much.

00:12:28.703 --> 00:12:31.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:12:31.957 --> 00:12:34.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
