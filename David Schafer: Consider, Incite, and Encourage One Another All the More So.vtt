00:00.550 --> 00:03.420
Our theme for this month 


00:03.420 --> 00:08.425
is “Consider, Incite, and Encourage 
One Another All the More So.” 


00:08.425 --> 00:11.962
JW Broadcasting


00:11.962 --> 00:14.764
—why do we enjoy it so much? 


00:14.763 --> 00:19.435
Many of you have expressed 
how the monthly broadcast draws you closer


00:19.435 --> 00:22.572
to our brothers and sisters 
and to Jehovah’s organization. 


00:22.572 --> 00:27.577
If you’re homebound or isolated, 
you especially treasure these programs. 


00:27.577 --> 00:32.182
And yet, while we appreciate 
the advances in technology 


00:32.182 --> 00:36.585
that have made all of this possible, 
we know that your sincere desire 


00:36.585 --> 00:39.788
is to be present 
with your brothers and sisters in person 


00:39.788 --> 00:42.258
at our congregation meetings.


00:42.258 --> 00:46.461
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
around the world share this feeling. 


00:46.462 --> 00:50.467
In northern Finland, for example, 
winters are especially cold, 


00:50.467 --> 00:52.469
even by Finnish standards. 


00:52.468 --> 00:56.638
At times, temperatures plummet 
to minus 50 degrees Celsius, 


00:56.638 --> 00:59.641
or minus 58 degrees Fahrenheit! 


00:59.642 --> 01:03.179
Under those conditions, 
it’s very difficult to drive, 


01:03.178 --> 01:05.581
much less walk long distances. 


01:05.582 --> 01:09.119
Still, the brothers love 
to gather together. 


01:09.118 --> 01:11.120
How do they manage it? 


01:11.120 --> 01:15.258
In one small village, there is a brother 
who lives near the Kingdom Hall 


01:15.258 --> 01:17.393
and has a warm garage. 


01:17.393 --> 01:19.528
On meeting nights, he uses his car 


01:19.528 --> 01:22.931
to bring each family 
in the congregation to the hall. 


01:22.932 --> 01:27.737
Then he parks in his garage and runs 
the short distance back to the Kingdom Hall.


01:27.737 --> 01:32.742
When the meeting is over, he returns 
all the friends safely to their homes.


01:32.742 --> 01:36.479
In the Bible, 
gatherings for pure worship 


01:36.478 --> 01:41.016
were occasions for personal association 
with fellow believers. 


01:41.017 --> 01:44.987
Such association required travel 
to a designated place. 


01:44.987 --> 01:49.792
This involved work, 
sacrifice, even risk. 


01:49.792 --> 01:54.797
Consider what is stated 
at Exodus 34:24. 


01:54.797 --> 01:59.335
This verse has to do with the command 
that every Israelite male 


01:59.335 --> 02:03.740
should gather three times a year 
for the festivals in Jerusalem. 


02:03.740 --> 02:06.675
What would that mean 
in practical terms? 


02:06.675 --> 02:08.945
Wouldn’t the nation 
be left vulnerable to attack


02:08.945 --> 02:11.480
if no men were left 
to guard the land?


02:11.480 --> 02:13.950
And if word spread 
among the surrounding nations 


02:13.950 --> 02:16.485
that practically everyone 
congregated in Jerusalem 


02:16.485 --> 02:20.490
three times a year, 
like clockwork, year after year, 


02:20.490 --> 02:23.425
wouldn’t it be just a matter of time 
before some invading army 


02:23.425 --> 02:26.428
would come 
and pillage an Israelite city? 


02:26.428 --> 02:29.331
At Exodus 34:24, 


02:29.332 --> 02:33.604
we find 
Jehovah’s remarkable answer: 


02:33.603 --> 02:37.773
“For I will drive the nations 
away from before you, 


02:37.773 --> 02:42.445
and I will enlarge your territory, 
and nobody will desire,” 


02:42.445 --> 02:45.915
yes, even desire, “your land 


02:45.915 --> 02:49.418
“while you are going up to see 
the face of Jehovah your God 


02:49.418 --> 02:51.420
three times a year.”


02:51.420 --> 02:54.557
Jehovah kept that promise. 


02:54.557 --> 02:59.562
It’s a historical fact 
that from 1513 B.C.E. 


02:59.562 --> 03:04.600
all the way down to 66 C.E. 
no foreign nation ever came 


03:04.600 --> 03:09.405
to invade Israelite territory 
during those three annual festivals. 


03:09.405 --> 03:12.742
Jehovah placed high value 
on having his people 


03:12.742 --> 03:16.479
gather together 
in the same space. 


03:16.478 --> 03:19.615
In the Christian era, 
the apostle Paul wrote 


03:19.615 --> 03:23.887
at 1 Corinthians 14:23 
about ‘the whole congregation 


03:23.887 --> 03:26.455
coming together to one place.’


03:26.455 --> 03:31.227
Now, although modern broadcasting 
technology didn’t exist in those days, 


03:31.227 --> 03:36.232
there were other viable methods 
of communicating, such as writing letters, 


03:36.232 --> 03:40.437
that didn’t require people to be physically 
present in the same location.


03:40.437 --> 03:44.640
Still, the apostle John, 
though a capable writer, 


03:44.640 --> 03:48.343
preferred face-to-face interchange 
with fellow Christians 


03:48.343 --> 03:52.381
as he expressed 
at 2 John 12.


03:52.382 --> 03:54.384
Or consider what is stated 


03:54.383 --> 03:57.953
at Job 1:6: 


03:57.953 --> 04:02.558
“Now the day came 
when the sons of the true God 


04:02.558 --> 04:06.161
entered to take their station 
before Jehovah.”


04:06.162 --> 04:09.965
Job 2:1 speaks 
of another such day. 


04:09.965 --> 04:11.968
Just imagine! 


04:11.968 --> 04:13.970
Here Jehovah himself, 


04:13.970 --> 04:18.007
though having all conceivable methods 
of communication at his disposal, 


04:18.007 --> 04:22.079
set specific days 
for his spirit creatures in heaven 


04:22.078 --> 04:25.146
to assemble 
in his immediate presence. 


04:25.147 --> 04:29.952
Clearly, the Scriptures encourage 
regular personal association 


04:29.952 --> 04:31.955
with fellow servants of God.


04:31.955 --> 04:36.425
Virtual attendance through modern 
communication technology has value, 


04:36.425 --> 04:40.830
and we’re happy to use it, 
but it’s no substitute for being together. 


04:40.830 --> 04:42.832
And why not? 


04:42.832 --> 04:46.569
Because of what association 
with the congregation achieves. 


04:46.568 --> 04:50.773
It’s not just that we receive nutritious 
and varied spiritual food. 


04:50.773 --> 04:55.110
Meetings inform us, 
but so does JW Broadcasting. 


04:55.110 --> 04:59.582
Meetings encourage us, 
but so does JW Broadcasting. 


04:59.582 --> 05:04.320
Fellow Christians who offer comments 
and sing from the heart build us up, 


05:04.320 --> 05:08.323
and yet we can hear that also 
on JW Broadcasting. 


05:08.323 --> 05:12.328
It’s when we’re together
—all together in one place—


05:12.328 --> 05:15.130
that others can hear us 
and draw encouragement 


05:15.130 --> 05:19.768
from our heartfelt convictions, 
our smile, our handshake. 


05:19.768 --> 05:23.371
Meetings give us opportunities 
to show our brothers and sisters 


05:23.372 --> 05:27.577
that we esteem them 
as worthy of our time, 


05:27.577 --> 05:30.414
attention, and concern. 


05:30.413 --> 05:34.550
That is why we go and visit our brothers 
who are homebound or isolated 


05:34.550 --> 05:38.822
because we want to show them 
that we love them.


05:38.822 --> 05:42.225
Moreover, in a special way, 


05:42.225 --> 05:46.762
our meetings bring us 
under the influence of holy spirit. 


05:46.762 --> 05:49.699
At Revelation 2:7, 


05:49.698 --> 05:52.635
the glorified Jesus said: 


05:52.635 --> 05:56.105
“Let the one 
who has an ear hear 


05:56.105 --> 06:00.510
what the spirit says 
to the congregations.”


06:00.510 --> 06:04.280
We need that spirit 
to help us resist temptation, 


06:04.280 --> 06:07.350
to embolden and equip us 
for the ministry, 


06:07.350 --> 06:10.953
and to enable us 
to make sound decisions.


06:10.953 --> 06:14.756
Still, there’s a reason 
to attend meetings 


06:14.757 --> 06:17.694
that’s even more important 
than the pleasant company, 


06:17.693 --> 06:20.596
the peaceful atmosphere, 
the genuine refreshment, 


06:20.597 --> 06:23.665
the sense of belonging, 
the opportunities to give, 


06:23.665 --> 06:25.868
or even the fact that meetings 
are a means by which 


06:25.868 --> 06:28.070
we receive 
Jehovah’s holy spirit. 


06:28.070 --> 06:30.807
The key reason 
why we gather together 


06:30.807 --> 06:34.410
is stated at Psalm 26:12: 


06:34.410 --> 06:39.048
“My foot is standing 
on level ground; 


06:39.048 --> 06:44.086
in the great congregation, 
I will praise Jehovah.”


06:44.087 --> 06:47.957
Yes, the principal reason 
why we gather together in person 


06:47.957 --> 06:51.027
is to give Jehovah what he deserves


06:51.027 --> 06:55.030
—praise, glory, yes, worship.


06:55.030 --> 06:57.700
Our meeting attendance 
shows Jehovah 


06:57.700 --> 07:01.437
that we want to draw close 
to him and his Son. 


07:01.437 --> 07:05.842
In his abundant love, Jehovah invites 
many more to serve him and keep living. 


07:05.842 --> 07:07.844
Because he lives eternally, 


07:07.843 --> 07:11.713
Jehovah can nurture 
those relationships forever. 


07:11.713 --> 07:14.950
The Adversary can offer 
no such hope of endless life, 


07:14.950 --> 07:18.020
so he promotes selfishness, 
pride, and other negative traits 


07:18.020 --> 07:21.290
that isolate people from one another, 
even when they are in the same room, 


07:21.290 --> 07:23.758
engaged in the same activities. 


07:23.758 --> 07:27.863
In contrast, our great God 
is drawing his people 


07:27.863 --> 07:30.733
closer to himself, 
to his Son, 


07:30.733 --> 07:34.670
and to one another 
so that we “may all be one,” 


07:34.670 --> 07:39.142
as Jesus prayed 
as recorded at John 17:21.


07:39.142 --> 07:41.977
And it’s not just the act 
of converging 


07:41.977 --> 07:44.847
on the same location 
that unites us either. 


07:44.847 --> 07:48.784
Lots of people coexist in the same space 
when they go to a market, 


07:48.783 --> 07:52.155
attend a sporting event, 
or use public transportation. 


07:52.155 --> 07:55.658
Crowding of itself 
does not equate with unity. 


07:55.658 --> 07:59.661
What makes the true 
Christian congregation different? 


07:59.662 --> 08:01.997
Notice how Hebrews chapter 10, 


08:01.997 --> 08:05.669
verses 24 and 25 
answers this question. 


08:05.668 --> 08:09.605
Now here we find 
the divinely inspired standard 


08:09.605 --> 08:12.342
for all our gatherings: 


08:12.342 --> 08:16.945
“And let us 
consider one another so as to incite 


08:16.945 --> 08:21.950
“to love and fine works, 
not forsaking our meeting together, 


08:21.950 --> 08:25.487
“as some have the custom, 
but encouraging one another, 


08:25.487 --> 08:28.224
“and all the more so as you see 


08:28.223 --> 08:31.060
the day drawing near.”


08:31.060 --> 08:34.863
Now, what does it mean 
to “consider one another”? 


08:34.863 --> 08:38.200
What does it mean 
“to incite to love and fine works”? 


08:38.200 --> 08:42.205
And in what way might we 
‘encourage one another’? 


08:42.205 --> 08:45.608
The verb “consider” 
could also be rendered 


08:45.608 --> 08:48.410
“be concerned about; 
pay attention to.” 


08:48.410 --> 08:50.880
So when 
we “consider one another,” 


08:50.880 --> 08:54.417
we show interest 
that goes far beyond a brief greeting. 


08:54.417 --> 08:58.154
And when we pay careful attention 
to one another, we’re better prepared 


08:58.153 --> 09:03.091
to incite, that is, to motivate one another, 
to stir one another to action. 


09:03.092 --> 09:05.360
And how might we do this? 


09:05.360 --> 09:08.697
Not by making comparisons 
or shaming our brothers, 


09:08.697 --> 09:11.034
for that would hardly be 
“encouraging one another,” 


09:11.033 --> 09:14.570
we endeavor to lift one another’s hearts 
when we’re together. 


09:14.570 --> 09:17.707
And when we do this 
to the best of our ability, 


09:17.707 --> 09:21.377
then we can be confident 
that Jehovah’s spirit will do the rest, 


09:21.377 --> 09:24.714
and that our brothers 
will feel strengthened.


09:24.713 --> 09:27.148
It’s evident, then, 
that true worship 


09:27.148 --> 09:31.953
means participation; 
it requires a response. 


09:31.953 --> 09:36.625
Another noteworthy example of this 
is the encouragement we both give 


09:36.625 --> 09:40.462
and receive when we sing together 
with our brothers and sisters. 


09:40.462 --> 09:44.467
In ancient Israel, 
at times they had a chorus, 


09:44.467 --> 09:46.935
such as the one described 
in Nehemiah chapter 12 


09:46.935 --> 09:50.072
that we talked about 
in our midweek meeting back in February. 


09:50.072 --> 09:54.210
Much of Israel’s group singing 
was antiphonal, 


09:54.210 --> 09:58.547
that is, some of the singers 
prompted others to respond. 


09:58.547 --> 10:02.285
For instance, Psalm 106 
which begins and ends with the words 


10:02.285 --> 10:04.687
“Praise Jah!” or “Hallelujah!” 


10:04.687 --> 10:09.659
encouraged the people 
to say in response: “Amen!” 


10:09.658 --> 10:12.661
Psalm 136 was written 


10:12.662 --> 10:16.532
to allow for different choruses 
to answer one another. 


10:16.532 --> 10:19.735
Now just imagine 
responding choruses 


10:19.735 --> 10:23.305
singing these alternating lines: 


10:23.305 --> 10:27.242
“Give thanks to Jehovah, for he is good; 


10:27.242 --> 10:30.312
“his loyal love endures forever. 


10:30.312 --> 10:33.115
“Give thanks to the God of gods, 


10:33.115 --> 10:35.985
“for his loyal love endures forever. 


10:35.985 --> 10:38.787
“Give thanks to the Lord of lords, 


10:38.787 --> 10:41.590
for his loyal love endures forever.”


10:41.590 --> 10:45.260
And on it went for 26 verses!


10:45.260 --> 10:48.330
To this day, 
singing demonstrates 


10:48.330 --> 10:52.468
our heartfelt response 
to the goodness of Jehovah. 


10:52.468 --> 10:55.938
What a joy it is to sing 
in company with others who are moved 


10:55.938 --> 10:59.608
to pour out the depths 
of their feelings to Jehovah! 


10:59.608 --> 11:03.678
And now at our Kingdom Halls, 
we’re accompanied by orchestral renderings


11:03.678 --> 11:06.815
of many of our songs
—another reason to sing out 


11:06.815 --> 11:10.018
at our midweek
and weekend meetings.


11:10.018 --> 11:14.023
And speaking of the midweek meeting, 
how are you enjoying the new format? 


11:14.023 --> 11:18.226
More of the program is devoted 
to delving into the Bible itself. 


11:18.227 --> 11:21.630
Time spent on preparing us 
for our public ministry 


11:21.630 --> 11:26.635
focuses more than ever 
on situations we face in field service. 


11:26.635 --> 11:30.572
And the meetings move along 
at a satisfying pace.


11:30.572 --> 11:35.577
Yes, JW Broadcasting 
is a wonderful blessing, 


11:35.577 --> 11:39.582
a powerful means to talk to 
and fortify our brothers 


11:39.582 --> 11:42.250
around the world
—simultaneously. 


11:42.250 --> 11:46.322
Still, nothing can replace 
the experience 


11:46.322 --> 11:48.524
of worshipping Jehovah 
in concert 


11:48.523 --> 11:52.395
with our fellow servants of God 
at congregation meetings. 


11:52.395 --> 11:57.132
When a meeting concludes 
and we lift our heads 


11:57.132 --> 12:01.670
after the final prayer, 
we find ourselves surrounded 


12:01.670 --> 12:06.075
by others who love Jehovah 
and support his sovereignty.


12:06.075 --> 12:08.477
These important benefits 
are detailed 


12:08.477 --> 12:11.547
in the April 2016 
study article 


12:11.547 --> 12:14.417
“Why Should We Meet 
Together for Worship?” 


12:14.417 --> 12:18.154
This month, we’re studying 
that article worldwide. 


12:18.153 --> 12:21.556
Later, in October, 
we begin a special campaign 


12:21.557 --> 12:24.694
to invite the public 
to our meetings. 


12:24.693 --> 12:28.363
If you do not yet regularly associate 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses 


12:28.363 --> 12:33.035
or if you travel away 
from your congregation, use jw.org 


12:33.035 --> 12:35.303
to find a meeting you can attend. 


12:35.303 --> 12:38.273
Click: “About Us,” “Meetings,” 


12:38.273 --> 12:40.608
and “Find a Location Near You”

as we see 
the day drawing near.’
