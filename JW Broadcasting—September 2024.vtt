In this month’s program,

00:00:03.232 --> 00:00:07.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll learn how Jehovah
is there for us when life feels unfair.

00:00:09.155 --> 00:00:11.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a new episode of <i>Imitate Their Faith,</i>

00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:16.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see how Miriam 
accepted discipline with humility.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did two teens promote real change

00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:23.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they were surrounded by injustice?

00:00:23.586 --> 00:00:27.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see in our next installment
of <i>Reasons for Faith.</i>

00:00:28.925 --> 00:00:32.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our music video
will show how Jehovah empowers us

00:00:32.136 --> 00:00:34.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we feel overwhelmed.

00:00:35.431 --> 00:00:38.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:00.623 line:10% position:50% align:center
Do you ever feel disadvantaged?

00:01:00.623 --> 00:01:02.459 line:10% position:50% align:center
Do you feel that perhaps

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:04.669 line:10% position:50% align:center
because of unfavorable circumstances

00:01:04.669 --> 00:01:07.172 line:10% position:50% align:center
over which you have no control,

00:01:07.172 --> 00:01:10.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
you just don’t have a fair chance in life?

00:01:10.884 --> 00:01:13.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you feel that in the race of life

00:01:13.345 --> 00:01:15.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
others seem to be able to run freely

00:01:15.722 --> 00:01:18.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you have to run with a crutch.

00:01:19.434 --> 00:01:21.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this program,
we’re going to talk

00:01:21.603 --> 00:01:26.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a very endearing aspect
of Jehovah’s personality:

00:01:26.191 --> 00:01:29.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
his loving care for the disadvantaged.

00:01:30.195 --> 00:01:33.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll delve into his feelings for such ones,

00:01:33.407 --> 00:01:35.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
his respect for them,

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his long history of caring for them.

00:01:39.371 --> 00:01:43.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll also consider
how Jehovah’s care of the lowly ones

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:45.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
draws us closer to him

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:49.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it can reassure you
if you face disadvantages in your life.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin with,
who are the disadvantaged?

00:01:55.888 --> 00:01:59.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we speak
of disadvantaged ones in this discussion,

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:02.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not talking
about the inadequacies of the person

00:02:02.978 --> 00:02:06.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather,
of the unfortunate circumstances in life

00:02:06.816 --> 00:02:09.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
that one must contend with.

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:13.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often a person inherits the situation
through no fault of his own.

00:02:14.782 --> 00:02:18.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among such ones,
the Bible specifically mentions widows,

00:02:18.577 --> 00:02:21.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
orphans, and foreign residents.

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:25.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice this at Deuteronomy 24:17:

00:02:26.544 --> 00:02:30.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not pervert the judgment
of the foreign resident

00:02:30.298 --> 00:02:32.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or of the fatherless child,

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:35.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you must not seize
the garment of a widow

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
as security for a loan.”

00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:40.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said:

00:02:40.183 --> 00:02:43.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Law specifically protected those

00:02:43.102 --> 00:02:45.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who could not protect themselves,

00:02:45.688 --> 00:02:49.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as orphans,
widows, and foreign residents.”

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 10:14 refers to such ones
as “unfortunate victim[s].”

00:02:56.407 --> 00:02:59.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible also uses the term “lowly ones,”

00:02:59.744 --> 00:03:01.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because they’re less important,

00:03:01.913 --> 00:03:04.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of their circumstances.

00:03:06.334 --> 00:03:08.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our next main question is,

00:03:08.336 --> 00:03:12.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah feel about such ones?

00:03:12.716 --> 00:03:17.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really see a beautiful aspect
of Jehovah’s personality here

00:03:17.262 --> 00:03:21.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his compassion and empathy—
in action.

00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:24.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since a widow doesn’t have a husband
to care for her,

00:03:24.895 --> 00:03:29.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
an orphan doesn’t have parents
to provide for and protect him,

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:32.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a foreigner has no advocate,

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah steps in
and fills those roles personally.

00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:41.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice this in the wording of Psalm 68:5:

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:45.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A father of the fatherless

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:50.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a protector of widows
is God in his holy dwelling.”

00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:56.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah himself assumes
the responsibility left vacated.

00:03:56.009 --> 00:04:00.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
He becomes the Father;
he becomes the Protector.

00:04:01.432 --> 00:04:05.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
As their Protector,
note how he views their care

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:09.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Exodus 22:22-24:

00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:14.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not afflict any widow
or fatherless child.

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:17.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you afflict him at all,
so that he cries out to me,

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will unfailingly hear his outcry;

00:04:21.369 --> 00:04:23.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and my anger will blaze,

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:26.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will kill you with the sword,

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:29.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your wives will become widows,

00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:31.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your children will be fatherless.”

00:04:32.713 --> 00:04:35.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding this verse,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said:

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:40.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Notice that Jehovah did not
leave it up to the human judges in Israel

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:42.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to enforce this law.

00:04:42.598 --> 00:04:46.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God himself would execute judgment
upon anyone

00:04:46.811 --> 00:04:50.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
who took advantage of a defenseless child.”

00:04:50.315 --> 00:04:53.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is how personally
Jehovah takes the care

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:56.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the lowly, disadvantaged ones.

00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:59.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
They become his responsibility;

00:04:59.616 --> 00:05:02.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
they come under his protection.

00:05:02.952 --> 00:05:07.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah personally makes up for any
disadvantage they may have.

00:05:09.626 --> 00:05:13.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact that Jehovah takes
personal responsibility for such ones

00:05:13.588 --> 00:05:17.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
is further seen at Proverbs 19:17:

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one showing favor to the lowly

00:05:20.637 --> 00:05:23.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is lending to Jehovah,

00:05:23.682 --> 00:05:26.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
and He will repay him for what he does.”

00:05:27.727 --> 00:05:31.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s walk through the process
that this verse describes.

00:05:31.648 --> 00:05:34.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we assist the lowly,

00:05:34.776 --> 00:05:37.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we show favor to them,
in some way.

00:05:37.362 --> 00:05:40.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
We help them in a practical way,
we encourage them,

00:05:40.615 --> 00:05:42.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
we make sure they get justice

00:05:42.451 --> 00:05:45.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
or care for something else
they’re in need of.

00:05:45.162 --> 00:05:47.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as discussed,

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:49.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has assumed the responsibility

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:52.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
to care for these disadvantaged ones.

00:05:52.294 --> 00:05:55.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we step in and assist,

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah views this
as if we are giving to him,

00:05:59.176 --> 00:06:02.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
assisting him with his responsibility.

00:06:02.888 --> 00:06:06.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah doesn’t view it as a gift or payment

00:06:06.976 --> 00:06:08.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as a loan.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the difference
between a gift and a loan?

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:16.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
A loan must be repaid.

00:06:17.653 --> 00:06:21.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine,
when we assist the disadvantaged,

00:06:21.407 --> 00:06:23.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah actually views himself

00:06:23.993 --> 00:06:27.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
as indebted to us lowly humans!

00:06:27.747 --> 00:06:32.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will repay that debt
with favor and blessings.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without a doubt,

00:06:34.962 --> 00:06:39.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah feels strongly
about the care of disadvantaged ones.

00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:44.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider this a little further.

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Jehovah’s love
and compassion for the disadvantaged,

00:06:48.893 --> 00:06:52.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
he enacted laws to protect them in Israel.

00:06:52.563 --> 00:06:56.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
In these laws, we see the depth
of Jehovah’s understanding

00:06:56.818 --> 00:07:00.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his tender care
and protection of such ones.

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:03.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider just two examples.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s look at his law
regarding a security for a loan.

00:07:08.663 --> 00:07:12.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find this at Exodus 22:26, 27:

00:07:14.961 --> 00:07:17.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you seize the garment of your fellow man

00:07:17.339 --> 00:07:19.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as security for a loan,

00:07:19.424 --> 00:07:22.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you are to return it to him by sunset.

00:07:22.177 --> 00:07:26.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it is his only covering,
his clothing to cover his body;

00:07:26.973 --> 00:07:29.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in what will he lie down to sleep?

00:07:29.476 --> 00:07:33.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he cries out to me,
I will certainly hear,

00:07:33.188 --> 00:07:35.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
for I am compassionate.”

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:39.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s compassion in this law
for any poor Israelite

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
who might find himself in this situation.

00:07:42.864 --> 00:07:47.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, note the additional stipulation
made in the case of widows,

00:07:47.744 --> 00:07:51.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
as stated at Deuteronomy 24:17:

00:07:53.625 --> 00:07:56.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not pervert the judgment
of the foreign resident

00:07:56.837 --> 00:07:58.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or of the fatherless child,

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:02.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you must not seize
the garment of a widow

00:08:02.384 --> 00:08:04.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
as security for a loan.”

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:06.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the widow’s case,

00:08:06.847 --> 00:08:11.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
no Israelite
was to take her garment as security at all!

00:08:11.518 --> 00:08:15.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah evidently
wanted to eliminate any chance

00:08:15.272 --> 00:08:19.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she’d be left overnight
without her garment to keep her warm.

00:08:20.694 --> 00:08:22.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:08:23.489 --> 00:08:26.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t we see Jehovah’s special love and care

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:29.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
for disadvantaged ones in a law like this?

00:08:31.706 --> 00:08:36.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a second example
of a law made to help the lowly ones.

00:08:36.168 --> 00:08:39.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this case,
it was related to the sacrifices

00:08:39.213 --> 00:08:41.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Israelites were to make to Jehovah

00:08:41.507 --> 00:08:44.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the forgiveness of their sins.

00:08:44.218 --> 00:08:46.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know the importance of blood

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:50.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
in regard to sacrifices
to atone ones from sin.

00:08:50.141 --> 00:08:53.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leviticus 17:11 tells us

00:08:53.144 --> 00:08:57.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “it is the blood that makes atonement.”

00:08:57.106 --> 00:09:01.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, note the provision
made for the very poor in Israel,

00:09:01.277 --> 00:09:03.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Leviticus 5:11:

00:09:05.823 --> 00:09:10.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now if he cannot afford
two turtledoves or two young pigeons,

00:09:10.495 --> 00:09:13.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he must bring as his offering for his sin

00:09:13.623 --> 00:09:18.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
a tenth of an ephah of fine flour
for a sin offering.”

00:09:19.003 --> 00:09:21.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding this, <i>The Watchtower</i>  said:

00:09:22.632 --> 00:09:26.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the very poor,
Jehovah chose to make an exception

00:09:26.386 --> 00:09:29.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and allow a sin offering without blood.

00:09:29.889 --> 00:09:34.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In Israel, poverty denied no one
the blessing of atonement

00:09:34.102 --> 00:09:36.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the privilege of making peace with God.”

00:09:36.646 --> 00:09:38.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  continued:

00:09:38.732 --> 00:09:42.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does that mean that the flour offerings
of the poor were worthless?

00:09:42.527 --> 00:09:43.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No.

00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:46.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah surely valued the humble,

00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
“willing spirit behind such offerings.

00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:53.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, the sins of the entire nation

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:54.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—including the poor—

00:09:54.498 --> 00:09:57.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were covered by the blood
of the animals offered to God

00:09:57.543 --> 00:09:59.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the annual Day of Atonement.”

00:10:01.213 --> 00:10:04.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this we see Jehovah’s reasonableness,

00:10:04.675 --> 00:10:08.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
his compassion,
and his love for the disadvantaged.

00:10:08.846 --> 00:10:13.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one was left out,
and they received the same refreshment

00:10:13.058 --> 00:10:16.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their sacrifice as any other Israelite.

00:10:18.939 --> 00:10:20.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far in our discussion,

00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:24.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve highlighted that Jehovah
takes personal responsibility

00:10:24.236 --> 00:10:26.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the care of disadvantaged ones.

00:10:26.864 --> 00:10:30.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
He steps in and fills the vacated role.

00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:35.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we assist such ones,
he views it as lending to him.

00:10:36.457 --> 00:10:39.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further, we see his love and compassion

00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:43.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the laws he enacted
to protect such ones in Israel.

00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:47.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an important question:

00:10:47.802 --> 00:10:50.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think about the special place

00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:54.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has in his heart
for disadvantaged ones,

00:10:54.684 --> 00:10:57.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does that make you feel about him?

00:10:58.563 --> 00:11:01.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t it draw you closer to Jehovah?

00:11:01.941 --> 00:11:05.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t help but love him for it.

00:11:06.863 --> 00:11:11.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love and care for the disadvantaged
is in such stark contrast

00:11:11.868 --> 00:11:14.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the way such ones
are often treated in the world.

00:11:15.497 --> 00:11:19.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, the world often
steps on the disadvantaged

00:11:19.250 --> 00:11:22.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
—taking more advantage of them
because they can.

00:11:23.963 --> 00:11:28.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further, whom does the world
praise and promote?

00:11:28.426 --> 00:11:31.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it typically the beautiful, the rich,

00:11:31.221 --> 00:11:34.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
the talented, the funny, the charismatic?

00:11:34.683 --> 00:11:37.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whereas the common person,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
even more so the disadvantaged,

00:11:39.521 --> 00:11:41.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
often doesn’t receive such favor.

00:11:43.316 --> 00:11:48.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
By contrast, Jehovah is on the lookout
for the lowly ones.

00:11:50.407 --> 00:11:52.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
This brings us to our next question:

00:11:52.826 --> 00:11:55.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is this reassuring for those of us

00:11:55.746 --> 00:11:59.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are disadvantaged in one way or another?

00:11:59.291 --> 00:12:01.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the outset, we asked that question:

00:12:01.835 --> 00:12:05.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you feel disadvantaged?

00:12:05.047 --> 00:12:07.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are your circumstances?

00:12:07.883 --> 00:12:12.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe because of your situation,
you relate to the widow, the orphan,

00:12:12.471 --> 00:12:15.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the foreign resident in Israel.

00:12:15.349 --> 00:12:19.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while the Mosaic Law
specifically mentioned those three,

00:12:19.186 --> 00:12:22.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could broaden those groups today,
couldn’t we?

00:12:22.398 --> 00:12:26.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we certainly have widows in our midst today,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our hearts truly go out
to these dear ones.

00:12:30.072 --> 00:12:32.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
But couldn’t we also include in this group

00:12:32.825 --> 00:12:36.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
wives who are neglected or abused
by their husbands

00:12:36.787 --> 00:12:40.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
verbally, emotionally, or physically?

00:12:40.374 --> 00:12:44.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such ones don’t have the normal protection
expected of a husband.

00:12:45.588 --> 00:12:48.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Couldn’t we also include single parents

00:12:48.341 --> 00:12:53.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
—either because of the death of a mate
or because of divorce or abandonment?

00:12:54.222 --> 00:12:59.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with orphans, couldn’t we include
children of single parents,

00:12:59.185 --> 00:13:03.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
children of parents
addicted to alcohol or drugs,

00:13:03.106 --> 00:13:06.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
or children of parents suffering
from severe depression

00:13:06.651 --> 00:13:09.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other debilitating mental illness?

00:13:09.904 --> 00:13:13.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
In these cases, the children
may not be getting the normal care

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and training that’s due them.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about foreigners?

00:13:18.329 --> 00:13:21.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are disadvantaged
because they have no advocate,

00:13:21.583 --> 00:13:23.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
no legal recourse, for protection.

00:13:24.794 --> 00:13:27.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
Couldn’t we also include in this group

00:13:27.297 --> 00:13:30.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
ones who are minorities in the land
where they live

00:13:30.717 --> 00:13:33.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so are often discriminated against?

00:13:34.638 --> 00:13:37.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, we could include any

00:13:37.015 --> 00:13:40.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
who do not have
the normal protection due them

00:13:40.435 --> 00:13:44.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just don’t have
the same opportunities as others

00:13:44.231 --> 00:13:48.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and any who feel disadvantaged,
such as the impoverished,

00:13:48.318 --> 00:13:53.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
the disabled, those with a lack of education
or training,

00:13:53.156 --> 00:13:57.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who because of unfavorable
circumstances in their youth

00:13:57.035 --> 00:14:01.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t get a fair chance,
and the list could go on.

00:14:02.457 --> 00:14:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
What makes you feel disadvantaged?

00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:10.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, all of Jehovah’s loving,
tender care for the lowly ones

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:14.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
who we discussed earlier applies to you.

00:14:14.261 --> 00:14:18.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah feels just as strongly
about your situation

00:14:18.515 --> 00:14:23.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he did for the widow
and orphan and foreign resident in Israel.

00:14:23.687 --> 00:14:26.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
He takes personal responsibility

00:14:26.607 --> 00:14:29.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your care and protection.

00:14:30.277 --> 00:14:35.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the Bible says
about him at Isaiah 57:15:

00:14:35.950 --> 00:14:38.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this is what
the High and Lofty One says,

00:14:38.911 --> 00:14:42.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who lives forever and whose name is holy:

00:14:42.289 --> 00:14:45.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I reside in the high and holy place,

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but also with those
crushed and lowly in spirit,

00:14:50.589 --> 00:14:53.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to revive the spirit of the lowly

00:14:53.301 --> 00:14:56.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to revive
the heart of those being crushed.’”

00:14:57.638 --> 00:15:02.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here Jehovah says
that he resides with the lowly ones.

00:15:02.185 --> 00:15:06.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that he doesn’t just see
your situation from afar.

00:15:06.314 --> 00:15:08.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t just come and go quickly.

00:15:08.691 --> 00:15:11.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, this gives the sense that he sits down,

00:15:11.778 --> 00:15:15.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gets comfortable, and he stays with you.

00:15:15.198 --> 00:15:19.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for what purpose
does he remain close to you?

00:15:19.244 --> 00:15:22.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
To revive your spirit and your heart.

00:15:22.997 --> 00:15:27.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has open concern for your welfare.

00:15:28.628 --> 00:15:33.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you personally experienced
Jehovah’s loving help in your situation?

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:36.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, living during the time that we do,

00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:40.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that we can’t expect Jehovah
to shield us from every hardship

00:15:40.765 --> 00:15:42.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes our way.

00:15:42.767 --> 00:15:46.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you seen him help you endure?

00:15:46.396 --> 00:15:50.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you experienced him provide for you?

00:15:50.275 --> 00:15:53.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you seen him answer a prayer
at just the right time?

00:15:54.988 --> 00:15:59.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you come across a scripture
or article from the publications

00:15:59.076 --> 00:16:03.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gave you just what you needed
when you needed it?

00:16:04.039 --> 00:16:07.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you seen Jehovah’s care
through a thoughtful word

00:16:07.751 --> 00:16:12.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
or timely practical help from one of your
brothers or sisters in the congregation?

00:16:13.549 --> 00:16:17.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is Jehovah residing with you!

00:16:17.219 --> 00:16:19.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:16:19.221 --> 00:16:22.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is reviving your heart.

00:16:22.349 --> 00:16:26.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has assumed responsibility for your care.

00:16:26.395 --> 00:16:29.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
He takes it personally.

00:16:29.064 --> 00:16:32.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are important to him!

00:16:33.485 --> 00:16:36.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we just love him for it, don’t we?

00:16:39.074 --> 00:16:43.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s something else that Jehovah
does to help the disadvantaged.

00:16:43.662 --> 00:16:45.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives you hope.

00:16:46.499 --> 00:16:50.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will not be downtrodden forever.

00:16:50.086 --> 00:16:54.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s care for the disadvantaged
will be fully expressed

00:16:54.006 --> 00:16:58.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the new world
when all disadvantages will be removed.

00:16:58.302 --> 00:17:03.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 145:16 says:

00:17:04.058 --> 00:17:07.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You open your hand and satisfy the desire

00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:09.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
of every living thing.”

00:17:09.355 --> 00:17:12.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not just the prominent
and not just the favored

00:17:12.567 --> 00:17:17.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah will “satisfy the desire
of every living thing.”

00:17:17.822 --> 00:17:20.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes you. 

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said:

00:17:23.494 --> 00:17:27.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises
will be so impressive

00:17:27.707 --> 00:17:31.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that the difficulties and trials
of the present time

00:17:31.127 --> 00:17:33.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will pale into insignificance.

00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:35.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the coming Paradise,

00:17:35.882 --> 00:17:40.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the blessings from Jehovah
will surpass our imagination.

00:17:40.303 --> 00:17:45.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will certainly
experience unprecedented happiness.”

00:17:45.976 --> 00:17:49.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing will be missing in Paradise.

00:17:49.396 --> 00:17:52.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing will be unfair.

00:17:52.232 --> 00:17:56.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every person will have every advantage.

00:17:57.404 --> 00:17:59.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Praised be Jehovah God,

00:17:59.656 --> 00:18:03.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Protector of the disadvantaged ones.

00:18:05.162 --> 00:18:08.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope that this discussion
has reassured you,

00:18:08.915 --> 00:18:12.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminded you of Jehovah’s tender care,

00:18:12.461 --> 00:18:16.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and given you confidence
that Jehovah will always be there for you.

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will always protect you,
whatever your disadvantage may be.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the end,
Jehovah has reserved a beautiful future

00:18:26.058 --> 00:18:29.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all those seeking refuge in him.

00:18:32.398 --> 00:18:35.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cared for the widows of the past.

00:18:35.234 --> 00:18:37.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
And today, he’s with his servants

00:18:37.778 --> 00:18:40.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
who experience a devastating loss.

00:18:40.906 --> 00:18:45.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how Jehovah 
has been there for Cort, a widower,

00:18:45.202 --> 00:18:48.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he deals with the pain of losing his wife.

00:18:59.717 --> 00:19:02.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam and I have been able to experience

00:19:02.845 --> 00:19:05.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
many blessings from Jehovah.

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were able to go on different assignments

00:19:11.187 --> 00:19:14.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Paraguay, Nigeria, Zambia.

00:19:15.775 --> 00:19:20.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we packed up
all of our belongings from home,

00:19:20.029 --> 00:19:22.073 line:10% position:50% align:center
took up everything in our life,

00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:24.117 line:10% position:50% align:center
and drove across the United States

00:19:24.117 --> 00:19:26.494 line:10% position:50% align:center
from California to Patterson.

00:19:26.494 --> 00:19:28.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
And within a couple of months,

00:19:28.538 --> 00:19:30.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
she was diagnosed with ALS.

00:19:31.499 --> 00:19:33.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were crushed.

00:19:37.755 --> 00:19:39.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
We drove back to California,

00:19:39.799 --> 00:19:44.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there we just tried
to do everything we could to help her.

00:19:44.095 --> 00:19:46.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing worked, and she passed away.

00:19:46.431 --> 00:19:50.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it was extremely difficult.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was my best friend.

00:20:06.243 --> 00:20:10.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
I received an encouraging card from a sister

00:20:10.622 --> 00:20:12.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was just helping me
to try and keep moving forward.

00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:15.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one of the thoughts in there
was this particular scripture

00:20:15.419 --> 00:20:18.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Psalm 18:29:

00:20:18.964 --> 00:20:21.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“By God’s power I can scale a wall.”

00:20:21.842 --> 00:20:23.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
And sometimes our trials feel just like that.

00:20:23.927 --> 00:20:25.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
They feel like something
that you just can’t get over.

00:20:25.804 --> 00:20:28.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s impossible to climb a wall
when there’s nothing to grab on to.

00:20:36.482 --> 00:20:40.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
The trial may feel this way to us, but again,

00:20:40.235 --> 00:20:43.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
the scripture says
that “by God’s power” I can scale this wall.

00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:52.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
So sticking with the goal of pioneering

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:54.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me to get moving

00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:57.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then helped me
to also want to try and reach out

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:01.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
for other goals,
like going back to doing temp work at Bethel.

00:21:05.136 --> 00:21:07.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a privilege to be able to go to Bethel,

00:21:08.598 --> 00:21:10.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
and every day you’re working for Jehovah.

00:21:14.437 --> 00:21:16.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was nice
to be able to be with the friends.

00:21:16.355 --> 00:21:18.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re always so very, very encouraging,

00:21:18.816 --> 00:21:20.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I know that working with them

00:21:20.902 --> 00:21:23.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
and working on a theocratic project

00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:25.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped to motivate me to keep moving,

00:21:25.323 --> 00:21:27.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel more positive.

00:21:31.537 --> 00:21:32.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
I serve as an elder in the congregation.

00:21:32.956 --> 00:21:35.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’m still trying to do my assignments.

00:21:35.208 --> 00:21:37.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
To try and be on shepherding visits

00:21:38.378 --> 00:21:40.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been something to keep my mind,

00:21:40.547 --> 00:21:43.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
not on myself,
but on trying to help others.

00:21:45.718 --> 00:21:47.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s always encouraging

00:21:47.303 --> 00:21:50.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be out in the ministry
and to be with the friends,

00:21:50.473 --> 00:21:54.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they have
different levels of anxieties, problems,

00:21:54.144 --> 00:21:56.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
health issues,
and other things that they deal with.

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:59.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you talk to them and they encourage you,

00:21:59.983 --> 00:22:01.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s “an interchange of encouragement”

00:22:01.526 --> 00:22:03.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be out in the ministry with the friends.

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:06.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam and I always had

00:22:06.156 --> 00:22:09.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
a regular habit of personal study.

00:22:09.451 --> 00:22:10.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
We did it together.

00:22:10.952 --> 00:22:13.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
We loved to bounce ideas off of each other,

00:22:13.538 --> 00:22:16.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’d share points that we had dug up.

00:22:18.168 --> 00:22:20.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, even more so for myself,

00:22:20.837 --> 00:22:24.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
I feel it’s important
because it helps me to keep motivated

00:22:24.091 --> 00:22:26.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep finding those points.

00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:27.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
And also they’re good memories;

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:30.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s something that we did together
that we enjoyed.

00:22:32.808 --> 00:22:35.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I stick to my spiritual routine.

00:22:40.232 --> 00:22:41.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I also have a physical routine.

00:22:46.196 --> 00:22:49.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll mountain bike
three to four times a week.

00:22:49.116 --> 00:22:51.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be in Jehovah’s creation
and to be on the trails,

00:22:56.957 --> 00:22:59.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
it helps me to be able to have time to pray

00:22:59.835 --> 00:23:01.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to meditate.

00:23:01.253 --> 00:23:04.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can talk to Jehovah,
and I’m able to express myself.

00:23:08.052 --> 00:23:10.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
What Jehovah has in store
for each and every one of us

00:23:10.304 --> 00:23:11.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not what we are dealing with now,

00:23:11.806 --> 00:23:14.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s going to be Paradise conditions.

00:23:14.267 --> 00:23:17.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
We won’t have the issues
that we’re dealing with today.

00:23:21.023 --> 00:23:24.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is helping me scale the wall

00:23:24.026 --> 00:23:26.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
—helping me move forward.

00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cort stays busy.

00:23:31.617 --> 00:23:33.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives to others,

00:23:33.619 --> 00:23:37.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah continues
to give right back to him.

00:23:37.248 --> 00:23:41.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can be assured He’ll do the same for you.

00:23:42.670 --> 00:23:45.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’ve lost your mate
for a different reason.

00:23:45.965 --> 00:23:49.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you contend with feelings of loneliness?

00:23:49.511 --> 00:23:54.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following morning worship explains
the emotional support Jehovah gives.

00:23:56.810 --> 00:24:00.480 line:10% position:50% align:center
About 28 years after Jesus’ death,

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.899 line:10% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul provided

00:24:02.899 --> 00:24:04.943 line:10% position:50% align:center
comfort to the brothers

00:24:04.943 --> 00:24:07.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
by means of our Scripture text today

00:24:07.195 --> 00:24:09.239 line:10% position:50% align:center
by means of this wonderful promise,

00:24:09.239 --> 00:24:10.907 line:10% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah said:

00:24:10.907 --> 00:24:13.285 line:10% position:50% align:center
‘I will not forget you

00:24:13.285 --> 00:24:15.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
—your works and your love.’

00:24:15.495 --> 00:24:19.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why would the fact
that Jehovah does not forget

00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
be of comfort to the brothers?

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you agree
that if you tell somebody

00:24:24.254 --> 00:24:27.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you don’t forget him
or what he has done,

00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:29.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can have
a completely different meaning

00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:31.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
depending on the person
and the circumstances?

00:24:33.013 --> 00:24:36.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us, therefore,
focus on the meaning of

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:38.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah does not forget.”

00:24:39.853 --> 00:24:42.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
In order to make this discussion practical,

00:24:42.731 --> 00:24:47.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
may we talk specifically
to you dear sisters

00:24:47.027 --> 00:24:49.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’ve lost your husband in death

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:53.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
or whose husband was unfaithful?

00:24:53.242 --> 00:24:54.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similar to your situation,

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:58.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
there must have been widows
in Judea back then

00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:02.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
who went not only through the pain
of losing their mate

00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also had to deal with all the changes

00:25:04.295 --> 00:25:08.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as economical and social challenges.

00:25:08.799 --> 00:25:12.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, we want to answer
the following three questions:

00:25:12.345 --> 00:25:15.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah remember,
or not forget,

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:17.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
the widow of Zarephath?

00:25:17.975 --> 00:25:20.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then second, in what ways

00:25:20.019 --> 00:25:23.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
does Jehovah remember
you dear sisters today?

00:25:23.898 --> 00:25:28.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then third,
how can we all benefit

00:25:28.361 --> 00:25:30.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s remembering?

00:25:31.364 --> 00:25:34.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, first of all, how did Jehovah
remember the widow of Zarephath?

00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:39.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to invite you to turn to 1 Kings 17.

00:25:39.455 --> 00:25:42.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we know, during a drought,

00:25:42.125 --> 00:25:44.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Elijah was directed by God

00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:49.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go to Zarephath
in order to be saved and kept alive

00:25:49.007 --> 00:25:51.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the help of a widow.

00:25:51.843 --> 00:25:55.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah remembered the widow

00:25:55.472 --> 00:25:57.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that he took note of her.

00:25:57.307 --> 00:25:58.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw her.

00:25:58.308 --> 00:26:01.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew she would be willing to help

00:26:01.102 --> 00:26:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be used by him.

00:26:03.313 --> 00:26:05.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah saw her potential.

00:26:05.523 --> 00:26:07.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would the poor widow really help?

00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:12.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read at verses 15 and 16
of 1 Kings 17:

00:26:12.948 --> 00:26:15.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So she [the widow] went
and did as Elijah said,

00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:19.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and she together with him
and her household

00:26:19.454 --> 00:26:21.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“ate for many days.

00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The large jar of flour did not run out,

00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:27.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the small jar of oil did not run dry,

00:26:27.087 --> 00:26:31.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to Jehovah’s word
that he had spoken through Elijah.”

00:26:32.968 --> 00:26:35.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah miraculously fed Elijah.

00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:37.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he forget the widow?

00:26:37.681 --> 00:26:38.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:26:38.724 --> 00:26:42.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah became a Savior to the widow.

00:26:42.144 --> 00:26:46.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of dying,
the widow continued eating and drinking.

00:26:47.983 --> 00:26:50.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even some time later,
Jehovah did not forget

00:26:50.736 --> 00:26:53.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
the widow’s faith and her works.

00:26:53.947 --> 00:26:55.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:26:55.407 --> 00:26:57.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the death of the widow’s son,

00:26:57.826 --> 00:27:00.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elijah asked Jehovah to resurrect the son.

00:27:01.622 --> 00:27:06.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read at verses 22-24:

00:27:06.293 --> 00:27:09.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah listened to Elijah’s request,

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:11.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the life of the child
came back into him,

00:27:11.924 --> 00:27:13.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he revived.

00:27:14.176 --> 00:27:16.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Elijah took the child and brought him down

00:27:16.053 --> 00:27:18.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the roof chamber into the house

00:27:18.055 --> 00:27:19.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and gave him to his mother;

00:27:19.682 --> 00:27:23.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Elijah said: ‘See, your son is alive.’

00:27:23.144 --> 00:27:25.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that the woman said to Elijah:

00:27:25.897 --> 00:27:27.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now I know

00:27:27.899 --> 00:27:29.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that you truly are a man of God

00:27:29.901 --> 00:27:31.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and that Jehovah’s word in your mouth

00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:33.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
is truth.’”

00:27:34.489 --> 00:27:36.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a blessing for the widow!

00:27:36.616 --> 00:27:39.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not forget her work and faith.

00:27:39.118 --> 00:27:40.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a joyous moment!

00:27:40.787 --> 00:27:44.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah became the Great Comforter.

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally,

00:27:45.583 --> 00:27:47.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of her resurrected son,

00:27:47.585 --> 00:27:50.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah cared for her as she grew old.

00:27:50.129 --> 00:27:53.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah became the Great Provider.

00:27:54.384 --> 00:27:58.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Luke chapter 4,
Jesus makes a positive reference about her,

00:27:58.972 --> 00:28:03.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
so it could be that she lived out her days
as a faithful servant of Jehovah.

00:28:03.893 --> 00:28:06.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
How delighted she will be

00:28:06.438 --> 00:28:09.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Jehovah remembers her soon again

00:28:09.316 --> 00:28:11.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
and resurrects her!

00:28:11.735 --> 00:28:13.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as we’ve seen in this example,

00:28:13.778 --> 00:28:17.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not forget

00:28:17.032 --> 00:28:20.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
by becoming
what the individual needs the most.

00:28:21.995 --> 00:28:24.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, to our second question,
our dear sisters,

00:28:24.831 --> 00:28:28.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what ways
does Jehovah remember you today?

00:28:28.543 --> 00:28:30.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us, please, look at three scriptures

00:28:30.962 --> 00:28:33.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see what Jehovah becomes for you.

00:28:33.674 --> 00:28:37.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn, first of all,
to John chapter 14,

00:28:37.344 --> 00:28:39.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah knows

00:28:39.346 --> 00:28:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your mate who commended you
and who assured you in the past

00:28:42.558 --> 00:28:44.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not here anymore.

00:28:44.601 --> 00:28:47.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
What helped Jesus to know

00:28:47.563 --> 00:28:50.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was loved and approved?

00:28:50.733 --> 00:28:54.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was strengthened
by his Father’s approval and by his words.

00:28:54.987 --> 00:28:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now Jesus assures you in verse 21

00:28:59.408 --> 00:29:01.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
(this is John 14:21),

00:29:01.994 --> 00:29:04.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he says:

00:29:04.371 --> 00:29:07.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whoever has my commandments
and observes them

00:29:07.458 --> 00:29:09.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is the one who loves me.

00:29:09.668 --> 00:29:14.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In turn, whoever loves me
will be loved by my Father,

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will love him

00:29:16.092 --> 00:29:18.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will clearly show myself to him.”

00:29:20.012 --> 00:29:22.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah loves you.

00:29:22.306 --> 00:29:25.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please do not allow Satan

00:29:25.101 --> 00:29:28.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
to create doubts in your mind

00:29:28.354 --> 00:29:32.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
—doubts regarding
our heavenly Father’s approval.

00:29:32.024 --> 00:29:35.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead,
see the commendation and the love

00:29:35.486 --> 00:29:37.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressed by your brothers and sisters

00:29:37.488 --> 00:29:39.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
as coming from Jehovah.

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:42.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah uses them

00:29:42.326 --> 00:29:46.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he does not forget
your works and your love.

00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:51.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second scripture is Psalm 68.

00:29:51.252 --> 00:29:56.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows about the need
you feel for security and protection,

00:29:56.257 --> 00:30:00.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he is becoming your Protector.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:04.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
We read at verse 5 of Psalm 68

00:30:04.432 --> 00:30:06.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah:

00:30:06.434 --> 00:30:07.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A father of the fatherless

00:30:07.936 --> 00:30:12.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a protector of widows.”

00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:17.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, you are especially protected
by our heavenly Father.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:22.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
he protects you from spiritual harm.

00:30:22.701 --> 00:30:25.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
He equips you with what you need
in order to avoid danger,

00:30:25.662 --> 00:30:28.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so you are able to safeguard
your friendship with him.

00:30:28.832 --> 00:30:31.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of his Word and the publications,

00:30:31.168 --> 00:30:34.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah makes
his loving guidance and protection

00:30:34.755 --> 00:30:36.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
stand out to you.

00:30:37.633 --> 00:30:39.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s turn to the third scripture,

00:30:39.843 --> 00:30:41.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hebrews 13.

00:30:42.512 --> 00:30:44.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Losing a husband

00:30:44.514 --> 00:30:47.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
goes along with anxieties
regarding material things.

00:30:47.476 --> 00:30:50.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have you experienced so far?

00:30:50.854 --> 00:30:54.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did Jehovah’s promise
that is repeated by the apostle Paul

00:30:54.608 --> 00:30:57.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
here in Hebrews 13
at the end of verse 5

00:30:57.778 --> 00:31:02.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
prove to be true
in your circumstances,

00:31:02.116 --> 00:31:05.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he promised:
“I will never leave you,

00:31:05.786 --> 00:31:08.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will never abandon you”?

00:31:09.707 --> 00:31:12.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah does not forget
your works and your love

00:31:12.626 --> 00:31:16.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
by becoming your Provider.

00:31:16.005 --> 00:31:20.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, please,
allow other brothers and sisters to help you.

00:31:20.176 --> 00:31:22.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the way Jehovah remembers you.

00:31:22.762 --> 00:31:24.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mention your needs to them

00:31:24.764 --> 00:31:28.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that Jehovah can use them
to care for you.

00:31:29.685 --> 00:31:33.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah does not forget
your works and your love

00:31:33.814 --> 00:31:36.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
by assuring you of his approval,

00:31:36.609 --> 00:31:40.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
by becoming your Protector and your Provider,

00:31:40.905 --> 00:31:42.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in many more ways.

00:31:43.658 --> 00:31:45.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, our final question was

00:31:45.743 --> 00:31:47.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How can you
—and how can we all—

00:31:47.995 --> 00:31:50.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
benefit from Jehovah’s remembering?’

00:31:50.915 --> 00:31:53.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we’ve discussed so far was something

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
you heard many times before
—nothing new.

00:31:56.254 --> 00:31:58.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, there are these moments

00:31:58.506 --> 00:32:00.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we just would like Jehovah

00:32:00.967 --> 00:32:04.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak directly to us, saying:

00:32:04.888 --> 00:32:07.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I see you.
I see your works.

00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:10.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your love,
and I will not forget you.’

00:32:11.936 --> 00:32:14.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can we do in these very moments?

00:32:16.066 --> 00:32:19.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, God’s words need to sound down

00:32:19.569 --> 00:32:21.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our mind and heart

00:32:21.863 --> 00:32:23.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we are influenced by them.

00:32:23.865 --> 00:32:25.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we accomplish this?

00:32:25.992 --> 00:32:30.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
By allowing our Bible reading
to affect us deep inside.

00:32:30.872 --> 00:32:33.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as we meditate about what we read,

00:32:33.375 --> 00:32:35.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can ask ourselves the questions:

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:39.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do I really believe what I just read?

00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:45.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why am I sure that Bible examples
are not isolated events

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:49.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
but are a pattern of Jehovah’s dealings
with his loyal ones?

00:32:49.433 --> 00:32:54.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have I not seen
or experienced this personally?

00:32:55.397 --> 00:32:57.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t I see
very good reasons to believe

00:32:57.691 --> 00:33:02.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
that through the Scriptures
Jehovah is talking to me personally?

00:33:03.572 --> 00:33:06.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditating on these questions will help us

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
to feel Jehovah’s sentiments

00:33:08.994 --> 00:33:12.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
are meant for us personally.

00:33:12.206 --> 00:33:14.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this, in turn, will help us

00:33:14.208 --> 00:33:17.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
to align our thinking
with God’s thinking.

00:33:19.004 --> 00:33:19.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
So

00:33:19.630 --> 00:33:23.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
the widow of Zarephath reminded us

00:33:23.384 --> 00:33:25.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the many different ways

00:33:25.386 --> 00:33:27.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah remembers widows

00:33:27.805 --> 00:33:31.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their love and their fine works.

00:33:32.059 --> 00:33:36.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear sisters,
please continue to see Jehovah

00:33:36.188 --> 00:33:38.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
as your Provider,

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:40.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
your Protector,

00:33:40.651 --> 00:33:45.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the one who
assures you personally of his love.

00:33:48.242 --> 00:33:52.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may feel abandoned, 
but you’re never alone.

00:33:52.038 --> 00:33:55.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sees you and loves you.

00:33:57.210 --> 00:34:00.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, life can be hard
through no fault of our own,

00:34:00.296 --> 00:34:04.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
but sometimes it’s hard
because of our own mistakes.

00:34:04.467 --> 00:34:06.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we recover?

00:34:06.678 --> 00:34:10.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how 
the faithful woman Miriam did it.

00:34:59.273 --> 00:35:02.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Discipline can be painful.

00:35:13.871 --> 00:35:18.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appreciating it for what it truly is takes faith.

00:35:44.735 --> 00:35:46.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses!

00:35:47.071 --> 00:35:48.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam!

00:35:48.281 --> 00:35:50.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, it’s so good to see you.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve missed you.

00:35:56.122 --> 00:35:57.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is time.

00:36:02.962 --> 00:36:06.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
For he has become

00:36:06.049 --> 00:36:08.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
highly exalted.

00:36:08.259 --> 00:36:12.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
The horse and its rider . . .

00:36:21.564 --> 00:36:25.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah, Highly Exalted One.

00:36:28.863 --> 00:36:31.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, don’t give up on me.

00:37:00.437 --> 00:37:01.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi, Miriam!

00:37:01.647 --> 00:37:03.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, hello.

00:37:03.065 --> 00:37:06.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam was well-known in the camp of Israel.

00:37:09.321 --> 00:37:11.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
She enjoyed a close relationship

00:37:11.532 --> 00:37:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
with her brothers, Moses and Aaron.

00:37:17.913 --> 00:37:19.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the slavery in Egypt

00:37:19.915 --> 00:37:21.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Exodus that followed,

00:37:21.542 --> 00:37:24.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
the people had grown to respect and love her.

00:37:28.465 --> 00:37:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah!

00:37:29.592 --> 00:37:30.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh!

00:37:30.718 --> 00:37:31.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you have?

00:37:35.431 --> 00:37:36.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zipporah is back!

00:37:36.891 --> 00:37:38.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zipporah, welcome home.

00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:39.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:37:42.355 --> 00:37:43.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zipporah!

00:37:43.397 --> 00:37:44.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam.

00:37:44.565 --> 00:37:46.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome back.

00:37:46.901 --> 00:37:47.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aaron.

00:37:47.902 --> 00:37:49.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zipporah, welcome.

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps at first

00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:53.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam was pleased to have Zipporah back.

00:37:54.659 --> 00:37:56.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is Zipporah settling in?

00:37:56.661 --> 00:37:57.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well . . .

00:37:59.205 --> 00:38:01.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone seems excited.

00:38:01.207 --> 00:38:02.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you think?

00:38:05.837 --> 00:38:08.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it seems that in time,

00:38:08.381 --> 00:38:10.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
she gave in to pride.

00:38:23.688 --> 00:38:25.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
She might have felt threatened, . . .

00:38:25.732 --> 00:38:27.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Zipporah.

00:38:27.776 --> 00:38:30.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . thinking that Zipporah would replace her

00:38:30.278 --> 00:38:32.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the most prominent woman in the nation.

00:38:37.285 --> 00:38:38.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
In any case,

00:38:38.578 --> 00:38:41.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam and Aaron engaged in negative talk.

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:45.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she’s a Cushite.

00:38:45.961 --> 00:38:47.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, but she is his wife.

00:38:49.339 --> 00:38:54.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, but she’s not one of us.

00:38:56.430 --> 00:38:58.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who knows how she influences him?

00:38:59.725 --> 00:39:02.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, their talk focused on Zipporah,

00:39:02.978 --> 00:39:05.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it soon escalated into

00:39:05.022 --> 00:39:07.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
complaining about Moses himself.

00:39:08.442 --> 00:39:09.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look!

00:39:09.443 --> 00:39:11.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
The people need leadership,

00:39:11.069 --> 00:39:13.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they trust us.

00:39:14.239 --> 00:39:15.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam,

00:39:16.575 --> 00:39:19.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is leading the people.

00:39:24.833 --> 00:39:26.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re not listening.

00:39:31.966 --> 00:39:33.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam!

00:39:33.008 --> 00:39:34.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wait!

00:39:34.009 --> 00:39:35.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are suffering out here.

00:39:35.219 --> 00:39:36.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe she’s right.

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some have questioned my brother.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something has to be done.

00:39:38.639 --> 00:39:40.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
She says his Cushite wife is distracting him.

00:39:40.641 --> 00:39:42.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just don’t understand what Moses is doing.

00:39:42.643 --> 00:39:44.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m tired of this.

00:39:44.061 --> 00:39:45.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
We suffered in Egypt,

00:39:45.312 --> 00:39:46.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’re suffering here.

00:39:46.605 --> 00:39:47.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hear Miriam is worried.

00:39:47.815 --> 00:39:48.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe there’s a better way.

00:39:48.858 --> 00:39:50.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam says we shouldn’t trust Zipporah.

00:39:50.526 --> 00:39:52.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think Moses is still qualified

00:39:52.612 --> 00:39:53.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead the nation?

00:39:53.946 --> 00:39:55.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does Moses know what he’s doing?

00:39:55.114 --> 00:39:56.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe Jehovah wants us to do something.

00:39:56.532 --> 00:39:57.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we have to listen to Moses?

00:39:57.867 --> 00:39:59.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure other people feel the same.

00:39:59.452 --> 00:40:00.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
We should’ve stayed in Egypt.

00:40:00.661 --> 00:40:01.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something has to be done.

00:40:01.954 --> 00:40:02.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re suffering here.

00:40:02.955 --> 00:40:04.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a lot of frustration.

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:07.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we have to listen to Moses?

00:40:07.293 --> 00:40:08.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think Jehovah is still with us?

00:40:08.252 --> 00:40:08.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s turn back.

00:40:08.795 --> 00:40:10.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe Jehovah wants us to do something.

00:40:10.213 --> 00:40:11.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
The men in the camp are worried.

00:40:12.548 --> 00:40:15.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it only by Moses that Jehovah has spoken?

00:40:15.468 --> 00:40:18.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Has he not also spoken through us?

00:40:21.474 --> 00:40:22.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go out,

00:40:23.643 --> 00:40:27.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
the three of you, to the tent of meeting.

00:40:43.496 --> 00:40:45.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hear my words, please.

00:40:54.382 --> 00:40:57.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is not that way with my servant Moses!

00:40:58.553 --> 00:41:01.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Face-to-face I speak to him,

00:41:01.223 --> 00:41:04.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the appearance of Jehovah is what he sees.

00:41:05.519 --> 00:41:08.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why, then, did you not fear

00:41:08.021 --> 00:41:10.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
to speak against my servant,

00:41:10.816 --> 00:41:12.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
against Moses?

00:41:39.303 --> 00:41:41.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
I beg you, my lord!

00:41:41.305 --> 00:41:44.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please do not hold this sin against us!

00:41:44.642 --> 00:41:46.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have acted foolishly.

00:41:46.685 --> 00:41:49.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, do not let her continue

00:41:49.355 --> 00:41:51.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
like someone dead!

00:41:54.235 --> 00:41:55.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
O God,

00:41:56.696 --> 00:42:00.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
please heal her!

00:42:00.157 --> 00:42:01.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please!

00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let her be quarantined for seven days,

00:42:19.093 --> 00:42:22.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
afterward she may be brought back.

00:42:33.108 --> 00:42:36.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
O Jehovah, you are the Most High.

00:42:38.279 --> 00:42:40.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
You chose Moses to lead your people,

00:42:40.782 --> 00:42:44.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I, I disrespected him.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you—

00:42:46.705 --> 00:42:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please, please forgive me.

00:43:04.723 --> 00:43:08.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam was not defined by her mistakes.

00:43:16.235 --> 00:43:18.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shall I go and call a nursing woman

00:43:18.237 --> 00:43:21.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the Hebrews to nurse the child for you?

00:43:23.784 --> 00:43:26.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is time.

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:28.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will bless you and Aaron.

00:43:39.008 --> 00:43:42.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah disciplines those he loves.

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:47.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam accepted his discipline with faith.

00:43:57.652 --> 00:43:59.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was restored to God’s favor

00:44:00.738 --> 00:44:03.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continued serving faithfully for decades.

00:44:20.883 --> 00:44:22.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Centuries afterward,

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:26.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah lovingly honored Miriam for her faithful service.

00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:32.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through His prophet Micah, He reminded His people:

00:44:33.021 --> 00:44:36.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“From the house of slavery I redeemed you;

00:44:36.316 --> 00:44:39.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I sent before you Moses,

00:44:39.486 --> 00:44:43.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aaron, and Miriam.”

00:44:51.289 --> 00:44:56.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
Miriam humbly used the discipline
to draw closer to God.

00:44:57.045 --> 00:44:59.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve made a serious mistake,

00:44:59.297 --> 00:45:01.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t give up on yourself.

00:45:01.591 --> 00:45:03.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hasn’t.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:09.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Injustice has grown out of control.

00:45:09.599 --> 00:45:13.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does it make you feel
when it’s in front of you?

00:45:13.478 --> 00:45:18.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll learn from two young ones
how they overcame inequality.

00:45:25.866 --> 00:45:29.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did the fight for equality
initially appeal to you?

00:45:29.953 --> 00:45:33.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
South Africa has a history
of legalized racism.

00:45:33.123 --> 00:45:35.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
But just because the law has changed,

00:45:35.209 --> 00:45:37.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t mean
that what’s been entrenched

00:45:37.628 --> 00:45:41.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the minds and hearts of people
has also changed.

00:45:41.257 --> 00:45:44.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
I observed that people still have prejudices,

00:45:44.593 --> 00:45:47.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they have ideas
of what I should look like

00:45:47.721 --> 00:45:49.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
or talk like
or where I should live,

00:45:49.723 --> 00:45:54.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t feel
like I was accepted anywhere.

00:45:54.228 --> 00:45:57.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that people’s needs
were not taken care of.

00:45:57.982 --> 00:46:02.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
their living conditions were not great

00:46:02.361 --> 00:46:05.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some had water, and some didn’t.

00:46:05.364 --> 00:46:07.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to help people.

00:46:07.408 --> 00:46:11.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
The time came
when some political parties

00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:13.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
were saying
that they could make a change.

00:46:13.915 --> 00:46:18.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in my heart,
although I wouldn’t say it,

00:46:18.086 --> 00:46:21.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
little by little I started to support them.

00:46:21.214 --> 00:46:23.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Protests are so powerful.

00:46:23.675 --> 00:46:27.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything is so loud and so moving

00:46:27.637 --> 00:46:31.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
—different colors, cultures, boys, girls—

00:46:31.391 --> 00:46:35.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
everybody getting together
to fight for the equality of others.

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:38.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to be part of making a change.

00:46:40.733 --> 00:46:43.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
What changes did you notice in yourself?

00:46:44.988 --> 00:46:49.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic,
I could no longer go out freely.

00:46:49.367 --> 00:46:51.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I did other things,

00:46:51.369 --> 00:46:53.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I also watched TV.

00:46:53.455 --> 00:46:55.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I watched TV,

00:46:55.332 --> 00:46:58.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
I noticed the things I used to see
while I was preaching

00:46:58.418 --> 00:47:01.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the way women and children, the elderly,

00:47:01.379 --> 00:47:04.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the immigrants
in this country were treated.

00:47:04.174 --> 00:47:06.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made me want to do something.

00:47:06.635 --> 00:47:09.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
My school also had a protest.

00:47:09.513 --> 00:47:12.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that I couldn’t protest
as one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:47:12.641 --> 00:47:15.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
so it was a bit frustrating.

00:47:15.894 --> 00:47:18.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I also felt bad
about not getting involved,

00:47:18.355 --> 00:47:20.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
like I was a bystander.

00:47:20.524 --> 00:47:22.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
I looked like I didn’t care.

00:47:22.734 --> 00:47:26.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I didn’t want anyone to think
that that was the case.

00:47:26.113 --> 00:47:30.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents noticed that I had become
very focused on these things.

00:47:31.535 --> 00:47:35.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes I would even ask
why people were treated this way.

00:47:36.373 --> 00:47:38.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
They helped me in many ways.

00:47:38.584 --> 00:47:42.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
They used relevant JW Broadcasting® episodes.

00:47:42.046 --> 00:47:45.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also helped me through family worship.

00:47:45.132 --> 00:47:47.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 2019 “Love Never Fails”! Convention

00:47:47.968 --> 00:47:49.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
was my favorite convention.

00:47:49.845 --> 00:47:54.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
The talk that stood out to me the most
spoke about how love “believes all things.”

00:47:55.601 --> 00:47:57.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we love our brothers and sisters,

00:47:57.394 --> 00:48:00.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
that means that we believe they have

00:48:00.231 --> 00:48:03.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
the best intentions toward us
and toward each other.

00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:07.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I had to let go
of negative and critical thinking,

00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now I have such amazing friendships

00:48:10.074 --> 00:48:12.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a variety of people.

00:48:12.201 --> 00:48:15.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to see the love that they have for me

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:17.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for each other—

00:48:17.373 --> 00:48:19.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
I get to show that and also receive it.

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:24.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture that came to mind
was Jeremiah 10:23,

00:48:24.756 --> 00:48:28.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
where it says that “it does not belong to man
. . . to direct his step.”

00:48:29.093 --> 00:48:31.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thinking about that scripture made me realize

00:48:31.554 --> 00:48:34.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people will not have success.

00:48:34.307 --> 00:48:38.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have never succeeded in the past,
and even now I see people fail.

00:48:38.519 --> 00:48:40.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me to show support,

00:48:40.522 --> 00:48:44.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
either by protesting or on social media,

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:46.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be like painting a sinking ship.

00:48:47.403 --> 00:48:49.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
This world is sinking,

00:48:49.447 --> 00:48:52.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it won’t do me any good
to show support for it.

00:48:55.662 --> 00:48:58.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
How are you conquering injustice today?

00:48:59.582 --> 00:49:02.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t feel like I’m a bystander anymore

00:49:02.127 --> 00:49:04.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that I’m not involved.

00:49:04.754 --> 00:49:07.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of feeling,

00:49:07.799 --> 00:49:10.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
like, exhausted and that there’s no change,

00:49:10.552 --> 00:49:12.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
I get to help people

00:49:12.012 --> 00:49:14.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving people a hope for the future
that comes from the Bible.

00:49:15.724 --> 00:49:19.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I don’t focus much on news
about how people are treated

00:49:19.269 --> 00:49:21.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the injustice.

00:49:22.606 --> 00:49:26.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as a volunteer who preaches full time,

00:49:26.818 --> 00:49:29.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
I help people to know Jehovah,

00:49:29.196 --> 00:49:31.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
know the truth,

00:49:31.240 --> 00:49:34.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and know what Jehovah
has in store for them in the future.

00:49:35.786 --> 00:49:38.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
During my Bible study with my dad,

00:49:38.205 --> 00:49:40.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
we studied prophecies
and the fulfillment of them.

00:49:40.708 --> 00:49:46.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so I got to see
that whatever Jehovah promised,

00:49:46.005 --> 00:49:48.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
he fulfilled 100 percent.

00:49:48.299 --> 00:49:51.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
So whatever he’s promised for the future,

00:49:51.635 --> 00:49:53.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s also going to fulfill.

00:49:54.805 --> 00:49:57.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people have love.

00:49:57.224 --> 00:50:00.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
They support each other in difficult times,

00:50:00.019 --> 00:50:02.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though they speak different languages

00:50:02.772 --> 00:50:06.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they come from different places,
different countries.

00:50:07.818 --> 00:50:11.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
It convinces me that even in the future

00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:13.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the rule of God’s Kingdom,

00:50:13.616 --> 00:50:16.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone in the world
will be showing that love.

00:50:28.923 --> 00:50:32.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we see injustice,
we want to help;

00:50:32.385 --> 00:50:35.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not unfeeling robots.

00:50:35.013 --> 00:50:37.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Emma and Alwande,

00:50:37.181 --> 00:50:41.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
we use our energy
to help people experience lasting comfort.

00:50:43.354 --> 00:50:44.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,

00:50:44.981 --> 00:50:48.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve seen how
to accept discipline with humility,

00:50:49.527 --> 00:50:53.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to fight injustice
with lasting acts of love,

00:50:53.615 --> 00:50:58.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how to scale the unexpected walls
of life with Jehovah’s help.

00:50:59.329 --> 00:51:04.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our music video beautifully sums up
many of the points we’ve considered.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:28.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God, a weight I bear
Of anxious thoughts, of all of life’s cares.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:35.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
I approach your throne
so sure that you

00:51:35.699 --> 00:51:44.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will hold my hand
And help me get through.

00:51:44.666 --> 00:51:52.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do pray
To have your spirit ev’ry day.

00:51:52.925 --> 00:52:07.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a lift from you,
I can fly up high above the world below.

00:52:09.442 --> 00:52:17.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like an eagle
with its wings outstretched,

00:52:17.074 --> 00:52:29.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
I soar on the power beyond my own,
The power beyond my own.

00:52:38.846 --> 00:52:47.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
The strength I’ve gained
from you, my God,

00:52:47.188 --> 00:52:55.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Helps me, in turn,
care for downhearted ones.

00:52:55.447 --> 00:53:11.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when they know that you are there,
They feel your love and tender care.

00:53:11.546 --> 00:53:19.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do pray
To have your spirit ev’ry day.

00:53:19.763 --> 00:53:34.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a lift from you,
I can fly up high above the world below.

00:53:36.280 --> 00:53:43.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like an eagle
with its wings outstretched,

00:53:43.996 --> 00:53:56.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
I soar on the power beyond my own,
The power beyond my own.

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:37.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a lift from you,
I can fly up high above the world below.

00:54:37.967 --> 00:54:46.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like an eagle
with its wings outstretched,

00:54:46.017 --> 00:55:01.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
I soar on the power beyond my own,
The power beyond my own,

00:55:01.658 --> 00:55:21.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
The power beyond my own,
The power beyond my own.

00:55:23.763 --> 00:55:27.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s postcard comes from Canada,

00:55:27.517 --> 00:55:29.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you’ll find snowcapped mountains,

00:55:29.936 --> 00:55:34.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
crystal clear freshwater lakes,
and sweeping prairies.

00:55:34.691 --> 00:55:38.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tourists travel from around the world
to see Canada’s moose,

00:55:38.612 --> 00:55:39.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
black bears,

00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:42.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and woodland caribou.

00:55:42.032 --> 00:55:47.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll also find one of the world’s
largest deposits of dinosaur fossils.

00:55:47.037 --> 00:55:50.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no trip is complete
without trying the local foods.

00:55:50.999 --> 00:55:52.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can have poutine,

00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:55.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
French fries smothered
in gravy and cheese curds,

00:55:55.963 --> 00:55:58.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
or sweets made with maple syrup.

00:55:59.883 --> 00:56:03.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
Canada is unique
in having the world’s longest coastline,

00:56:03.512 --> 00:56:07.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
where our Canadian brothers
have a rich history of preaching.

00:56:08.517 --> 00:56:11.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1930, a motorboat named the <i>Charmian </i>

00:56:11.103 --> 00:56:13.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and equipped with a powerful speaker system

00:56:13.522 --> 00:56:16.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
was used to project Bible lectures
across the water.

00:56:17.777 --> 00:56:19.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the 1940’s,

00:56:19.570 --> 00:56:23.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>Kingdom 1</i> carried ministers up and down
the Newfoundland

00:56:23.532 --> 00:56:25.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Labrador coasts.

00:56:26.118 --> 00:56:28.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that zealous pattern
continues to this day

00:56:28.537 --> 00:56:31.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the fishing towns of Newfoundland,
