Welcome!

00:00:03.253 --> 00:00:06.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m here with my good friend and cohost,
Chris Mavor.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Chris, what’s in store
for this month’s program?

00:00:09.726 --> 00:00:10.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks, Brother Herd.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see the value of learning

00:00:13.396 --> 00:00:16.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the good example
of Philip the evangelizer.

00:00:18.068 --> 00:00:22.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll also learn why Jehovah
is still the best Teacher today.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our new song shows how,

00:00:26.076 --> 00:00:27.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by safeguarding our heart and mind,

00:00:27.877 --> 00:00:30.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can focus on Jehovah’s blessings.

00:00:31.481 --> 00:00:36.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is JW Broadcasting® for April 2021!

00:00:54.804 --> 00:00:56.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In addressing our theme

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.509 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Is Your Best Good Enough?”

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:03.213 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to start by reading Galatians 6:4.

00:01:05.048 --> 00:01:07.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “But let each one

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“examine his own actions,

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:11.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and then he will have cause for rejoicing

00:01:11.721 --> 00:01:14.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in regard to himself alone,

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:17.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not in comparison with the other person.”

00:01:18.361 --> 00:01:21.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re told to “examine [our] own actions.”

00:01:21.197 --> 00:01:25.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So ask yourself: ‘How am I doing spiritually?

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:29.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I happy with my attendance
at Christian meetings?

00:01:29.472 --> 00:01:34.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I participate
by sharing meaningful comments as able?

00:01:34.477 --> 00:01:37.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How about my personal study of the Bible?

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Let me examine
my involvement in the ministry.

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Could I do better in preparing
for my return visits?

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:50.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I conduct any Bible studies
with interested ones?

00:01:50.293 --> 00:01:54.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, am I content with what I am doing?’

00:01:54.964 --> 00:01:57.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In effect, you’re asking yourself,

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is my best good enough?’

00:02:01.471 --> 00:02:06.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might see others in the congregation
that are doing more than we are.

00:02:06.476 --> 00:02:10.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then we look back at Galatians 6:4 again,

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it clearly said

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:17.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that I should not compare
myself with the other person.

00:02:17.654 --> 00:02:21.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we could quickly assume
that we’re doing what we can,

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:26.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reasoning that it’s good enough.

00:02:26.062 --> 00:02:30.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But let’s not forget
the first part of the verse.

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:34.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are to “examine [our] own actions.”

00:02:35.805 --> 00:02:39.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to compare what we are doing

00:02:39.075 --> 00:02:42.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what we personally could be doing.

00:02:42.846 --> 00:02:44.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We need to be active

00:02:44.848 --> 00:02:48.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not become
self-satisfied and overconfident.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First Corinthians 10:12
provides this warning:

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So let the one who thinks he is standing

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.863 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
beware that he does not fall.”

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you may say: ‘I’m doing my best!

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:06.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What more can I do?’

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:10.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take a good look at your best—scrutinize it.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Examine very closely all you’re doing
with the time that you have.

00:03:16.546 --> 00:03:21.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can mundane activity be replaced
with theocratic activity?

00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you see?

00:03:23.553 --> 00:03:26.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your best good enough?

00:03:26.256 --> 00:03:30.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be; it may not be.

00:03:30.093 --> 00:03:32.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It depends on one’s outlook.

00:03:32.962 --> 00:03:35.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are some examples?

00:03:36.232 --> 00:03:41.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A runner in a race—he practices; trains;

00:03:41.004 --> 00:03:45.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
eats the right things;
keeps a lean, healthy body;

00:03:46.843 --> 00:03:51.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wears the best running shoes; and so forth.

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:53.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He gives his best

00:03:53.383 --> 00:03:56.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but loses the race to someone faster.

00:03:56.986 --> 00:04:00.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His best was not good enough.

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:02.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:04:02.425 --> 00:04:07.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was compared to
whether he was faster than his competitors.

00:04:07.163 --> 00:04:10.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yohan Blake lost to Usain Bolt

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:13.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a 100-meter event in 2012

00:04:13.736 --> 00:04:17.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by just a fraction of a second.

00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:23.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He did his best,
but his best wasn’t good enough.

00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:27.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A mother and daughter

00:04:27.016 --> 00:04:30.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the daughter is
in the second grade at school.

00:04:30.253 --> 00:04:34.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She brings home a picture she drew in class.

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher had put a <i>B-</i> on the picture.

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The daughter shows it to her mother,

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the mother crosses out the <i>B-</i>

00:04:43.566 --> 00:04:46.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and puts an <i>A+</i> on it.

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:50.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She then tapes the picture
on the refrigerator.

00:04:51.774 --> 00:04:55.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the difference
between the teacher and the mother?

00:04:56.846 --> 00:05:01.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The teacher compares the student
to other classmates of her age.

00:05:01.317 --> 00:05:04.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The mother grades her according to her best,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not in comparison with others.

00:05:09.025 --> 00:05:14.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah does not compare your best
with the best of others.

00:05:14.664 --> 00:05:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Psalm 103:14.

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:22.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah examines
our spiritual accomplishments,

00:05:22.005 --> 00:05:25.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s one of his measuring sticks?

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:30.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Psalm 103:14:

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For he well knows how we are formed,

00:05:35.184 --> 00:05:38.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remembering that we are dust.”

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:40.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Dust” is used figuratively,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
indicating mankind’s frailty and lowliness.

00:05:44.894 --> 00:05:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By “remembering that we are dust,”

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah never asks more of us
than we can give.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, he expects us to obey his commands

00:05:57.273 --> 00:06:00.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the best of our own ability.

00:06:01.711 --> 00:06:06.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark 12:30
—you can likely quote it from memory.

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:08.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verse 30 says:

00:06:08.284 --> 00:06:11.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God

00:06:11.788 --> 00:06:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“with your whole heart

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and with your whole soul

00:06:17.093 --> 00:06:19.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and with your whole mind

00:06:19.929 --> 00:06:23.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with your whole strength.”

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This embraces everything we have
—all that we are.

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:30.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You go in service;

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you use “your whole strength”
to accomplish it.

00:06:34.444 --> 00:06:36.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s commendable.

00:06:36.446 --> 00:06:41.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what good is it to use our whole strength

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:44.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go in service if our mind

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
cannot direct our tongue

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:51.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to say the right things
when we talk to a person?

00:06:52.261 --> 00:06:53.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I used a lot

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘of my strength walking

00:06:55.765 --> 00:07:00.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘from door to door,
climbing stairs, and so forth.

00:07:00.269 --> 00:07:02.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And yet, no one let me get past

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my introduction.’

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:10.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Question: Was that
the best introduction you could give?

00:07:11.347 --> 00:07:15.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How long have you been using
that introduction?

00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:17.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would a new one help?

00:07:17.386 --> 00:07:20.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would using “your whole mind”

00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:22.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of advance preparation

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:27.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
result in making your best even better?

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:31.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you tried to use
some of the introductions

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
demonstrated at our midweek meetings

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or some of those found
in the <i>Reasoning From the Scriptures</i>  book,

00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:39.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pages 9-15?

00:07:41.244 --> 00:07:43.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does the householder see

00:07:43.846 --> 00:07:45.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in your face

00:07:45.348 --> 00:07:46.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when she opens the door?

00:07:46.782 --> 00:07:47.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your countenance

00:07:47.783 --> 00:07:51.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
radiating pleasantness and kindness?

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:55.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does she see good news or bad news?

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:59.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you look happy or sad?

00:07:59.128 --> 00:08:02.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The message
we’re commissioned to deliver today

00:08:02.532 --> 00:08:06.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the “good news of the Kingdom.”

00:08:06.202 --> 00:08:10.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We expect it to change
sometime in the near future.

00:08:10.339 --> 00:08:14.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do the best you can until you know better.

00:08:14.877 --> 00:08:19.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then when you know better, you can do better.

00:08:20.883 --> 00:08:23.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You attend all congregation meetings

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and pay rapt attention with your mind.

00:08:26.489 --> 00:08:28.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re to be commended.

00:08:28.491 --> 00:08:31.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But is that all that’s required

00:08:31.427 --> 00:08:35.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to love Jehovah with our whole mind?

00:08:35.198 --> 00:08:38.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are we meditating on the knowledge

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:41.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive at our meetings

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:45.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to draw close to Jehovah?

00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:48.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
James 4:8 says:

00:08:48.211 --> 00:08:53.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Draw close to God,
and he will draw close to you.”

00:08:53.216 --> 00:08:58.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s one benefit we receive
from our meeting attendance.

00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:03.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Hebrews 10:24, 25.

00:09:07.196 --> 00:09:10.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is another benefit
of regular meeting attendance.

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:14.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, we give
and receive encouragement.

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:18.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verses 24 and 25 read:

00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:22.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And let us consider one another

00:09:22.845 --> 00:09:27.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so as to incite to love and fine works,

00:09:27.483 --> 00:09:30.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not forsaking our meeting together,

00:09:30.686 --> 00:09:32.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as some have the custom,

00:09:32.822 --> 00:09:35.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but encouraging one another,

00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:37.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and all the more so

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:40.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you see the day drawing near.”

00:09:40.963 --> 00:09:43.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you give comments at meetings?

00:09:43.599 --> 00:09:46.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are they well-prepared?

00:09:46.335 --> 00:09:50.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do they encourage your brothers and sisters?

00:09:50.606 --> 00:09:52.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you giving your best?

00:09:52.975 --> 00:09:56.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If so, then your best is good enough.

00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:00.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about your personal study

00:10:00.783 --> 00:10:02.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or family worship?

00:10:04.453 --> 00:10:06.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you doing your best?

00:10:06.789 --> 00:10:08.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your best good enough?

00:10:10.026 --> 00:10:14.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I read all <i>The Watchtowers</i>  and <i>Awakes! </i>
when they come out,” you say.

00:10:14.563 --> 00:10:18.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It goes without saying that that’s good.

00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:21.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you find in what you read

00:10:21.937 --> 00:10:26.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will deepen your love
and appreciation for Jehovah

00:10:26.676 --> 00:10:30.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and draw you closer to him?

00:10:30.446 --> 00:10:34.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you use your whole mind

00:10:34.116 --> 00:10:37.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meditate and continue to think about it,

00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:42.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
thus spiking it down deep into your heart?

00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:44.226 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some things we learn

00:10:44.226 --> 00:10:47.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may not be immediately applicable

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:50.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but can be regurgitated

00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:53.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and applied later as needed.

00:10:54.503 --> 00:10:56.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you giving serious attention

00:10:56.672 --> 00:11:00.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the spiritual needs
of your wife and children?

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:04.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, you have family worship most weeks.

00:11:04.747 --> 00:11:06.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s commendable.

00:11:06.949 --> 00:11:09.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you prepare well for it

00:11:09.118 --> 00:11:13.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or just throw something together
at the last minute?

00:11:13.489 --> 00:11:17.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if your wife
just threw something on the table 

00:11:17.093 --> 00:11:19.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for dinner each evening

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:23.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without giving any thought
to the health needs of the family?

00:11:23.866 --> 00:11:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think: Is your best good enough?

00:11:30.072 --> 00:11:33.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can slop a pig, and he’ll enjoy it.

00:11:33.676 --> 00:11:38.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But give the same garbage
to a cow, and she’ll ignore it.

00:11:38.647 --> 00:11:40.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are we considering

00:11:40.683 --> 00:11:43.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is Your Best Good Enough?”

00:11:43.886 --> 00:11:47.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s only as a reminder

00:11:47.123 --> 00:11:51.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to look at what we think to be our best

00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:55.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in what we’re doing
for ourselves, our families,

00:11:55.464 --> 00:11:58.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:03.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember, our best is not compared

00:12:03.005 --> 00:12:06.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the best of another brother or sister.

00:12:06.575 --> 00:12:09.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah knows

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:12.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re doing our best.

00:12:12.181 --> 00:12:16.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He is a righteous and fair Judge.

00:12:16.619 --> 00:12:19.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our knowledge, even of ourself,

00:12:19.822 --> 00:12:23.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can be faulty because of inherited sin.

00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:25.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Therefore, it’s wisdom on our part

00:12:25.861 --> 00:12:28.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep examining ourselves

00:12:28.397 --> 00:12:31.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see where we might improve.

00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:34.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is your best good enough?

00:12:34.837 --> 00:12:37.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to think it is.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:12:41.811 --> 00:12:44.647 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
What would you like to be known for?

00:12:44.647 --> 00:12:46.649 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the first century,

00:12:46.649 --> 00:12:48.551 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a servant of Jehovah named Philip

00:12:48.551 --> 00:12:51.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was known as “the evangelizer.”

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:53.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following dramatization,

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:56.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll learn how Philip earned this reputation

00:12:56.725 --> 00:12:59.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what we can apply from his good example.

00:13:05.501 --> 00:13:07.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find your seats.

00:13:07.236 --> 00:13:09.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s time to start our graduation program.

00:13:11.774 --> 00:13:14.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We never dreamed this would happen.

00:13:15.678 --> 00:13:19.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a very special day
all of us have been anxiously waiting for.

00:13:19.582 --> 00:13:21.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re happy to see all of you here.

00:13:21.517 --> 00:13:23.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It all started a few years ago.

00:13:26.455 --> 00:13:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’d like to have the circuit overseer 
and his wife for a meal . . .

00:13:31.227 --> 00:13:33.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was during that visit and this question.

00:13:34.763 --> 00:13:36.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His theme on Tuesday is

00:13:36.765 --> 00:13:39.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Lessons Can We Learn

00:13:39.635 --> 00:13:42.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From Philip the Evangelizer?”

00:13:42.471 --> 00:13:43.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm.

00:13:43.973 --> 00:13:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What could we learn from Philip?

00:13:46.609 --> 00:13:50.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Honestly, we were already busy
with the right things.

00:13:50.045 --> 00:13:53.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lilly and the girls helped out
wherever they could.

00:13:59.555 --> 00:14:01.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I worked
on Kingdom Hall maintenance projects.

00:14:07.229 --> 00:14:09.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had
a regular schedule for the ministry.

00:14:12.401 --> 00:14:14.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like in a lot of places,

00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.438 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when someone showed interest,

00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:19.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was tough to find them again.

00:14:25.814 --> 00:14:28.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I wondered if our spiritual routine
needed an update.

00:14:39.862 --> 00:14:41.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Looking forward to that talk,

00:14:41.864 --> 00:14:45.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I decided we’d research Philip
for family worship

00:14:49.038 --> 00:14:51.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—Acts chapter 6.

00:14:56.612 --> 00:14:58.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip was one of seven brothers

00:14:58.614 --> 00:15:02.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
selected to distribute food
to Christian widows in Jerusalem.

00:15:13.963 --> 00:15:15.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was an important assignment,

00:15:17.633 --> 00:15:20.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he did so much more than that.

00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hmm, this is interesting.

00:15:42.625 --> 00:15:44.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of the persecution,

00:15:44.727 --> 00:15:46.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip had to flee from Jerusalem to Samaria.

00:16:10.185 --> 00:16:12.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samaria hadn’t accepted
the word of Jehovah yet.

00:16:32.641 --> 00:16:35.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Philip saw that trial
as a spiritual opportunity.

00:16:41.617 --> 00:16:45.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Samaria was largely untouched
by the preaching work.

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip declared the good news zealously,

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:56.699 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and many believed and got baptized.

00:17:00.769 --> 00:17:03.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sometime later,

00:17:05.074 --> 00:17:07.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an angel spoke with him.

00:17:09.978 --> 00:17:13.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He told Philip
to “get up and go to the south.”

00:17:29.198 --> 00:17:33.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led him to find the Ethiopian eunuch
and preach in other cities.

00:17:34.636 --> 00:17:38.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip was willing to serve
wherever there was a need.

00:17:38.674 --> 00:17:41.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he always kept that evangelizing spirit.

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:44.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some twenty years later,
he was still known as “the evangelizer.”

00:17:48.884 --> 00:17:52.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By that time, his life had changed.

00:17:54.056 --> 00:17:57.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was a family man with four daughters.

00:18:01.063 --> 00:18:04.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that didn’t stop him
from showing hospitality

00:18:04.733 --> 00:18:07.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Paul and his companions came to visit.

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:16.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Visits like that must have been

00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:18.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
full of spiritual lessons for his daughters.

00:18:24.319 --> 00:18:27.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That night, we came up
with a few things we wanted to do.

00:18:29.925 --> 00:18:32.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We started by having
the circuit overseer to lunch.

00:18:32.828 --> 00:18:35.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We hadn’t made time for that in a while.

00:18:39.368 --> 00:18:41.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Alex and Carla’s experiences

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:45.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made the girls excited
to reach their own spiritual goals.

00:18:56.285 --> 00:19:01.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But like Philip,
changes came that we didn’t expect.

00:19:01.156 --> 00:19:04.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was out of work for a few months.

00:19:08.163 --> 00:19:10.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a stressful time

00:19:11.567 --> 00:19:14.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also a spiritual opportunity.

00:19:20.209 --> 00:19:22.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I could visit people
at different times of the day.

00:19:29.718 --> 00:19:32.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We tried to make the most
of the situation and preach zealously

00:19:34.122 --> 00:19:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Philip.

00:19:40.762 --> 00:19:42.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here we are,

00:19:42.831 --> 00:19:47.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
watching our girls graduate
from the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:56.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those few lessons

00:19:56.712 --> 00:19:59.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a big difference for this family

00:19:59.548 --> 00:20:01.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of evangelizers.

00:20:03.552 --> 00:20:07.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bible is rich with examples like Philip.

00:20:07.322 --> 00:20:12.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have many fine examples
among Jehovah’s people in our day.

00:20:12.027 --> 00:20:15.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Learning from them
helps us make good decisions

00:20:15.264 --> 00:20:17.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and manage serious issues.

00:20:17.966 --> 00:20:20.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s pay attention to this interview

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:23.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Eugene and Odile Nteziryayo,

00:20:23.405 --> 00:20:27.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who attended the 145th class of Gilead.

00:20:27.242 --> 00:20:30.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What can we learn from their example
of faith and endurance?

00:21:03.078 --> 00:21:08.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With us today, we have
Eugene and Odile Nteziryayo.

00:21:08.083 --> 00:21:11.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve graduated
from the 145th class of Gilead,

00:21:11.553 --> 00:21:15.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they lived through this mayhem.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:18.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Odile, now, your family is Tutsi,

00:21:18.660 --> 00:21:21.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this must have certainly
put them in danger.

00:21:21.496 --> 00:21:25.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The killing was happening
all over the country,

00:21:25.033 --> 00:21:29.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so my parents and my brother were killed.

00:21:32.808 --> 00:21:36.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw that some religious leaders
were involved

00:21:36.645 --> 00:21:39.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in killing people in the genocide.

00:21:39.514 --> 00:21:41.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t believe how friendly people

00:21:41.516 --> 00:21:44.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were previously living together

00:21:44.886 --> 00:21:48.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now started killing their neighbors.

00:21:49.224 --> 00:21:51.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you get contact with the truth?

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:55.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So after the genocide,
I was taken in by my aunt

00:21:55.998 --> 00:21:58.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose family were Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I began studying the Bible with them.

00:22:00.936 --> 00:22:04.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was in the <i>Live Forever</i>  book.

00:22:04.239 --> 00:22:08.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw a picture of a priest
blessing people in the church,

00:22:08.543 --> 00:22:13.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then he was blessing troops
who were going to kill.

00:22:13.482 --> 00:22:18.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But also I could see
how brothers and sisters in the congregation

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would love and encourage.

00:22:20.555 --> 00:22:23.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they risked their lives
to take care of one another.

00:22:23.792 --> 00:22:25.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, that’s touching.

00:22:25.927 --> 00:22:27.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, Eugene,

00:22:27.963 --> 00:22:31.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your family was not a direct target
of the violence,

00:22:31.199 --> 00:22:33.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but what other hardships did you face?

00:22:33.802 --> 00:22:37.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The economic situation was very difficult.

00:22:37.973 --> 00:22:40.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My family had no money,

00:22:40.409 --> 00:22:43.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they could not buy food.

00:22:43.078 --> 00:22:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember my mom

00:22:45.347 --> 00:22:49.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—I can still see her lying on the bed
in complete despair,

00:22:49.251 --> 00:22:53.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not knowing what she could do
for us children.

00:22:53.922 --> 00:22:57.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders asked me to go
to the Kingdom Hall,

00:22:57.559 --> 00:23:00.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when I arrived,

00:23:00.429 --> 00:23:05.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they handed me 18,000 Rwandan francs.

00:23:05.133 --> 00:23:10.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The elders told me
that my brothers and sisters from abroad

00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:12.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
offered us this gift.

00:23:12.974 --> 00:23:15.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So I immediately ran back home,

00:23:15.877 --> 00:23:18.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found my mom still lying on the bed,

00:23:18.613 --> 00:23:20.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and gave her the money.

00:23:20.816 --> 00:23:24.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can still see my mom crying

00:23:24.586 --> 00:23:27.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the joy

00:23:27.422 --> 00:23:30.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thankfulness
of what the brothers had done.

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:32.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Excellent.

00:23:32.694 --> 00:23:36.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, looking back at all the injustices
you and your family have suffered,

00:23:36.798 --> 00:23:41.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Odile, what has helped you
to not become a bitter person?

00:23:41.436 --> 00:23:43.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The preaching work is very important to me

00:23:43.905 --> 00:23:48.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the more I talk
about the Bible’s promises,

00:23:48.343 --> 00:23:50.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the more they become real to me.

00:23:50.412 --> 00:23:54.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, when I talk
about the resurrection hope

00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:56.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the condition of the dead,

00:23:56.051 --> 00:23:58.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this helps me to feel

00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:01.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that my loved ones are not suffering anymore

00:24:01.456 --> 00:24:04.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they are waiting to be resurrected.

00:24:04.593 --> 00:24:07.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this makes me feel happy.

00:24:09.030 --> 00:24:12.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The scripture that comes to mind is

00:24:12.134 --> 00:24:15.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
1 John 2:6, 7,

00:24:15.937 --> 00:24:20.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the apostle John repeated
Jesus’ command

00:24:20.475 --> 00:24:24.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of loving one another just as Jesus loved us.

00:24:24.913 --> 00:24:28.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Christians during that time
were facing persecution,

00:24:28.984 --> 00:24:33.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and now they needed a fresh application
of that scripture in their lives.

00:24:33.989 --> 00:24:36.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We all love one another,

00:24:36.158 --> 00:24:38.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but during difficult moments

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the ones our brothers in Rwanda
went through,

00:24:42.297 --> 00:24:45.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they needed that fresh application

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this very commandment of Jesus:

00:24:49.871 --> 00:24:53.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loving one another to the point

00:24:53.975 --> 00:24:58.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of risking our lives for our brothers.

00:24:58.113 --> 00:25:03.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Being here in Gilead
has reminded me of that fact

00:25:03.118 --> 00:25:06.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—that I really need to love
my brothers and sisters

00:25:06.888 --> 00:25:10.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Jesus loved us.

00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:12.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You brothers and sisters in Rwanda

00:25:12.627 --> 00:25:15.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have given us a wonderful example

00:25:15.697 --> 00:25:18.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of courage and faith and love.

00:25:18.033 --> 00:25:21.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please know that we love you all very much.

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:23.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you.

00:25:23.538 --> 00:25:25.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you for joining us

00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:29.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on this edition of <i>Extraordinary Experiences.</i>

00:25:30.645 --> 00:25:33.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was a very moving experience.

00:25:33.815 --> 00:25:37.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can imitate the good example
of our brothers in Rwanda

00:25:37.552 --> 00:25:40.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by taking care of brothers and sisters
when they’re in need.

00:25:42.123 --> 00:25:45.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In recent years,
our video dramas have brought to life

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:49.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jonah, Josiah, and other examples of faith.

00:25:49.764 --> 00:25:52.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have you wondered how our brothers ensure

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these dramas
are both vivid and accurate?

00:25:55.604 --> 00:25:59.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s go behind the scenes
of one of our latest dramas: 

00:25:59.474 --> 00:26:03.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Nehemiah:</i>
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold.” </i>

00:26:13.255 --> 00:26:16.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Nehemiah’s day, the Jews joyfully embarked

00:26:16.458 --> 00:26:18.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on a massive building project.

00:26:18.927 --> 00:26:20.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s direction and help,

00:26:20.929 --> 00:26:22.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they were able to finish the work

00:26:22.597 --> 00:26:24.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just 52 days.

00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:27.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You look like you’ve been working.

00:26:27.135 --> 00:26:29.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the production of the film

00:26:29.604 --> 00:26:33.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Nehemiah:</i>
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold,” </i>

00:26:33.108 --> 00:26:36.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the walls of Jerusalem were built once again,

00:26:36.177 --> 00:26:40.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but this time at the Mount Ebo studios
in Brewster, New York.

00:26:43.585 --> 00:26:46.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A variety of skills were needed
to produce this drama

00:26:48.657 --> 00:26:51.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with many volunteers coming together,

00:26:51.259 --> 00:26:54.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using their time, energy, and abilities

00:26:54.195 --> 00:26:57.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create an accurate teaching tool.

00:26:58.133 --> 00:27:00.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they found great joy in their work.

00:27:17.285 --> 00:27:20.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good planning was needed
right at the start of production.

00:27:23.725 --> 00:27:26.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Every day began with a Scriptural discussion

00:27:26.695 --> 00:27:29.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and prayer.

00:27:30.965 --> 00:27:33.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The costume and makeup departments

00:27:33.501 --> 00:27:35.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prepared the actors to appear on set.

00:27:42.811 --> 00:27:45.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Assistance was provided to help actors

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:48.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
feel more comfortable
in front of the cameras.

00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:54.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And action!

00:27:56.524 --> 00:27:58.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers, please.

00:27:58.693 --> 00:28:00.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have they attacked anyone yet?

00:28:00.528 --> 00:28:01.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must have.

00:28:02.097 --> 00:28:03.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No! But they will.

00:28:03.932 --> 00:28:07.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While the production team
was filming in one studio,

00:28:07.168 --> 00:28:10.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets were being prepared in another.

00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:16.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To add to the realism,
detailed props were made

00:28:16.911 --> 00:28:19.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—many using 3D printing.

00:28:23.518 --> 00:28:27.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With all of these researched
and crafted costumes,

00:28:27.255 --> 00:28:29.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets, and props combined,

00:28:29.624 --> 00:28:33.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
environments were designed
to accurately recreate the time period.

00:28:37.866 --> 00:28:40.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even more was needed
to convey what it was like

00:28:40.869 --> 00:28:43.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live in Jerusalem during Nehemiah’s day.

00:28:43.805 --> 00:28:47.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, there were many animals on set.

00:29:13.668 --> 00:29:17.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even after principal filming was completed,

00:29:17.238 --> 00:29:19.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
sets built in the studio were extended

00:29:19.174 --> 00:29:22.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using advanced visual effects.

00:29:23.845 --> 00:29:26.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Digital construction work was done

00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:28.650 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by the visual effects team.

00:30:08.189 --> 00:30:12.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, building is a legacy of God’s people.

00:30:15.964 --> 00:30:18.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nehemiah was one of many
who throughout history

00:30:18.399 --> 00:30:22.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
devoted their energies
to supporting the work of building.

00:30:25.073 --> 00:30:27.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In a similar way,
the production team that made

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:31.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Nehemiah:</i>
<i>“The Joy of Jehovah Is Your Stronghold,” </i>

00:30:31.646 --> 00:30:34.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
joyfully worked hard to produce a film

00:30:34.215 --> 00:30:37.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that helps build love and appreciation

00:30:37.685 --> 00:30:39.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the hearts of God’s people.

00:30:43.324 --> 00:30:47.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learn from good examples
like Nehemiah and many others.

00:30:47.829 --> 00:30:50.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, as we’ll see in our next video,

00:30:50.131 --> 00:30:54.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we also learn important lessons
from those who made poor decisions.

00:31:00.241 --> 00:31:03.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born to two Christian parents;

00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:07.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they always tried to instill in us
a love for Jehovah.

00:31:07.849 --> 00:31:10.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I felt quite lonely growing up,

00:31:10.618 --> 00:31:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I felt like I didn’t have people
who wanted to do the same things

00:31:14.923 --> 00:31:18.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the lifestyle, the way they spoke,
the music they were listening to—

00:31:18.826 --> 00:31:22.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so for me, the real struggle was
where do I stand?

00:31:22.730 --> 00:31:24.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Where are my boundaries going to be set?

00:31:24.732 --> 00:31:27.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s really hard because it could mean

00:31:27.035 --> 00:31:29.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the difference between having a friend
and not having a friend.

00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:32.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Over the years, I have talked to several

00:31:32.507 --> 00:31:35.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who’ve perhaps drifted a little bit
in the truth.

00:31:35.843 --> 00:31:40.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that unfortunately happened
to some of my friends.

00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:43.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nobody is immune
to the pressures of the world.

00:31:44.852 --> 00:31:46.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was born and raised by Christian parents,

00:31:46.921 --> 00:31:50.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so all through my childhood
and teenage years,

00:31:50.425 --> 00:31:54.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was happy serving Jehovah,

00:31:54.629 --> 00:31:57.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it got a little bit harder
when I started to work.

00:31:57.865 --> 00:31:59.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People at work would ask me

00:31:59.968 --> 00:32:03.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do social activities with them,
go for a drink and things,

00:32:03.404 --> 00:32:07.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but there were men who would ask me
to go out with them.

00:32:07.809 --> 00:32:12.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s flattering when someone
shows interest in you, so it was nice,

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:16.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was hard to have to
constantly remind myself,

00:32:16.684 --> 00:32:19.687 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, you know that this
is not going to be successful;

00:32:19.687 --> 00:32:21.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know this person doesn’t love Jehovah.’

00:32:22.957 --> 00:32:26.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I remember one day
I drove into a parking lot,

00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:28.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I just prayed to Jehovah
with tears in my eyes, and I said:

00:32:28.696 --> 00:32:31.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“This is too hard. This is just too hard.

00:32:31.633 --> 00:32:34.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The people that are my friends
are starting to leave the truth.

00:32:34.869 --> 00:32:37.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel quite lonely,
but I want to serve you.”

00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:40.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that prayer I went home,
I spoke to my mom,

00:32:40.842 --> 00:32:44.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she got really quiet,
and she just looked at me and said,

00:32:44.078 --> 00:32:47.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Anything Jehovah tells you
is to benefit yourself.”

00:32:47.348 --> 00:32:51.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it clicked in that moment
that Jehovah was saying to me: “I love you.

00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:54.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will carry you through this time,
and you’ll see

00:32:54.856 --> 00:32:56.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there will be all these blessings
that’ll open up to you,

00:32:56.891 --> 00:32:59.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you’ll have
a really wonderful, colorful life,

00:32:59.527 --> 00:33:02.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you have to hang in there.”

00:33:02.130 --> 00:33:05.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though it was hard,
I resisted the temptation,

00:33:05.967 --> 00:33:09.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but someone close to me
who faced the same pressure

00:33:09.537 --> 00:33:12.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave in and ended up leaving Jehovah.

00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:14.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When I heard

00:33:14.542 --> 00:33:18.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that she was disfellowshipped,

00:33:21.015 --> 00:33:25.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it just completely hit me so hard

00:33:25.386 --> 00:33:28.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you really are just worried

00:33:28.122 --> 00:33:31.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what is going to happen
with their future.

00:33:31.059 --> 00:33:34.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a while, she did come back to Jehovah.

00:33:34.962 --> 00:33:38.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s raising a child on her own.

00:33:38.166 --> 00:33:40.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day we were having a video chat

00:33:40.301 --> 00:33:42.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the little one
just playing in the background,

00:33:42.804 --> 00:33:46.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she suddenly turned around and said,

00:33:46.741 --> 00:33:50.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Mummy, why did you marry someone
who doesn’t love Jehovah?”

00:33:50.812 --> 00:33:55.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She understood that we need to live
according to Jehovah’s standards.

00:33:55.583 --> 00:34:00.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As elders, we can help people to get up
and get back on the path to life,

00:34:00.455 --> 00:34:02.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s a real pleasure.

00:34:02.457 --> 00:34:04.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m reminded about the account of David.

00:34:04.592 --> 00:34:08.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Eventually he was forgiven by Jehovah
because he had a good heart;

00:34:08.796 --> 00:34:13.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
however, there were consequences
all through his life.

00:34:15.103 --> 00:34:17.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve received so many blessings
for sticking to Jehovah.

00:34:17.872 --> 00:34:21.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I found a lovely brother to marry
in the Christian congregation,

00:34:21.843 --> 00:34:23.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re very happy together.

00:34:23.845 --> 00:34:25.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The thing to do
is to just stick with Jehovah.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Taste and see that Jehovah is good,”

00:34:28.216 --> 00:34:30.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when you do that, you will appreciate

00:34:30.952 --> 00:34:33.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is absolutely no need

00:34:33.187 --> 00:34:35.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to go anywhere else.

00:34:36.457 --> 00:34:39.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having observed what has happened
to people who have left the truth

00:34:39.961 --> 00:34:42.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the baggage they sometimes
end up carrying

00:34:42.997 --> 00:34:46.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they come back in the truth
makes me feel that it’s just not worth it.

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:51.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really, Jehovah is like a parent;
he wants to protect us and care for us.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:54.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Things will always work out for the best
if you do things Jehovah’s way.

00:34:54.842 --> 00:34:57.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I feel my family has had many blessings.

00:34:57.478 --> 00:35:00.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a husband and a father,

00:35:00.114 --> 00:35:02.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve got four children
who have all grown up in the truth.

00:35:02.683 --> 00:35:05.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’ve all gone on to have
good theocratic lives,

00:35:05.653 --> 00:35:08.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they’ve enjoyed
many privileges of service.

00:35:08.256 --> 00:35:12.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for me, it’s been a real blessing
to do things Jehovah’s way.

00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:14.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think when you test out the world,

00:35:14.929 --> 00:35:18.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Satan will give you immediate satisfaction,

00:35:18.232 --> 00:35:22.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but when you serve no purpose
to him anymore, that’s it.

00:35:22.603 --> 00:35:25.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the most beautiful blessings
I’ve received is people

00:35:25.506 --> 00:35:28.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—people around you who love Jehovah

00:35:28.209 --> 00:35:31.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who want to serve him the way you do.

00:35:31.546 --> 00:35:34.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really strongly believe that Jehovah

00:35:34.215 --> 00:35:36.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not only gives us a lot of blessings

00:35:36.951 --> 00:35:39.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but gives us blessings
that he’s handpicked for us.

00:35:42.256 --> 00:35:44.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My observation would be

00:35:44.258 --> 00:35:48.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that experience is not the best teacher;
Jehovah is the best Teacher.

00:35:51.999 --> 00:35:54.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah wants us to be happy

00:35:54.235 --> 00:35:58.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and avoid the painful consequences
of bad decisions.

00:35:58.306 --> 00:36:01.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’re facing
a test of integrity in some way,

00:36:01.709 --> 00:36:03.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
remember that, as our brother said,

00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:07.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is [our] best Teacher.”

00:36:07.215 --> 00:36:10.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, if we’re to learn from Jehovah,

00:36:10.551 --> 00:36:13.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have to allow him to teach us.

00:36:13.254 --> 00:36:16.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must let him mold us.

00:36:16.023 --> 00:36:18.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was the topic
of a recent morning worship

00:36:18.726 --> 00:36:20.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by Brother Gary Breaux.

00:36:21.863 --> 00:36:24.765 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our scripture here, Isaiah 64:8,

00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:26.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
clearly establishes

00:36:26.467 --> 00:36:29.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah God is the Potter

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.905 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—the Great Potter, in fact—

00:36:30.905 --> 00:36:32.907 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we are the clay.

00:36:32.907 --> 00:36:37.211 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, in what way is he molding us?

00:36:38.346 --> 00:36:40.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, one way is through adjusting

00:36:40.748 --> 00:36:43.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Christian personality.

00:36:43.818 --> 00:36:47.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does he do that?

00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:50.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he uses his Word
—the Bible—

00:36:50.558 --> 00:36:52.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his holy spirit,

00:36:52.894 --> 00:36:56.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Christian congregation.

00:36:56.631 --> 00:36:58.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what we’re going to do is talk

00:36:58.900 --> 00:37:02.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about how Jehovah helps
to mold our personality.

00:37:02.837 --> 00:37:05.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the process that’s used?

00:37:05.806 --> 00:37:09.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to talk about two aspects
of the Christian personality

00:37:09.343 --> 00:37:12.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—humility and kindness.

00:37:12.747 --> 00:37:16.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we said one way Jehovah uses

00:37:16.317 --> 00:37:20.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mold our personality
is his Word, the Bible.

00:37:20.421 --> 00:37:23.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Hebrews 4:12 says

00:37:23.457 --> 00:37:27.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that God’s Word has tremendous power.

00:37:27.628 --> 00:37:32.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we take individual scriptures
as we are reading it;

00:37:32.566 --> 00:37:35.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we look at our own personality:

00:37:35.236 --> 00:37:37.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What does it say about me?

00:37:37.605 --> 00:37:40.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I improve?’

00:37:40.408 --> 00:37:42.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s take an example: humility.

00:37:42.576 --> 00:37:46.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are going to go to Philippians chapter 2,

00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 3 and 4.

00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:52.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We see how this is a powerful aid to us.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:54.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s what we should do,

00:37:54.221 --> 00:37:59.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philippians 2:3, 4:

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do nothing out of contentiousness
or out of egotism,

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:04.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but with humility

00:38:04.565 --> 00:38:07.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“consider others superior to you,

00:38:07.601 --> 00:38:11.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as you look not only for your own interests,

00:38:11.672 --> 00:38:15.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also for the interests of others.”

00:38:15.509 --> 00:38:19.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we read this scripture,
we look at ourselves and say:

00:38:19.380 --> 00:38:22.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Well, how am I doing with this?

00:38:22.116 --> 00:38:24.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I see that I have made progress,

00:38:24.952 --> 00:38:28.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘especially if this has been
an issue in the past?

00:38:28.589 --> 00:38:32.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Is Jehovah somehow nudging me,
adjusting me,

00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
molding me by means
of this powerful scripture?’

00:38:36.931 --> 00:38:39.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ask yourself about humility:

00:38:39.633 --> 00:38:43.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I the person that always seems
to be in charge?

00:38:43.471 --> 00:38:47.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I give that attitude across to others?

00:38:47.408 --> 00:38:52.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or, as it says here,
Do I view others as superior?’

00:38:52.179 --> 00:38:54.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe even we’re saying,

00:38:54.548 --> 00:38:58.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I admit that that sister
has more patience than I have,”

00:38:58.352 --> 00:39:02.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “That brother is really
a better teacher than I am.”

00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:06.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, you see, by means
of individual scriptures,

00:39:06.660 --> 00:39:10.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God can help to mold our thinking.

00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:13.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in addition to the individual scripture,

00:39:13.768 --> 00:39:17.538 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible also provides examples

00:39:17.538 --> 00:39:21.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that quality in action.

00:39:21.542 --> 00:39:24.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the <i>Watchtower</i>  comment for today

00:39:24.178 --> 00:39:28.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
uses Christ Jesus as an example of humility.

00:39:28.215 --> 00:39:32.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s open to that scripture
(it’s referred to)

00:39:32.486 --> 00:39:35.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Luke chapter 22.

00:39:35.689 --> 00:39:37.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we read the account,

00:39:37.591 --> 00:39:39.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we think: ‘What can I learn?

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How did he handle it?

00:39:41.128 --> 00:39:42.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can I apply it?’

00:39:42.930 --> 00:39:45.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So Luke 22:24

00:39:45.466 --> 00:39:48.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—this took place
the evening before his death.

00:39:48.235 --> 00:39:51.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It says: “However, there also arose
a heated dispute among them

00:39:51.572 --> 00:39:54.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over which one of them
was considered to be the greatest.”

00:39:54.875 --> 00:39:59.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, automatically we see
there’s a problem of humility here.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, so, let’s move down now

00:40:02.149 --> 00:40:06.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to verses 26 and 27.

00:40:06.187 --> 00:40:08.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “You, though,
are not to be that way.

00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:12.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But let the one
who is the greatest among you

00:40:12.393 --> 00:40:14.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“become as the youngest,

00:40:14.395 --> 00:40:18.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the one taking the lead
as the one ministering.

00:40:18.032 --> 00:40:20.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For which one is greater,

00:40:20.134 --> 00:40:23.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the one dining or the one serving?

00:40:23.571 --> 00:40:26.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Is it not the one dining?

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:31.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I am among you as the one serving.”

00:40:32.146 --> 00:40:35.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, these were not just words,
because the apostles had seen

00:40:35.916 --> 00:40:39.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
three and a half years of a beautiful example

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Jesus serving others
—truly a humble man.

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And through our Bible reading too,

00:40:45.259 --> 00:40:49.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have seen this example of humility
that we can apply.

00:40:49.497 --> 00:40:52.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it’s good for us to ask ourselves:

00:40:52.533 --> 00:40:55.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Am I a proud person?

00:40:55.503 --> 00:40:59.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I give off that impression to others?

00:40:59.607 --> 00:41:04.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Do I view myself as “one dining”

00:41:04.345 --> 00:41:07.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or as “one serving”?’

00:41:08.482 --> 00:41:11.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, another way that Jehovah uses

00:41:11.318 --> 00:41:13.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to mold our Christian personality

00:41:13.821 --> 00:41:15.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the holy spirit.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how does that work?

00:41:17.892 --> 00:41:22.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you look at Galatians 5:19,

00:41:22.696 --> 00:41:25.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it talks about “the works of the flesh.”

00:41:25.933 --> 00:41:28.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then in verse 22,

00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:31.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it refers to “the fruitage of the spirit”

00:41:31.172 --> 00:41:34.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—“works of the flesh,”
“fruitage of the spirit.”

00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:37.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, work

00:41:37.411 --> 00:41:41.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a result of what one does.

00:41:41.081 --> 00:41:44.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the product of your actions.

00:41:44.952 --> 00:41:49.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so the apostle Paul lists,
as you see there, under “works of the flesh,”

00:41:49.857 --> 00:41:52.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
various results that come

00:41:52.893 --> 00:41:56.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as a result of a conscious effort
on an individual’s part

00:41:56.797 --> 00:42:00.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or possibly because of human imperfection.

00:42:00.701 --> 00:42:05.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, on the other hand, Paul talks
about “the fruitage of the spirit”

00:42:05.039 --> 00:42:09.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—not work, but the fruitage it results in.

00:42:09.243 --> 00:42:11.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is implying

00:42:11.245 --> 00:42:14.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that qualities that are listed there
as fruitage of the spirit

00:42:14.815 --> 00:42:18.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are not the result of some sort
of program we get into

00:42:18.886 --> 00:42:21.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to adjust our character,

00:42:21.255 --> 00:42:25.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it’s the operation of God’s spirit

00:42:25.593 --> 00:42:27.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
upon the individual.

00:42:27.895 --> 00:42:32.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s this tremendous force
and power from Jehovah God

00:42:32.266 --> 00:42:35.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that moves us in certain ways.

00:42:35.002 --> 00:42:39.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be to recognize scripture
or to listen to counsel.

00:42:39.406 --> 00:42:43.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we need to pray for his holy spirit

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:47.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we can develop
those Christian qualities that Paul mentions.

00:42:47.848 --> 00:42:52.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you look at verse 22,
one of those qualities is kindness.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How important is that
for the Christian personality?

00:42:56.824 --> 00:43:00.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when the Great Potter looks at us,

00:43:00.427 --> 00:43:03.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does he see a need for adjustments

00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:07.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the way we display kindness to others?

00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:09.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, are we praying to Jehovah God,

00:43:09.903 --> 00:43:12.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Please, Jehovah, help me develop

00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:14.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this fruitage of the spirit”?

00:43:15.542 --> 00:43:19.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, again, the Bible gives examples

00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:22.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of individuals who had kindness.

00:43:22.883 --> 00:43:25.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the quality in action, so to speak.

00:43:25.886 --> 00:43:29.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in this case, Jehovah God, of course,
is the greatest example.

00:43:29.623 --> 00:43:30.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here it is.

00:43:30.624 --> 00:43:34.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Genesis chapter 3,
it describes in verse 7

00:43:34.261 --> 00:43:38.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that after Adam and Eve ate the fruit,
then they recognized their nakedness.

00:43:38.399 --> 00:43:39.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So what did they do?

00:43:39.533 --> 00:43:42.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They sewed fig leaves together” as clothing.

00:43:42.903 --> 00:43:45.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But, now, in verse 21,

00:43:45.339 --> 00:43:48.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before putting them out of the garden of Eden

00:43:48.676 --> 00:43:51.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the thorns and thistles,
what did Jehovah do?

00:43:51.845 --> 00:43:54.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it says he ‘made long garments

00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:58.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
out of skins to clothe them.’

00:43:58.218 --> 00:44:01.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s the ultimate kindness.

00:44:01.922 --> 00:44:06.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See, we want to allow these examples
to touch us in ways

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:10.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that move us to be kind to others.

00:44:10.731 --> 00:44:13.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, one benefit of kindness is

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that people are drawn to that kind of person.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:20.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 11:17 says this:

00:44:20.307 --> 00:44:24.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A kind man benefits himself.”

00:44:25.279 --> 00:44:30.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s enjoyable being
around a kind person, isn’t it?

00:44:30.017 --> 00:44:33.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A kind person easily finds

00:44:33.454 --> 00:44:36.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keeps good friends.

00:44:36.523 --> 00:44:39.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the <i>Ministry School </i> textbook says

00:44:39.393 --> 00:44:43.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “one who is kind and mild-tempered

00:44:43.897 --> 00:44:48.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is gentle in his way of doing things.”

00:44:49.303 --> 00:44:53.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, under the chapter “Voice Quality,”
here’s what it says:

00:44:53.240 --> 00:44:55.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“People are greatly influenced

00:44:55.976 --> 00:44:59.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“not only by what is said

00:44:59.179 --> 00:45:01.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but also by how it is said.

00:45:01.749 --> 00:45:04.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“If a person speaking to you has a voice

00:45:04.818 --> 00:45:08.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that is pleasant, warm, friendly, and kind,

00:45:08.856 --> 00:45:13.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is it not true that you
are more inclined to listen favorably?”

00:45:13.293 --> 00:45:15.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most certainly it is.

00:45:15.295 --> 00:45:17.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I might say
that the November study edition

00:45:17.898 --> 00:45:20.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of <i>The Watchtower</i>  we just received

00:45:20.601 --> 00:45:23.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has a beautiful article in it entitled

00:45:23.570 --> 00:45:28.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Kindness—A Quality Expressed
in Word and Action.”

00:45:29.543 --> 00:45:33.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when it comes to our Christian personality

00:45:33.714 --> 00:45:38.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—especially involving humility and kindness,
as we’ve talked about today—

00:45:38.452 --> 00:45:42.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may each of us respond
to the molding of Jehovah God.

00:45:42.823 --> 00:45:44.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He uses his Word
—the Bible—

00:45:44.825 --> 00:45:47.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he uses his holy spirit.

00:45:47.828 --> 00:45:51.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we also said
Jehovah uses the congregation.

00:45:51.965 --> 00:45:56.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So may we all be responsive to counsel

00:45:56.003 --> 00:45:58.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we receive either from the platform

00:45:58.639 --> 00:46:01.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or maybe individual counsel

00:46:01.108 --> 00:46:04.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to improve in these areas.

00:46:04.211 --> 00:46:06.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if we respond correctly,

00:46:06.747 --> 00:46:08.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then we can say

00:46:08.982 --> 00:46:12.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded at Isaiah 64:8:

00:46:12.119 --> 00:46:16.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But now, O Jehovah, you are our Father.

00:46:16.256 --> 00:46:21.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We are the clay, and you are our Potter;

00:46:21.161 --> 00:46:24.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are all the work of your hand.”

00:46:25.432 --> 00:46:29.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you sometimes feel
that your best is not good enough?

00:46:29.603 --> 00:46:33.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Brother Herd said earlier, it can happen.

00:46:33.407 --> 00:46:35.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But as our new song reminds us,

00:46:35.709 --> 00:46:37.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we overcome these feelings

00:46:37.744 --> 00:46:40.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by safeguarding our heart and mind.

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:08.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really want to do what’s right,
But there’s a war inside my mind—

00:47:08.876 --> 00:47:16.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Doubting if I measure up,
Wond’ring if I do enough.

00:47:18.285 --> 00:47:27.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I lie awake and pray to you,
Because you told me that’s what I should do.

00:47:27.394 --> 00:47:36.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When anxious thoughts surround me,
Jehovah, Father, you tell me

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:41.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To safeguard my heart
and safeguard my mind,

00:47:41.408 --> 00:47:50.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay focused on good things in life.
I won’t give in to what gets me down.

00:47:50.884 --> 00:47:57.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll safeguard my mind,
and peace will be found.

00:48:05.299 --> 00:48:14.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I really long to do your will,
But I get tired from how I feel,

00:48:14.608 --> 00:48:23.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thinking life is just too tough
And I don’t deserve your love.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:33.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I get up and out the door
And share my hope for the future in store.

00:48:33.093 --> 00:48:41.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I won’t let sadness drown me.
Jehovah, Father, you ground me.

00:48:41.535 --> 00:48:47.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll safeguard my heart
and safeguard my mind,

00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:56.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay focused on good things in life.
I won’t give in to what gets me down.

00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:03.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll safeguard my mind,
and peace will be found.

00:49:05.058 --> 00:49:08.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Peace will be found.

00:49:10.364 --> 00:49:15.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I won’t give up
pushing away

00:49:15.902 --> 00:49:20.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Harmful thoughts
that come through the day.

00:49:20.674 --> 00:49:24.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No need to stress
and no need to doubt—

00:49:24.978 --> 00:49:38.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, I’m glad you gave me a way out.
You gave me a way out.

00:49:38.759 --> 00:49:43.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll safeguard my heart
and safeguard my mind,

00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:53.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stay focused on good things in life.
I won’t give in to what gets me down.

00:49:53.206 --> 00:50:02.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll safeguard my mind,
and peace will be found.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:23.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouraging song for all of us!

00:50:23.203 --> 00:50:26.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although we saw a sister
facing discouraging moments,

00:50:26.873 --> 00:50:28.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it affects everyone

00:50:28.875 --> 00:50:32.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—men, couples, young ones, the elderly.

00:50:32.546 --> 00:50:34.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout our program,

00:50:34.548 --> 00:50:38.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we saw how Jehovah teaches us
through the examples of others.

00:50:38.118 --> 00:50:40.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Philip inspires us

00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have the evangelizing spirit.

00:50:43.323 --> 00:50:47.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We learned how Jehovah helps us
avoid mistakes and disappointments.

00:50:48.462 --> 00:50:51.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we saw how Jehovah
used brothers and sisters

00:50:51.698 --> 00:50:55.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help Eugene and Odile
through very difficult times.

00:50:55.869 --> 00:50:57.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And our music video

00:50:57.337 --> 00:51:00.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reminds us
that safeguarding our mind and heart

00:51:00.607 --> 00:51:03.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helps us focus on Jehovah’s blessings.

00:51:05.412 --> 00:51:09.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we say goodbye,
let’s enjoy our video postcard,

00:51:09.750 --> 00:51:12.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which comes to us
from our brothers and sisters

00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:14.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Republic of Lithuania.

00:51:14.955 --> 00:51:18.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Lithuania is a small country

00:51:18.024 --> 00:51:20.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the eastern edge of the Baltic Sea.

00:51:20.727 --> 00:51:25.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The land features
a beautiful coastline, forests, rivers,

00:51:25.265 --> 00:51:27.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thousands of lakes.

00:51:27.934 --> 00:51:30.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Castles dot the scenery.

00:51:30.804 --> 00:51:34.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For centuries,
the Baltic Sea has washed ashore

00:51:34.341 --> 00:51:37.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pieces of fossilized tree resin
known as amber.

00:51:37.744 --> 00:51:40.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to this day,
Lithuanian craftsmen

00:51:40.247 --> 00:51:42.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
form it into jewelry.

00:51:42.716 --> 00:51:46.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Nearly 3,000 publishers
are sharing the good news here.

00:51:47.687 --> 00:51:52.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They conduct
more than 1,800 Bible studies every month.

00:51:52.025 --> 00:51:56.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers participate
in many forms of the ministry.

00:51:56.062 --> 00:52:00.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They enjoy the door-to-door work
in cities and villages.

00:52:01.334 --> 00:52:03.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they’re active in public witnessing
throughout the country.

00:52:05.105 --> 00:52:08.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Klaipėda is home to Lithuania’s largest port.

00:52:08.942 --> 00:52:11.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cruise ships
bring tourists from many countries.

00:52:12.612 --> 00:52:15.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the center of the city,
our brothers have set up a kiosk,

00:52:15.949 --> 00:52:19.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where people can take literature
in multiple languages

00:52:19.119 --> 00:52:22.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch videos on jw.org.

00:52:23.123 --> 00:52:25.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Informal witnessing is also effective

00:52:25.659 --> 00:52:28.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in reaching people
on the shore of the Baltic Sea,

00:52:28.662 --> 00:52:31.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the resort town of Birštonas,

00:52:31.164 --> 00:52:33.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in the city of Kaunas.

00:52:34.734 --> 00:52:36.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Curonian Spit

00:52:36.169 --> 00:52:40.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is a lush 100-kilometer,
or 60-mile, strip of land

00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:44.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that rests between the Baltic Sea
and the Curonian Lagoon.

00:52:45.178 --> 00:52:47.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a popular tourist destination,

00:52:47.881 --> 00:52:51.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Jehovah’s Witnesses
are there to greet them.

00:52:51.885 --> 00:52:54.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers enjoy getting together

00:52:54.254 --> 00:52:57.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for encouraging association.

00:52:57.023 --> 00:52:59.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They watch JW Broadcasting programs

00:52:59.526 --> 00:53:02.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enjoy hospitality.

00:53:02.195 --> 00:53:05.498 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Favorite Lithuanian dishes include shashlik

00:53:05.498 --> 00:53:07.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—skewered, grilled meat—

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and cold borscht soup,

00:53:09.502 --> 00:53:12.239 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which is made of beets and sour cream,

00:53:12.239 --> 00:53:14.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
served with hot potatoes.

00:53:15.108 --> 00:53:17.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our brothers and sisters in Lithuania

00:53:17.110 --> 00:53:20.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
send their warm love and greetings.

00:53:21.715 --> 00:53:23.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Chris.

00:53:23.049 --> 00:53:25.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was an encouraging program.

00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:31.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We want you to know
we love you brothers very much.

From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:53:34.294 --> 00:53:36.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
