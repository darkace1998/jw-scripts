00:02.185 --> 00:05.922
Hello, and welcome to this month’s broadcast! 


00:05.922 --> 00:10.194
With me I have a good friend 
as my cohost, Leon Weaver. 


00:10.193 --> 00:13.295
Leon, what do we have 
to look forward to this time?


00:13.295 --> 00:15.032
Thanks, Brother Lösch. 


00:15.032 --> 00:17.567
We’ll see a young brother who must choose 


00:17.567 --> 00:19.569
between his loyalty to Jehovah 


00:19.568 --> 00:21.570
or to a close friend. 


00:21.570 --> 00:24.000
Which will he choose? 


00:25.775 --> 00:27.977
Then we’ll hear the story of Rafika Morris, 


00:27.977 --> 00:32.382
a young woman 
who desperately fought for racial equality 


00:32.382 --> 00:36.000
but eventually discovers 
the real path to peace. 


00:38.655 --> 00:40.757
And we’ll also enjoy a new music video 


00:40.757 --> 00:43.594
that beautifully highlights the importance 


00:43.593 --> 00:47.363
of putting our confidence in Jehovah. 


00:47.363 --> 00:49.965
We have much to look forward to 


00:49.965 --> 00:52.502
in this March 2018 edition 


00:52.502 --> 00:55.000
of JW Broadcasting! 


01:13.857 --> 01:16.059
The theme for this month is


01:16.058 --> 01:18.060
“In Whom Do You Trust?” 


01:18.060 --> 01:20.197
Do you trust me? 


01:20.197 --> 01:21.430
I hope so. 


01:21.430 --> 01:23.433
All of us want to be trusted. 


01:23.433 --> 01:27.670
Trust is a basic element of everyday life. 


01:27.670 --> 01:30.740
To trust others is a normal reaction. 


01:30.740 --> 01:34.243
Many of us have traveled on a train or a bus. 


01:34.243 --> 01:37.113
Did we worry whether 
the conductor or driver 


01:37.113 --> 01:39.715
would bring us safely to our destination? 


01:39.715 --> 01:42.285
Normally, we do not worry. 


01:42.285 --> 01:47.623
We trust an airplane captain 
to take us safely to our destination. 


01:47.623 --> 01:49.825
We trust that when we enter an elevator, 


01:49.825 --> 01:52.595
it will not crash at the bottom of the shaft,


01:52.595 --> 01:56.365
but safely take us to the desired floor. 


01:56.365 --> 02:00.903
When we marry, we trust that 
our partner will remain faithful. 


02:00.903 --> 02:05.073
In many situations in life we need trust. 


02:05.073 --> 02:06.775
What is trust? 


02:06.775 --> 02:10.447
Trust is the “firm belief in the reliability,


02:10.447 --> 02:14.000
truth, or ability of someone or something.” 


02:15.083 --> 02:18.521
Webster’s dictionary says 
that it is “confidence”; 


02:18.522 --> 02:22.559
a “reliance [or] resting 
of the mind on the integrity, 


02:22.558 --> 02:25.561
“veracity, justice, friendship, 


02:25.562 --> 02:29.965
or other sound principle, of another person.” 


02:29.965 --> 02:32.502
Trust is related to confidence, 


02:32.502 --> 02:36.805
belief, faith, and assurance. 


02:36.805 --> 02:41.743
Experiments conducted 
by Professor Dr. Michael Kosfeld,


02:41.743 --> 02:45.315
a professor at a university 
in Frankfurt, Germany,


02:45.315 --> 02:47.817
led him to the conclusion that trust 


02:47.817 --> 02:52.000
is “a biologically-based part 
of human nature.” 


02:53.388 --> 02:58.393
Kosfeld discovered that when 
there is interaction between two people, 


02:58.393 --> 03:03.765
the human brain releases 
a hormone that stimulates trust. 


03:03.765 --> 03:06.668
“It is, in fact, 
one of the distinguishing features 


03:06.668 --> 03:11.181
of the human species,” Kosfeld states.


03:11.182 --> 03:16.045
In everyday life, how discouraged 
some are if they are not trusted. 


03:16.045 --> 03:18.982
The phrase “Don’t you trust me?”


03:18.982 --> 03:23.000
is frequently heard with an undertone
of sadness or complaint. 


03:24.720 --> 03:27.857
Sometimes children or teenagers
ask their parents


03:27.857 --> 03:32.229
“Don’t you trust me?” when the parents
place some restrictions on them,


03:32.228 --> 03:35.565
perhaps in connection
with leisure-time activities. 


03:35.565 --> 03:39.035
Parents do that because they
love you young ones


03:39.035 --> 03:44.073
and want to prevent any spiritual
or physical harm befalling you. 


03:44.073 --> 03:47.643
If you cooperate, you will see that parents 


03:47.643 --> 03:50.078
will gradually trust you ever more


03:50.078 --> 03:53.983
and grant more liberty to you. 


03:53.983 --> 03:57.000
You can prove to them
that you are trustworthy.


03:58.220 --> 04:01.023
In the world, 
many people are not trustworthy. 


04:01.023 --> 04:03.926
Since we are living in the time of the end


04:03.927 --> 04:08.164
and the demons are desperate 
and have influenced many people,


04:08.163 --> 04:13.501
we have to admit that
trusting in everybody is not wise. 


04:13.502 --> 04:17.140
Many trusted in religion
and were disappointed. 


04:17.140 --> 04:20.810
Others trusted in governments
or the United Nations,


04:20.810 --> 04:22.812
but they were disappointed. 


04:22.812 --> 04:26.382
They trusted political leaders
that made all kinds of promises


04:26.382 --> 04:28.619
but did not keep all of them. 


04:28.618 --> 04:32.000
Some politicians were
even exposed as being liars. 


04:33.890 --> 04:36.325
Proverbs 14:15 says: 


04:36.325 --> 04:39.162
“The naive person believes every word,


04:39.162 --> 04:43.734
but the shrewd one ponders each step.” 


04:43.733 --> 04:48.503
If somebody, even in the truth,
promises us big monetary returns


04:48.503 --> 04:51.306
if we give him money
for his planned investment,


04:51.307 --> 04:55.779
we need to be careful
and not believe every word. 


04:55.778 --> 04:59.315
Some that spent their money
were in for a disappointment 


04:59.315 --> 05:02.000
when they learned that everything was lost. 


05:03.485 --> 05:06.022
We also should not trust everything we read


05:06.022 --> 05:09.000
in newspapers or see on television.


05:10.493 --> 05:14.430
There is another thing
we should not trust in—riches. 


05:14.430 --> 05:19.168
Psalm 49:6 speaks
about “those who are trusting in their wealth 


05:19.168 --> 05:23.438
and who boast about their great riches.” 


05:23.438 --> 05:27.410
Trusting in riches
often leads to disappointment. 


05:27.410 --> 05:30.513
“The one trusting in his riches will fall,” 


05:30.513 --> 05:33.000
says Proverbs 11:28. 


05:34.317 --> 05:39.289
It is not wrong to be rich; 
just do not trust in riches. 


05:39.288 --> 05:42.000
Riches are a risk factor. 


05:43.158 --> 05:46.161
Many people today are dishonest and cheat. 


05:46.162 --> 05:48.464
Some business owners have installed


05:48.463 --> 05:50.600
cameras at the workplace,


05:50.600 --> 05:55.303
since they do not trust their employees
to put in a full day of work. 


05:55.303 --> 05:59.000
They know that some would play
video games during work hours.


06:00.410 --> 06:05.113
But Jehovah created us
with the inclination to trust. 


06:05.113 --> 06:08.650
We can especially trust
our spiritual brothers. 


06:08.650 --> 06:12.522
True, once in a while
such trust is misplaced. 


06:12.522 --> 06:16.792
A few commit serious sins
and have to be disfellowshipped. 


06:16.792 --> 06:19.929
But that is rare. 


06:19.928 --> 06:23.000
Jehovah himself is
the best example of trusting in others. 


06:24.767 --> 06:27.804
He trusted the Logos to faithfully cooperate


06:27.803 --> 06:32.006
with him as the “master worker”
in creating the universe, 


06:32.007 --> 06:37.380
the earth, and all the living things
on earth, including mankind. 


06:37.380 --> 06:43.385
What tremendous trust Jehovah showed
in Jesus when He sent him to the earth. 


06:43.385 --> 06:46.222
Jehovah trusted that
Jesus would remain faithful


06:46.222 --> 06:51.060
and redeem mankind 
so that His will and purpose with mankind


06:51.060 --> 06:53.662
and the earth could be accomplished. 


06:53.662 --> 06:58.100
Jehovah trusted him so much
that he arranged for prophecies


06:58.100 --> 07:02.838
to be written that foretold
that he would die faithfully. 


07:02.838 --> 07:06.808
This trust on the part of Jehovah
was not a risk. 


07:06.808 --> 07:12.000
It was based on the collaboration
between the two for aeons of time. 


07:13.315 --> 07:16.618
Think of the prophecy at Psalm 16:10: 


07:16.618 --> 07:20.000
“For you will not leave me in the Grave.”


07:21.390 --> 07:23.392
Jesus had free will. 


07:23.392 --> 07:26.829
This means that theoretically 
he could have sinned. 


07:26.828 --> 07:29.098
If he could not have sinned, 


07:29.098 --> 07:34.000
Satan probably would not have tried
three times to tempt Jesus to sin. 


07:35.137 --> 07:37.174
If Jesus could not have sinned, 


07:37.173 --> 07:39.275
why would he be so heavily distressed


07:39.275 --> 07:43.612
in the garden of Gethsemane
that he was sweating blood? 


07:43.612 --> 07:46.815
Why send an angel
to comfort and strengthen him 


07:46.815 --> 07:49.000
if he could not sin or fail anyway? 


07:51.320 --> 07:55.858
No question that Jesus
felt the unfathomable load


07:55.858 --> 07:59.061
on his shoulders to remain faithful, 


07:59.062 --> 08:03.132
since not only the salvation
of mankind depended on him


08:03.132 --> 08:07.270
but also the vindication
of Jehovah’s sovereignty. 


08:07.270 --> 08:10.172
He did not want to disappoint Jehovah. 


08:10.172 --> 08:13.209
Jesus used his own free will


08:13.208 --> 08:16.445
and was determined to stay loyal. 


08:16.445 --> 08:20.950
How glad we are that he did!


08:20.950 --> 08:25.087
On the other hand, 
Jesus also trusted Jehovah completely. 


08:25.087 --> 08:30.000
He trusted Jehovah that he would
resurrect him if he would die faithfully. 


08:31.193 --> 08:35.463
Actually, Jesus was publicly known
to trust in Jehovah. 


08:35.463 --> 08:40.435
People that passed by when he was
on the torture stake were saying:


08:40.435 --> 08:43.138
“He has put his trust in God;


08:43.138 --> 08:46.875
“let Him now rescue him if He wants him, 


08:46.875 --> 08:49.278
for he said, ‘I am God’s Son.’”


08:49.278 --> 08:52.448
Another example of trust was Abraham. 


08:52.448 --> 08:55.918
When God told him
to kill his beloved son Isaac, 


08:55.918 --> 08:58.386
Abraham was willing to do so. 


08:58.387 --> 09:02.000
He trusted that Jehovah could resurrect him. 


09:03.092 --> 09:05.360
Hebrews 11:19 says: 


09:05.360 --> 09:10.132
“He reasoned that God was able to raise
him up even from the dead, 


09:10.132 --> 09:14.737
and he did receive him from there
in an illustrative way.”


09:14.737 --> 09:17.674
First Corinthians 13:7 says that


09:17.673 --> 09:21.676
love “believes all things.” 


09:21.677 --> 09:24.980
Love trusts that prophecies will come true. 


09:24.980 --> 09:27.000
It also believes what our brothers tell us. 


09:28.952 --> 09:31.854
It also helps to grant others
the benefit of the doubt


09:31.853 --> 09:35.000
if a matter could be interpreted
in different ways. 


09:36.258 --> 09:40.461
Yes, trusting others
is an expression of love. 


09:40.462 --> 09:45.000
If you love somebody, you only assume
and think the best of him.


09:46.568 --> 09:50.538
Another example of trust
in Jehovah was Moses. 


09:50.538 --> 09:55.010
He led the nation of Israel
out of Egypt into the desert


09:55.010 --> 09:58.613
—a nation upwards of three million people. 


09:58.613 --> 10:02.000
And they had flocks
of cattle and sheep with them. 


10:03.018 --> 10:06.021
When he left Egypt, 
did he know how to provide


10:06.022 --> 10:09.092
these great crowds with water in the desert? 


10:09.092 --> 10:11.527
Did he know what they would be eating


10:11.527 --> 10:15.000
after the initial foodstuffs
that they took out of Egypt ran out? 


10:16.498 --> 10:21.936
Did he know in advance that Jehovah 
would miraculously provide the manna? 


10:21.937 --> 10:23.974
It doesn’t seem so. 


10:23.973 --> 10:28.000
But he trusted that Jehovah 
would take care of the people.


10:30.045 --> 10:34.183
The three friends of Daniel
were another fine example of trust. 


10:34.183 --> 10:37.853
They did not bow and worship
in front of an idol


10:37.853 --> 10:40.000
that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 


10:41.223 --> 10:47.228
They were told they would be thrown
into a fiery furnace if they disobeyed. 


10:47.228 --> 10:51.633
They remained firm
and were protected by an angel, 


10:51.633 --> 10:54.703
so that the fire did not do any harm to them. 


10:54.703 --> 10:56.371
After that


10:56.372 --> 10:59.042
“Nebuchadnezzar then declared: 


10:59.042 --> 11:03.512
“‘Praised be the God of Shadrach, 
Meshach, and Abednego, 


11:03.512 --> 11:06.815
“‘who sent his angel
and rescued his servants. 


11:06.815 --> 11:11.053
“‘They trusted in him and went against
the command of the king


11:11.053 --> 11:13.288
“‘and were willing to die rather than serve


11:13.288 --> 11:17.626
or worship any god except their own God.’”


11:17.627 --> 11:21.130
As we are getting ever closer
to the great tribulation, 


11:21.130 --> 11:24.267
we might be confronted with scary challenges


11:24.267 --> 11:27.670
and tests related to nationalism. 


11:27.670 --> 11:30.438
Will we keep trusting Jehovah? 


11:30.438 --> 11:32.475
We trust we will. 


11:32.475 --> 11:37.212
Jehovah will miraculously save his 
people throughout the great tribulation 


11:37.212 --> 11:40.950
and arrange for their survival.


11:40.950 --> 11:45.955
Today, the faithful slave is put in charge
of providing spiritual food for God’s people, 


11:45.955 --> 11:48.000
who number into the millions. 


11:49.058 --> 11:52.495
The slave also shows
complete trust in Jehovah


11:52.495 --> 11:55.000
that he will guide them with his holy spirit. 


11:56.465 --> 11:59.702
What makes it possible 
for the “faithful and discreet slave” 


11:59.702 --> 12:02.000
to provide precious spiritual food? 


12:03.672 --> 12:08.477
“I will give you insight and instruct you
in the way you should go,” 


12:08.477 --> 12:12.000
says Jehovah at Psalm 32:8. 


12:13.482 --> 12:17.820
Today, Jehovah provides direction
to the slave through Jesus. 


12:17.820 --> 12:21.257
Jesus, in turn, 
provides direction for his people


12:21.257 --> 12:24.160
through “the faithful and discreet slave.” 


12:24.160 --> 12:27.763
We can therefore have full confidence


12:27.763 --> 12:32.000
in the Scriptural insight, 
understanding, and guidance.


12:33.835 --> 12:36.438
Satan tries to sow mistrust. 


12:36.438 --> 12:39.275
Under Communist dictatorship in Romania,


12:39.275 --> 12:42.478
secret police officers
forced a responsible brother


12:42.478 --> 12:45.613
to walk with them
on a heavily frequented street


12:45.613 --> 12:48.250
hoping that other brothers would see this 


12:48.250 --> 12:52.000
and wrongly conclude that this brother
works with the secret police. 


12:53.222 --> 12:55.224
Did the scheme work out? 


12:55.223 --> 12:57.526
No, it failed. 


12:57.527 --> 13:01.830
Brothers did see him but kept trusting him. 


13:01.830 --> 13:06.000
We learn that we should not quickly
lose trust in our brothers. 


13:08.170 --> 13:12.975
Satan also has the scheme 
to spread rumors about faithful brothers,


13:12.975 --> 13:15.000
including the faithful slave. 


13:16.245 --> 13:19.448
The method of spreading rumors is not new. 


13:19.448 --> 13:22.785
When Jesus was resurrected
and the tomb was empty, 


13:22.785 --> 13:26.288
the soldiers who reported it 
were told to spread the rumor


13:26.288 --> 13:30.893
that the disciples came 
and stole the body at night. 


13:30.893 --> 13:34.000
Matthew 28:15 relates:


13:35.630 --> 13:39.935
“So they took the silver pieces
and did as they were instructed, 


13:39.935 --> 13:45.875
and this story has been spread abroad
among the Jews up to this very day.” 


13:45.875 --> 13:48.743
Another rumor in the first century
was that Christians


13:48.743 --> 13:52.046
were responsible for the great fire of Rome. 


13:52.047 --> 13:55.584
Could such an accusation be true? 


13:55.583 --> 13:58.686
Historians say that it was Nero, 


13:58.687 --> 14:02.000
the emperor, who set fire to the city.


14:03.425 --> 14:08.430
Today, rumors are occasionally being spread
in electronic form about the faithful slave. 


14:08.430 --> 14:11.967
This has caused some concern
on the part of some brothers,


14:11.967 --> 14:16.172
especially when the reports
are commenting on court cases


14:16.172 --> 14:19.000
where some in the organization were accused. 


14:20.142 --> 14:25.080
Sometimes reference is made to certain quotes
and then readers think, 


14:25.080 --> 14:27.550
‘How can a quote be a rumor?’ 


14:27.550 --> 14:31.053
A quote can be taken out of context. 


14:31.053 --> 14:35.390
Critical reports often 
give only part of a matter


14:35.390 --> 14:38.427
and leave out other aspects. 


14:38.427 --> 14:42.000
Often, such rumors play on the emotions. 


14:43.665 --> 14:47.670
Ask yourself: ‘Am I prone to believe rumors? 


14:47.670 --> 14:51.307
‘And even if I am, should I spread it


14:51.307 --> 14:54.344
‘and undermine the trust
that others have in the slave 


14:54.343 --> 14:59.848
or in representatives of the branch office?’ 


14:59.848 --> 15:03.085
Avoid sensationalism 
by not saying something like


15:03.085 --> 15:06.922
“Can you believe what I heard
about this matter or that matter


15:06.922 --> 15:11.327
or this person or that person?” 
referring to a statement 


15:11.327 --> 15:16.332
that may have appeared
on Facebook, YouTube, or Twitter. 


15:16.332 --> 15:21.337
The spread of rumors is like wildfire
that is hard to control. 


15:21.337 --> 15:26.909
It spreads distrust
and can undermine someone’s faith. 


15:26.908 --> 15:31.513
This is not to say that the slave is perfect
and never makes mistakes. 


15:31.513 --> 15:35.350
But Jehovah and Jesus
trust the imperfect slave 


15:35.350 --> 15:38.187
who cares for things
to the best of his ability


15:38.187 --> 15:40.622
and with the best of motives. 


15:40.622 --> 15:45.000
Shouldn’t we then trust
the imperfect slave as well?


15:46.862 --> 15:51.867
To appreciate the extent of Jehovah
and Jesus’ trust in the faithful slave,


15:51.867 --> 15:55.604
reflect on what he has promised its members. 


15:55.603 --> 16:00.000
He has promised them
immortality and incorruption. 


16:01.177 --> 16:03.579
Soon, just before Armageddon,


16:03.578 --> 16:07.850
the remaining members of the slave
will be taken to heaven. 


16:07.850 --> 16:10.318
Since 1919 of our Common Era,


16:10.318 --> 16:14.956
the slave has been put in charge
of some belongings of Christ. 


16:14.957 --> 16:18.360
According to Matthew 24:47, 


16:18.360 --> 16:23.298
when the anointed are taken to heaven,
Jesus will at that point entrust


16:23.298 --> 16:26.000
“all his belongings” to them. 


16:27.168 --> 16:31.000
Does this not reveal immense trust? 


16:32.407 --> 16:36.812
Revelation 4:4 describes 
these resurrected anointed


16:36.812 --> 16:39.415
as corulers with Christ. 


16:39.415 --> 16:43.418
Revelation 22:5 says they will rule,


16:43.418 --> 16:45.653
not only for a thousand years


16:45.653 --> 16:49.000
but “forever and ever.” 


16:50.125 --> 16:54.000
What immense trust 
Jesus shows toward them! 


16:55.630 --> 16:58.000
Since Jehovah God and Jesus Christ


16:58.000 --> 17:01.470
completely trust
“the faithful and discreet slave,” 


17:01.470 --> 17:04.000
should we not do the same?


17:06.242 --> 17:09.779
Many servants of Jehovah in the past 
showed trust in Jehovah


17:09.778 --> 17:13.581
when confronted with obstacles or opposition. 


17:13.582 --> 17:18.587
We can trust that Jehovah will not let us
be tested beyond what we can bear


17:18.587 --> 17:21.124
but will provide a “way out” 


17:21.123 --> 17:25.626
so we can remain faithful under trials. 


17:25.627 --> 17:28.797
So whom do you trust? 


17:28.797 --> 17:34.604
You fully trust in Jehovah, 
Jesus, and the faithful slave. 


17:34.603 --> 17:39.000
To a reasonable degree, you also trust all
your fellow brothers and sisters.


17:40.308 --> 17:45.313
The writer of Psalm 119:42
mentioned something else we need to trust in


17:45.313 --> 17:47.315
—God’s Word. 


17:47.315 --> 17:49.350
He wrote: 


17:49.350 --> 17:53.355
“For I put my trust in your word.” 


17:53.355 --> 17:58.360
The prophecies in God’s Word
have always come true at the proper time. 


17:58.360 --> 18:02.932
Based on that, we can fully trust that
the remaining prophecies


18:02.932 --> 18:06.402
pointing to the survival
of the great tribulation


18:06.402 --> 18:11.307
and to the Paradise to follow
will also come true, 


18:11.307 --> 18:14.000
without the slightest possibility of failure.


18:15.943 --> 18:19.146
Of course, we should trust
not only Jehovah, Jesus,


18:19.147 --> 18:24.152
the faithful slave, and the Bible 
but also our fellow brothers. 


18:24.152 --> 18:27.255
The apostle Paul is a fine example of this. 


18:27.255 --> 18:30.758
He wrote to Philemon 


18:30.758 --> 18:33.061
asking him to kindly receive back 


18:33.062 --> 18:38.067
the runaway slave Onesimus
who had become a brother. 


18:38.067 --> 18:42.237
Paul wrote at Philemon 21: 


18:42.237 --> 18:45.207
“I am confident that you will comply,


18:45.207 --> 18:50.379
so I am writing you, knowing that you
will do even more than what I say.”


18:50.378 --> 18:52.446
When we speak of trust, 


18:52.447 --> 18:55.117
we sometimes think of a little child


18:55.117 --> 18:58.000
walking hand in hand with his father. 


18:59.622 --> 19:03.292
The child does not question
where the father will take him. 


19:03.292 --> 19:05.994
The child trusts the father. 


19:05.993 --> 19:08.096
All throughout the last days, 


19:08.097 --> 19:13.102
true Christians have faced hostility 
of so many in the world. 


19:13.102 --> 19:15.837
How strengthening Jehovah’s promise is


19:15.837 --> 19:19.642
in view of the impending attack
by Satan’s hordes! 


19:19.642 --> 19:24.547
When they attack, Jehovah’s people
will seem as defenseless. 


19:24.547 --> 19:27.049
But we do not need to quake with fear. 


19:27.048 --> 19:30.318
We trust that Jehovah, Jesus, and the angels


19:30.318 --> 19:33.988
will fight to deliver us. 


19:33.988 --> 19:37.058
We will not shrink back in fear. 


19:37.058 --> 19:39.928
At Hebrews 10:39, Paul wrote:


19:39.928 --> 19:43.265
“Now we are not the sort 
who shrink back to destruction,


19:43.265 --> 19:47.870
but the sort who have faith
for the preserving of our lives.” 


19:47.870 --> 19:50.638
Today and after Armageddon, all can say,


19:50.638 --> 19:54.943
according to Psalm 26:1 and 52:8: 


19:54.943 --> 19:58.213
“I have trusted [in Jehovah]
without wavering.” 


19:58.213 --> 20:04.051
“My trust is in God’s loyal love,
forever and ever.” 


20:04.052 --> 20:09.057
Therefore, keep trusting in Jehovah 
and those who are proving loyal to him.


20:09.057 --> 20:11.960
Back to you, Leon.


20:11.960 --> 20:14.128
Thank you, Brother Lösch. 


20:14.128 --> 20:15.363
In line with that, 


20:15.363 --> 20:16.365
we all want 


20:16.365 --> 20:17.365
good friends 


20:17.365 --> 20:19.133
we can trust


20:19.133 --> 20:20.801
—the type 


20:20.802 --> 20:24.005
mentioned at Proverbs 18:24, 
where it says: 


20:24.005 --> 20:28.643
“There is a friend 
who sticks closer than a brother.” 


20:28.643 --> 20:32.480
But at times, 
we may find that a close friend 


20:32.480 --> 20:34.650
needs spiritual help. 


20:34.650 --> 20:39.187
Do we fear losing 
that friendship if we speak up? 


20:39.187 --> 20:42.324
What does Jehovah want us to do? 


20:42.323 --> 20:45.026
In the following dramatization, 


20:45.027 --> 20:51.000
the young man Danny 
faces these same questions. 


21:04.412 --> 21:07.415
I had a secret. 


21:07.415 --> 21:11.000
Only it wasn’t mine to tell. 


21:12.320 --> 21:15.000
It was my best friend’s, Julian.


21:28.203 --> 21:32.000
This was not the Julian I knew.


21:46.322 --> 21:48.524
At the end of the meeting, 


21:48.523 --> 21:51.000
Brother Max wanted to know 
if I was OK. 


21:52.727 --> 21:54.730
I shrugged it off. 


21:54.730 --> 21:58.000
I just didn’t know 
who to talk to at that point.


22:06.375 --> 22:09.745
A few years ago, 


22:09.745 --> 22:14.000
when my parents 
stopped attending meetings, 


22:21.188 --> 22:24.000
Julian was there for me. 


22:44.980 --> 22:47.000
I didn’t want to lose my friend. 


22:49.918 --> 22:52.000
But did I really know him?


23:06.968 --> 23:10.000
I decided to ask Julian 
about the pictures he posted.


23:13.708 --> 23:15.876
I told him it wasn’t right. 


23:15.877 --> 23:19.414
He needed to talk to the elders. 


23:19.413 --> 23:23.000
Then he got really defensive about it. 


23:27.622 --> 23:30.000
I knew I did the right thing. 


23:31.693 --> 23:33.060
When was I supposed 
to take care of this bill? 


23:33.060 --> 23:34.062
I’ve been telling you 
for the past month! 


23:34.062 --> 23:36.832
I just needed someone to talk to. 


23:36.832 --> 23:37.999
When did you tell me? 


23:37.998 --> 23:39.500
I’ve been working 
for the past couple of weeks. 


23:39.500 --> 23:41.503
Well, as if I don’t work? 


23:41.503 --> 23:44.000
Oh! Now you’re going 
to blame everything on me. 


23:52.447 --> 23:56.819
Brother Max wanted to know 
how I was really doing. 


23:56.818 --> 23:59.888
He could tell something was wrong. 


23:59.888 --> 24:03.000
So I opened up. 


24:13.033 --> 24:15.103
I told him everything. 


24:15.103 --> 24:17.138
I didn’t want to get my friend in trouble. 


24:17.138 --> 24:20.708
Max understood. 


24:20.708 --> 24:25.000
He asked me to read James 5:14, 15: 


24:28.817 --> 24:32.320
“Is there anyone sick among you? 


24:32.320 --> 24:36.457
“Let him call 
the elders of the congregation to him, 


24:36.457 --> 24:39.294
“and let them pray over him, 


24:39.293 --> 24:44.031
“applying oil to him 
in the name of Jehovah. 


24:44.032 --> 24:46.602
“And the prayer of faith 


24:46.602 --> 24:49.270
“will make the sick one well, 


24:49.270 --> 24:53.000
and Jehovah will raise him up.”


24:56.243 --> 24:59.881
Max showed me that the elders 
can encourage and strengthen 


24:59.882 --> 25:03.185
a spiritually weak person. 


25:03.185 --> 25:05.253
Covering up a friend’s wrongdoing 


25:05.253 --> 25:09.000
prevents him from getting 
the spiritual help he needs. 


25:10.758 --> 25:15.663
All this time, 
I was focused on Julian and his deception, 


25:15.663 --> 25:19.000
and I didn’t speak up. 


25:20.435 --> 25:23.000
I’m glad I was honest with Brother Max. 


25:24.238 --> 25:27.508
The elders are like our spiritual doctors, 


25:27.508 --> 25:30.511
and even more, they’re our friends. 


25:30.512 --> 25:32.847
They want to help us. 


25:32.847 --> 25:35.684
Julian might receive discipline, 


25:35.683 --> 25:38.185
but that’s an expression of Jehovah’s love. 


25:38.185 --> 25:41.000
It could save his spiritual life. 


25:46.527 --> 25:50.000
Julian got the spiritual help he needed. 


25:59.073 --> 26:03.000
And I kept my best friend. 


26:14.322 --> 26:17.159
Did you notice how our young brother 


26:17.158 --> 26:21.730
put trust in the Bible and acted accordingly? 


26:21.730 --> 26:25.633
How can we do the same? 


26:25.633 --> 26:30.671
Brother Ron Curzan’s morning worship 
comments share some thoughts 


26:30.672 --> 26:35.244
on specific ways we can continue 
to make spiritual adjustments 


26:35.243 --> 26:40.715
as we encounter 
a variety of life’s challenges.


26:40.715 --> 26:42.450
These were very practical comments. 


26:42.450 --> 26:43.985
And they all tie in well 


26:43.985 --> 26:46.722
with what the apostle Paul was trying to tell 


26:46.722 --> 26:49.757
those in the Ephesian congregation 


26:49.757 --> 26:51.827
about examining themselves. 


26:51.827 --> 26:53.829
The same way we have to do today 


26:53.828 --> 26:56.631
—examining ourselves 
so that we please Jehovah. 


26:56.632 --> 26:59.700
If you’d like, 
please open up to Ephesians chapter 5, 


26:59.700 --> 27:03.000
and we’ll read verse 10, 
which is our theme scripture. 


27:04.405 --> 27:08.275
Ephesians 5:10, it says: 


27:08.275 --> 27:11.680
“Keep on making sure 
of what is acceptable to the Lord.” 


27:11.680 --> 27:13.682
And then it goes on in verse 11: 


27:13.682 --> 27:18.687
“And stop sharing in the unfruitful works 
that belong to the darkness; 


27:18.687 --> 27:23.492
rather, expose them for what they are.” 


27:23.492 --> 27:28.497
So it’s very clear to us, 
in this chapter of Ephesians chapter 5, 


27:28.497 --> 27:32.067
that there are things 
that Jehovah views as acceptable 


27:32.067 --> 27:35.104
and things he views as unacceptable. 


27:35.103 --> 27:38.105
Jehovah’s standard of what is unacceptable 


27:38.105 --> 27:41.642
is outlined in quite a few 
of the verses in chapter 5 here. 


27:41.642 --> 27:46.480
If you would just scan 
through verses 3, 4, and 5, 


27:46.480 --> 27:49.583
we’ll see that unwholesome talk about sex, 


27:49.583 --> 27:52.953
shameful conduct, obscene jesting 


27:52.953 --> 27:55.790
—and then verse 18, drunkenness—


27:55.790 --> 28:00.595
well, these are things 
that will bar us from God’s Kingdom. 


28:00.595 --> 28:02.697
When you think 
about entertainment today, 


28:02.697 --> 28:05.200
it’s nearly impossible 
to try to find something 


28:05.200 --> 28:07.502
that is acceptable to Jehovah 


28:07.502 --> 28:10.739
that does not have 
immoral sex, pornography, 


28:10.738 --> 28:13.173
spiritism, and violence. 


28:13.173 --> 28:17.411
Satan has thoroughly saturated 
all forms of the media. 


28:17.412 --> 28:19.780
So thoroughly, 
that it’s in our literature, 


28:19.780 --> 28:22.117
it’s in movies, 
it’s in electronic games, 


28:22.117 --> 28:26.287
and everything that we 
can think of Satan has infiltrated. 


28:26.287 --> 28:29.857
Yes, he knows that Jehovah 
hates these things, 


28:29.857 --> 28:33.995
and he doesn’t mind if part of our heart 
hates these things 


28:33.995 --> 28:37.665
as long as part of our heart 
loves these things. 


28:37.665 --> 28:39.967
So we do well to ask ourselves: 


28:39.967 --> 28:43.705
‘Does the entertainment that I choose help me 


28:43.705 --> 28:46.540
‘in my being acceptable to Jehovah? 


28:46.540 --> 28:49.743
‘Does it help me to have the qualities 


28:49.743 --> 28:51.846
‘that Jehovah endears in me, 


28:51.847 --> 28:54.049
and will he draw closer to me?’


28:54.048 --> 28:58.185
Well, the spirit of the world 
reflects rebellion of the Bible, 


28:58.185 --> 29:02.257
which outlines 
Jehovah’s qualities and his standards. 


29:02.257 --> 29:04.725
We want to show respect for the Bible, 


29:04.725 --> 29:07.928
which teaches us 
to love what Jehovah loves 


29:07.928 --> 29:10.765
and hate what he hates. 


29:10.765 --> 29:14.868
And what will help us to do this 
and resist the spirit of the world 


29:14.868 --> 29:17.971
and draw closer to Jehovah 
and be acceptable to him? 


29:17.972 --> 29:19.974
Let’s notice verse 17, 


29:19.973 --> 29:24.178
chapter 5 and verse 17, it says: 


29:24.178 --> 29:26.646
“On this account stop being unreasonable, 


29:26.647 --> 29:31.619
but keep perceiving 
what the will of Jehovah is.” 


29:31.618 --> 29:33.621
We need to constantly think: 


29:33.622 --> 29:36.090
‘What would Jehovah want me to do?’ 


29:36.090 --> 29:39.993
Well, verse 1 and verse 2 
help us to appreciate this, it says: 


29:39.993 --> 29:42.963
“Become imitators of God, 
as beloved children, 


29:42.963 --> 29:47.168
“and go on walking in love, 
just as the Christ also loved us 


29:47.168 --> 29:50.070
“and [he] gave himself [up] 
for us as an offering 


29:50.070 --> 29:54.142
and a sacrifice, 
a sweet fragrance to God.” 


29:54.142 --> 29:58.445
So, bottom line, 
we need to imitate Jehovah and Jesus. 


29:58.445 --> 30:01.983
Our sacrifices need to be 
acceptable to Jehovah 


30:01.983 --> 30:04.118
as was Jesus’.


30:04.118 --> 30:06.855
What made Jesus so pleasing? 


30:06.855 --> 30:10.758
Well, he did everything 
the way Jehovah wanted him to do. 


30:10.758 --> 30:14.161
In fact, he said something 
that we want to say one day: 


30:14.162 --> 30:17.032
“I always do the things pleasing to him.” 


30:17.032 --> 30:19.967
And one day in perfection, 
we will be able to say that. 


30:19.967 --> 30:24.405
Jesus was pleasing 
in his word, in his deed, in his actions. 


30:24.405 --> 30:28.543
Well, how can we imitate Jesus 
and thus imitate Jehovah? 


30:28.543 --> 30:31.311
Well, let’s briefly discuss three ways. 


30:31.312 --> 30:34.515
First: Pray for God’s holy spirit. 


30:34.515 --> 30:37.618
When confronted with trials, 
what did Jesus do? 


30:37.618 --> 30:41.688
He did not rely on himself; 
he petitioned Jehovah for help. 


30:41.688 --> 30:44.258
So if we’re struggling with a temptation 


30:44.258 --> 30:46.360
—a certain fleshly weakness—


30:46.360 --> 30:49.030
it’s vital that we do the same. 


30:49.030 --> 30:51.665
We can also talk to the elders
—our loving shepherds—


30:51.665 --> 30:55.470
who will pray with us,
and they will definitely help us 


30:55.470 --> 30:58.973
to remain faithful 
with words of encouragement.


30:58.973 --> 31:03.143
Number two: Obey Jehovah completely. 


31:03.143 --> 31:06.580
Jesus always did things 
that were pleasing to his Father. 


31:06.580 --> 31:08.917
Luke 22:42 says: 


31:08.917 --> 31:12.554
“Let, not my will, but yours take place.” 


31:12.553 --> 31:15.890
Remember, 
there is no substitute for obedience. 


31:15.890 --> 31:19.193
We cannot be acceptable without obedience. 


31:19.193 --> 31:22.663
Number three: Know the Scriptures well. 


31:22.663 --> 31:25.733
Jesus used God’s Word as his authority. 


31:25.733 --> 31:28.703
His whole life revolved around knowing 


31:28.703 --> 31:32.506
and obeying and encouraging others 
about God’s laws. 


31:32.507 --> 31:34.509
We all have busy schedules. 


31:34.508 --> 31:37.311
We have work to do 
—busy in the congregation. 


31:37.312 --> 31:41.115
It’s more than just trying to find time 
to dig deep into God’s Word; 


31:41.115 --> 31:43.652
we must make the time. 


31:43.652 --> 31:46.454
So, what do our schedules tell us 


31:46.453 --> 31:49.090
about our love for Jehovah? 


31:49.090 --> 31:51.625
our love for his Word? 


31:51.625 --> 31:54.028
Do we read the Bible daily? 


31:54.028 --> 31:56.730
And if we do, 
how much time do we take 


31:56.730 --> 32:01.000
to let it sink into our mind 
and our heart and to meditate? 


32:02.237 --> 32:04.239
Are we content with just looking 


32:04.238 --> 32:06.240
at the basics
—the surface—


32:06.240 --> 32:10.712
or digging deeper and deeper 
below the surface?


32:10.712 --> 32:13.882
It’s vital that we train 
our minds and our hearts, 


32:13.882 --> 32:16.684
but it takes time 
and it takes effort, 


32:16.683 --> 32:20.020
just as a marathon runner 
must devote much time and effort 


32:20.020 --> 32:22.990
to his training to run a race. 


32:22.990 --> 32:25.360
In fact, as we know, 
Christians are likened 


32:25.360 --> 32:27.562
to running a race, 
and it’s a race for life. 


32:27.562 --> 32:29.564
Let’s see 
what the apostle Paul had to tell us. 


32:29.563 --> 32:33.668
If we go over to 1 Corinthians, 


32:33.668 --> 32:36.070
1 Corinthians chapter 9, 


32:36.070 --> 32:40.742
a scripture we know very well, 
and we’ll start in verse 24. 


32:40.742 --> 32:42.344
And there are a few key elements 


32:42.343 --> 32:44.978
that we would like to extract 
as we’re reading these verses. 


32:44.978 --> 32:46.746
Here Paul said: 


32:46.747 --> 32:49.450
“Do you not know 
that the runners in a race all run, 


32:49.450 --> 32:52.120
“but only one receives the prize? 


32:52.120 --> 32:55.857
“Run in such a way that you may win it. 


32:55.857 --> 32:58.425
“Now everyone competing in a contest 


32:58.425 --> 33:02.230
“exercises self-control in all things 
[there’s a key]. 


33:02.230 --> 33:05.400
“Of course, they do it 
to receive a crown that can perish, 


33:05.400 --> 33:07.802
“but we, one that does not perish. 


33:07.802 --> 33:11.439
“Therefore, the way 
I am running is not aimlessly; 


33:11.438 --> 33:13.473
“the way I am aiming my blows 


33:13.473 --> 33:16.776
“is so as not to be striking the air; 


33:16.777 --> 33:18.914
“but I pummel my body 


33:18.913 --> 33:22.516
“[and the footnote says, 
“punish; strictly discipline”] 


33:22.517 --> 33:26.387
“and lead it as a slave, 
so that after I have preached to others, 


33:26.387 --> 33:29.757
“I myself should not become disapproved 


33:29.757 --> 33:33.000
[or the footnote says, “disqualified”] 
somehow.” 


33:34.695 --> 33:38.365
So we definitely want to have 
self-control like a runner. 


33:38.365 --> 33:40.502
We need to say no to Satan’s world 


33:40.502 --> 33:43.839
and yes to things 
that are acceptable to Jehovah. 


33:43.838 --> 33:47.475
And we definitely want 
to make sure that we are acceptable 


33:47.475 --> 33:50.110
and never to be disapproved. 


33:50.110 --> 33:52.180
Perhaps we can illustrate this. 


33:52.180 --> 33:55.348
In the 1994 New York City Marathon, 


33:55.348 --> 33:58.185
there was a young man named German Silva, 


33:58.185 --> 34:00.922
and he ran an outstanding race. 


34:00.922 --> 34:05.092
In fact, there was only half a mile 
to the finish line in Central Park, 


34:05.092 --> 34:07.129
and somehow he got distracted. 


34:07.128 --> 34:09.130
He took the wrong path. 


34:09.130 --> 34:10.765
Did he lose the race? 


34:10.765 --> 34:12.967
Well, the lead runner took over. 


34:12.967 --> 34:16.270
Well, he got redirected; 
he went back on the path; 


34:16.270 --> 34:18.873
he began to run faster and faster. 


34:18.873 --> 34:20.875
He passed up the lead runner, 


34:20.875 --> 34:24.578
and he won the New York City Marathon 
by two seconds. 


34:24.578 --> 34:26.580
What does this tell us? 


34:26.580 --> 34:30.585
It tells us that sometimes 
we can lose our focus, we can be sidetracked, 


34:30.585 --> 34:34.622
or we could get involved 
in unacceptable conduct. 


34:34.622 --> 34:39.160
But allow God’s Word 
and loving shepherds to readjust our course. 


34:39.160 --> 34:41.162
Never give up. 


34:41.162 --> 34:43.932
Just a few years later, after that
—1997—


34:43.932 --> 34:47.202
German began running again 
in a New York City Marathon. 


34:47.202 --> 34:50.304
He thought he had this one all in the bag; 


34:50.303 --> 34:52.306
he thought he was going to win this race. 


34:52.307 --> 34:54.409
But he started to run slower. 


34:54.408 --> 34:56.943
He began to— 
He dehydrated. 


34:56.943 --> 35:00.046
Instead of taking 
just a few seconds to hydrate, 


35:00.047 --> 35:01.549
he skipped that. 


35:01.548 --> 35:02.883
He thought he could do it. 


35:02.883 --> 35:04.885
Well, what could this tell us? 


35:04.885 --> 35:07.188
Well, we cannot afford to take shortcuts. 


35:07.188 --> 35:10.458
We need to have 
a regular intake of spiritual food 


35:10.458 --> 35:12.926
to keep pace with Jehovah’s organization. 


35:12.927 --> 35:15.930
We do this 
by what the commenters told us today, 


35:15.930 --> 35:19.600
that is, a regular intake 
of God’s Word and meditation. 


35:19.600 --> 35:22.603
As we run the Christian course
—the race for life—


35:22.603 --> 35:25.940
remember, it’s not the speed, 
it’s the direction


35:25.940 --> 35:28.008
—that’s what matters the most. 


35:28.008 --> 35:32.000
And may we always run in such a way 
that is acceptable to Jehovah. 


35:33.047 --> 35:35.684
As Brother Curzan mentioned, 


35:35.683 --> 35:39.486
certainly a regular intake of God’s Word 


35:39.487 --> 35:43.324
can have a dramatic effect on our lives. 


35:43.323 --> 35:47.628
Take the example of Rafika Morris. 


35:47.628 --> 35:49.896
Her life led her on a search 


35:49.897 --> 35:53.334
for ways to achieve racial harmony 


35:53.333 --> 35:56.436
through human means. 


35:56.437 --> 36:00.207
But after years of frustration 
and disappointments, 


36:00.207 --> 36:02.710
how would studying the Bible 


36:02.710 --> 36:06.000
affect her search for answers? 


36:08.748 --> 36:10.751
Growing up in the South 


36:10.752 --> 36:12.000
during the time of segregation


36:14.155 --> 36:18.592
—blacks and whites—
we couldn’t mix. 


36:18.592 --> 36:20.427
And not only that, they had signs 


36:20.427 --> 36:23.597
to keep you knowing 
where you were supposed to go. 


36:23.597 --> 36:26.000
I couldn’t understand 
why we couldn’t get along.


36:27.502 --> 36:29.504
Fifty cents.


36:29.503 --> 36:31.438
Yes, Sir. 


36:31.438 --> 36:33.540
Thank you, Sir.


36:33.540 --> 36:36.910
Grandma, he’s just a boy. 
Why are you saying “Sir”?


36:36.910 --> 36:40.000
Be quiet. 
I want you to know your place.


36:41.548 --> 36:43.583
I told her after we got back on the truck: 


36:43.583 --> 36:47.388
“You know what? 
I’ll never hold my head down!”


36:47.388 --> 36:49.556
My grandmother 
knew I had a love for the Bible 


36:49.557 --> 36:52.000
because I would 
always read the Bible as a kid. 


36:54.062 --> 36:57.000
But I couldn’t understand it.


37:02.035 --> 37:05.072
I used to pray, 
“What makes us so different?” 


37:05.072 --> 37:08.000
You know, 
“Why can’t we live together?”


37:11.612 --> 37:14.249
I met a group, 


37:14.248 --> 37:19.220
and this group was like 
what I really wanted to be in. 


37:19.220 --> 37:21.722
They were about politics. 


37:21.722 --> 37:23.925
They said, “We’re fighting injustice.” 


37:23.925 --> 37:26.993
And when they said 
that word “injustice,” it was like, 


37:26.993 --> 37:30.598
‘Yeah, this is what I want to be in, right?


37:30.598 --> 37:32.900
‘To be part of something that can change 


37:32.900 --> 37:35.335
and make people united, right?’ 


37:35.335 --> 37:38.572
That was my goal.


37:38.572 --> 37:41.342
We started protesting about police brutality, 


37:41.342 --> 37:43.910
and I think that’s what a lot of people, 


37:43.910 --> 37:46.000
you know, 
were focusing on. 


37:47.415 --> 37:50.250
I liked some of the things 
that they were doing, 


37:50.250 --> 37:53.520
but they trained us every, 
every day in military training. 


37:53.520 --> 37:56.023
We learned how to use weapons 
and stuff like that. 


37:56.023 --> 37:58.391
And so I’m thinking: 


37:58.392 --> 38:01.662
‘This is not what I want to be in. 
This is not what I joined.’


38:01.662 --> 38:05.834
So I started going back to God again
—to reading the Bible—


38:05.833 --> 38:08.535
because it was like 
I’m not changing anything. 


38:08.535 --> 38:11.605
The Bible that I was reading 
was the King James Version. 


38:11.605 --> 38:13.773
So I was reading it, reading it, reading it, 


38:13.773 --> 38:16.010
but I couldn’t understand it. 


38:16.010 --> 38:18.012
We went to Jamaica, 


38:18.012 --> 38:20.882
and we saw this Bible, 
the New World Translation. 


38:20.882 --> 38:23.550
And I started reading it, 
and it made so much sense! 


38:23.550 --> 38:26.520
And I could understand it, 
and it wasn’t “thee” and “thou.” 


38:26.520 --> 38:28.688
I was like, ‘Wow!’ 


38:28.688 --> 38:31.058
You know, like, 
‘This is the one I want to get.’


38:31.058 --> 38:34.761
One day, two women knocked on the door. 


38:34.762 --> 38:36.697
I didn’t know they were Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


38:36.697 --> 38:39.067
All I could see was that Bible. 


38:39.067 --> 38:42.135
And I said, 
“Where did you get that Bible from?” 


38:42.135 --> 38:44.405
And they said, 
“OK, we’ll bring you one.” 


38:44.405 --> 38:46.373
And they did. 
So they brought me the Bible, 


38:46.373 --> 38:50.000
but I didn’t know I was going to have 
a Bible study that came along with it.


38:51.212 --> 38:54.715
The first time I went 
to a convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


38:54.715 --> 38:57.317
it was like ten thousand people. 


38:57.317 --> 38:59.754
When I went in there and I saw 


38:59.753 --> 39:02.221
all these different faces 
and different colors, 


39:02.222 --> 39:04.025
it was like Jehovah showing me: 


39:04.025 --> 39:06.327
“Hey, Rafika, remember you were asking me 


39:06.327 --> 39:10.397
“about all different people 
getting together and being one? 


39:10.397 --> 39:14.402
See, I’m not partial; 
they do get along; we are unified.” 


39:14.402 --> 39:17.639
And it just made me feel so good inside. 


39:17.638 --> 39:19.340
Yes! 


39:19.340 --> 39:22.843
This is the organization 
that I want to be in.


39:22.843 --> 39:27.046
I just see people as people, you know, 


39:27.047 --> 39:32.954
and I can preach 
and be friends with anybody. 


39:32.953 --> 39:35.555
Now that I know 
what the Bible really teaches, 


39:35.555 --> 39:37.290
I have a wonderful life 


39:37.290 --> 39:41.995
because I know 
that only God and his government 


39:41.995 --> 39:44.798
can bring about peace.


39:44.798 --> 39:46.966
Just like how Jehovah 
unified everybody, 


39:46.967 --> 39:49.570
I want everybody 
to be unified


39:49.570 --> 39:52.000
and come to know Jehovah, 
just like I know him. 


39:53.107 --> 39:56.000
Jehovah answered my prayer. 


40:05.018 --> 40:09.021
While Rafika faced unique challenges 


40:09.022 --> 40:11.192
early in her spiritual life, 


40:11.192 --> 40:14.862
she learned to trust in Jehovah. 


40:14.862 --> 40:17.297
Trust is also needed 


40:17.297 --> 40:19.734
if we choose to extend ourselves 


40:19.733 --> 40:21.901
in a new form of Kingdom service. 


40:21.902 --> 40:26.240
This is especially true 
of those who have had the privilege 


40:26.240 --> 40:29.510
to attend the School 
for Kingdom Evangelizers. 


40:29.510 --> 40:34.000
Their personal experiences confirm this. 


40:37.150 --> 40:39.987
I have an illness 
that affects my level of energy, 


40:39.987 --> 40:43.000
so I didn’t feel that I could accept 
just any kind of assignment. 


40:44.258 --> 40:47.728
Since the end of this system is near, 


40:47.728 --> 40:49.730
I want to do whatever I can 


40:49.730 --> 40:52.733
that Jehovah wants down to the very end. 


40:52.733 --> 40:54.935
So I applied. 


40:54.935 --> 40:57.738
Before attending SKE, 
when I received my invitation, 


40:57.738 --> 41:01.741
all of a sudden I had challenges 
or worries about myself. 


41:01.742 --> 41:05.000
I felt unworthy, even unqualified.


41:06.013 --> 41:11.018
Being a single sister, 
going into the class with so many couples, 


41:11.018 --> 41:15.000
I thought I would be out of place. 


41:17.090 --> 41:21.095
I used all my abilities. 


41:21.095 --> 41:25.265
I felt like my head was swelling up. 


41:25.265 --> 41:28.868
Even so, I felt 
that I was really being refined 


41:28.868 --> 41:32.000
and ended each day feeling fulfilled.


41:34.808 --> 41:36.310
Something that I 


41:36.310 --> 41:37.912
really enjoyed about SKE 


41:37.912 --> 41:39.580
was Friday afternoons. 


41:39.580 --> 41:41.582
That’s when we had a talk 


41:41.582 --> 41:43.317
from one of the Governing Body members. 


41:43.317 --> 41:45.719
That was special.


41:45.718 --> 41:47.721
During the eight weeks of school, 


41:47.722 --> 41:49.155
such an emphasis was placed 


41:49.155 --> 41:51.158
on serving where the need is greater. 


41:51.158 --> 41:54.160
So this way of thinking 
became more important to us.


41:54.160 --> 41:56.163
After eight weeks of attending the school, 


41:56.163 --> 41:58.798
you are even ready to be sent to the moon.


41:58.798 --> 42:00.133
When I was told 


42:00.133 --> 42:01.601
that my next assignment 


42:01.602 --> 42:03.837
would be in Mesa, Arizona, 


42:03.837 --> 42:05.839
I thought, ‘Where is that?’ 


42:05.838 --> 42:08.475
And then I thought, 
‘Oh, no, scorpions!’ 


42:08.475 --> 42:10.810
And then I thought, ‘OK, 


42:10.810 --> 42:14.648
this is where Jehovah thinks 
I should be, so I’m ready to go.’


42:14.648 --> 42:16.650
One of the challenges in my new assignment 


42:16.650 --> 42:19.320
was finding suitable accommodations. 


42:19.320 --> 42:21.422
There was a couple in the congregation 


42:21.422 --> 42:25.159
who had two rooms that they rented 
in the back of their property,


42:25.158 --> 42:27.160
but it needed some renovations. 


42:27.160 --> 42:30.263
So the brothers very quickly came together, 
helped sort it out, 


42:30.263 --> 42:34.268
and even built an extra 
little kitchenette lounge. 


42:34.268 --> 42:36.270
So now we have a beautiful little home 


42:36.270 --> 42:40.140
to go back to after a long, 
hot day in the ministry. 


42:40.140 --> 42:44.143
I always thought that I’d do much better 
in the cold than I would in the heat. 


42:44.143 --> 42:47.013
So the brothers and sisters 
were very helpful 


42:47.013 --> 42:49.215
in making sure that I stayed hydrated, 


42:49.215 --> 42:52.552
making sure I knew 
how to handle myself in the heat, 


42:52.552 --> 42:55.389
giving me pointers on things to carry, 


42:55.388 --> 42:57.556
and they made sure that I had 


42:57.557 --> 43:00.460
an extra-large water bottle with me. 


43:00.460 --> 43:04.432
We really felt supported by the congregation 


43:04.432 --> 43:06.734
because they found us an apartment. 


43:06.733 --> 43:11.000
This meant that we could concentrate 
on our ministry. 


43:12.572 --> 43:16.344
One of the things that really helped me 
was an experienced brother 


43:16.343 --> 43:19.813
who gave an encouraging comment 
about whether my health 


43:19.813 --> 43:21.848
would permit me to attend the school. 


43:21.848 --> 43:24.351
He said, “If she can pioneer, 


43:24.352 --> 43:27.000
then it’s also possible for her 
to attend the school.”


43:29.155 --> 43:31.725
The education that we received at SKE 


43:31.725 --> 43:35.162
especially helped us with our qualities, 


43:35.162 --> 43:37.899
our personality 
—putting on the new personality. 


43:37.898 --> 43:41.235
That really will help us 
not only now in our assignment 


43:41.235 --> 43:44.000
but right through into the new world. 


43:46.240 --> 43:48.775
I think there are many 
who could meet the qualifications 


43:48.775 --> 43:51.245
with just a little more effort. 


43:51.245 --> 43:55.715
Please know that there is 
a wonderful education program, 


43:55.715 --> 43:59.218
and we were able 
to experience it in our 60’s. 


43:59.218 --> 44:02.690
We could get through it. 


44:02.690 --> 44:05.558
So if others are thinking of applying, 


44:05.558 --> 44:09.061
I want to tell them 
that we were able to do it, 


44:09.062 --> 44:11.132
and by all means, 


44:11.132 --> 44:15.000
I want them to taste 
the same joy that we experienced. 


44:17.070 --> 44:18.572
You could be nervous 


44:18.572 --> 44:21.875
and have performance anxiety 
and worry about, 


44:21.875 --> 44:23.943
‘How will I handle answering, 


44:23.943 --> 44:26.280
‘and how about all 
of the student assignments 


44:26.280 --> 44:28.648
and the tests?’
—worries like that. 


44:28.648 --> 44:30.650
But for my own part, 


44:30.650 --> 44:34.655
it was two months 
with an incredible amount of joy. 


44:34.655 --> 44:37.223
And you have to focus on that. 


44:37.223 --> 44:41.495
It is a gift 
—it is a wonderful gift from Jehovah. 


44:41.495 --> 44:44.565
I wasn’t sure if I was going 
to put in the application 


44:44.565 --> 44:47.300
because I thought maybe 
I wanted to do it as a couple 


44:47.300 --> 44:49.670
rather than as a single person. 


44:49.670 --> 44:52.000
But I prayed to Jehovah about it, 
and I put my application in. 


44:53.507 --> 44:55.842
I wouldn’t be experiencing the happiness 


44:55.842 --> 44:57.979
that I have now if I had waited. 


44:57.978 --> 45:00.580
So I’m happy 
that I just put my application in 


45:00.580 --> 45:02.582
and let Jehovah do the rest. 


45:02.582 --> 45:04.852
And now, sometimes I’m driving 
down the freeway, and I think: 


45:04.852 --> 45:07.000
‘Wow, Jehovah, I am so happy! 
Thank you!’


45:09.923 --> 45:13.593
These experiences remind me 


45:13.593 --> 45:17.898
of Colossians 3:23, 24 which reads: 


45:17.898 --> 45:19.900
“Whatever you are doing, 


45:19.900 --> 45:23.837
“work at it whole-souled as for Jehovah, 


45:23.837 --> 45:28.309
“and not for men, 
for you know that it is from Jehovah 


45:28.308 --> 45:31.311
“you will receive 
the inheritance as a reward. 


45:31.312 --> 45:34.415
Slave for the Master, Christ.” 


45:34.415 --> 45:38.952
Certainly, these brothers 
and sisters are doing just that. 


45:38.952 --> 45:43.124
If you personally find yourself in a position 


45:43.123 --> 45:47.160
to reach out for a privilege, 
such as attending this school 


45:47.160 --> 45:50.063
or moving to where the need is great, 


45:50.063 --> 45:53.000
give it consideration. 


45:54.000 --> 45:56.870
Now we travel to Costa Rica, 


45:56.870 --> 46:01.073
where we find our brothers 
and sisters relying on Jehovah 


46:01.073 --> 46:06.646
as they prepare for a very special assembly. 


46:06.647 --> 46:12.000
Why was trust in Jehovah 
essential for this project? 


46:28.802 --> 46:32.072
First, we asked the branch for permission. 


46:32.072 --> 46:33.840
Once they gave us approval, 


46:33.840 --> 46:36.310
we began to make preparations 
for the assembly, 


46:36.310 --> 46:39.245
though we had absolutely nothing. 


46:39.245 --> 46:42.715
So one brother lent us a property 
for the assembly site. 


46:42.715 --> 46:46.153
Our brothers have brought 
many different skills to the project. 


46:46.153 --> 46:48.155
There are metalworkers ,


46:48.155 --> 46:50.923
cabinetmakers, and bricklayers. 


46:50.923 --> 46:52.158
Many brothers 


46:52.158 --> 46:53.693
have given of their resources 


46:53.693 --> 46:55.295
and used their abilities 


46:55.295 --> 46:58.000
so that this project could go ahead. 


46:59.365 --> 47:01.802
This has really made us stand out here. 


47:01.802 --> 47:04.137
People were asking each other: 


47:04.137 --> 47:05.239
“What is happening here?” 


47:05.238 --> 47:07.806
and “Who paid for all of this?”


47:07.807 --> 47:12.812
They say people are surprised 
at how many workers are coming to help. 


47:12.812 --> 47:13.714
And I wonder, 


47:13.713 --> 47:16.650
‘If this is getting attention now, 


47:16.650 --> 47:19.385
what will the assembly be like?’ 


47:19.385 --> 47:23.390
A comfortable, practical, 
and secure Assembly Hall 


47:23.390 --> 47:26.427
was constructed using materials 
acquired locally. 


47:26.427 --> 47:30.030
Expectations grew 
as the special day drew closer, 


47:30.030 --> 47:33.167
and when it finally arrived, 
those in attendance 


47:33.167 --> 47:37.000
experienced something truly moving. 


47:39.807 --> 47:42.910
With Jehovah’s help, 
many interested ones, 


47:42.910 --> 47:46.213
along with our brothers and sisters, 
have come here today 


47:46.213 --> 47:50.816
to celebrate our first assembly 
in the Bribri language. 


47:50.817 --> 47:55.000
Friends, this is wonderful! 


47:57.925 --> 48:02.000
When the program started in Bribri, I cried.


48:04.463 --> 48:06.165
I’m so happy 


48:06.165 --> 48:08.735
to have participated in the assembly, 


48:08.735 --> 48:11.000
especially because it’s in my own language. 


48:14.273 --> 48:16.075
It’s what we wanted. 


48:16.075 --> 48:18.778
We hope it continues just like this.


48:18.778 --> 48:22.000
We walked a long way to invite these people, 


48:24.585 --> 48:29.000
and to see them here, 
it makes me very happy. 


48:34.828 --> 48:37.763
The information presented 
in the local language 


48:37.763 --> 48:39.600
touched many hearts. 


48:39.600 --> 48:41.868
This was truly a historic event 


48:41.868 --> 48:44.971
for our indigenous brothers in Costa Rica. 


48:44.972 --> 48:46.974
Jehovah has made it possible 


48:46.973 --> 48:51.000
for more people in this isolated region 
to enjoy his spiritual blessing. 


48:58.818 --> 49:03.056
Did you note why trust in Jehovah 


49:03.057 --> 49:07.327
was so essential for this project? 


49:07.327 --> 49:11.097
At the start the brothers had nothing. 


49:11.097 --> 49:15.135
But they trusted 
that Jehovah would assist them, 


49:15.135 --> 49:19.105
and he did through donated land, 


49:19.105 --> 49:22.542
materials, and willing volunteers. 


49:22.542 --> 49:26.680
Yes, we can truly put 
our confidence in Jehovah 


49:26.680 --> 49:30.483
as he guides us 
through this system of things. 


49:30.483 --> 49:33.186
Such trust in Jehovah 


49:33.187 --> 49:38.092
is highlighted 
in this month’s music video entitled 


49:38.092 --> 49:42.000
Confident in You. 


49:47.833 --> 49:58.678
Like a tree planted in the ground, 
Your words have sunk deep down 


49:58.678 --> 50:08.788
Into my heart and soothed my mind 
with gentle thoughts of peace. 


50:08.788 --> 50:19.265
’Cause no matter what may come, 
With this wisdom from above, 


50:19.265 --> 50:28.275
I always have these truths 
to keep reminding me to 


50:28.275 --> 50:39.285
Go on; don’t be afraid. 
Hold on to what Jehovah says. 


50:39.285 --> 50:49.428
Through all the storms, your words have 
Given me strength to endure. 


50:49.428 --> 51:01.000
And every day I am more 
confident in you. 


51:05.178 --> 51:16.355
When this world tries to pull me down, 
To give up on what I’ve found, 


51:16.355 --> 51:26.132
I turn to you and know that you 
are always there. 


51:26.132 --> 51:36.610
It takes time to meditate— 
Get the words from off the page 


51:36.610 --> 51:45.518
And in my heart so they can help 
and guide me to 


51:45.518 --> 51:55.495
Go on; don’t be afraid. 
Hold on to what Jehovah says. 


51:55.495 --> 52:07.140
Look beyond any adversity. 
Focus on the things that I can’t see.  


52:07.140 --> 52:17.283
Through all the storms, your words have 
Given me strength to endure. 


52:17.283 --> 52:29.128
And every day I am more 
confident in you— 


52:29.128 --> 52:34.000
In you. 


52:44.510 --> 52:55.088
Go on; don’t be afraid. 
Hold on to what Jehovah says. 


52:55.088 --> 53:06.365
Look beyond any adversity. 
Focus on the things that I can’t see. 


53:06.365 --> 53:16.042
Through all the storms, your words have 
Given me strength to endure. 


53:16.042 --> 53:29.000
And every day I am more 
confident in you. 


53:30.523 --> 53:34.093
This month we have seen 
how trusting in Jehovah 


53:34.093 --> 53:38.498
and his guidance 
can assist us in a variety of ways: 


53:38.498 --> 53:41.166
addressing issues with a close friend, 


53:41.167 --> 53:43.737
our choices in entertainment, 


53:43.737 --> 53:48.074
and even coping with a world 
filled with social injustice. 


53:48.073 --> 53:52.245
Certainly, Jehovah 
is someone in whom we can trust! 


53:52.245 --> 53:57.083
But we have one last treat 
for you before we end our program. 


53:57.083 --> 54:01.688
We’ll briefly travel to Cádiz, Spain. 


54:01.688 --> 54:06.058
Cádiz is considered to be one 
of the oldest cities in Western Europe 


54:06.058 --> 54:08.361
and was founded by the Phoenicians. 


54:08.362 --> 54:13.734
It is situated on a narrow slice 
of land surrounded by the sea. 


54:13.733 --> 54:16.970
Cádiz has a wealth of vistas 


54:16.970 --> 54:20.240
and well-preserved historical landmarks. 


54:20.240 --> 54:24.377
On the outskirts 
lies Puerto de Santa María, 


54:24.377 --> 54:27.447
where an English-speaking 
congregation meets. 


54:27.447 --> 54:30.217
This congregation is made up mainly 


54:30.217 --> 54:33.554
of brothers and sisters 
serving as need-greaters. 


54:33.553 --> 54:37.903
They have come from other parts 
of Spain as well as distant lands, 


54:37.903 --> 54:42.928
such as Australia, Britain, 
Canada, and the United States. 


54:42.928 --> 54:46.035
Cádiz has a high rate of unemployment, 


54:46.035 --> 54:48.068
so finding work is not easy. 


54:48.068 --> 54:52.540
One couple travels nearly 300 miles 


54:52.540 --> 54:54.473
(or 483 km) 


54:54.473 --> 54:57.210
every Thursday to their territory, 


54:57.210 --> 55:01.748
and on Monday morning they make 
the trip back to where they live and work. 


55:01.748 --> 55:04.416
In spite of these financial challenges, 


55:04.417 --> 55:07.520
many are still serving 
as construction volunteers, 


55:07.520 --> 55:11.573
remote Bethel workers, and pioneers. 


55:11.573 --> 55:14.910
Our brothers and sisters 
in Puerto de Santa María 


55:14.910 --> 55:18.882
are thrilled to send their love 
and greetings to you all. 


55:18.882 --> 55:21.650
This is JW Broadcasting 


55:21.650 --> 55:31.795
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
