00:00.650 --> 00:02.318
How would you feel

00:02.318 --> 00:04.320
if you received an invitation

00:04.320 --> 00:06.823
to attend the next class of Gilead School?

00:07.457 --> 00:11.094
For many, it has been 
a lifelong dream to attend Gilead.

00:11.094 --> 00:15.298
The course helps students 
keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”

00:15.298 --> 00:20.303
For others, the idea of five months 
of intense study seems intimidating.

00:20.303 --> 00:22.672
We know we need to study,

00:22.672 --> 00:25.241
but we may find 
it a challenge to get the most

00:25.241 --> 00:28.845
out of the time we spend 
reading God’s Word.

00:28.845 --> 00:33.850
In this program, we will discuss 
why study is so important,

00:33.850 --> 00:36.920
what it means to study something,

00:36.920 --> 00:40.724
and how you can get more 
from your study sessions.

00:40.724 --> 00:43.093
Since most cannot attend Gilead,

00:43.093 --> 00:46.763
we will demonstrate 
the method used in Gilead School.

00:47.831 --> 00:52.535
First, why is study so important?

00:52.535 --> 00:57.474
Only by study can we 
keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”

00:57.474 --> 01:00.176
When the apostle Paul penned these words,

01:00.176 --> 01:04.547
he was imprisoned and nearing the end 
of his action-packed life.

01:04.547 --> 01:06.916
He had been the “apostle to the nations”

01:06.916 --> 01:08.651
and had spent his best years

01:08.651 --> 01:11.354
taking the Word of God 
to the then-known world.

01:12.455 --> 01:15.125
As he reflected on the fruits of his labors,

01:15.125 --> 01:19.796
he wrote a letter to his friends 
in the congregation in Philippi in Macedonia.

01:20.964 --> 01:23.967
Inspired by holy spirit, he wrote words

01:23.967 --> 01:27.971
that would aid his brothers 
to gain the prize of eternal life.

01:27.971 --> 01:32.876
These words are found 
at Philippians 2:15, 16.

01:32.876 --> 01:35.545
Let’s read them:

01:35.545 --> 01:39.816
“So that you may come to be 
blameless and innocent,

01:39.816 --> 01:43.052
“children of God 
without a blemish in the midst

01:43.052 --> 01:45.622
“of a crooked and twisted generation,

01:45.622 --> 01:49.259
“among whom you are shining 
as illuminators in the world,

01:49.259 --> 01:53.663
keeping a tight grip on the word of life.”

01:53.663 --> 01:56.432
Imagine the joy Paul felt

01:56.432 --> 01:59.602
when he was reunited 
in the heavenly resurrection

01:59.602 --> 02:02.338
with those who listened to his admonition

02:02.338 --> 02:06.042
to keep “a tight grip on the word of life”!

02:06.042 --> 02:09.312
Whether we have 
the heavenly or earthly hope,

02:09.312 --> 02:13.249
Paul’s words can help us gain 
the prize of eternal life.

02:13.249 --> 02:17.320
They imprint on our hearts and minds 
a basic exhortation

02:17.320 --> 02:22.325
that will lead us through these last days 
and into our everlasting reward.

02:22.325 --> 02:27.330
The question is, Will we remain 
‘blameless and without blemish

02:27.330 --> 02:32.168
in the midst of this crooked 
and twisted generation’ of our day?

02:32.902 --> 02:37.907
Will we rejoice with other faithful servants 
of God in the new world?

02:37.907 --> 02:40.677
We can and we will

02:40.677 --> 02:42.879
if we take to heart Paul’s counsel

02:42.879 --> 02:46.482
to keep “a tight grip on the word of life.”

02:47.717 --> 02:51.721
Next, what does it mean to study?

02:51.721 --> 02:54.090
Stop and contemplate this word picture

02:54.090 --> 02:56.526
for keeping a tight grip.

02:56.526 --> 02:59.762
Imagine a hiker who has slipped near a ledge.

02:59.762 --> 03:04.567
But before falling over the cliff, 
he grabs hold of a tree branch.

03:04.567 --> 03:08.171
How tight do you think 
his grip will be on that branch?

03:08.171 --> 03:10.773
This is not a halfhearted effort.

03:10.773 --> 03:15.078
Likewise, keeping a tight grip 
on the word of life

03:15.078 --> 03:20.083
is not just a mechanical routine, 
nor is it a casual habit.

03:20.083 --> 03:22.952
It requires strenuous effort.

03:22.952 --> 03:27.957
It involves actively living 
by the truths in God’s Word.

03:27.957 --> 03:30.627
To do this, we must understand

03:30.627 --> 03:34.163
more than what God 
expressly commands and condemns.

03:34.163 --> 03:37.033
We must be able to identify principles,

03:37.033 --> 03:40.770
or life lessons, contained in the Bible.

03:40.770 --> 03:43.473
Once identified, we must understand

03:43.473 --> 03:45.975
how to match these valuable truths

03:45.975 --> 03:49.412
to specific situations in our lives.

03:49.412 --> 03:53.516
Then we must allow these principles 
to influence our decisions

03:53.516 --> 03:57.553
and guide our reaction 
to trials and temptations.

03:58.621 --> 04:00.623
Ask yourself,

04:00.623 --> 04:04.794
‘How strong is my grip 
on the word of life?’

04:04.794 --> 04:06.796
To answer that,

04:06.796 --> 04:10.733
let’s consider 
the fundamentals of Bible study.

04:11.801 --> 04:14.904
This is not about old methods or new methods,

04:14.904 --> 04:17.273
nor is it about what device you are using.

04:17.273 --> 04:21.277
This discussion transcends devices.

04:21.277 --> 04:24.614
Study requires active thinking.

04:24.614 --> 04:27.650
In a world of increasing distractions,

04:27.650 --> 04:30.520
this is becoming an even greater challenge.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.922
We’ve often received instant information

04:32.922 --> 04:35.658
that enables us to quickly recite facts,

04:35.658 --> 04:39.595
but this is not the same as active thinking.

04:39.595 --> 04:41.597
Through active thinking,

04:41.597 --> 04:45.702
we draw meaningful conclusions in our hearts.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.939
We are certainly grateful 
for all the study tools we’ve been given.

04:49.939 --> 04:52.608
We should use these to the full.

04:52.608 --> 04:55.345
At the same time, we need to be careful

04:55.345 --> 05:00.216
that these tools do not cause us 
to develop mental laziness.

05:00.216 --> 05:03.486
Devices can help us to access information,

05:03.486 --> 05:06.322
but they can’t think for us.

05:06.322 --> 05:10.827
We must work hard if we are 
to develop new patterns of thinking.

05:10.827 --> 05:15.498
For example, if we study 
The Watchtower on a device,

05:15.498 --> 05:19.569
we can use the hyperlink feature 
to read the Scriptures.

05:19.569 --> 05:23.406
With a simple touch, 
we quickly find and read the verse.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.408
That is good!

05:25.408 --> 05:30.046
If you regularly do this, 
you get a grip on the word of life.

05:30.046 --> 05:34.784
But would you like to get 
a tight grip on the word of life?

05:34.784 --> 05:37.653
To get a tight grip requires more effort

05:37.653 --> 05:41.724
than a swipe of a finger 
and then swiftly moving on.

05:41.724 --> 05:46.062
You need to slow down 
and analyze the material.

05:46.062 --> 05:49.165
Only then will the information you study

05:49.165 --> 05:51.968
become imprinted on your mind and heart,

05:51.968 --> 05:54.470
leaving a clear and distinct impression.

05:55.471 --> 05:59.809
How, then, can I get more out of my study?

05:59.809 --> 06:04.080
Let’s demonstrate a method 
taught during Gilead School.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.283
It involves the use of six questions.

06:07.283 --> 06:11.721
The following poem, written 
by English journalist Rudyard Kipling,

06:11.721 --> 06:14.424
can help guide better thinking:

06:14.724 --> 06:18.061
“I keep six honest serving-men

06:18.061 --> 06:20.229
“(They taught me all I knew);

06:20.229 --> 06:22.131
“Their names are What and Why

06:22.131 --> 06:24.167
“and When and How

06:24.167 --> 06:27.537
and Where and Who.”

06:27.870 --> 06:31.808
When studying God’s Word, 
ask yourself these questions

06:31.808 --> 06:34.677
and then do research in our publications

06:34.677 --> 06:39.015
to get the facts 
and discern the spiritual lessons.

06:39.015 --> 06:41.284
To illustrate how to do this,

06:41.284 --> 06:45.154
let’s open our Bibles to Genesis chapter 49

06:45.154 --> 06:48.491
and look at verses 22 through 25.

06:53.763 --> 06:57.433
First, we ask the when and where.

06:57.433 --> 06:59.535
Now, with some research,

06:59.535 --> 07:04.040
we learn that Jacob 
spoke these words near the end of his life.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.042
He was in Egypt,

07:06.042 --> 07:09.812
but what he described 
takes us back to Canaan some 40 years

07:09.812 --> 07:12.482
when his son Joseph was a young man.

07:12.482 --> 07:15.885
Now we have 
a clearer picture of these verses.

07:15.885 --> 07:20.323
So now, let’s read and analyze verse 22:

07:20.323 --> 07:25.328
“Joseph is the offshoot of a fruitful tree,

07:25.328 --> 07:30.666
a fruitful tree by a spring, 
whose branches extend over the wall.”

07:30.666 --> 07:33.436
“The offshoot of a fruitful tree.”

07:33.436 --> 07:35.171
Who is the “fruitful tree”?

07:35.171 --> 07:37.707
It is Joseph’s father, Jacob.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.076
How was he fruitful?

07:40.076 --> 07:42.445
He bore many children.

07:42.445 --> 07:46.916
Joseph’s “branches extend over the wall.”

07:46.916 --> 07:50.586
As Jacob’s offshoot, 
Joseph is singled out

07:50.586 --> 07:53.923
for a special blessing 
superior to that of his brothers.

07:53.923 --> 07:55.925
Why?

07:55.925 --> 07:59.729
Joseph proved he had 
the qualities needed for leadership.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.899
However, of even greater value 
than his abilities

08:02.899 --> 08:05.968
was his being a spiritual man.

08:05.968 --> 08:08.437
Let’s read verse 23:

08:08.437 --> 08:11.674
“But the archers kept harassing him

08:11.674 --> 08:15.845
and shot at him and kept harboring 
animosity against him.”

08:15.845 --> 08:18.247
“The archers kept harassing him.”

08:18.247 --> 08:20.249
Who are “the archers”?

08:20.249 --> 08:22.251
Joseph’s half brothers.

08:22.251 --> 08:23.386
How?

08:23.386 --> 08:25.555
They shot figuratively at Joseph

08:25.555 --> 08:30.526
—arrows of envy and hatred 
and jealousy were used to attack him.

08:30.526 --> 08:34.630
Now, eventually, 
his brothers sold him into slavery.

08:34.630 --> 08:37.200
Now let’s read verse 24:

08:37.200 --> 08:40.269
“And yet his bow remained in place,

08:40.269 --> 08:43.639
“and his hands stayed strong and agile.

08:43.639 --> 08:47.009
“This was from the hands 
of the powerful one of Jacob,

08:47.009 --> 08:49.879
from the shepherd, the stone of Israel.”

08:49.879 --> 08:52.215
“His bow remained in place.”

08:52.215 --> 08:53.716
How?

08:53.716 --> 08:55.718
Despite the repeated attacks,

08:55.718 --> 08:59.088
Joseph repaid animosity with kindness.

08:59.088 --> 09:01.557
Joseph endured this ill-treatment

09:01.557 --> 09:04.727
and did not weaken in his devotion to God.

09:04.727 --> 09:06.729
Now we ask, How?

09:06.729 --> 09:09.899
How is it that Joseph 
kept a spiritual outlook

09:09.899 --> 09:12.902
despite the harassment and animosity?

09:12.902 --> 09:15.171
Let’s read verse 25:

09:15.504 --> 09:19.575
“He [Joseph] is from the God of your father,

09:19.575 --> 09:23.579
“and he will help you, 
and he is with the Almighty,

09:23.579 --> 09:26.682
“and he will bless you with the blessings 
of the heavens above,

09:26.682 --> 09:29.051
“with the blessings of the deep below,

09:29.051 --> 09:32.488
with the blessings of the breasts and womb.”

09:33.122 --> 09:35.691
“He is with the Almighty.”

09:35.691 --> 09:38.828
Joseph had Jehovah’s help.

09:38.828 --> 09:42.231
The Almighty was by his side through it all.

09:42.231 --> 09:45.935
We’ve used our questions 
to get the facts of the account,

09:45.935 --> 09:47.937
but we’re not done.

09:47.937 --> 09:52.108
Now let’s use them 
to take our study to a spiritual plane.

09:52.108 --> 09:55.678
Next, let’s ask a what question.

09:55.678 --> 09:59.882
What does this account 
teach us about Jehovah?

09:59.882 --> 10:04.253
Jehovah never abandons his loyal servants.

10:04.253 --> 10:08.424
Even in the depths of prison, 
Joseph was not alone.

10:08.424 --> 10:11.827
Jehovah found ways to bless Joseph.

10:11.827 --> 10:15.031
Now make the connection 
to Jehovah’s people today,

10:15.031 --> 10:17.066
including yourself.

10:17.066 --> 10:20.236
Jehovah will never abandon us.

10:20.236 --> 10:25.241
Rather, he shows loyal love 
to all those who serve him whole-souled.

10:25.241 --> 10:30.246
Would Jehovah let Joseph 
remain in prison indefinitely?

10:30.246 --> 10:32.248
No.

10:32.248 --> 10:35.251
At the appointed time, relief came.

10:35.251 --> 10:38.054
Joseph was raised from a prisoner in chains

10:38.054 --> 10:40.289
to the second most powerful man in Egypt

10:40.289 --> 10:43.426
—from prison to palace in one day.

10:43.426 --> 10:45.961
Make the connection to us.

10:45.961 --> 10:48.464
Our trials are temporary.

10:48.464 --> 10:50.866
Jehovah will soon bring relief,

10:50.866 --> 10:54.337
even in unexpected or surprising ways.

10:54.337 --> 10:57.940
Meanwhile, we are never alone;

10:57.940 --> 11:00.609
Jehovah is with us.

11:01.744 --> 11:05.147
Again, let’s ask the question, How?

11:05.147 --> 11:09.418
How does the account 
contribute to the Bible’s theme?

11:09.418 --> 11:12.722
Joseph suffered, but his suffering led

11:12.722 --> 11:15.524
to the survival of Abraham’s offspring,

11:15.524 --> 11:17.927
leading to the Messiah.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.564
Joseph’s account 
is not just a riveting story.

11:21.564 --> 11:23.566
It directly contributed

11:23.566 --> 11:27.103
to the development of Jehovah’s purpose.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.238
Think about this:

11:29.238 --> 11:32.708
In spite of the poor conduct of his brothers,

11:32.708 --> 11:36.178
Joseph forgave them and took the initiative

11:36.178 --> 11:39.515
to improve their relationship with him.

11:39.515 --> 11:44.520
Joseph’s attitude 
was a reflection of Jehovah’s attitude.

11:44.520 --> 11:46.989
With their family reunited,

11:46.989 --> 11:49.792
Jehovah also forgave Joseph’s brothers

11:49.792 --> 11:54.797
and took the initiative 
in restoring their relationship with Himself.

11:54.797 --> 11:59.802
In fact, Jehovah gave Joseph’s brother Judah

11:59.802 --> 12:04.006
the honor of being 
an ancestor of the Messiah.

12:04.006 --> 12:06.475
What are the lessons in this account?

12:06.475 --> 12:08.744
Let’s highlight just one.

12:08.744 --> 12:12.481
Genesis 49:23:

12:13.082 --> 12:16.118
“But the archers kept harassing him

12:16.118 --> 12:20.189
and shot at him and kept harboring 
animosity against him.”

12:20.523 --> 12:24.093
Arrows of animosity were fired at Joseph.

12:24.093 --> 12:27.596
Recall Joseph’s response in verse 24?

12:29.365 --> 12:32.368
“And yet his bow remained in place,

12:32.368 --> 12:36.038
and his hands stayed strong and agile.”

12:36.238 --> 12:39.575
In other words, he did not return fire.

12:39.575 --> 12:42.178
His bow remained in place.

12:42.178 --> 12:46.549
Reflect on the last time 
you were wronged by someone.

12:46.549 --> 12:50.386
How did we react to what we experienced?

12:50.386 --> 12:55.524
Did we seek to vindicate ourselves 
or insist on our rights?

12:55.524 --> 12:59.328
Did we fire arrows of animosity in return,

12:59.328 --> 13:03.098
or did we show mercy and loyal love?

13:03.098 --> 13:08.003
Did our reaction reveal 
that God’s spirit was operative on us?

13:08.003 --> 13:12.074
Like Joseph, we know 
we will have Jehovah’s approval

13:12.074 --> 13:15.377
even if we are wronged or experience trials

13:15.377 --> 13:18.247
that make us feel like we are in prison.

13:18.247 --> 13:20.916
Reflective questions like these

13:20.916 --> 13:23.552
enable us to make the account our own.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.354
It becomes part of us,

13:25.354 --> 13:27.890
part of our way of thinking, 
our way of acting.

13:27.890 --> 13:31.660
This nourishes our relationship with Jehovah.

13:31.660 --> 13:36.665
This type of study rewards us 
not simply with a collection of facts

13:36.665 --> 13:40.636
that impress us today 
and are forgotten tomorrow.

13:40.636 --> 13:44.807
Rather, it leaves us 
with core principles that we remember,

13:44.807 --> 13:48.844
that influence our decisions, 
and that guide our lives.

13:48.844 --> 13:52.681
We tighten our grip on the word of life.

13:53.749 --> 13:56.485
Let’s review the fundamentals of study.

13:56.485 --> 14:00.623
Again, this is not 
about old methods or new methods

14:00.623 --> 14:02.858
or about what device you are using.

14:02.858 --> 14:06.061
This discussion transcends devices.

14:06.061 --> 14:10.799
It’s about basic methods of Bible study.

14:10.799 --> 14:13.636
We can liken these three phases of study

14:13.636 --> 14:17.740
to gathering, sifting, and baking grain.

14:17.740 --> 14:20.676
Gathering is when we read the Bible.

14:20.676 --> 14:25.247
We don’t run through the field 
grabbing just handfuls of grain;

14:25.247 --> 14:28.384
we systematically harvest the field.

14:28.384 --> 14:31.554
Sifting is when we sort out what we gathered,

14:31.554 --> 14:36.225
answering who, what, where, 
when, why, and how to get the facts.

14:36.225 --> 14:38.794
Baking is when we think

14:38.794 --> 14:41.830
—“turning up the heat” in our mind and heart—

14:41.830 --> 14:45.334
something no one else can do for you.

14:45.334 --> 14:50.105
The questions we ask 
can take our study to a spiritual plane.

14:51.073 --> 14:56.078
Most importantly, 
what does this teach me about Jehovah?

14:56.078 --> 14:59.181
How does it contribute to the Bible’s theme?

14:59.181 --> 15:03.519
And the bottom line: 
What is the lesson for me?

15:05.387 --> 15:08.824
Jehovah gave us a mind 
that is begging to learn.

15:08.824 --> 15:13.562
It is a gift with the capacity 
to cultivate thinking ability.

15:13.562 --> 15:17.099
When we make the effort 
to unearth gems from God’s Word,

15:17.099 --> 15:20.469
we find that study 
is rewarding and delightful.

15:20.469 --> 15:23.672
More importantly, our study skills enable us

15:23.672 --> 15:26.842
to keep a tight grip on the word of life.

15:26.842 --> 15:31.480
A tight grip on God’s Word 
will make our life better now

15:31.480 --> 15:34.550
and give us the opportunity 
to continue learning

15:34.550 --> 15:44.253
about our heavenly Father for all eternity.
