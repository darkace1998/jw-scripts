00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:02.852 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’d like to talk

00:00:02.852 --> 00:00:05.255 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about a very common expression

00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:06.656 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the Bible.

00:00:06.656 --> 00:00:08.358 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The expression is:

00:00:08.358 --> 00:00:10.527 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“I am with you.”

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:16.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thirteen times it’s attributed
to a statement from Jehovah.

00:00:16.332 --> 00:00:19.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Three times it’s something that Jesus said

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to one or more of his disciples.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, there are dozens of other times

00:00:26.176 --> 00:00:30.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the same sentiment
is expressed using similar wording.

00:00:31.715 --> 00:00:36.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Few things in the world
equal the joy humans experience

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:38.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the birth of a child.

00:00:38.588 --> 00:00:40.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As children grow up,

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:43.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are sometimes exposed to situations

00:00:43.993 --> 00:00:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that tend to cause nervousness

00:00:45.995 --> 00:00:48.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even fear.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So a parent may occasionally feel compelled

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:53.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reassure a child:

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Have no fear; I am with you.”

00:00:58.241 --> 00:01:02.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves his servants
as if they were his children.

00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:06.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, at John 13:1,

00:01:06.216 --> 00:01:10.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus’ feelings for his disciples
are well expressed.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says:

00:01:12.122 --> 00:01:16.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jesus, having loved his own
who were in the world,

00:01:16.326 --> 00:01:19.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
loved them to the end.”

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when we face fears,

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trials, or causes for anxiety,

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:28.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both our heavenly Father and his Son, Jesus,

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:32.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
reassuringly say, “I am with you.”

00:01:33.777 --> 00:01:36.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of the righteous man Noah.

00:01:36.513 --> 00:01:38.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Genesis 6:9 says

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “Noah walked with the true God.”

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:46.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s no doubt that Jehovah was with Noah.

00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:50.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He preserved him
and his family through the Flood.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Afterward,
Jehovah further proved he was with Noah.

00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:57.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In Genesis chapter 9, Jehovah said:

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:01.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘I am now establishing my covenant with you:

00:02:01.271 --> 00:02:04.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Never again will all flesh be destroyed

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by the waters of a flood.’

00:02:06.943 --> 00:02:09.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah could have made that determination

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and promised himself
that he wouldn’t do that again,

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but instead, he reached out to Noah

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:20.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reassured him that he was with him

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:25.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by making the rainbow covenant
with Noah and his offspring.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Using similar terminology,

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:33.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah indicated
that he was with Abraham,

00:02:33.136 --> 00:02:35.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaac, Jacob, Joseph,

00:02:35.205 --> 00:02:38.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Moses, Joshua, and Gideon.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were all individuals
whom Jehovah was pleased with,

00:02:43.012 --> 00:02:47.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so he reassured them that he was with them.

00:02:48.218 --> 00:02:50.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How about for a group of people?

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:53.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Jehovah moved to feel the same way

00:02:53.556 --> 00:02:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
toward a large crowd
of his servants collectively?

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please find with me Exodus 6:6, 7.

00:03:08.204 --> 00:03:10.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The whole nation of Israel

00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:12.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was experiencing severe trials

00:03:12.976 --> 00:03:16.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and suffering as slaves in Egypt.

00:03:16.412 --> 00:03:21.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice Jehovah’s reassurance
to the vast number of people.

00:03:21.117 --> 00:03:23.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Verses 6 and 7 state:

00:03:23.887 --> 00:03:27.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore, say to the Israelites:

00:03:27.824 --> 00:03:29.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘I am Jehovah,

00:03:29.826 --> 00:03:33.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I will bring you out
from under the burdens of the Egyptians

00:03:33.763 --> 00:03:37.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and rescue you from their slavery,

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and I will reclaim you
with an outstretched arm

00:03:40.603 --> 00:03:42.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and with great judgments.

00:03:42.672 --> 00:03:46.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘And I will take you in as my people,
and I will be your God,

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and you will certainly know
that I am Jehovah your God

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:54.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who is bringing you out
from under the burdens of Egypt.’”

00:03:54.017 --> 00:03:58.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that great, mixed group of people
would follow his leadings,

00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he said he’d ‘take them in’
and he ‘would be their God.’

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was he saying?

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:07.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was reassuring them:

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I will be with you,”

00:04:09.832 --> 00:04:11.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was.

00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:15.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For forty years in the wilderness,
he was with them

00:04:15.405 --> 00:04:18.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—feeding them, providing water for them,

00:04:18.474 --> 00:04:22.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
ensuring that their clothes
and sandals would not wear out,

00:04:22.946 --> 00:04:27.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
protecting them
from poisonous snakes, and so forth.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later, when entering the land of promise,

00:04:30.453 --> 00:04:33.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he protected them during enemy warfare.

00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:39.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promised to be with and to support

00:04:39.162 --> 00:04:41.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the kings of Israel

00:04:41.197 --> 00:04:44.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as long as they heeded
his commandments and direction.

00:04:45.768 --> 00:04:48.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Solomon was told:

00:04:48.304 --> 00:04:52.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah [your] God . . .
will not desert you or abandon you,

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:55.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he will be with you.”

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Asa was informed:

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:03.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is with you
as long as you remain with him.”

00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:09.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When faced with overwhelming enemy forces,

00:05:09.359 --> 00:05:11.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
King Jehoshaphat was told:

00:05:11.627 --> 00:05:16.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Tomorrow go out against them,
and Jehovah will be with you.”

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:21.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah also proved to be
with the many prophets

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:23.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he sent out in his name.

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:25.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just one example is Jeremiah.

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:30.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine if you had Jeremiah’s assignment.

00:05:30.513 --> 00:05:33.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suppose you had been directed to deliver

00:05:33.316 --> 00:05:36.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a scathing denunciation and judgment

00:05:36.519 --> 00:05:40.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
against wicked kings,
corrupt priests, and false prophets.

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:42.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you feel?

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:44.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
underqualified?

00:05:44.794 --> 00:05:47.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you feel like a little child

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:51.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
challenging a whole group of evil grown-ups?

00:05:52.335 --> 00:05:56.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Jeremiah felt
as he expressed himself

00:05:56.339 --> 00:06:01.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Jeremiah 1:6:

00:06:02.145 --> 00:06:05.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I said: ‘Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!

00:06:05.848 --> 00:06:10.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I do not know how to speak,
for I am just a boy.’”

00:06:11.387 --> 00:06:15.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were Jehovah’s reassuring words
in reply?

00:06:15.892 --> 00:06:18.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah 1:8, 9:

00:06:18.227 --> 00:06:20.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Do not be afraid

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:24.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘because of their appearance,
for “I am with you to save you,”

00:06:24.534 --> 00:06:26.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“declares Jehovah.’

00:06:26.202 --> 00:06:29.772 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then Jehovah stretched out his hand
and touched my mouth.

00:06:29.772 --> 00:06:34.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And Jehovah said to me: 
‘I have put my words in your mouth.’”

00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:40.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah put the words
that you were to say “in your mouth,”

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:43.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d no longer feel
like a little child, would you?

00:06:44.454 --> 00:06:49.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t think of Jeremiah
as being an incredible superman;

00:06:49.425 --> 00:06:51.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was a human like us.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:56.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s of interest that though Jeremiah
lived in another time and place,

00:06:56.999 --> 00:07:01.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he faced situations similar to those we face.

00:07:02.071 --> 00:07:04.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We interact with different types of people

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:09.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our daily life,
at work, and at school.

00:07:09.178 --> 00:07:12.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them can be intimidating.

00:07:12.081 --> 00:07:14.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And like Jeremiah,

00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:19.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has commissioned us
to go to strangers and preach.

00:07:19.088 --> 00:07:22.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We share the good news of the Kingdom.

00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:27.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are interested;
others are just plain apathetic.

00:07:27.296 --> 00:07:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at times, we may come
across someone who is angry

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may even be threatening.

00:07:34.103 --> 00:07:38.741 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is the time to remember Jeremiah.

00:07:38.741 --> 00:07:41.144 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Though initially timid,

00:07:41.144 --> 00:07:43.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he courageously faced

00:07:43.346 --> 00:07:47.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the challenge of an intimidating response.

00:07:47.483 --> 00:07:50.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he rally to the occasion?

00:07:50.853 --> 00:07:54.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was because Jehovah had reassured him:

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:57.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am with you.”

00:07:57.793 --> 00:08:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said:
“I have put my words in your mouth.”

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:08.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does Jehovah do something similar for us?

00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:09.405 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:08:09.405 --> 00:08:12.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Long after Jeremiah
and the other faithful ones

00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:17.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are recorded
in the Hebrew Scriptures came and went,

00:08:17.046 --> 00:08:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has proved to be
with true Christians,

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:22.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both past and present.

00:08:24.187 --> 00:08:27.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Find with me John chapter 8.

00:08:31.194 --> 00:08:33.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Think of Jesus.

00:08:33.196 --> 00:08:35.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true he was a perfect man,

00:08:35.531 --> 00:08:38.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but did Jehovah leave him all alone?

00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:42.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At John 8:16,
what did Jesus himself say?

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And yet even if I do judge,
my judgment is truthful,

00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:50.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because I am not alone,

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the Father who sent me is with me.”

00:08:54.217 --> 00:08:59.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We might be thinking
of that intimidating person in the ministry.

00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:04.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even if you are facing the person
without a fellow Witness standing beside you,

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:07.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are you really all alone?

00:09:07.997 --> 00:09:11.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew that at the most stressful

00:09:11.567 --> 00:09:14.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and emotionally draining time

00:09:14.103 --> 00:09:16.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during his human life,

00:09:16.138 --> 00:09:19.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his disciples would leave him all alone.

00:09:19.909 --> 00:09:23.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But was he really alone?

00:09:23.045 --> 00:09:26.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read the inspired account

00:09:26.182 --> 00:09:28.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 16:32.

00:09:28.451 --> 00:09:31.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, these are Jesus’ own words:

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:35.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Look! The hour is coming,
indeed, it has come,

00:09:35.424 --> 00:09:39.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when each one of you
will be scattered to his own house

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:41.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will leave me alone.

00:09:41.697 --> 00:09:44.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I am not alone,

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:47.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the Father is with me.”

00:09:47.336 --> 00:09:51.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was not alone
during his most anxious moments.

00:09:51.907 --> 00:09:54.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah was with him.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you think you are alone

00:09:57.246 --> 00:10:00.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standing at the door
of an irritated householder,

00:10:00.583 --> 00:10:02.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
think again.

00:10:02.585 --> 00:10:04.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:10:04.754 --> 00:10:06.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have more with you

00:10:06.822 --> 00:10:09.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than if you had your whole congregation

00:10:09.992 --> 00:10:13.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
standing in the person’s front yard.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:17.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, why did Jesus share

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this precious insight with us?

00:10:20.503 --> 00:10:22.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look at the next verse.

00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:26.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus explains his reason
for saying what he did.

00:10:26.876 --> 00:10:29.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 16:33:

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have said these things to you

00:10:32.381 --> 00:10:35.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so that by means of me you may have peace.

00:10:35.484 --> 00:10:38.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In the world you will have tribulation,

00:10:38.454 --> 00:10:40.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but take courage!

00:10:40.456 --> 00:10:42.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have conquered the world.”

00:10:43.125 --> 00:10:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Jesus for addressing

00:10:45.628 --> 00:10:49.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our fears and concerns when giving a witness.

00:10:49.532 --> 00:10:52.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of trembling with fear,

00:10:52.168 --> 00:10:55.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he shared his confidence in Jehovah’s support

00:10:55.638 --> 00:10:58.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that we “may have peace.”

00:10:58.641 --> 00:11:02.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He acknowledged
that we would face tribulation,

00:11:02.211 --> 00:11:05.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he said
that we could look at his example

00:11:05.281 --> 00:11:08.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and have courage
to deal with the tribulation.

00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:10.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said in verse 32

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:16.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was
because ‘the Father was with him.’

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:20.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you recall that Jehovah told Jeremiah:

00:11:20.663 --> 00:11:23.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have put my words in your mouth?”

00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:27.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can Jehovah do the same for us

00:11:27.036 --> 00:11:31.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are opposed by unbelievers?

00:11:31.273 --> 00:11:35.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Christian Greek Scriptures
answer with a resounding yes!

00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:39.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please follow along with the reading

00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:43.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the book of Mark chapter 13,

00:11:44.387 --> 00:11:48.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and please notice
that the setting Jesus describes

00:11:48.491 --> 00:11:51.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is in the ministry,
preaching the good news.

00:11:53.062 --> 00:11:56.165 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you’ve had a good morning in service,

00:11:56.165 --> 00:11:59.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then you take one more door.

00:11:59.001 --> 00:12:03.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The person is irate
and even calls the police.

00:12:03.172 --> 00:12:05.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What should you do?

00:12:05.374 --> 00:12:09.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will you say when the police arrive?

00:12:09.578 --> 00:12:13.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You don’t have to be overly concerned.

00:12:13.182 --> 00:12:14.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because similar to Jeremiah,

00:12:17.586 --> 00:12:22.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will, in effect,
put His words in your mouth.

00:12:22.458 --> 00:12:27.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark 13:10, 11 says:

00:12:27.096 --> 00:12:32.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Also, in all the nations,
the good news has to be preached first.

00:12:32.101 --> 00:12:36.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And when they are taking you
to hand you over,

00:12:36.705 --> 00:12:40.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“do not be anxious beforehand
about what to say;

00:12:40.943 --> 00:12:44.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“but whatever is given you
in that hour, say this,

00:12:44.814 --> 00:12:48.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for you are not the ones speaking,

00:12:48.717 --> 00:12:51.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the holy spirit is.”

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By this, do we mean that Jehovah

00:12:54.156 --> 00:12:58.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will miraculously put words
in your mouth for you to say?

00:12:59.962 --> 00:13:01.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not necessarily.

00:13:01.964 --> 00:13:04.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice verse 11 said

00:13:04.066 --> 00:13:08.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the holy spirit” is the one speaking?

00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:13.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve been taught the basis
for your faith from the Scriptures,

00:13:13.909 --> 00:13:18.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you know the reason
that you teach the Bible’s message.

00:13:18.347 --> 00:13:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s all stored in your mind.

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:24.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the holy spirit’s role

00:13:24.987 --> 00:13:28.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are in an intimidating situation

00:13:28.257 --> 00:13:30.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when sharing the good news?

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is with you.

00:13:34.497 --> 00:13:38.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He uses his holy spirit
to bring to the surface

00:13:38.133 --> 00:13:43.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of those precious gems
that might be buried in your mind.

00:13:43.138 --> 00:13:46.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You may be amazed at what you remember

00:13:46.909 --> 00:13:49.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when put under pressure by the authorities

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:53.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even by outright opposers.

00:13:53.482 --> 00:13:56.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way, Jehovah is with you.

00:13:57.786 --> 00:14:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Add to the fact that Jesus is with you
in the disciple-making work.

00:14:04.426 --> 00:14:09.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s be reminded
of this very encouraging thought

00:14:09.431 --> 00:14:14.136 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Matthew 28:19, 20.

00:14:14.136 --> 00:14:17.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was discussing our commission

00:14:17.206 --> 00:14:20.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to preach, teach, and make disciples.

00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how does he conclude
the Bible book of Matthew?

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:28.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read Matthew 28:19, 20:

00:14:29.952 --> 00:14:34.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Go, therefore, and make disciples
of people of all the nations,

00:14:34.957 --> 00:14:37.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:14:37.993 --> 00:14:40.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and of the Son and of the holy spirit,

00:14:40.930 --> 00:14:45.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“teaching them to observe
all the things I have commanded you.

00:14:45.601 --> 00:14:48.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And look!
I am with you all the days

00:14:48.871 --> 00:14:52.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the conclusion
of the system of things.”

00:14:52.741 --> 00:14:56.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that he is with us now

00:14:56.245 --> 00:15:00.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we are making disciples
and teaching people the truth.

00:15:00.449 --> 00:15:05.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he promises
he’ll support us in this important work

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:08.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the end
of this wicked system of things.

00:15:09.592 --> 00:15:14.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As prophesied, during this time
of the conclusion of the system,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:19.234 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are being persecuted
in different areas of the world.

00:15:19.234 --> 00:15:23.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the Scriptures show,
Satan and his angels

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:26.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are “misleading the entire inhabited earth.”

00:15:26.809 --> 00:15:31.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Recently, Jehovah’s people
have been persecuted in Russia.

00:15:31.313 --> 00:15:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But will the persecution

00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
succeed in eliminating

00:15:35.718 --> 00:15:38.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
true worship in that area of the world?

00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:40.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:15:40.322 --> 00:15:41.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

00:15:41.824 --> 00:15:45.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s because Jehovah is with them.

00:15:45.628 --> 00:15:49.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He and Jesus promised: “I am with you.”

00:15:51.033 --> 00:15:53.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Russia did not learn from the past.

00:15:53.669 --> 00:15:56.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It will prove to be the same for them

00:15:56.171 --> 00:15:59.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it was for Nazi Germany under Hitler.

00:15:59.775 --> 00:16:01.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hitler thought his regime

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:05.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could eradicate
true worship and God’s people

00:16:05.114 --> 00:16:07.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from areas under their control.

00:16:07.116 --> 00:16:09.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they made a big mistake.

While it is true
that they murdered some 2,000 brothers,

00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:17.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the end, their scheme ended up in failure.

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:19.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:16:19.194 --> 00:16:23.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because God was with us, not with them.

00:16:25.434 --> 00:16:27.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“God with us”

00:16:27.503 --> 00:16:30.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those words have decorated national emblems

00:16:30.973 --> 00:16:34.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the uniforms of soldiers of Prussia

and the Czarist Russian Empire.

These words were also
on the belts of German troops

00:16:40.883 --> 00:16:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they marched into Belgium
in the year 1914 of our Common Era.

But they had it wrong!

00:16:48.223 --> 00:16:53.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Sovereign Lord Jehovah
was with us, not with them.

00:16:53.228 --> 00:16:56.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s with all of us now.

00:16:56.432 --> 00:16:59.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be with us during Armageddon.

00:16:59.134 --> 00:17:01.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be with us after Armageddon.

of the Thousand Year Reign of Christ.

He’ll be with mankind
at the end of 100,000 years.

00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:15.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’ll be with humans
at the end of 100 million years

00:17:15.484 --> 00:17:20.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the end of 100 million years
times 100 million years.

00:17:21.056 --> 00:17:24.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah will be with mankind <i>forever,</i>

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and so will Jesus!

00:17:26.762 --> 00:17:29.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are both on record as saying:

00:17:29.164 --> 00:17:31.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I am with you”!
