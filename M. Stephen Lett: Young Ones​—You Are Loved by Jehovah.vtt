00:01.017 --> 00:04.187
I want to address the theme 


00:04.187 --> 00:08.725
“Young Ones—You Are Loved by Jehovah” 


00:08.725 --> 00:10.927
and his organization. 


00:10.927 --> 00:14.664
“Young Ones—You Are Loved by Jehovah” 


00:14.663 --> 00:16.933
and his organization. 


00:16.933 --> 00:20.170
But now, 
when we say young ones, 


00:20.170 --> 00:22.972
to whom are we referring? 


00:22.972 --> 00:26.109
As evidence of Jehovah’s love, 


00:26.108 --> 00:29.178
some may immediately think 
of the animated series 


00:29.178 --> 00:32.948
of videos entitled 
Become Jehovah’s Friend, 


00:32.948 --> 00:36.585
featuring Caleb and Sophia, 


00:36.585 --> 00:38.922
and that has indeed been evidence 


00:38.922 --> 00:42.992
of Jehovah’s 
and the Governing Body’s love 


00:42.992 --> 00:45.329
for little children. 


00:45.328 --> 00:49.531
We have gotten hundreds of letters 
of appreciation for this series 


00:49.532 --> 00:52.669
from small children 
and their parents, 


00:52.668 --> 00:55.538
and even from grandparents.


00:55.538 --> 00:58.408
But what about you teenagers? 


00:58.408 --> 01:02.878
You too are still young 
when compared to adulthood, 


01:02.878 --> 01:05.615
and you are appreciated very much 


01:05.615 --> 01:09.085
when you show your respect 
and love for Jehovah. 


01:09.085 --> 01:11.487
Does the Bible indicate anything 


01:11.487 --> 01:15.359
about Jesus’ disposition 
as a teenager? 


01:15.358 --> 01:20.163
There are comments 
about him as an infant. 


01:20.163 --> 01:23.566
Also in the book of Luke, 
it describes Jesus 


01:23.567 --> 01:25.969
as a child of 12 years old. 


01:25.968 --> 01:29.671
Let’s look at that account 
and determine 


01:29.672 --> 01:32.742
if it also includes 
any comments 


01:32.742 --> 01:36.000
about Jesus’ attitude 
as a teenager.


01:37.280 --> 01:41.217
In Luke 2:42 


01:41.217 --> 01:45.622
it describes Jesus as a preteen 


01:45.622 --> 01:48.000
in saying this, 


01:49.492 --> 01:51.829
Luke 2:42: 


01:51.828 --> 01:55.231
“And when he was 12 years old, 


01:55.232 --> 01:58.702
“they went up 
according to the custom of the festival. 


01:58.702 --> 02:01.972
“When the days 
of the festival were over 


02:01.972 --> 02:03.974
“and they were returning, 


02:03.973 --> 02:08.443
“the boy Jesus 
remained behind in Jerusalem, 


02:08.443 --> 02:12.048
and his parents did not notice it.” 


02:12.048 --> 02:15.918
So his parents 
went looking for him 


02:15.918 --> 02:18.000
and finally found him 
three days later. 


02:19.655 --> 02:24.393
What was Jesus 
focused on as a 12-year-old? 


02:24.393 --> 02:28.998
He was sitting in the temple 
talking with the teachers about Jehovah. 


02:28.998 --> 02:31.400
Notice verse 47: 


02:31.400 --> 02:34.870
“But all those listening to him 


02:34.870 --> 02:39.442
“were in constant amazement 
at his understanding 


02:39.442 --> 02:41.777
and his answers.” 


02:41.777 --> 02:44.480
What a good example 
for you children 


02:44.480 --> 02:47.017
12 years of age and younger 


02:47.017 --> 02:51.220
to talk about Jehovah 
with confidence!


02:51.220 --> 02:56.000
But what was Jesus’ attitude 
like as a teenager? 


02:57.093 --> 03:02.331
Please follow along 
in verses 51 and 52: 


03:02.332 --> 03:06.802
“Then he [Jesus] 
went down with them 


03:06.802 --> 03:09.672
“and returned to Nazareth, 


03:09.672 --> 03:13.075
and he continued subject to them,” 


03:13.075 --> 03:16.545
that is to his parents. 


03:16.545 --> 03:20.217
How old was he? 
Twelve. 


03:20.217 --> 03:23.820
But what comes after 12? 
Thirteen. 


03:23.820 --> 03:26.622
Notice verse 52: 


03:26.622 --> 03:30.694
“And Jesus went on progressing.” 


03:30.693 --> 03:34.696
You see, after 12, 
he “went on progressing 


03:34.697 --> 03:38.234
“in wisdom and in physical growth 


03:38.233 --> 03:42.000
and in favor with God and men.” 


03:43.105 --> 03:46.508
Evidently, then, 
Jesus was an intelligent, 


03:46.508 --> 03:50.178
well-balanced teenager. 


03:50.178 --> 03:54.183
But who took note 
of his progress as a teen? 


03:54.183 --> 03:57.453
It said: “God and men.” 


03:57.453 --> 04:00.723
Yes, godly children and teenagers 


04:00.723 --> 04:05.328
are appreciated by Jehovah 
and by spiritual men. 


04:05.328 --> 04:09.398
Jehovah and his organization 
love all you young ones 


04:09.398 --> 04:12.468
who are striving 
to do what is right.


04:12.468 --> 04:17.473
But how do we know 
that Jehovah loves all of you? 


04:17.473 --> 04:22.478
Well, if you have your Bible, 
turn to Matthew chapter 19, 


04:22.478 --> 04:26.215
and here we see 
that Jesus showed 


04:26.215 --> 04:30.218
his high regard 
for young ones. 


04:30.218 --> 04:36.625
So Matthew chapter 19, 
notice verses 13 and 14: 


04:36.625 --> 04:39.995
“Then young children 
were brought to him 


04:39.995 --> 04:44.533
“for him to place his hands 
on them and offer prayer, 


04:44.533 --> 04:48.638
but the disciples 
reprimanded them.” 


04:48.638 --> 04:52.708
They did not want 
the young ones to bother Jesus. 


04:52.708 --> 04:55.611
But notice verse 14: 


04:55.612 --> 04:57.814
“Jesus, however, said: 


04:57.813 --> 05:01.516
“‘Let the young children alone, 


05:01.517 --> 05:05.187
“‘and do not try to stop them 
from coming to me, 


05:05.187 --> 05:10.000
for the Kingdom of the heavens 
belongs to such ones.’” 


05:11.027 --> 05:14.230
Yes, Jesus welcomed young ones, 


05:14.230 --> 05:16.632
and the Bible tells us that Jesus 


05:16.632 --> 05:19.602
is the perfect reflection of Jehovah. 


05:19.602 --> 05:24.074
So Jesus was imitating 
Jehovah’s love for young ones. 


05:24.073 --> 05:28.878
After many wise sayings 
and performing miracles, 


05:28.878 --> 05:31.813
Matthew chapter 21 describes Jesus 


05:31.813 --> 05:36.018
riding into Jerusalem 
as Jehovah’s anointed one.


05:36.018 --> 05:40.155
Please notice the difference 
between some of the adult’s reactions 


05:40.155 --> 05:42.492
and that of appreciative young ones. 


05:42.492 --> 05:46.529
Matthew 21:15 


05:46.528 --> 05:48.931
tells us this: 


05:48.932 --> 05:52.535
“When the chief priests 
and the scribes 


05:52.535 --> 05:55.705
“saw the marvelous things he did 


05:55.705 --> 05:58.775
“and the boys 
who were shouting in the temple, 


05:58.775 --> 06:01.910
“‘Save, we pray, the Son of David!’ 


06:01.910 --> 06:04.000
they became indignant.” 


06:05.347 --> 06:08.284
Who was boldly praising Jesus? 


06:08.283 --> 06:11.020
The scripture said that “the boys” 


06:11.020 --> 06:13.757
were shouting out praise. 


06:13.757 --> 06:16.559
What a contrast those young ones were 


06:16.558 --> 06:21.763
to the religious leaders 
who were irritated by all of this. 


06:21.763 --> 06:25.968
Young people, when you speak up 
about Jehovah and Jesus, 


06:25.968 --> 06:28.636
they both take notice of you. 


06:28.637 --> 06:32.000
They are proud 
of your stand for the truth! 


06:33.075 --> 06:35.812
But how do you know 
that the Governing Body


06:35.812 --> 06:38.749
and the organization loves you? 


06:38.748 --> 06:40.883
Well, they have published 
many books 


06:40.883 --> 06:44.000
and magazine articles 
specifically for young ones. 


06:45.522 --> 06:49.459
In addition to all 
of the printed material, there are 


06:49.458 --> 06:53.000
the Become Jehovah’s Friend videos
for children. 


06:54.130 --> 06:57.533
But, you teenagers, 
have you been keeping up 


06:57.533 --> 07:00.870
with all of the information 
specifically for you 


07:00.870 --> 07:03.405
on jw.org? 


07:03.405 --> 07:06.742
There are dozens of printed articles 


07:06.742 --> 07:09.279
on an array of subjects 


07:09.278 --> 07:12.281
that interest those of your age. 


07:12.282 --> 07:17.220
In so many ways, Jehovah 
and his organization show their love 


07:17.220 --> 07:22.000
and appreciation 
for all you dear young ones.


07:24.627 --> 07:27.497
What can you young ones 
do in return? 


07:27.497 --> 07:32.235
You may say, ‘I go to all the meetings 
and out in service.’ 


07:32.235 --> 07:34.303
Well, that is wonderful. 


07:34.303 --> 07:37.773
Some of you may have even joined 


07:37.773 --> 07:40.643
the Theocratic Ministry School already, 


07:40.643 --> 07:43.778
and you help clean 
and maintain the Kingdom Hall. 


07:43.778 --> 07:48.716
We warmly commend you 
for your good works.


07:48.717 --> 07:52.322
But if you think about it, 
even more important 


07:52.322 --> 07:56.325
is having a good personal relationship 
with Jehovah. 


07:56.325 --> 08:01.330
In Luke 10:27 it says: 


08:01.330 --> 08:04.767
“You must love Jehovah your God 


08:04.767 --> 08:09.372
“with your whole heart 
and with your whole soul 


08:09.372 --> 08:13.000
and with your whole strength 
and with your whole mind.” 


08:14.977 --> 08:17.780
To love Jehovah 
with your whole heart 


08:17.780 --> 08:22.252
means that you have 
a good personal relationship with him. 


08:22.252 --> 08:25.589
That involves 
more than just doing good things. 


08:25.588 --> 08:27.790
It involves praying to him 


08:27.790 --> 08:31.660
about what is in your heart. 


08:31.660 --> 08:36.000
Tell him everything you love 
and whatever you fear. 


08:37.433 --> 08:41.170
You can tell Jehovah 
very personal things; 


08:41.170 --> 08:44.240
he is not going 
to tell anyone else. 


08:44.240 --> 08:47.977
But he can give you 
the strength and wisdom 


08:47.977 --> 08:52.114
to handle matters 
for the best possible outcome.


08:52.113 --> 08:55.383
Set up your own 
personal Bible study program 


08:55.383 --> 08:58.386
in addition 
to Family Worship evening. 


08:58.387 --> 09:01.990
This is how Jehovah 
communicates back to you, 


09:01.990 --> 09:06.995
and your relationship with him 
will be strengthened. 


09:06.995 --> 09:11.000
You are the next generation 
of adults in Jehovah’s organization. 


09:12.802 --> 09:16.539
We continue to need 
spiritually qualified ones 


09:16.538 --> 09:19.541
to get Jehovah’s work done. 


09:19.542 --> 09:24.347
A good relationship with Jehovah 
as a youth sets you up 


09:24.347 --> 09:29.352
for the best way of life 
as a responsible adult. 


09:29.352 --> 09:33.622
Along the way, though, 
you will face pressure 


09:33.622 --> 09:37.894
from Satan’s system 
that can test your faith. 


09:37.893 --> 09:41.863
But by loving Jehovah 
with your whole heart, 


09:41.863 --> 09:45.968
you can get through 
any test you may encounter, 


09:45.968 --> 10:01.635
and I mean any test 
that you may encounter!
