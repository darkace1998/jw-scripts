00:01.017 --> 00:03.654
I would like to talk about a valuable asset 


00:03.653 --> 00:05.655
that every one of us possesses 


00:05.655 --> 00:07.657
—time. 


00:07.657 --> 00:09.825
It certainly is something 
that is on our minds 


00:09.825 --> 00:12.162
as we go about our day’s activities. 


00:12.162 --> 00:15.965
Just think of how often 
you look at a clock, your watch, 


00:15.965 --> 00:18.735
or your cell phone to check the time. 


00:18.735 --> 00:20.737
Why do we do that? 


00:20.737 --> 00:24.040
Probably to see 
if we are ahead of time, on time, 


00:24.040 --> 00:26.810
behind time, or out of time!


00:26.810 --> 00:29.845
But what exactly is time? 


00:29.845 --> 00:34.850
One dictionary says 
it is “a nonspatial continuum.” 


00:34.850 --> 00:38.555
Another says 
it is “the thing that is measured 


00:38.555 --> 00:43.358
as seconds, minutes, 
hours, days, and years.” 


00:43.358 --> 00:48.363
To explain exactly what time is 
in simple terms is nearly impossible, 


00:48.363 --> 00:51.066
and the Bible does not define it, 


00:51.067 --> 00:53.437
which may suggest that Jehovah knows 


00:53.437 --> 00:57.107
it is beyond our ability to understand fully.


00:57.107 --> 01:00.277
But the Bible does discuss time. 


01:00.277 --> 01:03.680
It shows that Jehovah is very time conscious. 


01:03.680 --> 01:07.483
It speaks of time 
as something that we should use wisely. 


01:07.483 --> 01:11.620
And it gives us 
the amazing hope of living into infinity


01:11.620 --> 01:14.557
—that is, endless time.


01:14.557 --> 01:16.894
We do know this about time: 


01:16.893 --> 01:19.695
Every human has exactly the same number 


01:19.695 --> 01:22.132
of hours and minutes in each day. 


01:22.132 --> 01:24.634
Rich people cannot buy more hours, 


01:24.633 --> 01:27.836
and scientists cannot invent new minutes. 


01:27.837 --> 01:31.240
We can never recoup 
the time we have wasted; 


01:31.240 --> 01:34.877
neither can we save it 
to spend on another day. 


01:34.877 --> 01:38.815
Just think, we have exactly 
the same number of hours 


01:38.815 --> 01:42.852
to use each day that Jesus Christ 
had when he was on the earth! 


01:42.852 --> 01:47.557
And we can be sure 
that no human used his time more wisely 


01:47.557 --> 01:50.160
than did God’s Son. 


01:50.160 --> 01:52.162
It has been said that time 


01:52.162 --> 01:55.499
is the most valuable thing 
a human can spend. 


01:55.498 --> 01:58.968
And so it is up to us 
how we will use the time 


01:58.968 --> 02:01.570
that is at our disposal. 


02:01.570 --> 02:06.442
In this regard, there is a Bible principle 
that gives us good direction, 


02:06.442 --> 02:09.812
a principle that was shared 
with us by the apostle Paul 


02:09.812 --> 02:12.982
at Philippians 1:9, 10. 


02:12.982 --> 02:15.219
He wrote in verse 9: 


02:15.218 --> 02:18.386
“And this is what I continue praying,” 


02:18.387 --> 02:20.424
and in verse 10, 


02:20.423 --> 02:24.460
“that you may make sure 
of the more important things.” 


02:24.460 --> 02:26.795
Therefore, the theme of this month’s program 


02:26.795 --> 02:31.000
is “Make Time for 
‘the More Important Things.’”


02:32.102 --> 02:34.704
This presents us with a two-fold challenge. 


02:34.703 --> 02:37.373
First, we have to determine 


02:37.373 --> 02:40.976
what are the more important things of life. 


02:40.977 --> 02:44.847
In the scripture we just read, 
some Bible translations say 


02:44.847 --> 02:47.850
“have a sense of what is vital.” 


02:47.850 --> 02:52.055
So we must distinguish 
between activities that are merely trivial 


02:52.055 --> 02:55.258
and those that really matter.


02:55.258 --> 02:59.661
In addition to the obligation 
to work to support one’s family, 


02:59.662 --> 03:02.565
to care for necessary household chores, 


03:02.565 --> 03:05.902
and to look after one’s children 
or aging parents, 


03:05.902 --> 03:09.905
we have many important things 
of a spiritual nature 


03:09.905 --> 03:12.208
that deserve our full attention: 


03:12.208 --> 03:15.211
reading and meditating on God’s Word, 


03:15.212 --> 03:18.549
studying the Bible personally 
and in family worship, 


03:18.548 --> 03:22.218
preparing for and attending 
congregation meetings, 


03:22.218 --> 03:26.088
caring for any responsibilities 
that we have in the congregation, 


03:26.088 --> 03:30.326
and participating in the Christian ministry. 


03:30.327 --> 03:34.830
Besides all of that, 
who does not want some time to rest, 


03:34.830 --> 03:37.900
to exercise, to work in the garden, 


03:37.900 --> 03:40.035
to enjoy some recreation, 


03:40.035 --> 03:43.707
or to visit with family and friends?


03:43.707 --> 03:48.679
Have you ever felt that you did not have 
enough time to do all those things


03:48.678 --> 03:52.381
—that you have difficulty 
fitting all the spiritual activities 


03:52.382 --> 03:54.884
into your busy life? 


03:54.883 --> 03:59.821
As much as we might like to, 
we cannot add an extra hour to our day 


03:59.822 --> 04:03.894
or another day to our week 
to accomplish more things. 


04:03.893 --> 04:06.861
So we have to be selective 


04:06.862 --> 04:10.700
about how we spend 
the time that we have.


04:10.700 --> 04:12.768
We will get the most accomplished 


04:12.768 --> 04:17.273
if we prioritize 
the things that really matter. 


04:17.273 --> 04:19.475
And what does that mean? 


04:19.475 --> 04:22.478
To prioritize means to decide 


04:22.478 --> 04:26.315
which tasks are more important 
and to do them first. 


04:26.315 --> 04:29.818
In other words, 
decide what must be given attention 


04:29.818 --> 04:32.000
prior to other things.


04:33.255 --> 04:36.192
There is a Bible proverb 
that nicely illustrates 


04:36.192 --> 04:40.664
the importance 
of prioritizing life’s activities. 


04:40.663 --> 04:43.900
Proverbs 12:11 states: 


04:43.900 --> 04:46.768
“The one who cultivates his land 


04:46.768 --> 04:49.038
“will be satisfied with food, 


04:49.038 --> 04:51.573
“but the one pursuing worthless things 


04:51.573 --> 04:54.410
is lacking good sense.” 


04:54.410 --> 04:57.213
What a clear warning that is for a farmer 


04:57.213 --> 05:00.316
not to fill up his day 
with worthless endeavors 


05:00.317 --> 05:05.000
and waste the precious time that he 
should be spending working in his field!


05:06.122 --> 05:10.627
Likewise, a Christian 
who diligently cultivates his spirituality 


05:10.627 --> 05:13.629
can be confident of Jehovah’s blessing, 


05:13.628 --> 05:17.466
whereas a person 
who is distracted by worthless activities 


05:17.467 --> 05:20.970
puts his relationship with God in danger. 


05:20.970 --> 05:23.472
How can we avoid that? 


05:23.472 --> 05:27.944
By not taking valuable time 
away from spiritual pursuits 


05:27.943 --> 05:30.346
to spend on the things that distract us 


05:30.347 --> 05:33.000
from serving Jehovah whole-souled.


05:34.015 --> 05:38.387
For example, when it comes 
to communicating with others, 


05:38.387 --> 05:40.724
what should take priority? 


05:40.723 --> 05:44.493
Starting our day 
by giving Jehovah praise and thanks 


05:44.493 --> 05:46.895
in prayer for another day of life 


05:46.895 --> 05:49.298
or telephoning an old friend to catch up 


05:49.298 --> 05:52.135
on the latest news in his or her life? 


05:52.135 --> 05:55.203
There’s nothing wrong 
with talking to a friend. 


05:55.203 --> 05:57.406
But we need to make sure we take the time 


05:57.407 --> 06:00.644
to talk to our very best Friend, Jehovah. 


06:00.643 --> 06:04.946
Obviously, it is more important 
to communicate with our heavenly Father, 


06:04.947 --> 06:08.000
so praying to him should be a priority.


06:09.685 --> 06:13.857
The apostle Paul had more 
to say about time management. 


06:13.857 --> 06:18.394
At Ephesians 5:15-17, he wrote: 


06:18.393 --> 06:21.730
“So keep strict watch that how you walk 


06:21.730 --> 06:24.567
“is not as unwise but as wise persons, 


06:24.567 --> 06:27.170
“making the best use of your time, 


06:27.170 --> 06:29.705
“because the days are wicked. 


06:29.705 --> 06:32.575
“On this account stop being unreasonable, 


06:32.575 --> 06:34.577
“but keep perceiving what 


06:34.577 --> 06:37.514
the will of Jehovah is.”


06:37.513 --> 06:40.483
Now we can address 
the second part of our challenge: 


06:40.483 --> 06:43.051
to make ample time to care 


06:43.052 --> 06:45.855
for the more important things of life. 


06:45.855 --> 06:47.890
What does Paul’s counsel 


06:47.890 --> 06:52.362
to ‘make the best use of your time’ 
actually mean? 


06:52.362 --> 06:57.367
Literally, in Greek, 
it means to ‘buy out the appointed time.’ 


06:57.367 --> 07:02.372
That implies buying time 
at the expense of something else. 


07:02.372 --> 07:06.642
So it helps to analyze 
how our time is actually being spent 


07:06.642 --> 07:09.445
and to see what adjustments are needed 


07:09.445 --> 07:14.000
so that we can buy out, or make, 
time for the more important things.


07:15.752 --> 07:18.620
If we ‘perceive what the will of Jehovah is,’ 


07:18.620 --> 07:22.592
then we certainly will want 
to use as much time as possible 


07:22.592 --> 07:25.762
to forge an ever stronger 
relationship with him 


07:25.762 --> 07:28.000
and to share fully in sacred service. 


07:29.398 --> 07:34.000
Do you have definite periods set aside 
for the spiritual activities of life?


07:35.270 --> 07:38.607
For congregation meetings, 
the schedule is set for us. 


07:38.607 --> 07:41.610
We know exactly when 
our congregation meets 


07:41.610 --> 07:43.880
for its midweek 
and weekend meetings. 


07:43.880 --> 07:46.182
We just have to be sure 
that we do not let 


07:46.182 --> 07:49.585
anything else get 
in the way of our attending 


07:49.585 --> 07:51.987
because the meetings are a priority. 


07:51.987 --> 07:56.592
Hebrews 10:25 says ‘not to forsake’ them.


07:56.592 --> 07:58.594
For everything else


07:58.593 --> 08:01.563
—reading the Bible, 
preparing for meetings, 


08:01.563 --> 08:05.835
family worship, 
field service activity—


08:05.835 --> 08:08.203
we have to set our own schedule 


08:08.203 --> 08:13.641
and stick to it as part 
of a good spiritual routine.


08:13.642 --> 08:17.247
As an example, 
what does your family do 


08:17.247 --> 08:19.782
most Saturday mornings? 


08:19.782 --> 08:23.954
Many families have the routine 
of going in field service every Saturday. 


08:23.953 --> 08:27.990
Rarely is anything allowed 
to get in the way of that routine. 


08:27.990 --> 08:31.527
For them, 
Saturday morning is not the time 


08:31.527 --> 08:35.264
for music lessons, 
dance classes, cooking courses, 


08:35.263 --> 08:37.666
working out at the gym, 
or anything else


08:37.667 --> 08:40.000
—it is their time for field service.


08:41.403 --> 08:45.841
Having a routine like that 
makes life easier for everyone in the family. 


08:45.842 --> 08:48.177
No one has to wonder Friday night 


08:48.177 --> 08:50.814
what is going to happen Saturday morning. 


08:50.813 --> 08:53.348
The decision has already been made 


08:53.348 --> 08:56.185
to go out in the ministry that day. 


08:56.185 --> 08:58.955
Otherwise, 
if we leave it up to chance every week, 


08:58.955 --> 09:02.190
then it means 
that 52 times during the year 


09:02.190 --> 09:05.928
we have to decide 
whether to go in service on Saturday. 


09:05.928 --> 09:10.933
How much simpler it is 
to make the decision once and for all 


09:10.933 --> 09:13.903
that we will use 
that time slot for the ministry, 


09:13.903 --> 09:17.973
barring any serious, 
unforeseen circumstances. 


09:17.973 --> 09:20.480
Of course, 
given your family’s situation, 


09:20.480 --> 09:22.613
another day of the week may work better. 


09:22.613 --> 09:24.646
But you get the point. 


09:24.647 --> 09:29.085
Sharing regularly in the Christian ministry 
cannot be left up to chance. 


09:29.085 --> 09:31.113
At Mark 13:10, 


09:31.113 --> 09:34.563
Jesus prioritized the ministry when he said: 


09:34.563 --> 09:38.860
“The good news has to be preached first.” 


09:38.860 --> 09:43.815
So if spiritual matters are going 
to take precedence in our lives, 


09:43.815 --> 09:46.802
we first have to make them priorities, 


09:46.802 --> 09:48.814
and second, 


09:48.813 --> 09:53.108
make ample time 
to care for those priorities. 


09:53.108 --> 09:57.045
That means setting aside 
definite periods of time 


09:57.045 --> 09:59.315
to build up our spirituality 


09:59.315 --> 10:03.000
and to stay fully involved 
in our worship and service. 


10:04.620 --> 10:09.225
Ecclesiastes 3:1 reinforces this thought. 


10:09.225 --> 10:10.897
It states: 


10:10.897 --> 10:14.367
“There is an appointed time for everything, 


10:14.367 --> 10:18.067
a time for every activity under the heavens.” 


10:18.067 --> 10:21.470
We have to decide 
when that “appointed time” is 


10:21.470 --> 10:24.573
for each of our spiritual activities. 


10:24.573 --> 10:27.141
If we are having difficulty with this, 


10:27.142 --> 10:32.080
can we shorten the time 
we spend on hobbies, recreation, 


10:32.080 --> 10:35.050
sports, social networking 


10:35.050 --> 10:39.055
and devote that time 
to our Bible reading, family worship, 


10:39.055 --> 10:42.090
meeting preparation, or field ministry? 


10:42.090 --> 10:46.328
If we can, we will find it 
to be spiritually refreshing 


10:46.328 --> 10:48.930
and invigorating.


10:48.930 --> 10:51.713
This was the experience 
of a family man that I know 


10:51.713 --> 10:55.413
who began preparing better 
so as to participate each week 


10:55.413 --> 10:59.991
in the “Digging for Spiritual Gems” portion 
of the midweek meeting. 


10:59.992 --> 11:03.729
He made time on Sunday evenings for this. 


11:03.728 --> 11:06.831
All in his family 
and congregation have benefited 


11:06.832 --> 11:09.035
from the excellent points he has learned 


11:09.035 --> 11:11.937
as he does research 
on the assigned Bible reading, 


11:11.937 --> 11:14.000
and he feels good because of it. 


11:15.223 --> 11:18.293
One married couple decided to eliminate 


11:18.293 --> 11:21.030
some of their hobbies and personal projects. 


11:21.030 --> 11:23.632
They even packed them up 
and put them out of sight. 


11:23.632 --> 11:25.650
Why? 


11:25.650 --> 11:28.487
So as not to be distracted by those things. 


11:28.487 --> 11:34.910
They were nonessential activities 
that they decided they could do without.


11:34.910 --> 11:39.215
Likely, we could all benefit 
from taking inventory of our lives 


11:39.215 --> 11:42.418
and limiting any unnecessary activities 


11:42.418 --> 11:45.586
that may be interfering 
with our spiritual routine. 


11:45.587 --> 11:48.557
Imagine how rewarding that would be! 


11:48.557 --> 11:52.094
Just think, if we could buy out 
30 minutes each day 


11:52.093 --> 11:54.596
from doing something 
that is not essential, 


11:54.597 --> 11:56.732
that is about how much time it would take 


11:56.732 --> 12:00.780
to read the entire Bible in one year. 


12:00.780 --> 12:03.282
Or if we could buy out 
an extra hour or two 


12:03.282 --> 12:05.307
each week for the field ministry, 


12:05.307 --> 12:07.810
think of how much more 
we could accomplish 


12:07.810 --> 12:11.297
and how happy 
that would make God and Christ, 


12:11.297 --> 12:16.000
as they see us making time 
for the more important things!


12:17.213 --> 12:20.081
Now, why have we felt 
the need to spend this time 


12:20.082 --> 12:22.930
discussing how to manage time? 


12:22.930 --> 12:26.895
It is because of something else 
that the Bible tells us. 


12:26.895 --> 12:29.665
First Corinthians 7:29 says 


12:29.665 --> 12:32.400
that “the time left is reduced.” 


12:32.400 --> 12:34.403
That certainly is true of the time 


12:34.403 --> 12:37.906
that is left between now 
and the great tribulation! 


12:37.907 --> 12:40.709
This is not the time to neglect 


12:40.708 --> 12:43.211
the most important activity of all 


12:43.212 --> 12:52.339
—our worship of Jehovah.
