Our theme for this month’s program is

00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:07.824 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“You Are Precious to Jehovah.”

00:00:07.824 --> 00:00:09.359 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How vital it is

00:00:09.359 --> 00:00:11.728 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we remind ourselves of that!

00:00:11.728 --> 00:00:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:16.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s consider three reasons.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, Satan wants us to believe

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah doesn’t love us
or value our service.

00:00:22.572 --> 00:00:25.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wanted Job to believe that.

00:00:25.742 --> 00:00:30.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that was a lie in Job’s day,
and it’s still a lie today.

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:36.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second reason that we need
to be reminded that we’re precious to Jehovah

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:38.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is because of negative circumstances

00:00:38.722 --> 00:00:41.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or events that have taken place in our life.

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:46.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Severe illness,
advancing years, injustices,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
mistreatment,
a difficult family life, or other situations

00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:56.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may cause some brothers and sisters
to feel that they’re just not worth loving.

00:00:57.207 --> 00:01:00.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may question why Jehovah
allows those things to happen.

00:01:02.212 --> 00:01:06.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we need reminders
of how Jehovah feels about us

00:01:06.382 --> 00:01:11.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because our imperfection
can cause us to have negative thoughts.

00:01:11.387 --> 00:01:15.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some may still punish
themselves for past mistakes,

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:17.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
doubting that Jehovah has forgiven them

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or that he could ever love them.

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:24.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others wage a constant battle
against feelings of worthlessness.

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:27.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One Witness wrote:

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Satan has done an excellent job of making

00:01:30.573 --> 00:01:35.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“even those who love Jehovah
feel worthless and unlovable.

00:01:35.378 --> 00:01:38.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . I never felt worthy of Jehovah’s love,

00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:41.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“so I tried to do
more and more in his service

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as a way of earning that love.

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:46.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“. . . So no matter
how many hours I spent in the ministry,

00:01:46.523 --> 00:01:50.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or how many people I helped,
I felt it was not enough.

00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:53.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I saw only the lack in me.”

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:57.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One brother stated:

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I came from a family
that showed little love.

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:04.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I was belittled, teased, and laughed at.

00:02:04.541 --> 00:02:08.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“So, early in life I felt worthless.

00:02:08.511 --> 00:02:11.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I still carry
entrenched feelings from my past

00:02:11.714 --> 00:02:15.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that beat me down
when I experience calamity.

00:02:15.585 --> 00:02:18.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When I stopped serving
as a congregation elder,

00:02:18.588 --> 00:02:21.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I felt like a failure as usual

00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:25.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—to God, my family,
and my brothers in the congregation.”

00:02:27.831 --> 00:02:30.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you’ve experienced such feelings,

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:32.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’re not alone.

00:02:32.302 --> 00:02:36.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how can you
be assured of Jehovah’s interest?

00:02:36.372 --> 00:02:38.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s examine three lines of evidence

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:42.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that prove you’re precious to Jehovah.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, we’ll examine
Jehovah’s feelings for the nation of Israel.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we’ll reflect
on an event recorded in the Gospels.

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:55.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And third,
we’ll consider a modern-day example

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:58.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who was very precious to God.

00:03:00.163 --> 00:03:03.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the end of the 16th century B.C.E.,

00:03:03.132 --> 00:03:05.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
millions of Israelites
were enslaved in Egypt,

00:03:05.935 --> 00:03:08.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they were severely oppressed.

00:03:08.805 --> 00:03:13.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In their distress,
the Israelites cried out to Jehovah.

00:03:13.142 --> 00:03:15.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did he feel?

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:19.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Turn with me to Isaiah 63:9.

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The <i>A</i> portion reads:

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:24.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“During all their distress

00:03:24.654 --> 00:03:27.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was distressing to him.”

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice?

00:03:29.592 --> 00:03:32.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only did Jehovah see their troubles

00:03:32.328 --> 00:03:34.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but he felt for his people,

00:03:34.397 --> 00:03:37.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was moved to act in their behalf.

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 63:9 goes on to say:

00:03:41.871 --> 00:03:46.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“In his love and compassion
he repurchased them.”

00:03:47.243 --> 00:03:51.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah couldn’t see
their suffering or hear their outcries

00:03:51.114 --> 00:03:54.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without feeling for them
and doing something about it.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That may remind us of the loving concern

00:03:58.121 --> 00:04:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a mother has for her newborn child.

00:04:00.623 --> 00:04:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When that baby cries,

00:04:02.625 --> 00:04:04.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the mother takes notice

00:04:04.627 --> 00:04:06.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and she feels for her child.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:12.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, notice how
this is expressed at Isaiah 49:15.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It reads:

00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Can a woman forget her nursing child

00:04:18.007 --> 00:04:21.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or have no compassion
for the son of her womb?

00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:24.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Even if these women forget,

00:04:24.447 --> 00:04:27.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I would never forget you.”

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:33.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s hard to imagine a mother forgetting
to nourish and care for her nursing child.

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That baby is helpless

00:04:35.325 --> 00:04:39.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—day and night
it needs its mother’s attention.

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:41.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sad to say, however,

00:04:41.097 --> 00:04:44.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we hear at times
of such maternal neglect.

00:04:44.467 --> 00:04:48.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what did Jehovah say
to reassure the Israelites?

00:04:48.504 --> 00:04:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I would never forget you.”

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:56.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, the tender compassion
that Jehovah felt for his servants

00:04:56.813 --> 00:04:59.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was immeasurably stronger

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:03.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than one of the most tender
and natural feelings we can imagine

00:05:03.252 --> 00:05:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the compassion
a mother normally feels for her baby.

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:10.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s feelings for the Israelites

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:13.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are summed up
in another expression in the book of Isaiah.

00:05:13.763 --> 00:05:17.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please read with me Isaiah 43:4:

00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:22.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“For you became precious in my eyes,

00:05:22.739 --> 00:05:27.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were honored, and I have loved you.”

00:05:27.777 --> 00:05:31.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah clearly expressed
his feelings for his people.

00:05:32.815 --> 00:05:35.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As one of Jehovah’s servants,

00:05:35.084 --> 00:05:39.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can be sure
that he also loves you most tenderly.

00:05:39.455 --> 00:05:43.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what trials you’re facing now
or have endured in the past,

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you hurt, he hurts.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re far too precious to Jehovah
for him to forget you.

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers your past efforts,

00:05:57.907 --> 00:06:01.077 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he sees
your continuing efforts to please him.

00:06:02.578 --> 00:06:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice how Jehovah promises
to sustain and comfort his people

00:06:06.582 --> 00:06:11.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Isaiah 66:12, 13:

00:06:12.121 --> 00:06:15.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You will nurse and be carried on the hip,

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:19.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and you will be bounced on the knees.

00:06:19.228 --> 00:06:21.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As a mother comforts her son,

00:06:21.531 --> 00:06:24.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so I will keep comforting you.”

00:06:25.268 --> 00:06:28.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a heartwarming scene!

00:06:28.171 --> 00:06:31.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Imagine a loving mother
carrying a baby on her hip

00:06:31.307 --> 00:06:34.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or bouncing him on her knees.

00:06:34.277 --> 00:06:36.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this way,

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:39.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah touchingly illustrates the intensity

00:06:39.148 --> 00:06:42.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and tenderness of his love for you.

00:06:42.885 --> 00:06:45.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as Jehovah loved his people, Israel,

00:06:45.888 --> 00:06:50.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he likewise feels that you
are very precious and dear

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—never doubt that!

00:06:54.263 --> 00:06:56.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A second example
of how Jehovah feels

00:06:56.666 --> 00:07:00.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about his faithful servants
can be found in the Gospels.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:02.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s read what happened on one occasion

00:07:02.738 --> 00:07:05.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Jesus was at the temple in Jerusalem

00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:09.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Luke 21:1-4:

00:07:09.445 --> 00:07:11.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now as he looked up,

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“he saw the rich dropping their gifts

00:07:13.916 --> 00:07:16.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into the treasury chests.

00:07:16.319 --> 00:07:19.388 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then he saw a needy widow drop in

00:07:19.388 --> 00:07:23.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“two small coins of very little value,

00:07:23.459 --> 00:07:25.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and he said:

00:07:25.461 --> 00:07:28.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Truly I say to you that this poor widow

00:07:28.564 --> 00:07:31.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘put in more than they all did.

00:07:31.067 --> 00:07:33.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘For all of these put in gifts

00:07:33.069 --> 00:07:35.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘out of their surplus,

00:07:35.104 --> 00:07:37.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but she, out of her want

00:07:37.573 --> 00:07:40.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[or as the footnote says, “poverty”],

00:07:40.843 --> 00:07:45.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put in all the means of living she had.’”

The study note for verse 2

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the <i>New World Translation</i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures</i>

00:07:50.153 --> 00:07:53.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells us that the Greek word
for “needy” may describe

00:07:53.623 --> 00:07:57.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a person who lacks
the basic necessities of life

00:07:57.193 --> 00:08:00.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“or someone for whom
life is a great struggle.

00:08:00.596 --> 00:08:04.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the Christian Greek Scriptures,
it is used only here.”

00:08:05.535 --> 00:08:08.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just think about the widow’s circumstances.

00:08:08.704 --> 00:08:11.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not only had she experienced the grief

00:08:11.007 --> 00:08:13.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of losing her husband, her provider,

00:08:13.743 --> 00:08:16.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she also lived in a religious climate

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dominated by leaders who,

00:08:18.381 --> 00:08:21.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to Luke 20:47,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:24.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would “devour the houses of the widows”

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
rather than help such vulnerable ones.

00:08:27.857 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That widow was so poor
that her contribution to the temple

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:35.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was what a laborer
might earn in just a few minutes.

00:08:35.831 --> 00:08:39.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Life wasn’t easy for her.

00:08:39.202 --> 00:08:41.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, Jesus said that she

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:45.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“put in all the means of living she had.”

00:08:46.375 --> 00:08:50.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our publications have stated
that the coins the widow contributed

00:08:50.513 --> 00:08:53.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were likely two lepta.

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:57.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With eight lepta,
a person could buy two sparrows,

00:08:57.587 --> 00:09:01.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which were among the cheapest birds
used for food.

00:09:01.324 --> 00:09:04.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the widow had
only half the amount needed

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to buy one sparrow,

00:09:07.296 --> 00:09:09.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hardly enough for a single meal.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:12.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, both the widow and her contribution

00:09:12.235 --> 00:09:15.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were valuable to Jehovah.

00:09:15.104 --> 00:09:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said that her contribution was greater

00:09:18.274 --> 00:09:21.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the contributions of the rich.

00:09:21.143 --> 00:09:25.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When she put those two small coins
in the treasury chest,

00:09:25.147 --> 00:09:27.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would be mixed
with what the rich had put in.

00:09:27.683 --> 00:09:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To imperfect human eyes,
they might seem lost, buried.

00:09:32.555 --> 00:09:36.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, this precious widow
was the one Jesus singled out for praise.

00:09:36.726 --> 00:09:39.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the treasury workers
came across the coins,

00:09:39.795 --> 00:09:43.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they wouldn’t have known
how precious the coins and their donor

00:09:43.132 --> 00:09:45.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were to Jehovah.

00:09:45.334 --> 00:09:48.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But God’s view
was the one that really mattered,

00:09:48.304 --> 00:09:50.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not what other people thought

00:09:50.306 --> 00:09:54.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even how that dear widow viewed herself.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like that widow,

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you may find that circumstances limit

00:09:58.114 --> 00:10:01.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you can contribute to Jehovah.

00:10:01.284 --> 00:10:06.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Age, infirmities,
or other circumstances beyond your control

00:10:06.289 --> 00:10:10.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
may limit the amount of time
you’re able to spend in the ministry.

00:10:10.826 --> 00:10:13.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might feel
that your efforts are like those

00:10:13.396 --> 00:10:18.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“two small coins of very little value.”

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, we learn from this account
of the needy widow

00:10:21.704 --> 00:10:26.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah notices
and he treasures each act done for him,

00:10:26.709 --> 00:10:30.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when we do it
despite difficult circumstances.

00:10:31.981 --> 00:10:36.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For a moment, think back on your worship
of Jehovah during the past year.

00:10:37.687 --> 00:10:41.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of you may feel
that you accomplished little.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:43.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your imperfect heart
might cause you to wonder

00:10:43.592 --> 00:10:47.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether Jehovah
was pleased with your efforts.

00:10:47.129 --> 00:10:50.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, did one of the hours you spent

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:53.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
require a special sacrifice on your part?

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:56.639 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If Jehovah took notice of the widow

00:10:56.639 --> 00:11:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
dropping in those two coins
and valued her contribution,

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
don’t you think he also noticed

00:11:03.579 --> 00:11:06.582 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and valued what you did
for him during that hour?

00:11:07.817 --> 00:11:11.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah values every gift,
no matter how small,

00:11:11.454 --> 00:11:14.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that springs from a heart motivated by love.

00:11:14.857 --> 00:11:17.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers, and he’ll reward

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:22.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the smallest contribution
given in support of his Kingdom.

00:11:22.198 --> 00:11:25.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s proof of how Jehovah feels about you.

00:11:27.737 --> 00:11:30.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, let’s consider a modern-day example

00:11:30.573 --> 00:11:34.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of one who was very precious to Jehovah.

00:11:34.076 --> 00:11:37.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the experience of Sister Areti Pina.

00:11:37.246 --> 00:11:40.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina lived
on the southern coast of Albania

00:11:40.916 --> 00:11:42.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the town of Vlorë.

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:47.189 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was baptized in 1928 at the age of 18.

00:11:47.189 --> 00:11:51.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was a strong congregation 
in Vlorë in the 1930’s,

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:53.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sister Pina was a zealous evangelizer

00:11:53.996 --> 00:11:56.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who climbed up and down rugged mountains,

00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:59.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preaching with her Bible in hand.

00:11:59.668 --> 00:12:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, a congregation
no longer existed in Vlorë,

00:12:03.406 --> 00:12:06.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Sister Pina lost contact
with the brothers.

00:12:06.909 --> 00:12:10.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, she kept preaching faithfully
on her own.

00:12:10.813 --> 00:12:14.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think her efforts
went unnoticed by Jehovah?

00:12:14.216 --> 00:12:17.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, years later, word reached the brothers

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:19.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there was an old, senile woman

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:22.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who was reportedly preaching in Vlorë.

00:12:22.758 --> 00:12:25.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
People thought she was crazy
for keeping faith in God

00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during years of totalitarian rule.

00:12:29.098 --> 00:12:33.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, Sister Pina, now in her 80’s,
was anything but senile.

00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:37.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the brothers arrived at her home,

00:12:37.273 --> 00:12:39.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina invited them in,

00:12:39.608 --> 00:12:42.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but she seemed somewhat reserved.

00:12:42.511 --> 00:12:45.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they explained
that they were her spiritual brothers,

00:12:45.548 --> 00:12:47.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
she had no reaction.

00:12:48.451 --> 00:12:50.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After a few minutes,

00:12:50.453 --> 00:12:53.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina started firing
questions at the brothers:

00:12:53.789 --> 00:12:57.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe in the Trinity?
What is God’s name?

00:12:57.259 --> 00:13:00.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you believe in hellfire?
What happens when we die?

00:13:00.896 --> 00:13:04.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the earth?
How many go to heaven?”

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers answered each question.

00:13:06.902 --> 00:13:10.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Do you preach?” she then asked.

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Yes,” said one brother, “we preach.”

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:17.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But,” she responded, 
“how do you preach?”

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:21.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We preach from house to house,”
replied the brother.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:25.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Now I know that you are my brothers!”
she exclaimed.

00:13:25.788 --> 00:13:30.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Only Jehovah’s people
preach from house to house!”

00:13:30.025 --> 00:13:33.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Through her tears, Sister Pina stated:

00:13:33.462 --> 00:13:37.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Jehovah is wonderful.
He never forgot me!”

00:13:39.635 --> 00:13:44.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometime later, the brothers
were notified that Sister Pina was ill

00:13:44.039 --> 00:13:47.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that she wanted to meet
with one of the responsible brothers.

00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:50.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he arrived, she asked in part,

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as she gasped for air,

00:13:53.349 --> 00:13:57.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Has the book of Revelation been fulfilled?”

00:13:57.019 --> 00:14:02.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother responded,
“Yes, Areti, most of it has.”

00:14:02.024 --> 00:14:06.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina said:
“Now I can die in peace.

00:14:06.662 --> 00:14:10.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I needed to know how close we are.”

00:14:10.566 --> 00:14:12.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Shortly after that conversation,

00:14:12.902 --> 00:14:16.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sister Pina
faithfully finished her earthly course.

00:14:17.873 --> 00:14:19.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think?

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:22.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During all those years of isolation

00:14:22.311 --> 00:14:25.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the earthly part
of Jehovah’s organization,

00:14:25.014 --> 00:14:29.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did Sister Pina’s efforts
go unnoticed by Jehovah?

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:31.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Absolutely not!

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:34.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just imagine Jehovah’s joy

00:14:34.056 --> 00:14:38.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as he watched her faithfully doing
what she could in his service.

00:14:38.761 --> 00:14:42.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you think that Sister Pina
was precious to Jehovah?

00:14:42.798 --> 00:14:45.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Without a doubt she was.

00:14:46.268 --> 00:14:51.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, your efforts in Jehovah’s service
do not go unnoticed by him either.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:55.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like Sister Pina, you are precious to him.

00:14:57.012 --> 00:15:00.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what has this consideration
helped us to realize?

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.686 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We may have to contend with Satan’s lies,

00:15:03.686 --> 00:15:06.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
negative circumstances
and events in our lives,

00:15:06.622 --> 00:15:09.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and our own imperfections.

00:15:09.158 --> 00:15:14.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But we should never forget
that Jehovah highly values his servants.

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:19.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw that in his words to the Israelites
through the prophet Isaiah.

00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:24.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can be sure that Jehovah
loves you most tenderly.

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:28.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No matter what trials you’re facing now
or have endured in the past,

00:15:28.677 --> 00:15:32.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah sees you and he feels for you.

When you hurt, he hurts.

You’re far too precious to Jehovah
for him to forget you.

The account of the widow in Luke chapter 21

00:15:44.293 --> 00:15:46.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can assure you that although circumstances

may affect what you
can contribute to Jehovah,

00:15:49.632 --> 00:15:54.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he notices and treasures
each act you do for him,

00:15:54.203 --> 00:15:58.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when you do it
in the face of difficult circumstances.

00:15:58.807 --> 00:16:01.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He remembers,
and he will reward

00:16:01.443 --> 00:16:05.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the smallest contribution
given in support of his Kingdom.

00:16:06.849 --> 00:16:11.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what beautiful modern-day examples
we have in the organization

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of brothers and sisters
who have proven their loyalty to Jehovah

00:16:14.857 --> 00:16:19.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and are precious to him,
like the example of Sister Pina!

00:16:20.529 --> 00:16:23.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters, please,

00:16:23.065 --> 00:16:27.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
never forget that you
are precious to Jehovah!
