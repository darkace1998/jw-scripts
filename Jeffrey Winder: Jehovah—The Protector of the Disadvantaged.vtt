00:00:01.188 --> 00:00:04.608 line:10% position:50% align:center
Do you ever feel disadvantaged?

00:00:04.608 --> 00:00:06.443 line:10% position:50% align:center
Do you feel that perhaps

00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:08.654 line:10% position:50% align:center
because of unfavorable circumstances

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:11.156 line:10% position:50% align:center
over which you have no control,

00:00:11.156 --> 00:00:13.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
you just don’t have a fair chance in life?

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you feel that in the race of life

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:19.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
others seem to be able to run freely

00:00:19.707 --> 00:00:22.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you have to run with a crutch.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this program,
we’re going to talk

00:00:25.588 --> 00:00:30.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
about a very endearing aspect
of Jehovah’s personality:

00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:33.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
his loving care for the disadvantaged.

00:00:34.179 --> 00:00:37.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll delve into his feelings for such ones,

00:00:37.391 --> 00:00:39.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
his respect for them,

00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his long history of caring for them.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll also consider
how Jehovah’s care of the lowly ones

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:49.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
draws us closer to him

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it can reassure you
if you face disadvantages in your life.

00:00:55.034 --> 00:00:58.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
To begin with,
who are the disadvantaged?

00:00:59.872 --> 00:01:03.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we speak
of disadvantaged ones in this discussion,

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:06.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not talking
about the inadequacies of the person

00:01:06.962 --> 00:01:10.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
but, rather,
of the unfortunate circumstances in life

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
that one must contend with.

00:01:13.218 --> 00:01:17.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often a person inherits the situation
through no fault of his own.

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:22.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among such ones,
the Bible specifically mentions widows,

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:25.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
orphans, and foreign residents.

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:29.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice this at Deuteronomy 24:17:

00:01:30.527 --> 00:01:34.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not pervert the judgment
of the foreign resident

00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:36.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or of the fatherless child,

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you must not seize
the garment of a widow

00:01:39.453 --> 00:01:41.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
as security for a loan.”

00:01:42.081 --> 00:01:44.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said:

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:47.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Law specifically protected those

00:01:47.086 --> 00:01:49.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who could not protect themselves,

00:01:49.672 --> 00:01:53.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as orphans,
widows, and foreign residents.”

00:01:54.593 --> 00:01:59.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 10:14 refers to such ones
as “unfortunate victim[s].”

00:02:00.391 --> 00:02:03.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible also uses the term “lowly ones,”

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because they’re less important,

00:02:05.896 --> 00:02:08.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of their circumstances.

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:12.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our next main question is,

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah feel about such ones?

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:21.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really see a beautiful aspect
of Jehovah’s personality here

00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:25.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
—his compassion and empathy—
in action.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since a widow doesn’t have a husband
to care for her,

00:02:28.877 --> 00:02:33.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
an orphan doesn’t have parents
to provide for and protect him,

00:02:33.215 --> 00:02:36.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a foreigner has no advocate,

00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:41.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah steps in
and fills those roles personally.

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:45.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice this in the wording of Psalm 68:5:

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A father of the fatherless

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:54.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a protector of widows
is God in his holy dwelling.”

00:02:54.987 --> 00:02:59.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah himself assumes
the responsibility left vacated.

00:02:59.992 --> 00:03:04.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
He becomes the Father;
he becomes the Protector.

00:03:05.414 --> 00:03:09.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
As their Protector,
note how he views their care

00:03:09.293 --> 00:03:13.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Exodus 22:22-24:

00:03:14.256 --> 00:03:18.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not afflict any widow
or fatherless child.

00:03:18.135 --> 00:03:21.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you afflict him at all,
so that he cries out to me,

00:03:21.972 --> 00:03:25.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will unfailingly hear his outcry;

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and my anger will blaze,

00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:30.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will kill you with the sword,

00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:33.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and your wives will become widows,

00:03:33.108 --> 00:03:35.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
and your children will be fatherless.”

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding this verse,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said:

00:03:40.157 --> 00:03:44.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Notice that Jehovah did not
leave it up to the human judges in Israel

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:46.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to enforce this law.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God himself would execute judgment
upon anyone

00:03:50.793 --> 00:03:54.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
who took advantage of a defenseless child.”

00:03:54.296 --> 00:03:57.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is how personally
Jehovah takes the care

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the lowly, disadvantaged ones.

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
They become his responsibility;

00:04:03.597 --> 00:04:06.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
they come under his protection.

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:11.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah personally makes up for any
disadvantage they may have.

00:04:13.607 --> 00:04:17.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact that Jehovah takes
personal responsibility for such ones

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:21.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
is further seen at Proverbs 19:17:

00:04:22.241 --> 00:04:24.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one showing favor to the lowly

00:04:24.618 --> 00:04:27.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is lending to Jehovah,

00:04:27.663 --> 00:04:30.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
and He will repay him for what he does.”

00:04:31.708 --> 00:04:35.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s walk through the process
that this verse describes.

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:38.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we assist the lowly,

00:04:38.757 --> 00:04:41.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we show favor to them,
in some way.

00:04:41.343 --> 00:04:44.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
We help them in a practical way,
we encourage them,

00:04:44.596 --> 00:04:46.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
we make sure they get justice

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:49.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
or care for something else
they’re in need of.

00:04:49.143 --> 00:04:51.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as discussed,

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:53.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has assumed the responsibility

00:04:53.564 --> 00:04:56.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
to care for these disadvantaged ones.

00:04:56.275 --> 00:04:59.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we step in and assist,

00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:03.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah views this
as if we are giving to him,

00:05:03.157 --> 00:05:06.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
assisting him with his responsibility.

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:10.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah doesn’t view it as a gift or payment

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:12.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as a loan.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the difference
between a gift and a loan?

00:05:17.754 --> 00:05:20.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
A loan must be repaid.

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:25.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine,
when we assist the disadvantaged,

00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:27.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah actually views himself

00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:31.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
as indebted to us lowly humans!

00:05:31.727 --> 00:05:36.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will repay that debt
with favor and blessings.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without a doubt,

00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:43.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah feels strongly
about the care of disadvantaged ones.

00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:48.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider this a little further.

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Jehovah’s love
and compassion for the disadvantaged,

00:05:52.873 --> 00:05:56.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
he enacted laws to protect them in Israel.

00:05:56.543 --> 00:06:00.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
In these laws, we see the depth
of Jehovah’s understanding

00:06:00.797 --> 00:06:04.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his tender care
and protection of such ones.

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider just two examples.

00:06:07.679 --> 00:06:12.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s look at his law
regarding a security for a loan.

00:06:12.643 --> 00:06:16.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find this at Exodus 22:26, 27:

00:06:18.941 --> 00:06:21.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you seize the garment of your fellow man

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:23.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as security for a loan,

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:26.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you are to return it to him by sunset.

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:30.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it is his only covering,
his clothing to cover his body;

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:33.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in what will he lie down to sleep?

00:06:33.455 --> 00:06:37.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he cries out to me,
I will certainly hear,

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:39.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
for I am compassionate.”

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:43.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s compassion in this law
for any poor Israelite

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:46.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
who might find himself in this situation.

00:06:46.843 --> 00:06:51.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, note the additional stipulation
made in the case of widows,

00:06:51.723 --> 00:06:55.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
as stated at Deuteronomy 24:17:

00:06:57.604 --> 00:07:00.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not pervert the judgment
of the foreign resident

00:07:00.816 --> 00:07:02.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or of the fatherless child,

00:07:02.818 --> 00:07:06.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you must not seize
the garment of a widow

00:07:06.363 --> 00:07:08.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
as security for a loan.”

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:10.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the widow’s case,

00:07:10.826 --> 00:07:15.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
no Israelite
was to take her garment as security at all!

00:07:15.497 --> 00:07:19.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah evidently
wanted to eliminate any chance

00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:23.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she’d be left overnight
without her garment to keep her warm.

00:07:24.673 --> 00:07:26.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that beautiful?

00:07:27.467 --> 00:07:30.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t we see Jehovah’s special love and care

00:07:30.887 --> 00:07:33.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
for disadvantaged ones in a law like this?

00:07:35.684 --> 00:07:40.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a second example
of a law made to help the lowly ones.

00:07:40.147 --> 00:07:43.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this case,
it was related to the sacrifices

00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:45.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Israelites were to make to Jehovah

00:07:45.485 --> 00:07:48.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the forgiveness of their sins.

00:07:48.196 --> 00:07:50.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know the importance of blood

00:07:50.198 --> 00:07:54.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
in regard to sacrifices
to atone ones from sin.

00:07:54.119 --> 00:07:57.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leviticus 17:11 tells us

00:07:57.122 --> 00:08:01.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “it is the blood that makes atonement.”

00:08:01.084 --> 00:08:05.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, note the provision
made for the very poor in Israel,

00:08:05.255 --> 00:08:07.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at Leviticus 5:11:

00:08:09.801 --> 00:08:14.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now if he cannot afford
two turtledoves or two young pigeons,

00:08:14.473 --> 00:08:17.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he must bring as his offering for his sin

00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:22.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
a tenth of an ephah of fine flour
for a sin offering.”

00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:25.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding this, <i>The Watchtower</i>  said:

00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:30.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the very poor,
Jehovah chose to make an exception

00:08:30.364 --> 00:08:33.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and allow a sin offering without blood.

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:38.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In Israel, poverty denied no one
the blessing of atonement

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the privilege of making peace with God.”

00:08:40.624 --> 00:08:42.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  continued:

00:08:42.709 --> 00:08:46.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does that mean that the flour offerings
of the poor were worthless?

00:08:46.505 --> 00:08:47.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No.

00:08:47.923 --> 00:08:50.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah surely valued the humble,

00:08:50.717 --> 00:08:53.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“willing spirit behind such offerings.

00:08:53.678 --> 00:08:57.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, the sins of the entire nation

00:08:57.057 --> 00:08:58.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—including the poor—

00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:01.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
“were covered by the blood
of the animals offered to God

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the annual Day of Atonement.”

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:08.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this we see Jehovah’s reasonableness,

00:09:08.652 --> 00:09:12.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
his compassion,
and his love for the disadvantaged.

00:09:12.823 --> 00:09:17.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one was left out,
and they received the same refreshment

00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:20.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
from their sacrifice as any other Israelite.

00:09:22.916 --> 00:09:24.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
So far in our discussion,

00:09:24.584 --> 00:09:28.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve highlighted that Jehovah
takes personal responsibility

00:09:28.213 --> 00:09:30.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the care of disadvantaged ones.

00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:34.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
He steps in and fills the vacated role.

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:39.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we assist such ones,
he views it as lending to him.

00:09:40.434 --> 00:09:43.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further, we see his love and compassion

00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:47.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the laws he enacted
to protect such ones in Israel.

00:09:49.067 --> 00:09:51.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an important question:

00:09:51.778 --> 00:09:54.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think about the special place

00:09:54.197 --> 00:09:58.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has in his heart
for disadvantaged ones,

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:01.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does that make you feel about him?

00:10:02.539 --> 00:10:05.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t it draw you closer to Jehovah?

00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:09.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t help but love him for it.

00:10:10.839 --> 00:10:15.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love and care for the disadvantaged
is in such stark contrast

00:10:15.844 --> 00:10:18.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the way such ones
are often treated in the world.

00:10:19.473 --> 00:10:23.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, the world often
steps on the disadvantaged

00:10:23.226 --> 00:10:26.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
—taking more advantage of them
because they can.

00:10:27.939 --> 00:10:32.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
Further, whom does the world
praise and promote?

00:10:32.402 --> 00:10:35.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it typically the beautiful, the rich,

00:10:35.197 --> 00:10:38.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
the talented, the funny, the charismatic?

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:41.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whereas the common person,

00:10:41.036 --> 00:10:43.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
even more so the disadvantaged,

00:10:43.497 --> 00:10:45.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
often doesn’t receive such favor.

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:52.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
By contrast, Jehovah is on the lookout
for the lowly ones.

00:10:54.382 --> 00:10:56.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
This brings us to our next question:

00:10:56.801 --> 00:10:59.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is this reassuring for those of us

00:10:59.721 --> 00:11:03.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are disadvantaged in one way or another?

00:11:03.266 --> 00:11:05.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the outset, we asked that question:

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:09.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you feel disadvantaged?

00:11:09.022 --> 00:11:11.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are your circumstances?

00:11:11.858 --> 00:11:16.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe because of your situation,
you relate to the widow, the orphan,

00:11:16.446 --> 00:11:19.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the foreign resident in Israel.

00:11:19.324 --> 00:11:23.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And while the Mosaic Law
specifically mentioned those three,

00:11:23.161 --> 00:11:26.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could broaden those groups today,
couldn’t we?

00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:30.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
we certainly have widows in our midst today,

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:34.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our hearts truly go out
to these dear ones.

00:11:34.047 --> 00:11:36.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
But couldn’t we also include in this group

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
wives who are neglected or abused
by their husbands

00:11:40.762 --> 00:11:44.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
verbally, emotionally, or physically?

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:48.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such ones don’t have the normal protection
expected of a husband.

00:11:49.563 --> 00:11:52.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Couldn’t we also include single parents

00:11:52.315 --> 00:11:56.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
—either because of the death of a mate
or because of divorce or abandonment?

00:11:58.196 --> 00:12:03.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with orphans, couldn’t we include
children of single parents,

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:07.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
children of parents
addicted to alcohol or drugs,

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
or children of parents suffering
from severe depression

00:12:10.625 --> 00:12:13.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
or other debilitating mental illness?

00:12:13.878 --> 00:12:17.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
In these cases, the children
may not be getting the normal care

00:12:17.674 --> 00:12:20.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and training that’s due them.

00:12:20.135 --> 00:12:22.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about foreigners?

00:12:22.304 --> 00:12:25.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are disadvantaged
because they have no advocate,

00:12:25.557 --> 00:12:27.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
no legal recourse, for protection.

00:12:28.768 --> 00:12:31.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Couldn’t we also include in this group

00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:34.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
ones who are minorities in the land
where they live

00:12:34.691 --> 00:12:37.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so are often discriminated against?

00:12:38.612 --> 00:12:40.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, we could include any

00:12:40.989 --> 00:12:44.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
who do not have
the normal protection due them

00:12:44.409 --> 00:12:48.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just don’t have
the same opportunities as others

00:12:48.204 --> 00:12:52.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
and any who feel disadvantaged,
such as the impoverished,

00:12:52.292 --> 00:12:57.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
the disabled, those with a lack of education
or training,

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:01.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who because of unfavorable
circumstances in their youth

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:05.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
didn’t get a fair chance,
and the list could go on.

00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:09.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
What makes you feel disadvantaged?

00:13:10.352 --> 00:13:14.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, all of Jehovah’s loving,
tender care for the lowly ones

00:13:14.314 --> 00:13:18.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
who we discussed earlier applies to you.

00:13:18.234 --> 00:13:22.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah feels just as strongly
about your situation

00:13:22.489 --> 00:13:26.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he did for the widow
and orphan and foreign resident in Israel.

00:13:27.661 --> 00:13:30.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
He takes personal responsibility

00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your care and protection.

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:39.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the Bible says
about him at Isaiah 57:15:

00:13:39.923 --> 00:13:42.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this is what
the High and Lofty One says,

00:13:42.884 --> 00:13:46.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who lives forever and whose name is holy:

00:13:46.262 --> 00:13:49.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I reside in the high and holy place,

00:13:49.683 --> 00:13:54.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but also with those
crushed and lowly in spirit,

00:13:54.562 --> 00:13:57.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to revive the spirit of the lowly

00:13:57.273 --> 00:14:00.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to revive
the heart of those being crushed.’”

00:14:01.611 --> 00:14:06.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here Jehovah says
that he resides with the lowly ones.

00:14:06.157 --> 00:14:10.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that he doesn’t just see
your situation from afar.

00:14:10.286 --> 00:14:12.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t just come and go quickly.

00:14:12.664 --> 00:14:15.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, this gives the sense that he sits down,

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:19.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
he gets comfortable, and he stays with you.

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:23.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for what purpose
does he remain close to you?

00:14:23.216 --> 00:14:26.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
To revive your spirit and your heart.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:30.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has open concern for your welfare.

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you personally experienced
Jehovah’s loving help in your situation?

00:14:38.106 --> 00:14:40.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, living during the time that we do,

00:14:40.775 --> 00:14:44.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
we know that we can’t expect Jehovah
to shield us from every hardship

00:14:44.738 --> 00:14:46.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes our way.

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you seen him help you endure?

00:14:50.368 --> 00:14:54.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you experienced him provide for you?

00:14:54.247 --> 00:14:57.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you seen him answer a prayer
at just the right time?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:03.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you come across a scripture
or article from the publications

00:15:03.047 --> 00:15:07.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gave you just what you needed
when you needed it?

00:15:08.011 --> 00:15:11.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you seen Jehovah’s care
through a thoughtful word

00:15:11.723 --> 00:15:16.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
or timely practical help from one of your
brothers or sisters in the congregation?

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is Jehovah residing with you!

00:15:21.191 --> 00:15:23.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:15:23.193 --> 00:15:26.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is reviving your heart.

00:15:26.321 --> 00:15:30.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has assumed responsibility for your care.

00:15:30.366 --> 00:15:33.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
He takes it personally.

00:15:33.036 --> 00:15:36.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are important to him!

00:15:37.457 --> 00:15:40.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we just love him for it, don’t we?

00:15:43.046 --> 00:15:47.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s something else that Jehovah
does to help the disadvantaged.

00:15:47.634 --> 00:15:49.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives you hope.

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will not be downtrodden forever.

00:15:54.057 --> 00:15:57.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s care for the disadvantaged
will be fully expressed

00:15:57.977 --> 00:16:02.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the new world
when all disadvantages will be removed.

00:16:02.273 --> 00:16:07.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 145:16 says:

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:11.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You open your hand and satisfy the desire

00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:13.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
of every living thing.”

00:16:13.326 --> 00:16:16.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not just the prominent
and not just the favored

00:16:16.538 --> 00:16:21.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah will “satisfy the desire
of every living thing.”

00:16:21.793 --> 00:16:24.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
That includes you. 

00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:26.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  said:

00:16:27.465 --> 00:16:31.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The fulfillment of Jehovah’s promises
will be so impressive

00:16:31.678 --> 00:16:35.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that the difficulties and trials
of the present time

00:16:35.098 --> 00:16:37.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will pale into insignificance.

00:16:37.851 --> 00:16:39.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In the coming Paradise,

00:16:39.853 --> 00:16:44.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the blessings from Jehovah
will surpass our imagination.

00:16:44.274 --> 00:16:49.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will certainly
experience unprecedented happiness.”

00:16:49.946 --> 00:16:53.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing will be missing in Paradise.

00:16:53.366 --> 00:16:56.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing will be unfair.

00:16:56.202 --> 00:17:00.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every person will have every advantage.
