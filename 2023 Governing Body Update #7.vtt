00:00:00.938 --> 00:00:02.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:02.023 --> 00:00:04.025 line:10% position:50% align:center
We have some exciting things

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:06.152 line:10% position:50% align:center
to share with you in this update.

00:00:06.152 --> 00:00:08.905 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you’ll find it very encouraging.

00:00:09.823 --> 00:00:12.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month makes the ten-year anniversary

00:00:12.826 --> 00:00:16.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the release
of the revised English <i>New World Translation</i>

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:18.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the annual meeting in 2013.

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:21.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
That historic program

00:00:21.544 --> 00:00:24.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
was streamed to 31 lands,

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 1.4 million attended in person

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:29.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
or via Internet stream.

00:00:30.762 --> 00:00:33.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
The complete <i>New World Translation</i>

00:00:33.223 --> 00:00:37.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
is now available in 158 languages.

00:00:37.144 --> 00:00:40.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we take into consideration
those languages

00:00:40.398 --> 00:00:43.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have the complete
Christian Greek Scriptures

00:00:43.192 --> 00:00:45.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
or part of the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:00:45.653 --> 00:00:47.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
that brings the total

00:00:47.655 --> 00:00:52.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 279 languages.

00:00:53.453 --> 00:00:58.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve found this revision
to be so helpful in our ministry, haven’t we?

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:02.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now the Governing Body
has approved of adding yet another tool

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:06.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us quickly access
the powerful message in the Bible.

00:01:08.428 --> 00:01:11.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all believe in the power of God’s Word

00:01:11.014 --> 00:01:13.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give us comfort and guidance.

00:01:13.809 --> 00:01:15.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of that,

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have our favorite scriptures
that we refer to over and over again.

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:25.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, do you ever partially
remember a Bible verse

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:28.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
but you’re not sure where to find it?

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:30.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that happens to me.

00:01:30.744 --> 00:01:33.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or do you want to comfort someone

00:01:33.038 --> 00:01:36.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a verse
that perhaps they don’t often hear?

00:01:37.376 --> 00:01:40.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, you will be pleased to know

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a new tool is being released.

00:01:43.466 --> 00:01:44.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has the title

00:01:44.968 --> 00:01:48.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Scriptures for Christian Living.</i>

00:01:49.806 --> 00:01:53.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
This publication
is similar in a number of ways

00:01:53.811 --> 00:01:58.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
to one that was released
back in 1965, the book

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:02.487 line:10% position:50% align:center
“<i>Make Sure of All Things; Hold Fast to What Is Fine</i>.”

00:02:03.363 --> 00:02:05.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title page described that book

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:09.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “a compilation
of scriptures from the Holy Bible

00:02:09.745 --> 00:02:13.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
under one hundred and twenty-three
main headings.”

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:15.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its purpose?

00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:17.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
The title page said:

00:02:17.795 --> 00:02:22.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This book may be used to assure yourself
of the Bible teaching on these subjects,

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:26.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and also to answer
those who challenge your faith.” 

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Make Sure</i>  was a well-loved publication.

00:02:31.643 --> 00:02:34.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what two publishers enjoyed about it.

00:02:35.898 --> 00:02:38.192 line:10% position:50% align:center
I love this book.

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:40.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
Its comprehensive lists of scriptures

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:44.449 line:10% position:50% align:center
under topics ranging from angels to work

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me to understand
and identify important Bible principles.

00:02:50.164 --> 00:02:52.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when the <i>Make Sure</i>  book came out,

00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:54.168 line:10% position:50% align:center
we were pioneering in the Bible Belt

00:02:54.168 --> 00:02:56.712 line:10% position:50% align:center
where we often had doctrinal discussions.

00:02:56.712 --> 00:02:59.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember one time talking with a woman,

00:02:59.507 --> 00:03:02.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she brought up the rich man and Lazarus.

00:03:02.177 --> 00:03:06.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we went to that section
in th<i>e Make Sure</i>  book on hellfire,

00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:09.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were able to reason
with her on the matter.

00:03:11.186 --> 00:03:13.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was in the Air Force when I got the truth,

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:17.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so this book helped me
to understand a lot more clearly

00:03:17.276 --> 00:03:22.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
issues relating to war,
neutrality, and friendship with the world.

00:03:22.282 --> 00:03:24.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
To this day,
I keep my copy handy.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would say that it was a teaching tool
of the time.

00:03:27.788 --> 00:03:31.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as pioneers,
we never left home without it.

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the <i>Make Sure</i>  book,
which is no longer available in print,

00:03:37.006 --> 00:03:40.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
the new publication,
<i>Scriptures for Christian Living,</i>

00:03:40.885 --> 00:03:45.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a compilation of scriptures
on more than 100 topics.

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
The purpose of this publication

00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:53.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to help us as we’re instructed
at 2 Timothy 2:15,

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:56.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, to handle
“the word of the truth aright.”

00:03:57.862 --> 00:04:02.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s briefly outline key features
of this new publication

00:04:02.242 --> 00:04:04.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
using <i> JW Library</i>®.

00:04:05.037 --> 00:04:07.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Scriptures for Christian Living,</i>

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:09.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we’ll refer to as <i>scl</i>,

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:11.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes it easy to locate

00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:13.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible verses and accounts

00:04:13.254 --> 00:04:15.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help you deal with challenges

00:04:15.256 --> 00:04:17.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to encourage others.

00:04:18.468 --> 00:04:20.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t list all the scriptures

00:04:20.303 --> 00:04:21.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a given topic.

00:04:21.972 --> 00:04:23.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, it groups

00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:25.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
the various subjects by category.

00:04:26.935 --> 00:04:28.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find a subject,

00:04:28.771 --> 00:04:31.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
use the search box in <i> JW Library</i>

00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:33.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
or browse the categories. 

00:04:34.318 --> 00:04:38.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>SCL</i> is divided into seven categories:

00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:42.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
Challenges, Conduct, Congregation,

00:04:42.285 --> 00:04:44.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daily Life, Family,

00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:48.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spirituality, and Qualities.

00:04:49.084 --> 00:04:50.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Select a category,

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then scroll down the list of topics.

00:04:54.048 --> 00:04:55.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re not sure which category

00:04:55.883 --> 00:04:58.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
might have the subject you’re looking for,

00:04:58.261 --> 00:05:00.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
select All.

00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:04.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many of the subjects have these features:

00:05:04.351 --> 00:05:06.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under each topic,

00:05:06.061 --> 00:05:07.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll see a number of statements

00:05:07.813 --> 00:05:09.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
or questions in bold.

00:05:10.191 --> 00:05:11.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
The cited verses

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:14.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
support the statement or answer the question.

00:05:15.488 --> 00:05:19.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases, there are “See also” verses

00:05:19.284 --> 00:05:22.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Relevant Bible account(s)” listed.

00:05:23.163 --> 00:05:26.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can the <i>scl </i> be used?

00:05:26.417 --> 00:05:28.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike the <i>Make Sure</i>  book,

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
which was designed primarily
for use in the field ministry,

00:05:32.507 --> 00:05:35.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>scl</i>  is designed to guide us

00:05:35.134 --> 00:05:39.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we face the challenges
of living as true Christians.

00:05:39.848 --> 00:05:43.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders,
you will find this new publication

00:05:43.435 --> 00:05:47.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be a valuable resource
on shepherding calls

00:05:47.022 --> 00:05:49.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when developing talks.

00:05:49.817 --> 00:05:53.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family heads,
you may want to use the material

00:05:53.613 --> 00:05:57.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the basis for some
of your Family Worship sessions.

00:05:57.325 --> 00:05:59.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
And congregation publishers,

00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:01.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can use this material

00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:06.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only as a basis
for some personal Bible study projects

00:06:06.085 --> 00:06:08.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to help your Bible students

00:06:08.504 --> 00:06:11.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
learn and apply Bible principles

00:06:11.466 --> 00:06:13.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
when making decisions.

00:06:14.552 --> 00:06:19.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>SCL</i> has been approved in over 300 languages.

00:06:20.392 --> 00:06:22.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you get a copy?

00:06:22.186 --> 00:06:25.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the big question:
When can you get a copy?

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to inform you that <i>scl</i>

00:06:29.652 --> 00:06:33.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
is now available in  <i>JW Library</i>

00:06:33.448 --> 00:06:36.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will later be available in print.

00:06:36.785 --> 00:06:38.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
For a period of time, 

00:06:38.412 --> 00:06:42.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>scl</i>  will be available in “What’s New.”

00:06:42.958 --> 00:06:45.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’ll also be able to find it

00:06:45.044 --> 00:06:47.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
by selecting the Library option

00:06:47.546 --> 00:06:49.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the bottom of the screen

00:06:49.173 --> 00:06:51.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then selecting Books.

00:06:53.052 --> 00:06:55.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some languages will be available

00:06:55.055 --> 00:06:57.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the same time as English,

00:06:57.057 --> 00:06:59.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
with more languages to follow.

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:05.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s the Governing Body’s hope
that <i>Scriptures for Christian Living</i>

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:09.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help all of us
to do as 2 Timothy 3:17 says

00:07:09.946 --> 00:07:13.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
and use God’s Word
to become “fully competent,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is especially important

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:25.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we get deeper into the last days.

00:07:26.505 --> 00:07:31.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever been afraid
during the past few years?

00:07:31.177 --> 00:07:33.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
afraid you’d get sick?

00:07:33.805 --> 00:07:36.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
afraid you’d lose your job?

00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:39.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
afraid you wouldn’t be able
to feed your family?

00:07:40.646 --> 00:07:43.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’ve faced a natural disaster,

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:46.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
persecution, or war.

00:07:46.486 --> 00:07:49.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
For what seems like an eternity,

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ve been living with fear.

00:07:52.325 --> 00:07:55.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, what does it mean?

00:07:56.705 --> 00:08:00.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does being afraid indicate a lack of faith?

00:08:00.501 --> 00:08:02.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all.

00:08:02.753 --> 00:08:06.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Faithful men of the past
have been afraid at times.

00:08:06.716 --> 00:08:09.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take David, for example.

00:08:09.302 --> 00:08:12.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
King Saul had put a price on David’s head.

00:08:12.555 --> 00:08:16.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
no place in Israel was safe for David,

00:08:16.852 --> 00:08:19.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he decided to leave the country.

00:08:20.314 --> 00:08:22.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where did he go?

00:08:22.525 --> 00:08:26.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
To Gath, the hometown of Goliath.

00:08:26.988 --> 00:08:31.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you can imagine,
David wasn’t very popular there.

00:08:31.952 --> 00:08:34.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result, the Bible says

00:08:34.496 --> 00:08:38.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “David . . . became very much afraid

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:40.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
of King Achish of Gath.”

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was during
that dangerous time in David’s life

00:08:44.632 --> 00:08:47.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he composed the 56th Psalm.

00:08:48.762 --> 00:08:52.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at a few verses,
starting with verse 1.

00:08:54.685 --> 00:08:57.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Show me favor, O God,

00:08:57.438 --> 00:09:00.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
because mortal man is attacking me.”

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s good to remember.

00:09:04.529 --> 00:09:08.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter how powerful
a ruler may seem to be,

00:09:08.366 --> 00:09:12.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is still a “mortal man.”

00:09:12.579 --> 00:09:15.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
He needs water and food to live.

00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:20.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
All Jehovah has to do is to take that away,

00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:22.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that man is a goner!

00:09:24.592 --> 00:09:26.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s look at verse 8.

00:09:27.387 --> 00:09:28.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
David says:

00:09:29.598 --> 00:09:32.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“</i>You keep track of my wandering.”

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter where David went,

00:09:35.938 --> 00:09:38.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was never out of Jehovah’s sight.

00:09:39.692 --> 00:09:41.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he continues:

00:09:42.069 --> 00:09:46.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do collect my tears in your skin bottle.

00:09:46.825 --> 00:09:49.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they not recorded in your book?”

00:09:50.245 --> 00:09:52.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
David, that courageous warrior,

00:09:52.706 --> 00:09:56.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
wasn’t embarrassed to admit
that he shed tears at times

00:09:56.961 --> 00:09:59.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he was afraid at times.

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, David didn’t allow himself

00:10:02.508 --> 00:10:05.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be overwhelmed by grief.

00:10:05.929 --> 00:10:10.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was confident
that Jehovah noticed his tears

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:13.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that God understood
the reason why David was crying.

00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:18.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s as if his tears were recorded in a book.

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
David was sure that one day
that book would be opened

00:10:22.739 --> 00:10:27.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that Jehovah would repay
the men who had made David cry.

00:10:28.078 --> 00:10:30.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it reassuring to know that Jehovah

00:10:30.706 --> 00:10:33.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not indifferent to our tears?

00:10:34.919 --> 00:10:39.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you get into a difficult situation,
pray.

00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:43.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
If there’s something you can do about it,

00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:45.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
pray for wisdom.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:48.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
If there’s nothing you can do about it,

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:50.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
pray for peace.

00:10:51.728 --> 00:10:55.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a situation arises
that makes us fearful,

00:10:55.816 --> 00:10:58.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember that we have a secret weapon.

00:10:58.861 --> 00:11:02.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a powerful weapon—prayer.

00:11:03.324 --> 00:11:06.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we pour out our hearts to Jehovah,

00:11:06.661 --> 00:11:10.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will listen to us and he will help us.

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:14.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that brings us back to verse 3.

00:11:15.546 --> 00:11:19.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a simple statement,
but it’s very meaningful.

00:11:21.094 --> 00:11:25.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.”

00:11:27.184 --> 00:11:29.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s realistic.

00:11:29.019 --> 00:11:32.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
It acknowledges the fact
that sometimes we’re afraid,

00:11:32.898 --> 00:11:35.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it tells us what to do about it

00:11:35.317 --> 00:11:38.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to put our trust in Jehovah.

00:11:39.447 --> 00:11:44.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next year, we’ll have many opportunities
to meditate on that statement

00:11:44.452 --> 00:11:47.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the Governing Body has chosen it

00:11:47.789 --> 00:11:51.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
as our yeartext for 2024!

00:11:51.085 --> 00:11:52.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Once again,

00:11:52.711 --> 00:11:56.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s Psalm 56:3:

00:11:56.299 --> 00:12:00.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.”

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:07.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
