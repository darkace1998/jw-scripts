Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:04.441 --> 00:00:06.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see how Jehovah shepherds us

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:10.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
through any challenge.

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:12.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are some highlights of what’s ahead.

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:15.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the exciting conclusion to Luda’s story,

00:00:15.744 --> 00:00:17.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
she must overcome her fears

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:20.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a stand for God’s Kingdom.

00:00:20.791 --> 00:00:22.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where can we find the strength

00:00:22.793 --> 00:00:24.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make needed changes?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
A highly trained soldier tells us
why he decided to leave the military

00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
after learning the truth.

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our music video

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:36.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
reminds us
that joy and peace are possible now

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we wait for “the real life” to come.

00:00:39.768 --> 00:00:42.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the May 2024 edition

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:44.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you see
when you look at this picture?

00:01:06.462 --> 00:01:08.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see yourself in it?

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:10.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
You should.

00:01:10.215 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why?

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.553 line:10% position:50% align:center
This picture helps us to visualize

00:01:14.553 --> 00:01:17.014 line:10% position:50% align:center
the beautiful description of Jehovah

00:01:17.014 --> 00:01:19.266 line:10% position:50% align:center
found at Isaiah 40:11:

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:23.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like a shepherd he will care for his flock.

00:01:23.687 --> 00:01:27.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With his arm
he will gather together the lambs,

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in his bosom he will carry them.

00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:33.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will gently lead
those nursing their young.”

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:37.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah bears many titles in the Bible,

00:01:37.242 --> 00:01:39.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the designation “Shepherd”

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
is among the most tender.

00:01:41.956 --> 00:01:43.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a shepherd,

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:48.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says ‘he will carry
his lambs in his bosom,’

00:01:48.087 --> 00:01:51.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
illustrating his tender love and care

00:01:51.048 --> 00:01:53.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each one of his precious sheep.

00:01:54.301 --> 00:01:56.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look again at the picture.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it hard for you to see yourself as a lamb

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:02.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
nestled in the bosom
of our Shepherd, Jehovah?

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:05.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know that many
of you dear brothers and sisters

00:02:05.604 --> 00:02:08.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
are coping with very difficult challenges

00:02:08.273 --> 00:02:12.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
day after day in this cruel, wicked world.

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:17.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such challenges can make it difficult for you
to feel like a lamb,

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:21.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
safe and secure in the bosom of our Shepherd.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:22.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please be assured

00:02:22.788 --> 00:02:27.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is fully aware
of every challenge you face.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can you be so sure?

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:35.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read what David,
the writer of Psalm 23:4, says:

00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:38.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow,

00:02:38.846 --> 00:02:43.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I fear no harm, for you are with me;

00:02:43.142 --> 00:02:46.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
your rod and your staff reassure me.”

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Much like a physical valley

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:53.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
located deep in the shadows
of nearby mountains,

00:02:53.652 --> 00:02:56.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
a figurative valley
can be used to describe

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
a low point in one’s life

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:03.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when we’re feeling down,
gloomy, or in a dark place.

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:06.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David wrote this psalm,

00:03:06.123 --> 00:03:09.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was feeling down,
at a low point in his life.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:14.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what “valley of deep shadow”
are you currently going through?

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you feeling overwhelmed with
trying to provide for your family’s needs?

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:23.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
dealing with a serious health issue,
such as cancer?

00:03:24.892 --> 00:03:29.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
exhausted because you are caring
for your mate or a parent with dementia?

00:03:30.814 --> 00:03:33.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to cope with the death of a loved one?

00:03:34.026 --> 00:03:36.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
battling feelings of loneliness,

00:03:36.653 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
worthlessness, or anxiety?

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:41.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
or facing persecution?

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:45.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so difficult to remain positive

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:49.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
when facing the darkest days of our life.

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:51.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is a bright side.

00:03:51.585 --> 00:03:53.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is aware
of the mountainlike obstacles

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
that cause you to feel low,

00:03:59.093 --> 00:04:01.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
as if you were in a “valley of deep shadow.”

00:04:02.304 --> 00:04:04.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
He not only sees your pain,

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he’s ready to come to your rescue,

00:04:06.934 --> 00:04:09.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
lift you up with his strong arms,

00:04:09.895 --> 00:04:13.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
and embrace you
like that lamb in the picture.

00:04:14.233 --> 00:04:19.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 23 is one
of the most well-known passages in the Bible

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beautifully describes the loving way

00:04:22.074 --> 00:04:25.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our Shepherd, Jehovah, leads, protects,

00:04:25.953 --> 00:04:28.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feeds his precious sheep.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we consider these three ways
that Jehovah cares for us,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for the answers
to the following questions:

00:04:36.547 --> 00:04:38.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah do?

00:04:38.924 --> 00:04:40.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does he do it?

00:04:40.467 --> 00:04:43.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do you need to do?

00:04:44.096 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first way: Our Shepherd leads us.

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:52.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 23:1, the theme of our discussion,

00:04:52.521 --> 00:04:54.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
David expressed with full confidence:

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:59.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is my Shepherd.
I will lack nothing.”

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:03.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a young man,
David proved to be a capable shepherd

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:08.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
who tenderly cared for
and protected his entire flock

00:05:08.036 --> 00:05:11.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cared for the specific needs
of each sheep.

00:05:12.624 --> 00:05:16.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in Psalm 23, David portrays himself,

00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:19.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
not as a shepherd, but as a humble sheep

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
under the loving care of Jehovah,

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:25.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
affectionately calling him “my Shepherd.”

00:05:27.055 --> 00:05:32.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
During his lifetime,
David experienced many highs and lows,

00:05:32.102 --> 00:05:36.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
peaks and valleys, joys and disappointments.

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:40.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever
“valley of deep shadow” he faced,

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:45.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
David always relied on his Shepherd
to lead him to safety

00:05:45.407 --> 00:05:50.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provide exactly
what he needed when he needed it.

00:05:50.871 --> 00:05:54.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
With complete trust and confidence, he said:

00:05:54.041 --> 00:05:56.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will lack nothing.”

00:05:56.835 --> 00:05:58.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder Psalm 23

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:02.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been called
“a psalm of assurance or trust.”

00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:06.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does our Shepherd do?

00:06:06.428 --> 00:06:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verses 2 and 3 answer:

00:06:09.181 --> 00:06:12.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In grassy pastures he makes me lie down;

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:16.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he leads me to well-watered resting-places.

00:06:16.313 --> 00:06:18.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He refreshes me.

00:06:18.482 --> 00:06:21.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He leads me in the paths of righteousness

00:06:21.068 --> 00:06:22.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the sake of his name.”

00:06:23.111 --> 00:06:25.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once explained:

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:28.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“David here paints a scene of contentment,

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:31.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
refreshment, and security.”

00:06:32.746 --> 00:06:36.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah leads us to “grassy pastures”
and “tranquil waters.”

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:41.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Hebrew word rendered ‘pastures’
can mean ‘pleasant place.’”

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:45.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we humbly follow our Shepherd,

00:06:45.217 --> 00:06:48.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will lead us to a “pleasant place”

00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:51.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we can feel secure
and have peace of mind,

00:06:51.181 --> 00:06:54.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when we’re going through
a “valley of deep shadow.”

00:06:55.727 --> 00:06:57.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah lead us?

00:06:58.647 --> 00:07:02.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of his Word,
he teaches us how to make wise decisions

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:06.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
that lead to “paths of righteousness,”

00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:10.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
a life course that is pleasing to him
and brings us happiness.

00:07:11.118 --> 00:07:15.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sets a course and a pace
that we’re able to follow,

00:07:15.247 --> 00:07:18.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
never expecting us
to do more than we’re able.

00:07:19.167 --> 00:07:21.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also leads us

00:07:21.211 --> 00:07:24.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
by means of undershepherds, the elders,

00:07:24.172 --> 00:07:27.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
who tenderly care for us spiritually,

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:29.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
emotionally, and physically

00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:31.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we will “lack nothing.”

00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:34.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you need to do?

00:07:35.726 --> 00:07:38.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re going
through a “valley of deep shadow,”

00:07:38.437 --> 00:07:40.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
search our many publications

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
for specific Bible principles

00:07:43.275 --> 00:07:47.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helpful advice that can shed light
on your present circumstances

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:51.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
and provide practical ways
to overcome difficulties

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:54.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
or give you the patience to endure.

00:07:55.579 --> 00:07:58.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many find encouragement and comfort

00:07:58.081 --> 00:08:00.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
watching JW Broadcasting®.

00:08:00.459 --> 00:08:02.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, one sister said:

00:08:02.919 --> 00:08:07.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“JW Broadcasting
has helped me to be more positive . . .

00:08:07.049 --> 00:08:09.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When I get lonely or discouraged,

00:08:09.468 --> 00:08:11.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I find an encouraging talk

00:08:11.511 --> 00:08:13.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
or [a] Morning Worship program to watch.”

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you benefiting
from the monthly broadcasts,

00:08:17.976 --> 00:08:20.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
videos, and uplifting songs?

00:08:21.772 --> 00:08:25.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second way: Our Shepherd protects us.

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:28.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the second half of verse 4:

00:08:29.946 --> 00:08:33.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your rod and your staff reassure me.”

00:08:34.076 --> 00:08:36.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
David used a shepherd’s rod and staff

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
to illustrate Jehovah’s protective care.

00:08:39.456 --> 00:08:43.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ancient shepherds used a rod
to protect their sheep from predators

00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:47.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as lions, bears, wolves, and snakes.

00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:51.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also used a staff to guide their sheep,

00:08:51.134 --> 00:08:54.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
gently nudging them in the right direction.

00:08:54.805 --> 00:08:57.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, some staffs had a hook

00:08:57.557 --> 00:09:01.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of the long stick
that helped them as a shepherd

00:09:01.436 --> 00:09:05.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
to gently draw back a sheep straying
or nibbling into danger,

00:09:05.982 --> 00:09:09.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
guiding them back
to the protection of the flock.

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
The sheep certainly did not fear

00:09:12.364 --> 00:09:15.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the shepherd would use his rod
or his staff to beat them.

00:09:16.827 --> 00:09:18.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah do?

00:09:18.995 --> 00:09:23.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our loving Shepherd stands
ready to use his figurative rod and staff

00:09:23.583 --> 00:09:28.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warn and protect us
from predators seeking to harm us,

00:09:28.213 --> 00:09:30.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially from Satan,

00:09:30.382 --> 00:09:35.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
who in the Bible is portrayed
as a vicious lion and a cunning serpent.

00:09:36.304 --> 00:09:39.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also has appointed
elders in the congregation

00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:43.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warn and protect us
from harmful influences

00:09:43.395 --> 00:09:47.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from taking a dangerous path
in this wicked world.

00:09:48.191 --> 00:09:51.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you’re filled
with heartfelt appreciation

00:09:51.778 --> 00:09:56.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are comforted
knowing that Jehovah is always on the lookout

00:09:56.158 --> 00:09:58.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use his figurative rod and staff

00:09:58.743 --> 00:10:02.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
to warn and protect us, not to beat us.

00:10:03.748 --> 00:10:08.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve strayed or nibbled away
from the flock for whatever reason,

00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:11.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
please listen to Jehovah

00:10:11.465 --> 00:10:15.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he speaks to you
through his written Word, the Bible,

00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:17.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our brotherhood.

00:10:17.053 --> 00:10:19.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humbly follow the gentle nudging

00:10:19.764 --> 00:10:23.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead you back
to the safety of the congregation,

00:10:23.059 --> 00:10:26.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you’ll enjoy lush “grassy pastures”

00:10:26.354 --> 00:10:30.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
and refreshing “well-watered resting-places.”

00:10:31.109 --> 00:10:34.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders, you are entrusted

00:10:34.196 --> 00:10:37.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a privileged but heavy responsibility

00:10:37.574 --> 00:10:39.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect Jehovah’s precious sheep,

00:10:39.993 --> 00:10:42.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom He’s placed under your care.

00:10:43.038 --> 00:10:47.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
We take this opportunity
to express our sincere appreciation

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:50.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those of you
who use your figurative rod and staff

00:10:50.921 --> 00:10:55.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect the sheep,
never making them feel beaten down

00:10:55.467 --> 00:10:58.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
but truly loved and appreciated.

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:02.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah protect us?

00:11:02.557 --> 00:11:06.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
He protects us as a group, or flock.

00:11:06.728 --> 00:11:10.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan will never succeed
in wiping Jehovah’s sheep from the earth.

00:11:11.816 --> 00:11:15.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah also protects
each sheep individually.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:17.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:20.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
Most important, he protects us spiritually.

00:11:21.493 --> 00:11:25.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Draw Close to Jehovah</i>  book explains:

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Our loving God
protects us from spiritual harm

00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:31.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“by equipping us with what we need
in order to endure trials

00:11:31.878 --> 00:11:34.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to safeguard our relationship with him.

00:11:34.923 --> 00:11:37.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah thus works to preserve our life,

00:11:37.384 --> 00:11:42.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just for a few short years
but for eternity.”

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:46.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
How reassuring that Jehovah makes sure

00:11:46.351 --> 00:11:48.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have everything we need

00:11:48.687 --> 00:11:52.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we will, in effect, “lack nothing”!

00:11:53.692 --> 00:11:55.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you need to do?

00:11:55.986 --> 00:11:58.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take full advantage
of the many provisions

00:11:58.572 --> 00:12:02.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah makes available
to protect us spiritually

00:12:02.284 --> 00:12:05.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
—prayer, fellow worshippers,

00:12:05.203 --> 00:12:07.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
and timely spiritual food,

00:12:07.747 --> 00:12:09.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we’ll discuss next.

00:12:09.958 --> 00:12:14.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
The third way: Our Shepherd feeds us.

00:12:14.254 --> 00:12:17.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 23:5, 6 reassures us:

00:12:18.008 --> 00:12:21.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You prepare a table for me
before my enemies.

00:12:21.928 --> 00:12:26.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You refresh my head with oil;
my cup is well-filled.

00:12:26.891 --> 00:12:31.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Surely goodness and loyal love
will pursue me all the days of my life,

00:12:31.896 --> 00:12:35.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will dwell in the house of Jehovah
for all my days.”

00:12:36.318 --> 00:12:38.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah do?

00:12:38.737 --> 00:12:40.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
David now describes our Shepherd

00:12:40.864 --> 00:12:45.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a generous host
who spreads before us, his invited guests,

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:50.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
delicious and nutritious food and drink
in great abundance.

00:12:51.458 --> 00:12:53.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does Jehovah feed us?

00:12:53.877 --> 00:12:55.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through “the faithful and discreet slave,”

00:12:55.962 --> 00:12:58.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah gives us timely publications

00:12:58.548 --> 00:13:03.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as rich spiritual programs
at our meetings, assemblies,

00:13:03.595 --> 00:13:08.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
conventions, JW Broadcasting,
Governing Body updates,

00:13:08.516 --> 00:13:11.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with encouraging songs and videos,

00:13:11.227 --> 00:13:13.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so much more.

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:17.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, the slave is giving us
“food at the proper time”

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:20.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
—what we need when we need it.

00:13:20.528 --> 00:13:23.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
We certainly “lack nothing” spiritually.

00:13:24.658 --> 00:13:26.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you need to do?

00:13:27.285 --> 00:13:31.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show your appreciation
for the food the slave provides

00:13:31.247 --> 00:13:34.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
by eating it and never being fussy, picky,

00:13:34.834 --> 00:13:37.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
or selective in your eating habits.

00:13:37.545 --> 00:13:41.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the Bible
and Bible-based publications

00:13:41.466 --> 00:13:45.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
are ways that Jehovah speaks to us,
in effect, saying:

00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:48.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is the way.
Walk in it,” my precious sheep.

00:13:49.557 --> 00:13:50.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we read the Bible

00:13:50.725 --> 00:13:54.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meditate on the verses
that touch our heart,

00:13:54.062 --> 00:13:57.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll be better equipped
to correct any faulty thinking

00:13:57.482 --> 00:14:01.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could lead us
to dark feelings of anxiety,

00:14:01.277 --> 00:14:04.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
loneliness, worthlessness,

00:14:04.364 --> 00:14:06.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
anger, or resentment.

00:14:07.409 --> 00:14:11.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like David, be determined
to “dwell in the house of Jehovah

00:14:11.454 --> 00:14:13.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
for all [your] days.”

00:14:13.289 --> 00:14:16.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue attending our upbuilding meetings,

00:14:16.084 --> 00:14:18.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
assemblies, and conventions,

00:14:18.628 --> 00:14:22.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we receive
spiritual nourishment and protection.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister who has traversed
various “valley[s] of deep shadow”

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:32.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
expressed what helps her
to stay focused and to keep on enduring.

00:14:32.392 --> 00:14:36.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said: “Depressive thoughts
are not trustworthy.

00:14:36.938 --> 00:14:39.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They are the product of a treacherous heart

00:14:39.524 --> 00:14:42.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that distorts our thinking abilities.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But because I trust Jehovah completely,

00:14:46.114 --> 00:14:50.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each Bible verse proves to be
like a solid stepping stone

00:14:50.618 --> 00:14:55.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
that enables me to gradually climb out
of my many valleys of deep shadow.”

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our sister expressed so well

00:14:59.544 --> 00:15:02.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
how we feel about our loving Shepherd

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
who promises to help us successfully navigate

00:15:05.759 --> 00:15:08.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
through any “valley of deep shadow.”

00:15:09.179 --> 00:15:11.222 line:10% position:50% align:center
Isn’t this a beautiful picture

00:15:11.222 --> 00:15:13.224 line:10% position:50% align:center
of a shepherd with his sheep?

00:15:13.224 --> 00:15:14.267 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s adorned

00:15:14.267 --> 00:15:15.977 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body conference room

00:15:15.977 --> 00:15:18.313 line:10% position:50% align:center
since the 1970’s.

00:15:18.313 --> 00:15:20.482 line:10% position:50% align:center
It’s a visual reminder

00:15:20.482 --> 00:15:23.151 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the importance of their work as shepherds.

00:15:23.818 --> 00:15:27.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lösch, a member
of the Governing Body since 1994,

00:15:27.739 --> 00:15:29.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
recently explained

00:15:29.616 --> 00:15:34.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
what this inspiring painting
has meant to him throughout the decades.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy the following video segment.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:40.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
This painting
in the Governing Body conference room

00:15:40.585 --> 00:15:43.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
shows the shepherd and his sheep.

00:15:43.755 --> 00:15:46.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the shepherd is caring for the sheep,

00:15:46.466 --> 00:15:50.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they feel, obviously,
comfortable and protected.

00:15:50.428 --> 00:15:53.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they do that despite,

00:15:53.097 --> 00:15:56.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you can see in the background,
stormy weather.

00:15:56.684 --> 00:15:59.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the sheep feel just fine.

00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:02.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
In connection
with the application in the Bible,

00:16:02.941 --> 00:16:05.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible shows that Jehovah God

00:16:05.276 --> 00:16:09.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a shepherd who cares for us as his sheep,

00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:11.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
but so is Jesus Christ.

00:16:11.282 --> 00:16:13.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is called “the fine shepherd.”

00:16:13.409 --> 00:16:16.496 line:10% position:50% align:center
And what are shepherds to do?

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:20.834 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, shepherds lead the sheep,

00:16:20.834 --> 00:16:23.294 line:10% position:50% align:center
feed the sheep,

00:16:23.294 --> 00:16:26.589 line:10% position:50% align:center
and shepherds protect the sheep.

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:30.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then shepherds
also care for injured

00:16:30.385 --> 00:16:31.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
or ailing sheep.

00:16:31.928 --> 00:16:36.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fact is
that all of God’s people are sheep.

00:16:36.057 --> 00:16:37.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so we have the privilege

00:16:37.934 --> 00:16:41.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all follow the lead

00:16:41.521 --> 00:16:44.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah and Jesus and the elders

00:16:44.232 --> 00:16:46.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to work together in unity.

00:16:46.818 --> 00:16:49.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the Governing Body meeting,

00:16:49.112 --> 00:16:53.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
we sometimes look at the picture

00:16:53.366 --> 00:16:57.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we try to apply

00:16:57.078 --> 00:17:00.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
what is implied in the painting

00:17:00.331 --> 00:17:04.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our work with the congregations
and the worldwide flock.

00:17:05.503 --> 00:17:09.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother Lösch, for sharing
those encouraging comments with us.

00:17:10.091 --> 00:17:12.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
How reassuring it is to know

00:17:12.594 --> 00:17:15.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our loving shepherds
on the Governing Body

00:17:15.305 --> 00:17:19.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
take their responsibility to lead, protect,

00:17:19.017 --> 00:17:23.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
and feed you, me,
and all of Jehovah’s precious sheep

00:17:23.313 --> 00:17:25.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
very seriously!

00:17:25.148 --> 00:17:29.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we all continue
to humbly and obediently follow their lead

00:17:29.611 --> 00:17:34.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we follow closely the lead
of our Great Shepherd, Jehovah,

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the footsteps
of our Fine Shepherd and King, Jesus.

00:17:39.454 --> 00:17:43.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never forget that Jehovah
is not just our Shepherd,

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:47.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is your Shepherd; he is my Shepherd.

00:17:47.545 --> 00:17:52.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah, our Shepherd,
leading, protecting, and feeding us,

00:17:52.759 --> 00:17:55.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can face the future
with complete confidence

00:17:55.887 --> 00:17:58.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
and echo the words that David used

00:17:58.264 --> 00:18:01.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
to introduce this beautiful
and reassuring psalm

00:18:01.559 --> 00:18:04.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the words contained at Psalm 23:1:

00:18:04.437 --> 00:18:06.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is my Shepherd.

00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:08.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will lack nothing.”

00:18:10.109 --> 00:18:12.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the many “valley[s] of deep shadow”

00:18:12.445 --> 00:18:14.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can pass through is war.

00:18:15.281 --> 00:18:18.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
Along with physical and emotional strain,

00:18:18.117 --> 00:18:21.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can threaten our loyalty to God’s Kingdom.

00:18:21.746 --> 00:18:23.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we overcome fear

00:18:23.831 --> 00:18:26.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stand with Jehovah?

00:18:26.459 --> 00:18:28.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
The following dramatization

00:18:28.544 --> 00:18:30.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
takes us into the heart of a conflict

00:18:30.797 --> 00:18:33.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is based on the real-life experiences

00:18:33.675 --> 00:18:35.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
of some of our brothers and sisters.

00:18:36.511 --> 00:18:39.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Though I walk in the valley of deep shadow,

00:18:39.555 --> 00:18:43.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
I fear no harm, for you are with me.”

00:19:09.043 --> 00:19:12.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those words felt new
when the fighting started again.

00:19:19.846 --> 00:19:23.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the family that took us in
was a gift from Jehovah.

00:19:32.567 --> 00:19:33.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we waited

00:19:33.776 --> 00:19:36.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the trains to start running again,

00:19:36.863 --> 00:19:39.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
we tried our best to help others.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re nearly finished.

00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:48.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to go help them clean up.

00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:49.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK.

00:19:58.342 --> 00:20:00.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luda?

00:20:00.011 --> 00:20:01.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yakiv.

00:20:01.345 --> 00:20:03.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know her from school.

00:20:03.473 --> 00:20:05.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is my brother, Pavlo.

00:20:05.475 --> 00:20:07.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
He protects this whole area.

00:20:10.146 --> 00:20:12.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m surprised you’re still here.

00:20:12.648 --> 00:20:14.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too.

00:20:15.818 --> 00:20:17.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:20:17.028 --> 00:20:19.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stayed to help the fight.

00:20:19.322 --> 00:20:20.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where else would I be?

00:20:20.573 --> 00:20:21.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, no.

00:20:21.616 --> 00:20:22.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
I-I just meant . . .

00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is our home.

00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:28.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everybody has to do their part
to support the war.

00:20:31.417 --> 00:20:32.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m . . .

00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:36.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re what?

00:20:41.469 --> 00:20:43.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s a Jehovah.

00:20:43.971 --> 00:20:46.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
They don’t care about the country.

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:48.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, the cowards.

00:20:51.938 --> 00:20:55.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your people should be shot.

00:20:58.528 --> 00:21:00.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey!

00:21:01.489 --> 00:21:04.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, let’s go.

00:21:08.454 --> 00:21:09.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just froze.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fear is natural.

00:21:17.213 --> 00:21:18.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all get afraid.

00:21:20.007 --> 00:21:23.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s look at what Jesus told us.

00:21:27.223 --> 00:21:31.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, when they hand you over,

00:21:31.018 --> 00:21:34.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do not become anxious about how

00:21:34.105 --> 00:21:36.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or what you are to speak,

00:21:36.816 --> 00:21:40.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what you are to speak will be given you
in that hour.”

00:21:42.405 --> 00:21:45.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s talk about what you can say.

00:21:46.617 --> 00:21:50.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because when you have Jehovah’s thoughts
in here,

00:21:51.873 --> 00:21:54.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will always give you the words
when you need them.

00:22:06.888 --> 00:22:09.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today is the day we’ll try to leave.

00:22:09.807 --> 00:22:12.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have brothers and sisters waiting for us.

00:22:12.894 --> 00:22:17.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all these weeks,
it may finally happen.

00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:23.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have your tickets and ID ready!

00:22:32.997 --> 00:22:35.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
One at a time.

00:22:35.541 --> 00:22:38.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go ahead;
I’m right behind you.

00:22:41.756 --> 00:22:43.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Leaving the country?

00:22:44.342 --> 00:22:45.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:22:45.968 --> 00:22:49.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
Me, my mother, and my grandma are leaving.

00:22:50.056 --> 00:22:53.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re giving priority to the weak and sick.

00:22:53.017 --> 00:22:55.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s a lot you can do here.

00:22:55.394 --> 00:22:57.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you care about your country?

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:12.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
I respect our country,
but I am loyal to God.

00:23:12.203 --> 00:23:15.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
I support God’s Kingdom first.

00:23:15.373 --> 00:23:17.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think we make you stay.

00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:19.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go back!

00:23:19.168 --> 00:23:20.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hold on.

00:23:21.754 --> 00:23:23.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom?

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you say God’s Kingdom?

00:23:29.136 --> 00:23:32.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father, he, he was one of you.

00:23:34.141 --> 00:23:36.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t agree with your beliefs.

00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:46.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I know you’re good people.

00:23:47.154 --> 00:23:49.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, you and your family, get on the train.

00:23:55.288 --> 00:23:57.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not become anxious . . . ,

00:23:57.248 --> 00:24:00.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what you are to speak will be given you.”

00:24:00.751 --> 00:24:03.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t know how Jehovah would do it,

00:24:03.963 --> 00:24:06.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I put my trust in him.

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:10.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he showed me that I have nothing to fear.

00:24:15.766 --> 00:24:20.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our Shepherd has promised
to give us the right words at the right time.

00:24:21.230 --> 00:24:25.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Inscribe his thoughts on your heart now
before the trial,

00:24:25.484 --> 00:24:27.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’ll have nothing to fear.

00:24:28.112 --> 00:24:32.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Joerg began to study the Bible
with Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:24:32.116 --> 00:24:35.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s thoughts were inscribed on his heart.

00:24:35.286 --> 00:24:37.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
He needed to make a choice:

00:24:37.496 --> 00:24:40.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
serve in the army or serve God.

00:24:41.125 --> 00:24:44.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would he find the strength
to completely change his life?

00:24:44.587 --> 00:24:45.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see.

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was born in northern Germany.

00:24:50.593 --> 00:24:53.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t have a really good relationship
with my father

00:24:53.471 --> 00:24:56.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he drank a lot

00:24:56.015 --> 00:24:58.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and very often he was mean to me.

00:24:59.727 --> 00:25:00.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:25:00.978 --> 00:25:03.773 line:10% position:50% align:center
my mother, really, she was kind and lovely.

00:25:03.773 --> 00:25:05.149 line:10% position:50% align:center
And I can tell you,

00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:06.650 line:10% position:50% align:center
I loved my mother

00:25:06.650 --> 00:25:08.277 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the bottom of my heart.

00:25:09.362 --> 00:25:14.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, the doctors diagnosed
that she had cancer,

00:25:14.325 --> 00:25:17.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
and only a few days later,

00:25:17.244 --> 00:25:19.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
she died and she was gone.

00:25:19.455 --> 00:25:22.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this was horrible for me, I tell you.

00:25:25.211 --> 00:25:27.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt completely empty, no hope,

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:28.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
angry.

00:25:28.631 --> 00:25:29.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t understand.

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:31.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, I couldn’t get it

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how God can be so hurtful to others

00:25:34.512 --> 00:25:38.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
and take the best of what I had in my life,
just take it away.

00:25:40.017 --> 00:25:44.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hated everything around me.

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:46.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would never trust anyone.

00:25:46.357 --> 00:25:50.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
And especially,
I also completely lost trust in God.

00:25:51.737 --> 00:25:55.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, therefore,
I decided to go to the German Air Force.

00:25:57.118 --> 00:25:59.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
It started with basic training.

00:26:00.871 --> 00:26:03.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the idea is that we have to follow orders.

00:26:03.207 --> 00:26:05.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t matter what happens.

00:26:05.251 --> 00:26:08.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
So special training
was also hand-to-hand combat.

00:26:08.629 --> 00:26:10.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this gives you a lot of confidence.

00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:13.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
You think nobody can hurt you once again.

00:26:13.175 --> 00:26:15.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
You feel very strong.

00:26:15.719 --> 00:26:17.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember a situation:

00:26:17.304 --> 00:26:19.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were outside in the woods,

00:26:19.974 --> 00:26:22.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this was a part of the survival training.

00:26:22.601 --> 00:26:24.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt indestructible

00:26:24.728 --> 00:26:26.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was very proud of myself.

00:26:27.815 --> 00:26:30.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a little later on in my military career,

00:26:30.401 --> 00:26:34.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was working with the missile launch crew.

00:26:34.530 --> 00:26:36.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,

00:26:36.532 --> 00:26:40.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized
that just with one launch of this missile,

00:26:40.744 --> 00:26:44.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could be responsible
for killing thousands of people.

00:26:45.666 --> 00:26:49.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
When all this came to my mind,
I started to think:

00:26:49.295 --> 00:26:52.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is it possible
that there is a God who exists?

00:26:52.465 --> 00:26:54.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And if so,

00:26:54.091 --> 00:26:57.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
what would he think about my work
—what I am doing here?’

00:26:58.345 --> 00:27:02.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was in my family my aunt
who once told me:

00:27:02.558 --> 00:27:05.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dieter, if someday you would like

00:27:05.561 --> 00:27:07.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to know something more about God
or about the Bible,

00:27:07.855 --> 00:27:10.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you have to contact Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:27:10.316 --> 00:27:11.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They know exactly

00:27:11.859 --> 00:27:13.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what the prophecy is from the Bible,

00:27:13.527 --> 00:27:15.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this can give you hope.”

00:27:15.446 --> 00:27:17.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
And from then on, I studied the Bible

00:27:17.823 --> 00:27:20.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I also went to the meetings with them.

00:27:20.951 --> 00:27:24.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at one meeting,
my wife, Elvia, was sitting beside me

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:28.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was sure
I had to make a big change

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:32.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be with these people
who love Jehovah God,

00:27:32.379 --> 00:27:36.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
since I was still working
for the German Air Force.

00:27:38.093 --> 00:27:42.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided officially
to refuse the military service

00:27:42.473 --> 00:27:44.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
because my conscience bothered me.

00:27:44.517 --> 00:27:48.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt really confident
that this was the right decision to make.

00:27:48.812 --> 00:27:52.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
So at that court date
(and this was surprising for me),

00:27:52.775 --> 00:27:55.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
they told me that my request

00:27:55.778 --> 00:27:57.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be rejected.

00:27:58.948 --> 00:28:02.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I refused
to go on with my military service,

00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:04.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would be sent to prison.

00:28:05.371 --> 00:28:07.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really didn’t know what to do,

00:28:07.373 --> 00:28:11.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I saw that Jehovah took over.

00:28:12.294 --> 00:28:14.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
My site commander told me:
“Do you know what?

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have a solution for you.

00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:18.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can appeal the court decision.”

00:28:18.926 --> 00:28:22.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
He offered me an office job.

00:28:22.388 --> 00:28:26.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the only thing I would have to do
was paperwork.

00:28:27.434 --> 00:28:30.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the shift was eight hours,
but I was finished after two hours

00:28:30.521 --> 00:28:32.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I was done with this.

00:28:32.523 --> 00:28:37.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
For six months
(five days a week, six hours a day)

00:28:37.152 --> 00:28:39.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just studying and studying.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt
not only that I drew closer to Jehovah,

00:28:43.659 --> 00:28:47.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I was also convinced now
that in the past,

00:28:47.496 --> 00:28:49.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was just relying on myself.

00:28:49.873 --> 00:28:51.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
I trusted only me.

00:28:51.625 --> 00:28:54.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now I got the opportunity

00:28:54.336 --> 00:28:58.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lay everything out, what I needed,
to Jehovah.

00:28:59.883 --> 00:29:03.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elvia and I,
we got in really deep discussions.

00:29:03.178 --> 00:29:05.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I was in prison and she was alone,

00:29:05.306 --> 00:29:09.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was wondering
how she could take care of herself.

00:29:10.144 --> 00:29:12.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I have to go to prison,

00:29:12.146 --> 00:29:15.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’d still stick to Jehovah and to his ways.

00:29:18.068 --> 00:29:20.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the court date arrived,

00:29:20.112 --> 00:29:22.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Jehovah,

00:29:22.448 --> 00:29:24.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please, Jehovah,
give me the strength and also the wisdom

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:28.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the right words
to glorify your name.”

00:29:30.164 --> 00:29:33.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
After the hearing,
the presiding judge told me,

00:29:33.667 --> 00:29:37.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the decision is made,
it will be final.”

00:29:38.255 --> 00:29:42.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
So back in my unit,
the next days were horrible.

00:29:42.134 --> 00:29:45.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,
my site commander came into my office,

00:29:45.804 --> 00:29:48.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he had a very, very serious face.

00:29:48.891 --> 00:29:49.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wow!

00:29:49.933 --> 00:29:51.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew what was coming up.

00:29:51.477 --> 00:29:54.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was seeing myself already behind bars.

00:29:54.313 --> 00:29:56.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, surprisingly, he told me:

00:29:56.690 --> 00:30:00.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hey, this is sad news for me.

00:30:00.402 --> 00:30:02.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The decision is made.

00:30:02.488 --> 00:30:04.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are free to go,

00:30:04.323 --> 00:30:07.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will lose
the best officer that I have.”

00:30:08.619 --> 00:30:11.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this moment, wow!

00:30:11.455 --> 00:30:13.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember the tears coming out.

00:30:13.749 --> 00:30:18.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t hold it back,
and I was so thankful to Jehovah.

00:30:18.712 --> 00:30:22.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I felt, really,
it was the best decision I made,

00:30:22.841 --> 00:30:25.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stick to Jehovah and not to man.

00:30:26.178 --> 00:30:28.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elvia and I,

00:30:28.222 --> 00:30:31.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
we dedicated our lives completely to Jehovah,

00:30:31.809 --> 00:30:34.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now we’ve had the privilege to serve him

00:30:34.186 --> 00:30:36.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
almost 50 years together.

00:30:36.855 --> 00:30:41.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture at Isaiah 40:10, 11

00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:43.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
really comes to my mind:

00:30:43.237 --> 00:30:45.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah will come with power . . .

00:30:45.572 --> 00:30:47.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like a shepherd he will care for his flock.”

00:30:47.908 --> 00:30:50.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
And certainly he did.

00:30:50.494 --> 00:30:54.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t matter
what Satan ever brings to you.

00:30:54.039 --> 00:30:58.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
This relying on Jehovah
always leads to success.

00:30:59.503 --> 00:31:03.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Brother Hoecker
gradually progressed spiritually,

00:31:03.048 --> 00:31:06.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
he made decisions to match God’s standards.

00:31:06.885 --> 00:31:09.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
He specifically asked Jehovah

00:31:09.054 --> 00:31:12.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the power to follow through
on his decisions.

00:31:12.224 --> 00:31:16.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re happy that with time
and Jehovah’s help,

00:31:16.186 --> 00:31:20.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was able to bring his life
in harmony with Jehovah’s standards.

00:31:21.233 --> 00:31:25.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if our choice
is not about right or wrong?

00:31:25.612 --> 00:31:28.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if it’s more about
choosing from many options?

00:31:29.199 --> 00:31:32.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this episode
of <i>Lessons From The Watchtower,</i>

00:31:32.453 --> 00:31:36.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
see how these young people
were able to use Bible principles

00:31:36.081 --> 00:31:38.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
when choosing employment.

00:31:51.555 --> 00:31:53.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I first started having

00:31:53.724 --> 00:31:55.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
some health problems,

00:31:55.225 --> 00:31:57.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
my biggest concern was my goals.

00:32:00.397 --> 00:32:05.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
With health situations,
it’s easy to get overwhelmed.

00:32:06.278 --> 00:32:08.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve had to find a part-time job

00:32:09.948 --> 00:32:12.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is agreeable to my pioneering schedule
and to my energy levels.

00:32:15.537 --> 00:32:17.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was offered after high school

00:32:17.164 --> 00:32:21.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
the opportunity to attend
a prestigious university for no cost.

00:32:23.212 --> 00:32:27.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah invites you to rely on him,
not to rely on yourself.

00:32:30.385 --> 00:32:33.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Growing up,
my family didn’t have a lot materially.

00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:36.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
It caused me to have a tendency

00:32:36.892 --> 00:32:39.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
to want to rely on myself instead of Jehovah.

00:32:41.104 --> 00:32:44.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that I needed to have
more trust in Jehovah,

00:32:44.191 --> 00:32:47.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that was going to require
working on my faith.

00:32:48.987 --> 00:32:52.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Israelites were given
a wonderful provision from Jehovah

00:32:52.366 --> 00:32:55.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they were hungry and in need of food
—manna—

00:32:56.411 --> 00:32:58.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they had to show contentment

00:32:58.622 --> 00:33:01.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
throughout the whole 40 years
of them being in the wilderness.

00:33:02.251 --> 00:33:03.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not ideal

00:33:03.877 --> 00:33:05.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have to cut back on things
for financial reasons.

00:33:05.963 --> 00:33:09.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
But being OK with it and adapting to it

00:33:09.299 --> 00:33:12.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that shows Jehovah
that we’re content with what he’s given us,

00:33:12.761 --> 00:33:15.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it helps us to be able to enjoy life

00:33:15.347 --> 00:33:17.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy our full-time ministry that way.

00:33:18.559 --> 00:33:20.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
I appreciated David’s example

00:33:20.477 --> 00:33:24.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he stuck to Jehovah
through several trials

00:33:24.064 --> 00:33:26.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
and each time he saw Jehovah’s hand.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I thought,

00:33:28.026 --> 00:33:32.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘That must have impressed on him
the importance of relying on Jehovah,

00:33:32.739 --> 00:33:35.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and it probably helped him

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have faith that Jehovah
was going to be there again the next time.’

00:33:39.538 --> 00:33:43.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were pioneering in our hometown;
we had everything we needed.

00:33:43.417 --> 00:33:47.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was set up with a job
where I could work three days a week,

00:33:47.588 --> 00:33:49.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was the perfect pioneer job.

00:33:49.339 --> 00:33:51.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we wanted something more,

00:33:51.091 --> 00:33:53.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we decided to move
where the need was greater

00:33:53.343 --> 00:33:54.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Chinese field.

00:33:54.761 --> 00:33:57.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided to find a part-time job

00:33:57.055 --> 00:33:59.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
that provided the means necessary

00:33:59.308 --> 00:34:02.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pay for things like food and clothing.

00:34:02.185 --> 00:34:04.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, really, it was going to provide me
with an opportunity

00:34:04.563 --> 00:34:07.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
to focus on that service to Jehovah.

00:34:07.024 --> 00:34:10.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
After some time, I realized
that the job I had originally taken

00:34:10.736 --> 00:34:14.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not providing what I needed anymore.

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:16.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
A change was necessary.

00:34:16.658 --> 00:34:21.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
So another opportunity came up
to pursue higher education.

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:24.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
While I was considering my options,
a friend recommended a job

00:34:24.124 --> 00:34:27.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
that required
a little bit of vocational training

00:34:27.377 --> 00:34:30.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
but would pay to cover my expenses.

00:34:33.133 --> 00:34:35.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 23:1

00:34:35.510 --> 00:34:38.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
has absolutely been true for us.

00:34:38.305 --> 00:34:39.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s never been a moment

00:34:39.973 --> 00:34:41.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we went hungry.

00:34:41.683 --> 00:34:43.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s never been a moment

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we didn’t have what we needed.

00:34:46.647 --> 00:34:48.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
And challenges have come up,

00:34:48.857 --> 00:34:52.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he’s always led us
through those challenges

00:34:52.069 --> 00:34:54.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped us to overcome them.

00:34:54.363 --> 00:34:57.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to find a way
to work remotely from home

00:34:57.824 --> 00:35:00.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I could control my energy level

00:35:00.243 --> 00:35:03.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I could control my own schedule.

00:35:04.373 --> 00:35:06.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ministry has been such a comfort

00:35:06.750 --> 00:35:08.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
since as far back as I can remember.

00:35:08.335 --> 00:35:11.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
For any trials we face,
just going in service,

00:35:11.964 --> 00:35:13.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
we always come home smiling.

00:35:15.092 --> 00:35:18.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
For us, it was always,
“If you can do it, do it

00:35:18.887 --> 00:35:21.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it will make you happy
and will make life more enjoyable.”

00:35:22.724 --> 00:35:25.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Working at the Assembly Hall
is an enormous privilege.

00:35:25.644 --> 00:35:28.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s great to work in Jehovah’s organization

00:35:28.063 --> 00:35:30.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to see how it works, to receive training.

00:35:30.649 --> 00:35:32.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, at the same time,

00:35:32.192 --> 00:35:35.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s an opportunity to meet even more people

00:35:35.737 --> 00:35:37.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are all putting Jehovah first.

00:35:38.323 --> 00:35:39.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back on it, I realize

00:35:39.908 --> 00:35:43.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah gave us
that time to work for him

00:35:43.036 --> 00:35:45.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he could show his power to us

00:35:45.247 --> 00:35:47.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a way that was undeniable.

00:35:47.332 --> 00:35:51.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
When this <i>Watchtower </i> came out, I said,
“Everything is true.”

00:35:52.129 --> 00:35:54.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, every single principle—

00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:56.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Taste and see that Jehovah is good,”

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:01.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ‘Jehovah is my Shepherd;
I’ll lack nothing’—it’s all true.

00:36:01.596 --> 00:36:05.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
My experience in my life
has been a testimony to that.

00:36:22.284 --> 00:36:26.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
These young ones
have lives filled with purpose and joy

00:36:26.246 --> 00:36:29.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are truly “lack[ing] nothing” good.

00:36:29.374 --> 00:36:33.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice how they worked
in harmony with their prayers?

00:36:34.046 --> 00:36:38.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lett discussed specific ways
we can work with Jehovah’s hand

00:36:38.925 --> 00:36:40.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this Morning Worship program.

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:44.306 line:10% position:50% align:center
The theme for this discussion is

00:36:44.306 --> 00:36:48.435 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s Hand Is Awe-Inspiring!”

00:36:49.352 --> 00:36:53.065 line:10% position:50% align:center
The human hand is an amazing creation.

00:36:53.065 --> 00:36:56.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
It enables us to apply the power of our arm

00:36:56.568 --> 00:36:59.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
in very dexterous and versatile ways.

00:36:59.988 --> 00:37:02.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can swing a sledgehammer.

00:37:02.657 --> 00:37:05.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can thread a tiny sewing needle.

00:37:05.202 --> 00:37:08.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
The human hand is far superior

00:37:08.872 --> 00:37:10.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
to any animal’s hand.

00:37:10.957 --> 00:37:13.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
One advantage only humans have

00:37:13.752 --> 00:37:15.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
is an opposing thumb

00:37:15.962 --> 00:37:19.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can easily touch our four other fingers.

00:37:19.841 --> 00:37:22.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate the human hand’s superiority,

00:37:22.969 --> 00:37:25.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
imagine an ape
(whose hand you see here)

00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:29.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to take a pen
and precisely sign his name

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:33.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
or trying to throw a curveball
with a baseball.

00:37:34.189 --> 00:37:37.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as amazing as the human hand is,

00:37:37.776 --> 00:37:41.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s hand is far more amazing.

00:37:41.655 --> 00:37:44.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, it is awe-inspiring.

00:37:44.991 --> 00:37:47.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what is Jehovah’s hand?

00:37:47.077 --> 00:37:49.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here’s one definition:

00:37:49.079 --> 00:37:51.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s hand is his ability

00:37:51.373 --> 00:37:55.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply the great power of his holy spirit

00:37:55.085 --> 00:37:57.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
in various ways.

00:37:57.087 --> 00:38:00.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
let’s discuss four examples

00:38:00.132 --> 00:38:03.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah using his awe-inspiring hand

00:38:03.301 --> 00:38:07.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
to apply the great power of his holy spirit.

00:38:07.264 --> 00:38:10.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then after we discuss each one,

00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll comment just briefly
on how we can work in harmony

00:38:13.687 --> 00:38:16.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this specific use of Jehovah’s hand.

00:38:16.731 --> 00:38:20.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s go to Proverbs 21,
today’s Scripture text.

00:38:20.443 --> 00:38:22.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it again

00:38:22.571 --> 00:38:24.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Proverbs 21:1:

00:38:24.573 --> 00:38:26.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A king’s heart

00:38:26.575 --> 00:38:30.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is like streams of water in Jehovah’s hand.

00:38:30.954 --> 00:38:35.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
He directs it wherever He pleases.”

00:38:35.292 --> 00:38:36.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is this telling us?

00:38:36.585 --> 00:38:39.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in order to accomplish his will,

00:38:39.379 --> 00:38:43.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can maneuver the heart
of any government official

00:38:43.258 --> 00:38:46.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
to do something
or not to do something.

00:38:46.011 --> 00:38:48.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s one Bible example:

00:38:48.430 --> 00:38:51.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Persian King Artaxerxes

00:38:51.057 --> 00:38:54.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
granted all of Ezra’s requests.

00:38:54.186 --> 00:38:56.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazingly, he did this

00:38:56.521 --> 00:39:00.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
about going to Jerusalem
and advancing pure worship.

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what motivated the king’s heart
to do this?

00:39:03.612 --> 00:39:05.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ezra knew where the credit belonged.

00:39:05.864 --> 00:39:08.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ezra 7:27, he said:

00:39:08.617 --> 00:39:11.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah . . . be praised,

00:39:11.369 --> 00:39:13.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who put it into the heart of the king

00:39:13.705 --> 00:39:17.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
to beautify the house of Jehovah
in Jerusalem!”

00:39:17.375 --> 00:39:21.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s just one Bible example
of many that could be discussed.

00:39:21.254 --> 00:39:22.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now our question is,

00:39:22.881 --> 00:39:27.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we work in harmony
with this use of Jehovah’s hand?

00:39:27.219 --> 00:39:28.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,

00:39:28.845 --> 00:39:32.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can pray,
if it be Jehovah’s will,

00:39:32.641 --> 00:39:37.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he maneuver
the hearts of government officials

00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:41.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make decisions
that will benefit Jehovah’s people.

00:39:41.775 --> 00:39:45.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can also pray
for Jehovah to move the hearts of officials

00:39:45.946 --> 00:39:49.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
to treat our imprisoned brothers kindly.

00:39:49.908 --> 00:39:54.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s in harmony with Hebrews 13:3,
which is a beautiful scripture:

00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep in mind those in prison,

00:39:56.915 --> 00:39:59.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
as though you were imprisoned with them.”

00:39:59.876 --> 00:40:01.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, isn’t that interesting?

00:40:01.461 --> 00:40:05.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep in mind those in prison,
as though you were imprisoned with them.”

00:40:05.924 --> 00:40:08.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s go to Isaiah 41,

00:40:08.385 --> 00:40:13.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll get our second example
of how Jehovah can use his hand.

00:40:13.056 --> 00:40:16.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 41:10, the <i>B</i>  part,

00:40:16.559 --> 00:40:18.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says:

00:40:18.561 --> 00:40:21.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:40:21.439 --> 00:40:25.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:40:25.777 --> 00:40:29.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then look at verse 13:
“For I, Jehovah your God,

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:32.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“am grasping your right hand,

00:40:32.784 --> 00:40:34.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One saying to you,

00:40:34.786 --> 00:40:37.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Do not be afraid.
I will help you.’”

00:40:37.789 --> 00:40:40.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, interestingly,
this scripture is not talking

00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:42.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah taking his right hand

00:40:42.335 --> 00:40:45.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grabbing our left hand,

00:40:45.171 --> 00:40:47.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
as would be true in walking side by side.

00:40:47.882 --> 00:40:51.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
But rather, Jehovah takes his right hand
and grabs our right hand,

00:40:51.052 --> 00:40:55.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
as would be true
of Jehovah pulling us up and out of a pit.

00:40:56.516 --> 00:40:58.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we learn from this?

00:40:58.643 --> 00:41:02.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Jehovah can rescue us

00:41:02.272 --> 00:41:04.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
from any situation,

00:41:04.316 --> 00:41:09.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter how hopeless,
how desperate, it might seem.

00:41:09.112 --> 00:41:10.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now our question is,

00:41:10.822 --> 00:41:15.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we work in harmony
with this specific use of Jehovah’s hand?

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:19.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for one thing,
we can supplicate Jehovah

00:41:19.331 --> 00:41:21.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
to rescue us

00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:25.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
in times of test, trial, temptation.

00:41:25.086 --> 00:41:29.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we can avail ourselves
of the help that comes our way,

00:41:29.132 --> 00:41:31.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
in effect,
reaching out with our right hand

00:41:31.384 --> 00:41:34.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
and grasping Jehovah’s right hand.

00:41:34.304 --> 00:41:38.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, let’s go to Psalm 145
for our third example.

00:41:39.267 --> 00:41:42.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 145:16

00:41:42.604 --> 00:41:44.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
says of Jehovah:

00:41:44.773 --> 00:41:47.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You open your hand

00:41:47.942 --> 00:41:52.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
and satisfy the desire
of every living thing.”

00:41:52.822 --> 00:41:54.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is this telling us?

00:41:54.866 --> 00:41:56.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah can use his hand

00:41:56.993 --> 00:42:00.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
to express tremendous generosity.

00:42:00.205 --> 00:42:02.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s true that this scripture
will be completely fulfilled

00:42:02.665 --> 00:42:03.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the new world.

00:42:03.666 --> 00:42:05.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even now,

00:42:05.001 --> 00:42:09.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah freely uses his hand
to express generosity.

00:42:09.339 --> 00:42:13.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is the most magnanimous Giver
in the universe

00:42:13.468 --> 00:42:17.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nothing stingy or tightfisted
about Jehovah.

00:42:17.722 --> 00:42:21.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives emotionally,
he gives materially,

00:42:21.810 --> 00:42:23.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
and especially spiritually.

00:42:23.937 --> 00:42:27.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
The ground we walk on,
the food we eat,

00:42:27.232 --> 00:42:31.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
the air we breathe
—it all comes from Jehovah.

00:42:31.027 --> 00:42:34.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
That makes me think of the atheist
who arrogantly said:

00:42:34.322 --> 00:42:36.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t need God.

00:42:36.449 --> 00:42:38.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I don’t need anybody.

00:42:38.618 --> 00:42:40.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t need anything.”

00:42:40.787 --> 00:42:43.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he took a deep breath.

00:42:43.873 --> 00:42:46.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
How shortsighted indeed!

00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:49.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now our question is,

00:42:49.045 --> 00:42:53.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we work in harmony
with this use of Jehovah’s hand?

00:42:53.383 --> 00:42:55.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, by being generous toward others

00:42:55.885 --> 00:42:59.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
—being willing to give unstintingly

00:42:59.556 --> 00:43:02.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our time, energy, resources.

00:43:02.809 --> 00:43:07.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
And think about this:
If we are closefisted with others,

00:43:07.021 --> 00:43:10.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
not only are we not imitating
our generous God

00:43:10.233 --> 00:43:12.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
as beloved children

00:43:12.235 --> 00:43:15.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also Jehovah
can’t put anything in our hand.

00:43:16.239 --> 00:43:18.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:43:18.324 --> 00:43:21.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re openhanded with others,

00:43:21.744 --> 00:43:25.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
now Jehovah can put something in our hand.

00:43:26.416 --> 00:43:29.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s identify one more way
Jehovah uses his hand.

00:43:29.794 --> 00:43:32.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to Exodus chapter 15, please,

00:43:34.841 --> 00:43:38.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 6, the <i>B</i>  part:

00:43:38.803 --> 00:43:41.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your right hand, O Jehovah,

00:43:41.723 --> 00:43:45.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
can shatter an enemy.”

00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:47.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we learn?

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:49.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminds us of how many times in the past

00:43:49.606 --> 00:43:51.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has used his hand

00:43:51.608 --> 00:43:56.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
to smash to irreparable pieces his enemies.

00:43:56.112 --> 00:43:59.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it assures us he will do so

00:43:59.115 --> 00:44:03.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
in an even more awe-inspiring way
in the near future.

00:44:03.244 --> 00:44:05.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the great tribulation,

00:44:05.246 --> 00:44:09.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will use his hand
to maneuver many of the wicked

00:44:09.751 --> 00:44:14.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
to actually use their physical hands 
to slaughter each other.

00:44:14.422 --> 00:44:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then he will use his hand
to wield the forces of nature,

00:44:18.968 --> 00:44:21.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use the immortal Christ,

00:44:21.179 --> 00:44:25.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
the immortal 144,000,
and the mighty angels.

00:44:25.266 --> 00:44:28.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will use them to sweep away,

00:44:28.895 --> 00:44:30.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
sweep out of existence,

00:44:30.897 --> 00:44:35.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
the rest of the wicked
along with this entire wicked system.

00:44:36.194 --> 00:44:39.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we work in harmony
with this use of Jehovah’s hand?

00:44:39.572 --> 00:44:41.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, one way is very important.

00:44:41.616 --> 00:44:44.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can work hard to help people

00:44:44.494 --> 00:44:47.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
take a stand with Jehovah
and learn the truth

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:52.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they don’t have to be removed
by Jehovah’s almighty hand.

00:44:52.835 --> 00:44:56.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this brings great delight to Jehovah
when we do this

00:44:56.673 --> 00:45:01.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Jehovah takes no delight
in even “the death of the wicked.”

00:45:01.177 --> 00:45:03.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what he takes delight in

00:45:03.179 --> 00:45:07.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that ‘someone wicked
turns back from his way and keeps living.’

00:45:08.726 --> 00:45:11.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we have now discussed four ways

00:45:11.729 --> 00:45:14.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah can use his awe-inspiring hand:

00:45:14.941 --> 00:45:19.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
maneuver government officials
according to his will,

00:45:19.237 --> 00:45:21.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
rescue his people,

00:45:21.239 --> 00:45:23.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
give generously,

00:45:23.241 --> 00:45:25.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
and shatter his enemies.

00:45:25.618 --> 00:45:29.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the Bible does describe many other ways
Jehovah uses his hand.

00:45:29.998 --> 00:45:33.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why not make
identifying some of these other ways

00:45:33.251 --> 00:45:35.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
a future study project?

00:45:35.253 --> 00:45:37.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll give you a little bit of homework.

00:45:37.463 --> 00:45:40.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
But may all of us be determined

00:45:40.883 --> 00:45:45.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use our physical and figurative hand

00:45:45.221 --> 00:45:47.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
to always work in harmony

00:45:47.223 --> 00:45:50.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s awe-inspiring hand.

00:45:51.686 --> 00:45:55.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s hand truly is awe-inspiring.

00:45:55.732 --> 00:45:59.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has done and will do amazing things.

00:45:59.277 --> 00:46:01.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will lead us “to tranquil waters”

00:46:01.988 --> 00:46:05.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if our lives feel like a raging sea.

00:46:06.034 --> 00:46:09.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video
is an uplifting reminder

00:46:09.621 --> 00:46:13.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the peace we can have now
thanks to our Shepherd.

00:46:15.209 --> 00:46:24.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
I open my eyes to the bluest skies
that I’ve ever seen before.

00:46:26.262 --> 00:46:31.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s nothing to fear,
and ev’ryone is here.

00:46:31.893 --> 00:46:36.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on out;
let’s go explore.

00:46:36.981 --> 00:46:46.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s climb the highest mountaintop
and take it all in.

00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:57.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every single gift we have
Jehovah’s given.

00:46:57.502 --> 00:47:03.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for now,
we will wait for that day when

00:47:03.591 --> 00:47:14.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will raise our heads and lift our voices
when this old world’s behind.

00:47:14.268 --> 00:47:24.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah opens up his hands,
imagine what we’ll find

00:47:24.862 --> 00:47:27.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the real life!

00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:47.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hands in the dirt, building a whole new earth—
we’ve been given a new start.

00:47:49.137 --> 00:47:58.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Joy in the air, people laughing ev’rywhere—
and the sound fills up my heart.

00:48:00.064 --> 00:48:09.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one will ever make you cry—
except the good kind.

00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:23.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
This Paradise lights up your smile,
and it shines; it shines.

00:48:23.337 --> 00:48:33.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we will raise our heads and lift our voices
when this old world’s behind.

00:48:34.098 --> 00:48:44.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah opens up his hands,
imagine what we’ll find

00:48:44.734 --> 00:48:47.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the real life!

00:48:55.870 --> 00:49:06.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for now,
I’ll keep this picture safe and sound in my mind.

00:49:07.006 --> 00:49:18.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon will come
the day that we’ve been waiting for all our lives

00:49:18.476 --> 00:49:29.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we will raise our heads and lift our voices
when this old world’s behind.

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:40.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah opens up his hands,
imagine what we’ll find!

00:49:40.498 --> 00:49:51.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will raise our heads and lift our voices
when this old world’s behind.

00:49:51.551 --> 00:50:01.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jehovah opens up his hands,
imagine what we’ll find

00:50:01.435 --> 00:50:04.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the real life!

00:50:04.564 --> 00:50:09.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will find—we will find
The real life.

00:50:09.902 --> 00:50:15.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will find—we will find
The real life.

00:50:15.449 --> 00:50:20.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will find—we will find
The real life.

00:50:20.997 --> 00:50:26.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will find—we will find
The real life.

00:50:28.421 --> 00:50:32.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon will come the day
when every one of Jehovah’s sheep

00:50:32.425 --> 00:50:35.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
will experience goodness all their days.

00:50:35.177 --> 00:50:38.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Until then, what must we do?

00:50:38.764 --> 00:50:41.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay in the Shepherd’s warm embrace.

00:50:41.851 --> 00:50:46.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his arms, he protects us from dangers,
small and large.

00:50:46.856 --> 00:50:48.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his pastures,

00:50:48.691 --> 00:50:51.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
he feeds us nourishing spiritual food

00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:54.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we have the strength to make a stand.

00:50:55.197 --> 00:50:58.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
With his hand,
he gives generously

00:50:58.451 --> 00:51:00.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we lack nothing good.

00:51:01.787 --> 00:51:05.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we conclude,
let’s visit Liechtenstein,

00:51:05.583 --> 00:51:09.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
located between Switzerland and Austria.

00:51:09.378 --> 00:51:13.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be long in name,
but it’s small in size.

00:51:13.841 --> 00:51:16.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the sixth smallest country in the world,

00:51:16.552 --> 00:51:20.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
it has a population
of just over 39,000 people.

00:51:21.515 --> 00:51:26.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite being flanked
by snowy mountains on the east and south,

00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:29.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
the cities in the valleys below
enjoy a comfortable climate

00:51:29.774 --> 00:51:32.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of the warm air called foehn winds

00:51:32.944 --> 00:51:35.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
flowing downward from the summits.

00:51:36.447 --> 00:51:39.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re interested
in trekking the rugged terrain,

00:51:39.533 --> 00:51:42.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
be sure to have a hearty meal beforehand.

00:51:42.078 --> 00:51:44.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can try ribel,

00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:47.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
a traditional dish made with cornmeal

00:51:47.708 --> 00:51:51.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and served with applesauce,
making it a filling and hearty snack.

00:51:51.629 --> 00:51:53.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 95 publishers here

00:51:53.798 --> 00:51:58.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
trek the country and dispense
nourishing spiritual food along the way,

00:51:58.803 --> 00:52:03.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they also make a small journey
to Switzerland for their meetings.

00:52:03.015 --> 00:52:06.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
The closest Kingdom Hall
is right along the border.

00:52:06.227 --> 00:52:08.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although most of the population

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:11.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Roman Catholic,
our brothers still average

00:52:11.732 --> 00:52:13.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
26 Bible studies.

00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:16.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the path to preaching
has not always been smooth.

00:52:17.697 --> 00:52:19.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our history of preaching is full

00:52:19.782 --> 00:52:21.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
of uphill battles.

00:52:21.659 --> 00:52:24.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in the 1920’s, the government 

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:28.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
would try to arrest
anyone distributing our literature,

00:52:28.249 --> 00:52:30.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether it was
from house to house

00:52:30.167 --> 00:52:32.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even by letter.

00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:36.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one point,
all the publishers preaching in the country

00:52:36.257 --> 00:52:38.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
were arrested and detained on a bus.

00:52:38.801 --> 00:52:40.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did they do?

00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
They sang out to Jehovah!

00:52:43.222 --> 00:52:46.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
Undeterred and with dictators rising

00:52:46.308 --> 00:52:48.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
to power in the 1930’s,

00:52:48.185 --> 00:52:52.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
they courageously used the pamphlet
<i>Fascism or Freedom.</i>

00:52:53.232 --> 00:52:55.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though persecution was rampant,

00:52:55.359 --> 00:52:57.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were unstoppable.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:01.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the warm winds
blowing in from the mountains,

00:53:01.157 --> 00:53:03.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
the love of our brothers and sisters
can be felt everywhere.

00:53:04.952 --> 00:53:07.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s seen
in their regular Family Worship evenings,

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
before and after the meetings,

00:53:10.458 --> 00:53:13.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in their singing to Jehovah.

00:53:13.169 --> 00:53:17.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they wish to send that love to you,
the worldwide brotherhood.

00:53:18.466 --> 00:53:21.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:53:21.052 --> 00:53:23.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
