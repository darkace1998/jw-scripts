00:00.783 --> 00:05.788
I would first like to read to you 
some passages from the Bible 


00:05.788 --> 00:08.858
found at Ephesians chapter 3, 


00:08.858 --> 00:11.928
verses 14 through 19. 


00:11.928 --> 00:16.733
This will also establish the theme 
for my comments this month. 


00:16.733 --> 00:21.705
Ephesians 3, 
starting with verse 14, Paul said: 


00:21.705 --> 00:25.608
“For this reason 
I bend my knees to the Father, 


00:25.608 --> 00:30.580
“to whom every family in heaven 
and on earth owes its name. 


00:30.580 --> 00:34.483
“I pray that he may grant you 
through the abundance of his glory 


00:34.483 --> 00:37.786
“to be made mighty 
in the man you are inside, 


00:37.787 --> 00:40.057
“with power through his spirit, 


00:40.057 --> 00:44.760
“and that through your faith you may have 
the Christ dwell in your hearts with love. 


00:44.760 --> 00:48.765
“May you be rooted 
and established on the foundation, 


00:48.765 --> 00:52.802
“in order that with all the holy ones 
you may be thoroughly able 


00:52.802 --> 00:55.572
“to comprehend fully 
what is the breadth 


00:55.572 --> 00:58.374
“and length 
and height and depth, 


00:58.373 --> 01:02.978
“and to know the love of the Christ, 
which surpasses knowledge, 


01:02.978 --> 01:06.281
“so that you may be filled 
with all the fullness 


01:06.282 --> 01:08.552
that God gives.”


01:08.552 --> 01:10.554
Now, verse 15 


01:10.553 --> 01:13.890
is the inspiration 
for my theme, namely, 


01:13.890 --> 01:19.000
“Glorify Jehovah—The One 
to Whom Every Family Owes Its Name.” 


01:20.230 --> 01:25.235
The family unit is under a vicious attack 
in these last days. 


01:25.235 --> 01:28.370
The Insight book 
lived up to its name 


01:28.370 --> 01:30.973
under the heading “Family.” 


01:30.973 --> 01:35.378
The very insightful comment 
reads this way: 


01:35.378 --> 01:39.781
“The inspired Scriptures 
have foretold a vicious attack 


01:39.782 --> 01:44.787
“on the family institution 
with a consequent breaking down of morality


01:44.787 --> 01:49.792
and of human society 
outside the . . . congregation.” 


01:49.792 --> 01:54.464
The article pointed out 
that in “‘the last days’ 


01:54.463 --> 01:58.033
“a condition in which 
disobedience to parents, 


01:58.033 --> 02:03.038
“disloyalty, and absence 
of ‘natural affection’ would be rife, 


02:03.038 --> 02:07.643
even among those 
‘having a form of godly devotion.’”


02:07.643 --> 02:12.181
How can married couples, 
parents, and children 


02:12.182 --> 02:16.252
counteract 
such a diabolical attack? 


02:16.252 --> 02:21.257
Do you remember those verses 
we read in Ephesians chapter 3? 


02:21.257 --> 02:26.262
Verse 16 said that the One 
to whom every family owes its name, 


02:26.262 --> 02:29.599
Jehovah, would ‘grant us
 to be made mighty


02:29.598 --> 02:31.868
in the person we are inside.’ 


02:31.868 --> 02:34.770
Yes, Jehovah can give us 


02:34.770 --> 02:38.508
the internal 
spiritual strength to fight back 


02:38.508 --> 02:42.178
against Satan’s efforts 
to destroy the family. 


02:42.178 --> 02:44.180
How? 


02:44.180 --> 02:47.850
By being immersed in God’s Word. 


02:47.850 --> 02:51.553
In particular, 
by imitating the loving way 


02:51.553 --> 02:54.256
that Jesus treated his disciples. 


02:54.257 --> 02:58.127
Did you note 
that Ephesians 3:17 said 


02:58.127 --> 03:02.332
we are to “have the Christ 
dwell in [our] hearts with love”? 


03:02.332 --> 03:07.137
Yes, if each of us cherishes 
the Christ in our hearts 


03:07.137 --> 03:11.875
to the point that he dwells, 
or resides, there constantly, 


03:11.875 --> 03:14.410
our family 
will not only survive 


03:14.410 --> 03:17.380
but it will truly thrive. 


03:17.380 --> 03:21.517
This will be so evident 
that verse 17 further states 


03:21.517 --> 03:25.655
that we will “be rooted 
and established on the foundation.” 


03:25.655 --> 03:28.190
We will be solid! 


03:28.190 --> 03:32.062
And keep in mind 
that 1 Corinthians 3:11 says 


03:32.062 --> 03:34.997
that the “foundation” 
on which we build 


03:34.997 --> 03:37.434
“is Jesus Christ.”


03:37.433 --> 03:42.015
Then verse 18 
of Ephesians chapter 3 indicates that 


03:42.015 --> 03:46.042
our spiritual peripheral vision 
will be enhanced. 


03:46.042 --> 03:48.979
We will not 
have spiritual blind spots 


03:48.978 --> 03:53.048
that could allow the spirit of the world 
to creep into the family. 


03:53.048 --> 03:56.585
That verse says 
that we will “be thoroughly able 


03:56.585 --> 03:59.855
“to comprehend fully 
what is the breadth 


03:59.855 --> 04:02.458
and length 
and height and depth.” 


04:02.458 --> 04:06.728
All aspects of Jesus’ personality 
will come into play 


04:06.728 --> 04:09.565
as we interact 
with family members. 


04:09.565 --> 04:13.903
Finally, verse 19 
sums up the result when it says 


04:13.903 --> 04:18.573
that we would then 
have come “to know the love of the Christ, 


04:18.573 --> 04:20.910
which surpasses knowledge.” 


04:20.910 --> 04:24.413
Granted, 
knowledge is important, 


04:24.413 --> 04:27.683
but it is the application 


04:27.683 --> 04:31.686
of Christlike love 
that will preserve our family, 


04:31.687 --> 04:34.757
keeping it vibrantly intact.


04:34.757 --> 04:38.160
Family life 
in these critical last days 


04:38.160 --> 04:41.463
could be likened to those 
who suffer from diabetes. 


04:41.463 --> 04:43.933
It is believed 
that diabetes is caused 


04:43.933 --> 04:47.003
by both genetic 
and environmental factors. 


04:47.003 --> 04:51.073
Similarly, all in the family 
have inherited sin 


04:51.073 --> 04:53.876
and imperfection 
from our first human parents, 


04:53.877 --> 04:56.679
Adam and Eve, 
as if genetically. 


04:56.678 --> 05:01.150
However, we are also exposed 
to the ever more toxic 


05:01.150 --> 05:05.555
environmental factors 
of Satan’s evil world. 


05:05.555 --> 05:08.858
Most who suffer 
from a serious case of diabetes 


05:08.858 --> 05:11.126
need to use two methods 


05:11.127 --> 05:15.432
to successfully relieve the symptoms 
and lead a normal life.


05:15.432 --> 05:18.835
They have to watch their diet 
and, in many cases, 


05:18.835 --> 05:23.072
take an injection 
of insulin daily.


05:23.072 --> 05:26.342
Spiritually, 
we need to avoid the sickly, 


05:26.342 --> 05:30.480
sweet junk food 
that the world promotes in movies, 


05:30.480 --> 05:35.183
talk shows, 
the Internet, and in print. 


05:35.183 --> 05:37.920
Just as with the person 
who has diabetes, 


05:37.920 --> 05:40.857
this requires 
a permanent lifestyle change 


05:40.857 --> 05:44.460
from what we might have 
exposed ourselves to in the past. 


05:44.460 --> 05:46.728
In addition to avoiding 


05:46.728 --> 05:49.465
unwholesome junk food 
from Satan’s system,


05:49.465 --> 05:51.867
we also need 
to take daily “injections” 


05:51.867 --> 05:55.672
of God’s Word 
and other wholesome provisions. 


05:55.672 --> 05:58.674
This has become more 
and more important 


05:58.673 --> 06:02.000
the deeper we get 
into these last days.


06:03.612 --> 06:08.617
How has our organization provided this 
when it comes to family life? 


06:08.617 --> 06:12.155
Well, in the early 1900’s, 


06:12.155 --> 06:14.823
the focus was on preaching 
the good news. 


06:14.823 --> 06:16.825
Little attention was given 


06:16.825 --> 06:20.563
to building strong 
Christian marriages and families. 


06:20.563 --> 06:23.231
For a time, 
marriage was even discouraged 


06:23.232 --> 06:26.769
well beyond 
the intent of the Scriptures. 


06:26.768 --> 06:29.705
I did some checking, 
and commendably 


06:29.705 --> 06:33.342
between 1919 and 1921 


06:33.342 --> 06:36.212
there was a feature 
in the Golden Age magazine


06:36.212 --> 06:40.684
once or twice a month 
called the “Juvenile Bible Study.” 


06:40.683 --> 06:43.285
In 1920, 
a brochure was released 


06:43.285 --> 06:46.488
called The Golden Age ABC. 


06:46.488 --> 06:50.693
Then it wasn’t until 1941 
that the now famous book 


06:50.693 --> 06:52.961
entitled Children was handed out 


06:52.962 --> 06:56.899
to all young ones 
at the convention that year. 


06:56.898 --> 07:00.101
But as the last days progressed, 


07:00.102 --> 07:04.240
more and more information
 for families was produced. 


07:04.240 --> 07:07.310
For example, in the 1970’s, 


07:07.310 --> 07:10.847
the book Making Your Family Life Happy 
was released. 


07:10.847 --> 07:14.650
About the same time, 
the books Listening to the Great Teacher 


07:14.650 --> 07:18.453
and Your Youth—Getting the Best out of It 
were published. 


07:18.453 --> 07:22.391
In 1982, Awake! 
began a regular series 


07:22.392 --> 07:26.595
that has run for decades 
entitled “Young People Ask.” 


07:26.595 --> 07:30.933
We now have two up-to-date books 
with the same title, 


07:30.933 --> 07:35.871
and the series of articles 
continues on the jw.org website. 


07:35.872 --> 07:38.842
We have the book 
Learn From the Great Teacher 


07:38.842 --> 07:42.179
and so many features 
and activities for young ones 


07:42.178 --> 07:47.115
on the website that I would be out of time 
if I tried to enumerate them all. 


07:47.115 --> 07:50.452
There are also regular articles 
in our magazines 


07:50.452 --> 07:53.655
about marriage 
and family life. 


07:53.655 --> 07:58.660
And I will certainly never forget 
the privilege I had in 2012 


07:58.660 --> 08:03.532
to introduce the animated series 
Become Jehovah’s Friend. 


08:03.532 --> 08:05.869
That has proved 
to be a blessing 


08:05.868 --> 08:09.071
for both young ones 
and their parents. 


08:09.072 --> 08:13.877
What a teaching tool for both!


08:13.877 --> 08:18.414
In 2014, I attended 
the international convention 


08:18.413 --> 08:22.083
in Atlanta, Georgia, 
here in the United States. 


08:22.083 --> 08:25.555
After a little two-year-old girl 
saw my face 


08:25.555 --> 08:28.423
on the big jumbo screen 
giving a talk, 


08:28.423 --> 08:32.160
she eagerly started searching 
all around her for someone. 


08:32.160 --> 08:36.632
When her parents asked her 
who she was looking for, she said, “Caleb. 


08:36.632 --> 08:41.437
He must be here because I saw 
his grandfather giving a talk.” 


08:41.437 --> 08:43.705
Many children ask 


08:43.705 --> 08:47.310
to meet Caleb in person 
when they visit Bethel. 


08:47.310 --> 08:49.712
Two postings 
of an item every month 


08:49.712 --> 08:53.182
is making quite an impression 
on little hearts. 


08:53.182 --> 08:57.387
With Bible principles 
being impressed on the minds and hearts 


08:57.387 --> 09:01.590
of children so early, 
we prayerfully anticipate 


09:01.590 --> 09:06.462
many spiritually-minded teenagers 
in the years to come.


09:06.462 --> 09:10.867
We have so much 
healthy spiritual food 


09:10.867 --> 09:13.735
for counteracting 
family “diabetes.” 


09:13.735 --> 09:17.205
For this, 
we give all glory to Jehovah, 


09:17.205 --> 09:21.000
the one “to whom 
every family . . . owes its name.”


09:22.077 --> 09:26.082
One of the favorite passages 
of Scripture that anyone 


09:26.082 --> 09:31.020
professing to be Christian 
loves is the 23rd Psalm. 


09:31.020 --> 09:34.957
Family heads, can we benefit 


09:34.957 --> 09:37.827
from imitating not only 
the Fine Shepherd, Jesus, 


09:37.827 --> 09:42.030
but also the Great Shepherd, 
Jehovah God? 


09:42.030 --> 09:45.702
I am going to borrow 
the text of the 23rd Psalm 


09:45.702 --> 09:50.640
and adjust the words so that we 
can sense a family’s tranquillity 


09:50.640 --> 09:53.642
when headship 
is exercised properly. 


09:53.642 --> 09:56.779
In fact, you husbands, 


09:56.778 --> 10:01.516
as the script is read, 
imagine it is your wife’s voice 


10:01.517 --> 10:06.000
describing the effect 
your headship has on your family.


10:08.857 --> 10:12.260
‘[My husband] 
is [our] shepherd. 


10:12.260 --> 10:14.263
‘[We] will lack nothing. 


10:14.263 --> 10:18.200
‘In grassy pastures 
[refreshing recreation] 


10:18.200 --> 10:21.670
‘he makes [us] lie down; 
he leads [us] 


10:21.670 --> 10:26.475
‘to well-watered resting-places 
[meetings and conventions]. 


10:26.475 --> 10:29.145
‘He refreshes [us]. 


10:29.145 --> 10:31.680
‘He leads [us in the ministry] 


10:31.680 --> 10:36.218
‘in the paths of righteousness 
for the sake of [Jehovah’s] name. 


10:36.218 --> 10:40.856
‘Though [we] walk in the valley 
of deep [economic] shadow, 


10:40.857 --> 10:45.795
‘[we] fear no harm, 
for [Dad is] with [us]; 


10:45.795 --> 10:49.598
‘your rod and your staff 
[loving discipline] reassure [us]. 


10:49.598 --> 10:53.601
‘You prepare a table [of family worship, 
helping the children] 


10:53.602 --> 10:55.872
‘for [us] before [our] enemies. 


10:55.872 --> 10:58.840
‘You refresh 
[our] head[s] with oil; 


10:58.840 --> 11:03.245
‘[Our] cup 
[of family well-being] is well-filled. 


11:03.245 --> 11:07.583
‘Surely goodness and loyal love 
will pursue [our family] 


11:07.583 --> 11:11.320
‘all the days of [our] life, 
and [our family] 


11:11.320 --> 11:16.000
will dwell in the house 
of Jehovah for all [our] days.’ 


11:17.693 --> 11:21.230
No further application called for. 


11:21.230 --> 11:24.633
We feel the sense of security 
that envelops 


11:24.633 --> 11:29.171
the interior rooms 
of such a home, don’t we?


11:29.172 --> 11:31.907
Do you remember 
the point made 


11:31.907 --> 11:35.444
in Ephesians chapter 3, 
which we read earlier? 


11:35.443 --> 11:38.546
We are to treasure 
Jesus’ personality 


11:38.547 --> 11:41.250
and let it “dwell” 
in our hearts. 


11:41.250 --> 11:44.120
If all in the family 
make a determined effort 


11:44.120 --> 11:46.388
to treat each other 
like Jesus would, 


11:46.388 --> 11:49.325
we can conquer the world! 


11:49.325 --> 11:52.728
Yes, we—His spiritual family 
in heaven 


11:52.728 --> 11:56.265
and all humans on earth 
who dedicate their lives to Him


11:56.265 --> 11:58.467
—give glory to Jehovah! 


11:58.467 --> 12:01.470
Indeed, we thank Jehovah 


12:01.470 --> 12:05.273
for all the spiritual provisions 
he has made through his Word 


12:05.273 --> 12:10.278
and organization to protect every family 
who takes up his name. 


12:10.278 --> 12:13.415
May Jehovah bless 
all of you families 


12:13.415 --> 12:16.752
as you strive to win 
the war that Satan wages 


12:16.752 --> 12:30.917
against you 
in these last days.
