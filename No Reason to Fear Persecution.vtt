Please watch the following video

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that contains heartfelt comments

00:00:06.777 --> 00:00:08.445 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from persecuted brothers

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.656 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and sisters in Russia,

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:15.661 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and see why we have no reason
to fear persecution.

00:00:19.456 --> 00:00:22.459 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was horrified when several masked officers

00:00:22.459 --> 00:00:25.170 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
broke down two doors and burst into the home

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.256 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
where the meeting was being held.

00:00:27.256 --> 00:00:29.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everything happened at once

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—loud sounds, noise,

00:00:31.343 --> 00:00:34.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the order:
“Everyone sit on the floor!”

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was overcome with fear when they put me

00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:44.148 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in handcuffs, placed me in the police van,

00:00:44.148 --> 00:00:45.774 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and took me to jail.

00:00:45.774 --> 00:00:48.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid

00:00:48.652 --> 00:00:50.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
because I didn’t know how long

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.282 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I would be there and what was awaiting me.

00:00:53.282 --> 00:00:55.284 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I was being interrogated,

00:00:55.284 --> 00:00:57.286 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was afraid that I might be unfaithful

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:59.038 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah and let my brothers down.

00:01:00.414 --> 00:01:03.083 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
After being detained, I was mostly afraid

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:05.127 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about what I would face in prison

00:01:05.127 --> 00:01:09.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—whom I would encounter, how to act,
how others would treat me—

00:01:09.548 --> 00:01:11.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the unknown.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:18.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When one of the officers

00:01:18.849 --> 00:01:22.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
began to describe
how bad life is behind bars,

00:01:22.019 --> 00:01:23.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I imagined that behind the officer

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:25.522 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
stood an angel just like the one

00:01:25.522 --> 00:01:27.816 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
who supported Daniel in the illustration.

00:01:27.816 --> 00:01:29.818 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
This helped me to calm down

00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:31.862 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and not to panic or be afraid.

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:34.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s how Jehovah supported me.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At the first court appearance,

00:01:38.911 --> 00:01:41.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when I was brought out,
the brothers’ feelings

00:01:41.413 --> 00:01:45.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
impelled them to show support somehow,
and they began applauding.

00:01:45.167 --> 00:01:47.586 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How that encouraged me

00:01:47.586 --> 00:01:49.755 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that they were with me!

00:01:49.755 --> 00:01:53.175 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Fervent and sincere prayers to Jehovah

00:01:53.175 --> 00:01:55.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
helped me to cope with these fears.

00:01:55.803 --> 00:01:58.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 30:15

00:01:58.013 --> 00:02:00.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gave me much support.

00:02:00.015 --> 00:02:01.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I realized that tranquility

00:02:01.433 --> 00:02:02.851 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and trust in Jehovah

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.853 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
are now the most important things.

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:06.105 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Understanding this

00:02:06.105 --> 00:02:07.523 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
made things much easier for me.

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:12.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We took the elevator down to the first floor,

00:02:12.361 --> 00:02:14.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the doors opened,

00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there stood a large crowd

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:18.575 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of our brothers and sisters

00:02:18.575 --> 00:02:21.203 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—and they all began clapping.

00:02:21.203 --> 00:02:25.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When I saw that, my emotions just welled up,

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I got a lump in my throat.

00:02:28.752 --> 00:02:30.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt as if I had wings;

00:02:30.963 --> 00:02:34.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I felt the “great cloud of witnesses.”

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah
for calmness, courage, and wisdom

00:02:40.264 --> 00:02:43.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that he help me
not to bring reproach on his holy name.

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Almost immediately,
“the peace of God” came over me,

00:02:47.813 --> 00:02:49.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I was calm.

00:02:49.898 --> 00:02:52.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The unpleasant sensations did not go away,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I was no longer afraid.

00:02:57.156 --> 00:02:59.950 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
While overcoming our fear,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.577 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
my wife and I tried to go out

00:03:01.577 --> 00:03:03.579 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in service every day.

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.581 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When you don’t concentrate on yourself

00:03:05.581 --> 00:03:08.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but focus on helping others, fear disappears.

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:13.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something that helped me
to cope with my fears

00:03:13.005 --> 00:03:15.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is hope,

00:03:15.841 --> 00:03:19.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
looking at the situation
through Jehovah’s eyes,

00:03:19.178 --> 00:03:21.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
seeing what will happen next

00:03:21.805 --> 00:03:24.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is not the end of the situation,

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but only a difficult phase
through which you can pass.

00:03:29.897 --> 00:03:31.899 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I was helped to cope with my fear

00:03:31.899 --> 00:03:33.942 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
by the words of the song:

00:03:33.942 --> 00:03:35.944 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“Take one day at a time;

00:03:35.944 --> 00:03:38.072 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“leave tomorrow until tomorrow;

00:03:38.072 --> 00:03:40.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
peace is what I find.”

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I understood that it was important

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:44.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to solve problems as they came up

00:03:44.953 --> 00:03:48.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not to be troubled
by what might never happen.

00:03:48.373 --> 00:03:51.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Fear is interesting;

00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:54.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is, in principle, fear can be

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:56.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
inside a person, and if someone is afraid,

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:58.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is not shameful.

00:03:58.801 --> 00:04:00.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the question is,

00:04:00.511 --> 00:04:02.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you overcome this fear?

00:04:02.054 --> 00:04:05.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you get the fear under your control?

00:04:05.474 --> 00:04:09.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you overcome this surge of negativity?

00:04:09.103 --> 00:04:12.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when my heart persuaded me to get scared,

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then I started to pray.

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed to Jehovah to give me courage

00:04:18.362 --> 00:04:21.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and not be afraid of anyone or anything.

00:04:21.782 --> 00:04:23.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I still say to myself,

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:28.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Feliks, do not fear anybody
or anything except Jehovah!’

00:04:31.041 --> 00:04:35.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,
I really appreciate your support.

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:38.340 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m very happy for all your letters,

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.759 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for all your thoughts, for all your prayers.

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.053 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I really appreciate it a lot.

00:04:43.053 --> 00:04:45.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I try to do my best,

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and I try to serve Jehovah
in the best way that I can.

00:04:48.267 --> 00:04:50.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will do that forever!
