‎In addition to being clear and accurate,

00:00:04.287 --> 00:00:09.025 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what should be the primary goal 
of any Bible translation? 

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:11.027 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The answer is found

00:00:11.027 --> 00:00:13.697 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the theme of our program this month:

00:00:13.697 --> 00:00:17.300 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Father, Glorify Your Name.” 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.469 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s based on Jesus’ words

00:00:19.469 --> 00:00:22.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎recorded at John 12:28. 

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:26.676 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s start by examining 
the context of those words

00:00:26.676 --> 00:00:30.447 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as found in verses 27 and 28:

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:35.618 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Now I am troubled, 
and what should I say? 

00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:38.621 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Father, save me out of this hour. 

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:43.026 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“‘Nevertheless, this is why 
I have come to this hour. 

00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:46.162 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Father, glorify your name.’ 

00:00:46.162 --> 00:00:48.732 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Then a voice came out of heaven:

00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:53.069 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘I have glorified it and will glorify it again.’”

00:00:53.703 --> 00:00:55.805 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jesus uttered these words

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:59.809 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎just four days before his agonizing death. 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.445 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But even though Jesus was very troubled

00:01:02.445 --> 00:01:04.948 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about what was soon to happen to him,

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:08.284 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what was his primary concern? 

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:12.422 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was for Jehovah’s name to be glorified.

00:01:12.422 --> 00:01:15.358 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We today are likewise concerned

00:01:15.358 --> 00:01:20.230 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎about the glorification
of Jehovah’s name and his reputation.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.334 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But how can someone 
be glorified, or made famous,

00:01:24.334 --> 00:01:26.970 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎if nobody knows his name? 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.073 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Knowing God’s personal name, Jehovah,

00:01:30.073 --> 00:01:34.010 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is closely tied in with glorifying his reputation. 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.780 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In fact, knowing Jehovah’s name

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.350 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is the very first step in that process. 

00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:45.221 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The June 2015 program of JW Broadcasting

00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:47.857 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎discussed why God’s personal name

00:01:47.857 --> 00:01:51.294 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎should appear in all translations of the Bible. 

00:01:51.294 --> 00:01:54.931 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You might find it helpful to review that program. 

00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:59.769 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But this month, we will consider
another aspect of this subject

00:01:59.769 --> 00:02:03.706 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is far more controversial, namely,

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:08.711 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Should the divine name appear 
in the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:02:08.711 --> 00:02:12.182 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or what is commonly called 
the New Testament? 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.785 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many scholars who agree with us

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:19.289 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the divine name should appear 
in the Hebrew Scriptures

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.525 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎disagree with our use of the same name

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.627 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the New Testament. 

00:02:24.627 --> 00:02:28.565 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what prompted the translators 
of the New World Translation 

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:32.602 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to restore the divine name 237 times 

00:02:32.602 --> 00:02:34.971 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures? 

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The answer to that question 
involves some fascinating events

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:44.180 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that seem to be too amazing 
to be just coincidence. 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.184 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It also requires us
to do some detective work.

00:02:48.184 --> 00:02:49.786 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Sound intriguing? 

00:02:49.786 --> 00:02:51.187 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It is! 

00:02:51.187 --> 00:02:54.190 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So let’s start our journey together.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.195 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First of all, imagine that you
are back in the late 1940’s

00:02:59.195 --> 00:03:02.398 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the time when
the New World Bible Translation Committee

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:05.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was translating the book of Matthew. 

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:07.737 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As they started the project,

00:03:07.737 --> 00:03:11.341 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎no doubt they realized 
that Matthew’s account contains

00:03:11.341 --> 00:03:14.611 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures. 

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:17.447 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many of these contain the Tetragrammaton,

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:22.218 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is, the divine name 
in Hebrew letters in the original text. 

00:03:22.886 --> 00:03:27.891 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example,
let’s consider Matthew 22:44. 

00:03:29.392 --> 00:03:34.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This verse records Jesus
quoting the words of Psalm 110:1:

00:03:35.398 --> 00:03:40.103 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Jehovah said to my Lord:
‘Sit at my right hand.’”

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:45.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But did Jesus use the divine name
when making this quote?

00:03:45.375 --> 00:03:48.011 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Or did he substitute the divine name

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:51.014 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎with an equivalent such as “Lord”? 

00:03:51.014 --> 00:03:53.316 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, the brothers would have realized

00:03:53.316 --> 00:03:55.985 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that many editions of the King James Version

00:03:55.985 --> 00:04:00.156 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did something
very interesting at Matthew 22:44.

00:04:00.156 --> 00:04:03.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In that verse, the English word “LORD”

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:05.962 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is written in capital letters.

00:04:05.962 --> 00:04:09.432 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This technique is used 
throughout the King James Version 

00:04:09.432 --> 00:04:14.437 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to indicate where 
the original Hebrew text uses the divine name. 

00:04:14.437 --> 00:04:17.874 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So using “LORD”
in capital letters in this verse,

00:04:17.874 --> 00:04:21.577 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in effect, 
acknowledges that the name of God

00:04:21.577 --> 00:04:23.913 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was originally in this quote. 

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:25.915 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The implication is

00:04:25.915 --> 00:04:28.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jesus used God’s name 
when making this quote.

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, in the years prior 
to the release of the New World Translation,

00:04:34.924 --> 00:04:39.228 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many scholars argued 
that long before Jesus came to earth,

00:04:39.228 --> 00:04:42.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Jewish people
had already removed the Tetragrammaton

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:47.270 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the Greek translation of the Hebrew text
—the Septuagint. 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.973 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If true, that would mean

00:04:49.973 --> 00:04:53.242 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that copies of the Holy Writings 
used in Jesus’ day

00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:56.713 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎would not have contained 
the divine name. 

00:04:56.713 --> 00:05:00.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what should the Translation Committee do? 

00:05:00.416 --> 00:05:04.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Should they use the divine name
in their translation or not?

00:05:04.887 --> 00:05:09.559 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is where the story becomes intriguing. 

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:12.762 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Around that time,
some exciting discoveries

00:05:12.762 --> 00:05:16.366 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were made that proved those scholars wrong.

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:19.869 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎One of these discoveries
was documented by the brothers

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.538 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the foreword of the 1950 edition

00:05:22.538 --> 00:05:26.142 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the New World Translation
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:05:26.142 --> 00:05:30.179 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It involved 
some papyri copies of the Septuagint

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:33.549 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that dated 
back to around the time of Jesus.

00:05:33.549 --> 00:05:37.387 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What did these papyri fragments reveal? 

00:05:37.387 --> 00:05:41.290 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s find out in this documentary report.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.095 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In 1950,

00:05:46.095 --> 00:05:49.599 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the New World Translation 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures was released.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:53.469 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I have the extreme pleasure of releasing

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.805 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“the New World Translation

00:05:55.805 --> 00:06:00.576 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures!” 

00:06:00.576 --> 00:06:03.880 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This translation was unique

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.482 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in that it restored 
the divine name, Jehovah,

00:06:06.482 --> 00:06:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎237 times in the main text

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:12.155 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the so-called New Testament.

00:06:12.155 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But how could they do that, 
considering that for centuries 

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:19.462 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎many Bibles did not use Jehovah’s name? 

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:24.033 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And why did the divine name 
need to be restored?

00:06:24.033 --> 00:06:26.069 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The oldest copies we have available

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:28.071 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎do not use the divine name

00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:30.740 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures;

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.077 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they use substitutes like God or Lord.

00:06:34.077 --> 00:06:35.745 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Very early on,

00:06:35.745 --> 00:06:38.981 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the copyists of those original manuscripts,

00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:40.817 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they simply replaced

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:44.987 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—they got into the practice of replacing—
God’s name. 

00:06:44.987 --> 00:06:48.157 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We know that this is not a translation

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.593 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because one is a name 
and the other one is a title. 

00:06:50.593 --> 00:06:54.931 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And it’s not even  
a synonym for Jehovah, for a name.

00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:56.532 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Since the Greek Scriptures

00:06:56.532 --> 00:06:58.034 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were an inspired addition

00:06:58.034 --> 00:06:59.802 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to the sacred Hebrew Scriptures and, 

00:06:59.802 --> 00:07:00.937 line:10% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in fact,

00:07:00.937 --> 00:07:02.939 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah’s name, God’s name,

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:06.309 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was used some 7,000 times
in the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:10.379 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the sudden disappearance
in the Greek text is inconsistent.

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:14.050 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Even though 
the New World Bible Translation Committee 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.219 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎believed that Jehovah’s name should appear

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:18.888 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the text of the Christian Greek Scriptures,

00:07:18.888 --> 00:07:21.124 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎they also knew that at that time

00:07:21.124 --> 00:07:24.994 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎virtually all Bible scholars 
disagreed with that belief. 

00:07:24.994 --> 00:07:28.231 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Those scholars argued 
that by the time of Jesus,

00:07:28.231 --> 00:07:32.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎even the Greek translation 
of the Hebrew Scriptures, the Septuagint, 

00:07:32.401 --> 00:07:35.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎no longer contained the divine name. 

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:37.039 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So why would the writers 
of the New Testament

00:07:37.039 --> 00:07:41.477 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎use the divine name when their copies 
of the Holy Scriptures in Greek

00:07:41.477 --> 00:07:44.080 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did not contain the Tetragrammaton? 

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.383 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This view was based on faulty information.

00:07:47.383 --> 00:07:48.651 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How so? 

00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:50.887 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Did the Septuagint still use

00:07:50.887 --> 00:07:53.089 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the divine name in Jesus’ time? 

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:55.191 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s consider one piece of evidence

00:07:55.191 --> 00:07:57.193 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that answers this question.

00:07:57.693 --> 00:07:59.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Something amazing happened in 1944. 

00:08:00.530 --> 00:08:02.598 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎A theological journal published a picture

00:08:02.598 --> 00:08:05.067 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of a Greek Septuagint fragment

00:08:05.067 --> 00:08:08.404 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the Papyrus Fouad 266 collection. 

00:08:08.404 --> 00:08:12.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, inside that fragment 
there was the divine name.

00:08:12.375 --> 00:08:15.111 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the Greek text, 
you had the Tetragrammaton,

00:08:15.111 --> 00:08:17.513 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎not just once but throughout. 

00:08:17.513 --> 00:08:21.450 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Now, this fragment was very old, 
dating back to the first century B.C.E.,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:25.421 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but the important point is 
that this was proof, clear proof,

00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:29.392 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the divine name was originally there.

00:08:29.392 --> 00:08:32.261 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Two Jehovah’s Witnesses were asked

00:08:32.261 --> 00:08:34.931 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to obtain photographs
of these fragments,

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:38.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎which were located in Cairo, Egypt.

00:08:38.634 --> 00:08:41.971 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The New World Translation Committee 
was very interested in this

00:08:41.971 --> 00:08:44.240 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because they started translating

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.709 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the Greek Scriptures in 1947.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:52.648 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎After obtaining permission, 
pictures of 12 of the fragments 

00:08:52.648 --> 00:08:54.984 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were published in the foreword 
of the New World Translation

00:08:54.984 --> 00:08:58.988 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:09:00.256 --> 00:09:03.726 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What amazes me about this is the timing. 

00:09:04.594 --> 00:09:08.898 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎When our brothers
—this New World Translation Committee—

00:09:08.898 --> 00:09:11.467 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎did their research, before even translating,

00:09:11.467 --> 00:09:13.603 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎suddenly something that was unknown

00:09:13.603 --> 00:09:17.106 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until essentially 1944

00:09:17.106 --> 00:09:19.508 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎came to light that confirmed

00:09:19.508 --> 00:09:22.345 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the eternal name of God

00:09:23.346 --> 00:09:27.450 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎had to be revealed;
it could no longer be hidden. 

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:30.853 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It should be shown to everyone 
who wants to worship Jehovah.

00:09:30.853 --> 00:09:35.124 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This careful preservation 
supports what Jesus said in prayer

00:09:35.124 --> 00:09:38.861 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎at John 17:26, 
when he said to his Father:

00:09:38.861 --> 00:09:42.832 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“I have made your name known . . . 
and will make it known.”

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:47.670 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎As Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
we are proud to be “a people for his name.”

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.041 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Knowing his name 
is essential to knowing Jehovah himself,

00:09:52.041 --> 00:09:55.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the fact that Jehovah 
has provided this arrangement

00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:57.847 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎through his people

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.016 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎makes it very clear

00:10:00.016 --> 00:10:03.886 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that he was gathering 
“a people for his name.”

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:07.223 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is why 
this Bible translation is so beautiful,

00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:09.592 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because it brings us closer to Jehovah. 

00:10:09.592 --> 00:10:13.863 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah is not just a Lord somewhere,
which could apply to anyone,

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.099 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but he is Jehovah, our God. 

00:10:17.099 --> 00:10:19.902 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎He extends his hand to us and says, well,

00:10:19.902 --> 00:10:24.907 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎‘I’m Jehovah; call me by that name.’

00:10:25.875 --> 00:10:28.778 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What an amazing find! 

00:10:28.778 --> 00:10:32.214 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They found proof
that the divine name in Hebrew letters

00:10:32.214 --> 00:10:35.484 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was included in the text of the Septuagint

00:10:35.484 --> 00:10:38.354 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that would have been
available in Jesus’ day

00:10:38.354 --> 00:10:40.523 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and just at the right time

00:10:40.523 --> 00:10:43.359 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the time when the members
of the Translation Committee

00:10:43.359 --> 00:10:46.762 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎were making the decision
as to whether they should use

00:10:46.762 --> 00:10:51.600 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the name Jehovah in their translation
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.738 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎We are so happy that the brothers 
were able to find this information

00:10:55.738 --> 00:11:00.042 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎because these fragments 
were not released for general publication

00:11:00.042 --> 00:11:04.146 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎until much later in 1971

00:11:04.146 --> 00:11:09.151 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—years after the time when the committee 
needed to make that vital decision. 

00:11:09.151 --> 00:11:11.153 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But that’s not all! 

00:11:11.153 --> 00:11:13.789 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Do you remember 
what other important material

00:11:13.789 --> 00:11:17.526 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was discovered starting in 1947? 

00:11:17.526 --> 00:11:20.062 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It was the Dead Sea Scrolls. 

00:11:20.062 --> 00:11:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Many of these scrolls were dated
to around the time when Jesus was on earth.

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:29.672 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎And what did these scrolls
contain over and over again?

00:11:29.672 --> 00:11:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You guessed it

00:11:31.674 --> 00:11:34.643 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—the Tetragrammaton—
the divine name.

00:11:35.411 --> 00:11:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Isn’t it interesting

00:11:37.413 --> 00:11:40.416 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that these discoveries
were made around the time

00:11:40.416 --> 00:11:44.186 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when our brothers were translating
the New World Translation? 

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:46.756 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Is this just coincidence

00:11:46.756 --> 00:11:50.426 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or do you see Jehovah’s hand in this? 

00:11:50.426 --> 00:11:53.829 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What has happened 
in the years since that time? 

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:55.865 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It’s important to note

00:11:55.865 --> 00:11:58.634 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that the divine name is consistently used

00:11:58.634 --> 00:12:00.636 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in fragments of the Septuagint

00:12:00.636 --> 00:12:03.539 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that date from the first century B.C.E.

00:12:03.539 --> 00:12:06.208 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and the first century C.E. 

00:12:06.208 --> 00:12:10.012 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This has led some scholars
to acknowledge the possibility

00:12:10.012 --> 00:12:12.114 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that Jesus and his disciples

00:12:12.114 --> 00:12:16.752 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎used the divine name
when making these quotations.

00:12:16.752 --> 00:12:20.990 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we need to remember 
that Hebrew Scripture quotations

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.893 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎account for approximately one third

00:12:23.893 --> 00:12:26.429 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the 237 times

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:29.465 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the New World Translation
restores the divine name

00:12:29.465 --> 00:12:32.134 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the Christian Greek Scriptures. 

00:12:32.134 --> 00:12:35.905 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So, what about the other 
two thirds of occurrences?

00:12:35.905 --> 00:12:39.375 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, this brings us 
to the part of our program

00:12:39.375 --> 00:12:43.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that involves some detective work.

00:12:43.145 --> 00:12:46.048 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Imagine that you are a detective,

00:12:46.048 --> 00:12:48.384 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and you catch an art thief

00:12:48.384 --> 00:12:51.954 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who has stolen 
over 200 original pieces of art

00:12:51.954 --> 00:12:55.524 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from various museums and art galleries. 

00:12:55.524 --> 00:12:58.794 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This thief not only stole each piece of art

00:12:58.794 --> 00:13:02.598 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎but he also substituted it with a copy.

00:13:02.598 --> 00:13:05.568 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So you need to start an investigation

00:13:05.568 --> 00:13:08.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and follow the clues. 

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:10.873 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎First of all, you need to find out

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:14.276 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where each painting was located originally.

00:13:14.276 --> 00:13:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Once you have verified 
that fakes are hanging in those locations,

00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.117 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you would be in a position 
to return the originals

00:13:22.117 --> 00:13:25.054 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to their proper locations. 

00:13:25.054 --> 00:13:28.724 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In a similar way, 
we have solid evidence

00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:33.329 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that a crime was committed 
in the second and third centuries C.E.

00:13:33.329 --> 00:13:36.565 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Apostate Christians removed the divine name

00:13:36.565 --> 00:13:38.567 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from manuscripts of the Bible

00:13:38.567 --> 00:13:43.038 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and replaced it with Kyʹri·os,
the Greek word for “Lord.” 

00:13:43.038 --> 00:13:46.208 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There is much evidence for this conclusion. 

00:13:46.208 --> 00:13:49.979 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So they are like the art thief in our illustration. 

00:13:49.979 --> 00:13:52.515 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎They stole something valuable

00:13:52.515 --> 00:13:57.520 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when they removed Jehovah’s name
from the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:59.722 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But we have a problem. 

00:13:59.722 --> 00:14:03.125 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There are no copies 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures

00:14:03.125 --> 00:14:06.128 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎from the first century for us to examine. 

00:14:06.128 --> 00:14:08.931 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The earliest existing manuscripts

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:11.133 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that would have a bearing on this matter

00:14:11.133 --> 00:14:14.336 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎date from the late second century onward

00:14:14.336 --> 00:14:18.407 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎—a time when we know that the crime 
had already been committed

00:14:18.407 --> 00:14:22.044 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and Jehovah’s name 
had already been removed. 

00:14:22.044 --> 00:14:24.914 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So how do we know where Jehovah’s name

00:14:24.914 --> 00:14:27.816 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎originally appeared in the Greek text

00:14:27.816 --> 00:14:30.719 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎before the apostates removed it? 

00:14:30.719 --> 00:14:34.189 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, just like the detective in our illustration,

00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:36.792 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we need to start an investigation

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:39.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and follow the clues.

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.330 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To do our work properly,

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.968 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎we need to examine every time 
the word “Lord” appears in the text

00:14:45.968 --> 00:14:49.505 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and see if it refers to Jehovah, to Jesus,

00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:52.441 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or to some other person with the title “Lord.” 

00:14:53.709 --> 00:14:56.946 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Basically, 
there are five clues that will help us

00:14:56.946 --> 00:14:59.582 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to find out where the original artwork,

00:14:59.582 --> 00:15:03.552 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is, Jehovah’s name, 
needs to be returned to. 

00:15:03.552 --> 00:15:07.056 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Let’s scrutinize these clues. 

00:15:07.056 --> 00:15:09.091 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The first clue is,

00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:12.962 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎as we have already mentioned,
the easiest clue,

00:15:12.962 --> 00:15:14.964 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where the title “Lord” appears

00:15:14.964 --> 00:15:17.433 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in quotations from the Hebrew Scriptures

00:15:17.433 --> 00:15:20.302 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that originally used the divine name. 

00:15:20.302 --> 00:15:22.438 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The second clue is

00:15:22.438 --> 00:15:25.808 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where the Greek text contains a Hebrew idiom

00:15:25.808 --> 00:15:28.644 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that would normally contain the divine name. 

00:15:28.644 --> 00:15:32.014 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
if someone says in English,

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:34.650 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“He escaped by the skin of his . . . ,”

00:15:34.650 --> 00:15:36.652 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what word do you expect? 

00:15:36.652 --> 00:15:38.921 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Teeth, not eye. 

00:15:38.921 --> 00:15:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Yes, the expression is “skin of his teeth.” 

00:15:42.558 --> 00:15:45.761 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is similar with Hebrew expressions. 

00:15:45.761 --> 00:15:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Some of these contain the divine name. 

00:15:48.731 --> 00:15:52.768 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎For example, 
the expression found at Matthew 1:20

00:15:52.768 --> 00:15:56.438 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is “the angel of Jehovah.” 

00:15:56.438 --> 00:16:00.309 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So whenever we find 
a Greek translation of a Hebrew idiom

00:16:00.309 --> 00:16:02.378 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that uses the divine name,

00:16:02.378 --> 00:16:06.382 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎this is another clue 
that Jehovah’s name should be there.

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:09.385 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The third clue

00:16:09.385 --> 00:16:11.487 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is where the term “Lord” appears

00:16:11.487 --> 00:16:14.156 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the context surrounding a quotation

00:16:14.156 --> 00:16:17.126 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that is originally attributed to Jehovah. 

00:16:17.126 --> 00:16:21.463 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎An example of this is Matthew 1:22:

00:16:22.164 --> 00:16:25.467 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“All of this actually came about to fulfill

00:16:25.467 --> 00:16:29.038 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎what was spoken by Jehovah 
through his prophet, saying . . .”

00:16:29.538 --> 00:16:34.543 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The quotation 
that immediately follows at Matthew 1:23

00:16:34.543 --> 00:16:38.047 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is taken from Isaiah 7:14.

00:16:38.047 --> 00:16:40.049 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This is a prophetic message

00:16:40.049 --> 00:16:43.419 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎spoken by Jehovah through Isaiah.

00:16:43.419 --> 00:16:45.421 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The fourth clue

00:16:45.421 --> 00:16:47.556 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is when we see in the Greek text

00:16:47.556 --> 00:16:52.428 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎where there is no definite article 
before Kyʹri·os, the Greek word for “Lord,”

00:16:52.428 --> 00:16:57.399 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in places where the Greek grammar
normally expects a definite article. 

00:16:57.399 --> 00:17:02.004 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎This clue may indicate 
that a proper name, such as Jehovah,

00:17:02.004 --> 00:17:04.139 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎originally was there in the text

00:17:04.139 --> 00:17:09.144 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and was removed from later manuscripts
and replaced with Kyʹri·os. 

00:17:09.144 --> 00:17:12.448 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎To illustrate the importance of this clue,

00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:15.451 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎imagine that you are a newspaper reporter

00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:18.754 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎who is reporting on a car accident. 

00:17:18.754 --> 00:17:22.424 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You report that Joe Smith,
the driver of the vehicle,

00:17:22.424 --> 00:17:24.727 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎was killed in the accident. 

00:17:24.727 --> 00:17:27.930 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎But just before the story goes to press,

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:31.266 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎your editor informs you 
that Joe Smith’s relatives

00:17:31.266 --> 00:17:34.002 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎have not yet been notified of his death. 

00:17:34.002 --> 00:17:37.773 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So you are told to remove
his name from the report.

00:17:37.773 --> 00:17:41.009 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You do that, but in doing so,

00:17:41.009 --> 00:17:45.347 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you forget to add 
the “the” before the word “driver.”

00:17:45.347 --> 00:17:47.349 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎What would happen?

00:17:47.349 --> 00:17:49.351 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Your report would say,

00:17:49.351 --> 00:17:53.355 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“As a result of the accident,
driver was killed.” 

00:17:53.355 --> 00:17:55.691 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That sounds strange, doesn’t it? 

00:17:55.691 --> 00:17:59.595 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎It sounds like “driver” 
is the name of the person killed.

00:17:59.595 --> 00:18:02.397 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s because you suppressed the name

00:18:02.397 --> 00:18:05.768 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and forgot to add the appropriate article. 

00:18:05.768 --> 00:18:09.304 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That is similar 
to what our symbolic art thieves did

00:18:09.304 --> 00:18:13.142 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎when removing 
Jehovah’s name from the Bible. 

00:18:13.142 --> 00:18:15.177 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎An example of this

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:19.515 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is found in the Greek text of Mark 13:20. 

00:18:20.682 --> 00:18:25.053 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“In fact, unless Lord had cut short the days,

00:18:25.053 --> 00:18:28.457 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎no flesh would be saved.” 

00:18:28.457 --> 00:18:30.859 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That sounds like “Lord” is a name,

00:18:30.859 --> 00:18:34.897 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and clearly it should be Jehovah’s name. 

00:18:34.897 --> 00:18:39.468 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎That’s why the New World Translation 
restores the divine name in this verse. 

00:18:40.569 --> 00:18:44.006 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎However, 
even in cases where the definite article

00:18:44.006 --> 00:18:46.074 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎occurs before the word “Lord,”

00:18:46.074 --> 00:18:48.243 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎there may be other strong reasons

00:18:48.243 --> 00:18:52.047 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎for viewing “Lord” 
as a substitute for the divine name,

00:18:52.047 --> 00:18:54.349 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎like the ones we already discussed.

00:18:55.784 --> 00:18:58.120 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎The final clue

00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:03.125 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is where the divine name 
needs to be added to avoid ambiguity. 

00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:05.160 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎An example of this

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.997 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is in Mark 5:19. 

00:19:08.997 --> 00:19:12.401 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎There, Jesus says to a man he healed:

00:19:12.401 --> 00:19:15.037 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“Go home to your relatives,

00:19:15.037 --> 00:19:17.873 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎“and report to them all the things

00:19:17.873 --> 00:19:21.844 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Jehovah has done for you 
and the mercy he has shown you.”

00:19:22.544 --> 00:19:26.548 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎How do we know that “Lord” 
here refers to Jehovah

00:19:26.548 --> 00:19:28.550 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎and not Jesus?

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:30.919 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Well, in recording the same event,

00:19:30.919 --> 00:19:35.924 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎Luke 8:39 uses the Greek word The·osʹ (God),

00:19:35.924 --> 00:19:40.596 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎supporting the thought 
that Kyʹri·os (Lord) at Mark 5:19

00:19:40.596 --> 00:19:43.899 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎is used with reference to Jehovah God. 

00:19:43.899 --> 00:19:48.770 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎So these five clues helped 
the New World Bible Translation Committee

00:19:48.770 --> 00:19:50.772 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to ascertain where the name Jehovah

00:19:50.772 --> 00:19:54.076 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎should be restored to the Biblical text.

00:19:54.076 --> 00:19:57.145 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In this way, they were able to right the wrong

00:19:57.145 --> 00:19:59.781 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that was committed by apostate Christians

00:19:59.781 --> 00:20:02.784 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in the second and third centuries or,

00:20:02.784 --> 00:20:05.387 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎in other words, they were able to return

00:20:05.387 --> 00:20:07.890 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎the figurative pieces of stolen artwork

00:20:07.890 --> 00:20:10.626 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎to their proper places. 

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:13.295 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎If you would like to review these five clues,

00:20:13.295 --> 00:20:17.332 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you will find a detailed explanation in Appendix C

00:20:17.766 --> 00:20:20.569 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎of the Study Edition of the New World Translation.

00:20:21.503 --> 00:20:24.740 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎You can either find this in the JW Library® app

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.877 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎or online at Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY. 

00:20:28.877 --> 00:20:31.413 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎In the same Appendix C,

00:20:31.413 --> 00:20:34.750 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎you will find a list 
of what we call J-References

00:20:34.750 --> 00:20:37.753 line:90% position:50% align:center size:80%
‎that support these decisions.
