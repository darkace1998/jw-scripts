00:00:01.772 --> 00:00:03.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome!

00:00:03.858 --> 00:00:06.402 line:10% position:50% align:center
In this program, we will update you

00:00:06.402 --> 00:00:07.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the situation

00:00:07.862 --> 00:00:09.572 line:10% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters

00:00:09.572 --> 00:00:11.366 line:10% position:50% align:center
around the world

00:00:11.366 --> 00:00:14.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:20.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, here’s an update
about this year’s convention.

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:22.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some parts of the world,

00:00:22.794 --> 00:00:26.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
the “Declare the Good News!”
Regional Conventions

00:00:26.256 --> 00:00:28.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
are now underway.

00:00:28.717 --> 00:00:31.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a beautiful program.

00:00:32.304 --> 00:00:35.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear from a few
who recently attended.

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:37.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
A lot of the friends

00:00:37.977 --> 00:00:39.979 line:10% position:50% align:center
have made incredible sacrifices

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:42.190 line:10% position:50% align:center
to support the convention here.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.110 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, I had to negotiate time off of work.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.570 line:10% position:50% align:center
We also had to ask for leave from school.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.114 line:10% position:50% align:center
We got up really early.

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:52.200 line:10% position:50% align:center
Every effort you make is definitely worth it.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t put a price on being here.

00:00:55.162 --> 00:00:58.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get to see brothers
that we don’t often get to see.

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:01.168 line:10% position:50% align:center
Also, when you’re here,

00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:02.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
you get the hugs.

00:01:02.837 --> 00:01:04.255 line:10% position:50% align:center
I love hugs.

00:01:04.255 --> 00:01:05.673 line:10% position:50% align:center
A virtual hug is OK.

00:01:05.673 --> 00:01:06.883 line:10% position:50% align:center
A real hug is better.

00:01:06.883 --> 00:01:09.302 line:10% position:50% align:center
There’s a big difference

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
between being here in person

00:01:10.845 --> 00:01:12.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
and watching online.

00:01:12.388 --> 00:01:15.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so much more alive.

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:16.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love the singing.

00:01:16.768 --> 00:01:19.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a power that resonates 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the audience
when we’re all singing together.

00:01:22.357 --> 00:01:24.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
That really strengthens us
and gives us a boost.

00:01:25.611 --> 00:01:27.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, it’s been incredible

00:01:27.237 --> 00:01:28.864 line:10% position:50% align:center
that we get to see Episode 1

00:01:28.864 --> 00:01:30.950 line:10% position:50% align:center
of <i>The Good News According to Jesus.</i>

00:01:32.034 --> 00:01:34.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next time you do your Bible reading,
you really can picture these beautiful moments

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how important they were.

00:01:36.831 --> 00:01:39.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
What impressed me
is that I’ve read all of those verses

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:42.170 line:10% position:50% align:center
that were highlighted and never ever

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.505 line:10% position:50% align:center
—not one time—did I get emotional.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:47.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it brought it to life today,
and I did get emotional.

00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:49.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
You feel like you’re there.

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
These spiritual feasts enrich us

00:01:52.973 --> 00:01:55.225 line:10% position:50% align:center
and strengthen us spiritually.

00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:58.437 line:10% position:50% align:center
I think I want to come to this convention 

00:01:58.437 --> 00:02:00.189 line:10% position:50% align:center
three or four times.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.441 line:10% position:50% align:center
For me, there’s no better place

00:02:02.441 --> 00:02:05.403 line:10% position:50% align:center
than being among
a group of Jehovah’s people.

00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:06.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time I’m reminded

00:02:06.946 --> 00:02:10.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what a beautiful,
huge spiritual family we’re a part of.

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:13.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
It brings us so much joy
to be with our brothers and sisters!

00:02:13.077 --> 00:02:15.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
You just don’t want to miss it.

00:02:15.914 --> 00:02:18.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
We encourage all of you to endeavor

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:23.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend the convention in person.

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
By doing so, you will
not only benefit from the program

00:02:27.676 --> 00:02:30.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also receive much encouragement

00:02:30.763 --> 00:02:34.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
from associating with many dear friends

00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:39.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
—perhaps even some
whom you haven’t seen for some time.

00:02:40.898 --> 00:02:45.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we understand
that those limited by age and health

00:02:45.904 --> 00:02:48.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
may have to tune in

00:02:48.364 --> 00:02:51.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the streaming program.

00:02:52.661 --> 00:02:55.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
This year, a real highlight

00:02:55.455 --> 00:03:00.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be the 15 special conventions
that are scheduled.

00:03:01.086 --> 00:03:05.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first was held
on the weekend of June 7-9

00:03:05.883 --> 00:03:09.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the island of Guadeloupe.

00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:12.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers Jeff Winder and Clive Martin

00:03:12.181 --> 00:03:16.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
had the privilege to serve the convention.

00:03:16.561 --> 00:03:20.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Delegates came from 11 lands,

00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:22.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there was a peak attendance

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 8,602.

00:03:26.238 --> 00:03:31.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
On Saturday, 74 were baptized.

00:03:31.034 --> 00:03:34.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice to see the love and unity

00:03:34.955 --> 00:03:37.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our international brotherhood!

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, for the rest of this program,

00:03:42.004 --> 00:03:44.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to update you on the situation

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:49.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:03:50.138 --> 00:03:54.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help all of us
to follow the wise direction

00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:57.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Hebrews 13:3,

00:03:57.187 --> 00:03:58.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says:

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:03.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep in mind those in prison,

00:04:03.485 --> 00:04:07.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as though you were imprisoned with them,

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those being mistreated,

00:04:09.867 --> 00:04:14.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
since you yourselves
also are in the body.”

00:04:15.081 --> 00:04:17.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
As of June 17,

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:21.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are over 199 brothers and sisters

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:24.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
imprisoned for their faith.

00:04:24.299 --> 00:04:25.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where are they?

00:04:25.884 --> 00:04:29.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are 9 imprisoned in Crimea,

00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:33.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
39 in Eritrea, 8 in Singapore,

00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:37.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 17 in other lands.

00:04:37.188 --> 00:04:39.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
The largest number

00:04:39.064 --> 00:04:42.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
of imprisoned brothers and sisters
is in Russia,

00:04:42.777 --> 00:04:46.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there are 126.

00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:51.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about South Korea?

00:04:51.161 --> 00:04:55.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although our brothers there
are no longer routinely imprisoned

00:04:55.957 --> 00:04:57.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
for neutrality,

00:04:57.918 --> 00:05:02.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re enduring
a harsh form of alternative service.

00:05:03.382 --> 00:05:06.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re required to serve for three years

00:05:06.844 --> 00:05:11.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to live and work exclusively in prisons.

00:05:12.183 --> 00:05:14.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson

00:05:14.352 --> 00:05:18.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
recently visited
two groups of brothers at prisons

00:05:18.982 --> 00:05:23.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
where they’re carrying out
their alternative service.

00:05:23.403 --> 00:05:25.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope that this situation

00:05:25.906 --> 00:05:28.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
will improve in the future.

00:05:28.992 --> 00:05:31.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we continue to pray

00:05:31.203 --> 00:05:34.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
for these faithful brothers
and their families.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we might think

00:05:38.002 --> 00:05:41.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
that only brothers
are imprisoned around the world.

00:05:42.548 --> 00:05:47.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we actually have 12 sisters in Eritrea

00:05:47.512 --> 00:05:49.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are in prison for their faith.

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:53.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are eight sisters in Russia

00:05:53.601 --> 00:05:56.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are in prison because of their faith.

00:05:57.898 --> 00:06:02.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
These dear sisters
need our continued prayers.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, many brothers and sisters

00:06:05.823 --> 00:06:09.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
are enduring long prison sentences

00:06:09.451 --> 00:06:13.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, at times,
even physical mistreatment.

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:15.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was recently the case

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:19.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Brother Rinat Kiramov in Russia.

00:06:19.295 --> 00:06:20.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
In April 2024,

00:06:20.922 --> 00:06:23.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
several prisoners demanded

00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:27.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our brother reveal the names
of other Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:30.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he courageously refused!

00:06:30.098 --> 00:06:34.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn, the prisoners
beat and tortured him for four days, 

00:06:34.436 --> 00:06:37.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
even using a taser.

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:41.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray for Brother Kiramov

00:06:41.777 --> 00:06:45.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all 199 brothers and sisters

00:06:45.531 --> 00:06:48.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are imprisoned for their faith.

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we don’t forget their families either.

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:56.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
The faith and integrity
of our imprisoned brothers and sisters

00:06:56.209 --> 00:07:00.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
remind us of the words of Romans 12:21:

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:05.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not let yourself
be conquered by the evil,

00:07:05.719 --> 00:07:09.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
but keep conquering
the evil with the good.”

00:07:10.474 --> 00:07:15.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, they’re enduring opposition
and severe tests of faith.

00:07:16.063 --> 00:07:20.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
But they’ve not let themselves
be conquered by it.

00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:26.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, they “keep conquering
the evil with the good.”

00:07:27.701 --> 00:07:31.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
We truly love and respect
these dear brothers and sisters.

00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:36.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s interesting
that as our brothers and sisters

00:07:36.126 --> 00:07:38.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
endure these hardships,

00:07:38.253 --> 00:07:41.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
they often have unique opportunities

00:07:41.382 --> 00:07:43.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
to share the good news.

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:47.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the case
for dozens of Witnesses

00:07:47.889 --> 00:07:50.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the city of Birobidzhan, Russia.

00:07:50.975 --> 00:07:53.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 2018,

00:07:53.686 --> 00:07:56.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
officials raided 22 homes

00:07:56.815 --> 00:07:59.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all on the same day.

00:07:59.276 --> 00:08:01.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you watch the following video,

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how our brothers and sisters

00:08:03.905 --> 00:08:06.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave a good witness

00:08:06.533 --> 00:08:09.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maintained their joy.

00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:13.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they “keep conquering
the evil with the good”?

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:17.670 line:10% position:50% align:center
Early in the morning of May 17, 2018,

00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:19.172 line:10% position:50% align:center
we were woken up

00:08:19.172 --> 00:08:20.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
by a loud knock on the door.

00:08:20.548 --> 00:08:22.800 line:10% position:50% align:center
Through the door, I asked, “Who’s there?”

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.761 line:10% position:50% align:center
They said, “It’s the police.”

00:08:24.761 --> 00:08:27.472 line:10% position:50% align:center
Of course, we felt very stressed.

00:08:28.223 --> 00:08:30.100 line:10% position:50% align:center
Naturally, we started praying

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:31.768 line:10% position:50% align:center
silently to Jehovah.

00:08:34.396 --> 00:08:36.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, we learned that this operation

00:08:36.523 --> 00:08:38.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
was given the name Judgment Day

00:08:38.817 --> 00:08:41.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that about
150 officers were involved.

00:08:44.615 --> 00:08:47.076 line:10% position:50% align:center
When a criminal case was initiated,

00:08:47.076 --> 00:08:48.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
all my accounts were frozen.

00:08:48.786 --> 00:08:50.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to go to various banks.

00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:55.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the staff would see me
coming through the door,

00:08:57.337 --> 00:09:00.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
they greeted me with,
“Oh, ‘our little extremist’ has come”

00:09:00.924 --> 00:09:03.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave me a friendly smile.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:08.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the times when I was going
to the FSB for interrogation,

00:09:08.807 --> 00:09:10.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
I called a taxi.

00:09:10.058 --> 00:09:12.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
The taxi driver asked:
“What is this address?

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where are you going?”

00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “It’s the FSB building.”

00:09:16.774 --> 00:09:19.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
He asked, “Are you going to work?”

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “No, not to work;

00:09:20.945 --> 00:09:23.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going there for interrogation.”

00:09:23.614 --> 00:09:26.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
He couldn’t believe it.
He got very confused.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to tell him
that I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:32.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that a criminal case
had been initiated against me for my faith.

00:09:32.207 --> 00:09:33.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few days later,

00:09:33.542 --> 00:09:35.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went back to the FSB office

00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:37.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
and called another taxi.

00:09:37.462 --> 00:09:40.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
To my surprise, the same car arrived

00:09:40.632 --> 00:09:41.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the same driver.

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:42.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on this trip,

00:09:42.968 --> 00:09:46.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to tell him in more detail
which prophecies are recorded

00:09:46.514 --> 00:09:50.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Bible on this subject
and we had a good conversation.

00:09:50.643 --> 00:09:53.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we went for interrogations,

00:09:53.146 --> 00:09:57.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wanted to show the investigators
by our behavior, words, and kindness

00:09:57.942 --> 00:10:00.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are not extremists

00:10:00.278 --> 00:10:04.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that Jehovah’s Witnesses
are kind, sympathetic people.

00:10:04.908 --> 00:10:07.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the end of the investigation,

00:10:07.202 --> 00:10:09.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
we decided to make them cards.

00:10:09.955 --> 00:10:13.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
We tried to say nice things to everyone.

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:16.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
We mentioned their good, kind points.

00:10:18.172 --> 00:10:22.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lawyer said
that he was very worried

00:10:22.218 --> 00:10:25.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
and added: “I see that you
are good people, and people like you

00:10:25.138 --> 00:10:26.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
“shouldn’t be in prison.

00:10:26.931 --> 00:10:29.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m sure that your God
will help you but,

00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“please, Artur,
do not deviate from this path.

00:10:32.145 --> 00:10:34.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay firm to the end.”

00:10:35.607 --> 00:10:37.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our trial began,

00:10:37.901 --> 00:10:41.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
we four sisters
ended up before the same judge.

00:10:41.613 --> 00:10:45.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was very prejudiced
and negative toward us.

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:48.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
She interrupted us,

00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:51.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
she pointed out that we’re uneducated,

00:10:51.165 --> 00:10:54.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she humiliated us
in every possible way.

00:10:54.627 --> 00:10:59.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at some point, we wondered,
‘Jehovah brought us here to witness,

00:10:59.465 --> 00:11:02.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
but how can we witness to a person
who won’t let us say anything?’

00:11:03.929 --> 00:11:06.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided to pray to Jehovah

00:11:06.389 --> 00:11:08.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
for him to soften her heart

00:11:08.141 --> 00:11:10.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we might eventually
give a good witness to her.

00:11:12.271 --> 00:11:15.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also made an effort
to be tactful and polite.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:17.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
We always greeted her.

00:11:17.776 --> 00:11:21.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
I resolved to express kindness
by my tone of voice,

00:11:21.947 --> 00:11:24.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
my words, and my face.

00:11:25.368 --> 00:11:28.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at one point, something happened.

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:32.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things started to go completely differently.

00:11:32.375 --> 00:11:35.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
She started listening to us and greeting us.

00:11:35.712 --> 00:11:37.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we were watching
the video recordings

00:11:37.756 --> 00:11:39.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our meetings in court,

00:11:39.883 --> 00:11:41.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judge was making notes.

00:11:43.053 --> 00:11:45.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then she asked,
“Where did he read it from?”

00:11:45.597 --> 00:11:48.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, out of fear, I couldn’t remember.

00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:50.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I said, “From the Bible.”

00:11:50.603 --> 00:11:55.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “That’s obvious;
but from where in the Bible did he read?”

00:11:55.566 --> 00:11:57.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told her, “From Job.”

00:11:57.443 --> 00:11:58.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “What?”

00:11:58.778 --> 00:12:00.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Job.”

00:12:00.321 --> 00:12:02.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
She asked again, “What?”

00:12:02.031 --> 00:12:04.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now my lawyer said, “Job.”

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:07.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said, “Oh, Job” and wrote it down.

00:12:07.329 --> 00:12:09.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I added, “42:10.”

00:12:11.541 --> 00:12:15.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
When she read the verdict,
she even asked several times,

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:19.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Irina, am I pronouncing
the name of God correctly?”

00:12:20.217 --> 00:12:24.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed to Jehovah, saying:
“Jehovah, today is the judgment.

00:12:24.221 --> 00:12:26.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want your name to be glorified today.”

00:12:26.766 --> 00:12:29.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said: “Jehovah, please let the judge

00:12:29.268 --> 00:12:31.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pronounce your name
correctly ten times

00:12:31.604 --> 00:12:33.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put the stress in the correct place,”

00:12:33.815 --> 00:12:35.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she had a problem with that.

00:12:36.443 --> 00:12:38.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do you think?

00:12:38.028 --> 00:12:39.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the end of the judgment,

00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:42.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
she had pronounced
God’s name correctly ten times!

00:12:47.496 --> 00:12:50.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was sentenced,
I was met by many friends.

00:12:50.791 --> 00:12:54.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were a lot of people,
and I was given a lot of flowers.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:57.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
A woman came up to me
with two of her friends.

00:12:57.465 --> 00:13:01.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Smiling, she asked me:
“Tell me, please,

00:13:01.094 --> 00:13:02.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what’s the occasion?

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:04.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
You look so beautiful!”

00:13:04.806 --> 00:13:08.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
I smiled at her and said, “You know,
I’m one of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:13:08.977 --> 00:13:12.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was  given a two-and-a-half-year
suspended sentence today.”

00:13:12.564 --> 00:13:16.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
She and her friends were smiling,
and they just froze.

00:13:16.735 --> 00:13:20.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
I work from home, so when my clients came
and saw so many flowers,

00:13:20.906 --> 00:13:23.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
they asked: “Where did they come from?

00:13:23.492 --> 00:13:25.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was the occasion?”

00:13:25.911 --> 00:13:28.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
it gave me the opportunity

00:13:28.289 --> 00:13:30.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
to say that the “big occasion”

00:13:30.583 --> 00:13:33.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
is having such loving brothers and sisters.

00:13:34.254 --> 00:13:39.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of the 23 brothers and sisters
who were prosecuted,

00:13:39.009 --> 00:13:43.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
4 were taken into custody
and are now serving time in a penal colony.

00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:51.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
We found out that our husbands
were going to be transported,

00:13:51.564 --> 00:13:53.274 line:10% position:50% align:center
so we went to the station

00:13:53.274 --> 00:13:54.650 line:10% position:50% align:center
to see them off.

00:13:57.945 --> 00:13:59.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the train they were asked,

00:13:59.655 --> 00:14:01.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who were all the people
who came to see you?”

00:14:02.951 --> 00:14:05.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some wondered
if it was some kind of support group.

00:14:06.204 --> 00:14:07.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers were being taken to prison,

00:14:07.789 --> 00:14:10.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet this group was rejoicing

00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:12.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
and singing songs.

00:14:13.712 --> 00:14:18.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking back, I feel truly grateful,

00:14:18.467 --> 00:14:20.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it was not easy,

00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:22.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah

00:14:22.179 --> 00:14:25.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
sustained us throughout the trial.

00:14:28.352 --> 00:14:30.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there was a moment when I felt

00:14:30.396 --> 00:14:32.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
that my faith was weakening,

00:14:32.857 --> 00:14:36.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I asked Artur,
“Why don’t I feel supported?”

00:14:37.445 --> 00:14:39.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Artur helped me a lot.

00:14:42.117 --> 00:14:45.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “That you—

00:14:49.249 --> 00:14:52.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That you are enduring,
this is Jehovah’s support.

00:14:52.795 --> 00:14:55.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have not renounced him.
You have not forsaken him.

00:14:55.714 --> 00:14:57.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that tells you that he’s with you.”

00:14:58.551 --> 00:15:01.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brief thought
strengthened my faith,

00:15:01.846 --> 00:15:04.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I realized that at that moment

00:15:04.015 --> 00:15:06.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan was putting pressure on my faith

00:15:06.142 --> 00:15:09.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I needed
to strengthen my faith not only in Jehovah

00:15:09.145 --> 00:15:13.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also in Jehovah’s presence
in difficult situations.

00:15:14.735 --> 00:15:17.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan wants to steal our joy.

00:15:17.070 --> 00:15:20.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s impossible because joy
belongs to Jehovah

00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:22.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he owns it.

00:15:22.952 --> 00:15:25.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then what does Satan do?

00:15:25.412 --> 00:15:29.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants to hide this joy from us
so that we don’t see it.

00:15:29.792 --> 00:15:33.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah
—as a good, reliable Friend—

00:15:33.463 --> 00:15:36.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
has always helped us
to see reasons for joy.

00:15:37.634 --> 00:15:39.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted to silence us

00:15:39.594 --> 00:15:42.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we wouldn’t talk
about Jehovah anymore.

00:15:42.973 --> 00:15:45.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in reality, they gave us

00:15:45.517 --> 00:15:48.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
even more opportunities
to talk about God’s name.

00:16:02.702 --> 00:16:06.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t you just love their zeal and joy?

00:16:07.373 --> 00:16:09.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re determined to keep preaching

00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:12.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to keep their integrity!

00:16:12.837 --> 00:16:16.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had unique opportunities
to give a witness.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:20.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they relied on Jehovah to do so.

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:25.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we know
that all of you brothers and sisters

00:16:25.184 --> 00:16:29.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
are facing challenges
of one sort or another.

00:16:29.772 --> 00:16:32.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure that hearing these experiences

00:16:32.733 --> 00:16:36.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
will encourage and motivate all of us

00:16:36.112 --> 00:16:39.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep relying on Jehovah

00:16:39.365 --> 00:16:41.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to keep preaching,

00:16:41.409 --> 00:16:44.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what challenges we face.

00:16:45.539 --> 00:16:48.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, with Jehovah’s help,

00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:53.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can “keep conquering
the evil with the good.”

00:16:54.965 --> 00:16:57.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:16:57.009 --> 00:17:00.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s “keep in mind those in prison,

00:17:00.513 --> 00:17:04.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
as though [we] were [in prison] with them.”

00:17:05.935 --> 00:17:07.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so proud of all of you

00:17:07.937 --> 00:17:11.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your endurance and your zeal.

00:17:11.608 --> 00:17:15.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you all very much.

00:17:15.111 --> 00:17:18.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:17:18.115 --> 00:17:21.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
