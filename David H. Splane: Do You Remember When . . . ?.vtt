Through his prophet Isaiah,

00:00:03.386 --> 00:00:05.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah made a wonderful promise,

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.091 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
one that’s being fulfilled today.

00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:13.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can read about it at Isaiah 60:17:

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:17.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,

00:00:17.133 --> 00:00:20.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and instead of the iron
I will bring in silver,

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:22.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“instead of the wood, copper,

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:24.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and instead of the stones, iron;

00:00:24.941 --> 00:00:28.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and I will appoint peace as your overseers

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:32.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and righteousness as your task assigners.”

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now, this reference to “overseers”

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:39.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “task assigners”
—that sounds like organization, doesn’t it?

00:00:39.456 --> 00:00:41.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what is Jehovah telling us?

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:44.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He’s saying that we can expect

00:00:44.227 --> 00:00:48.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see organizational arrangements
getting better and better.

00:00:48.631 --> 00:00:52.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you’ve been associated
with the truth for a while,

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:56.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’ll agree that Isaiah’s prophecy
is being fulfilled today.

00:00:56.973 --> 00:00:59.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for this broadcast,

00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:01.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought we’d review
some of the improvements

00:01:01.377 --> 00:01:04.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve seen just since World War II.

00:01:04.247 --> 00:01:07.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the period
most of us are familiar with.

00:01:07.383 --> 00:01:11.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some of you will be hearing
about these things for the first time.

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:14.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others will have lived through it all,

00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:17.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for them it’ll bring back fond memories.

00:01:17.694 --> 00:01:20.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s go back.
It’ll be fun!

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I call this part
“Do You Remember When . . . ?”

00:01:25.802 --> 00:01:29.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before World War II
and for a number of years after that,

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many congregations
didn’t have a Kingdom Hall of their own.

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.945 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They were actually encouraged

00:01:35.945 --> 00:01:37.947 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to meet in private homes

00:01:37.947 --> 00:01:39.949 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or in rented facilities.

00:01:39.949 --> 00:01:42.485 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The thinking was that if you

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:44.988 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were in a rented facility or a private home,

00:01:44.988 --> 00:01:46.222 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you had more flexibility.

00:01:46.222 --> 00:01:48.057 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You could move the meeting place

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:50.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
from one place to the other very easily.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:52.896 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But there were problems; there were drawbacks.

00:01:52.896 --> 00:01:54.497 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes the space

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:56.299 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be shared with other organizations.

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.535 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So you couldn’t leave your

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.637 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
literature, magazines,

00:02:00.637 --> 00:02:02.806 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
speaker’s stand, and maybe even a sound system

00:02:02.806 --> 00:02:04.707 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the hall at the end of the meeting.

00:02:04.707 --> 00:02:07.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the meeting was over,
you’d have to pack it all up

00:02:07.777 --> 00:02:09.779 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and take it away.

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:12.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But that’s not all.

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:17.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes you had to arrive very early
and clean the place up 

00:02:17.387 --> 00:02:20.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after a particularly rowdy group
of people had used it.

00:02:20.924 --> 00:02:24.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if there were cigar smokers
in that group, you were in trouble.

00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:29.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was very difficult to air the place out
in time for the meeting.

00:02:29.666 --> 00:02:34.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, remember, in those days,
people could smoke in a private hall,

00:02:34.571 --> 00:02:38.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you could smoke in an airplane
—they could smoke almost anywhere.

00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this was a real problem for us.

00:02:41.578 --> 00:02:43.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were other problems.

00:02:43.613 --> 00:02:46.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before we had a Kingdom Hall in my hometown,

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation met in a rented facility.

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:52.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in October,
the place was decorated for Halloween,

00:02:52.755 --> 00:02:57.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and in December, there was
a great big Christmas tree on the platform.

00:02:57.393 --> 00:02:58.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t move it!

00:02:58.995 --> 00:03:00.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, this was in Canada,

00:03:00.997 --> 00:03:03.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and portraits
of the King and Queen of England

00:03:03.266 --> 00:03:07.337 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the British flag
were permanent fixtures in the hall.

00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:10.607 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You couldn’t remove
any of it for the meeting.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, to their credit,

00:03:12.842 --> 00:03:15.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
many interested persons
attended our meetings.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:18.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to them, it wasn’t
the meeting place that was important;

00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:22.151 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was what
they were learning there that counted.

00:03:23.086 --> 00:03:25.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Speaking of our meeting places,

00:03:25.088 --> 00:03:27.490 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at first, congregations were on their own

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.525 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when it came to building them.

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:32.295 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Now, at times, the most a congregation

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:34.163 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
could afford was to purchase the land,

00:03:34.163 --> 00:03:36.032 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and sometimes that land would sit there

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:37.800 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for years because it would

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.769 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
take years to get the money together

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:41.271 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to build the hall.

00:03:42.372 --> 00:03:45.208 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And then once they had the money together,

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.310 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were there enough brothers who could take

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.512 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the lead in the construction?

00:03:49.512 --> 00:03:51.915 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes on a weekend, you’d see

00:03:51.915 --> 00:03:53.783 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
just one or two brothers working away

00:03:53.783 --> 00:03:55.251 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the site of the new hall.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:59.188 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You had to love them for their perseverance.

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:00.490 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Nowadays,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our Kingdom Hall construction
is supervised by the LDCs,

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.496 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with lots of qualified volunteers,

00:04:06.496 --> 00:04:10.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and practical Kingdom Halls
can be constructed in a short period of time.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:13.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about the meetings?

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:17.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For years, the Theocratic Ministry School,
Service Meeting,

00:04:17.073 --> 00:04:19.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Congregation Book Study,
and <i>Watchtower</i>  Study

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:21.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were all about an hour in length.

00:04:21.377 --> 00:04:23.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So were the public talks

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—when we had them.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:29.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at first, a public talk
wasn’t scheduled every week.

00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:32.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’d be a series of four or eight talks,

00:04:32.422 --> 00:04:34.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you could schedule that many speakers.

00:04:34.991 --> 00:04:38.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then, for a while,
the congregation wouldn’t have a public talk.

00:04:39.095 --> 00:04:40.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why was that?

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.298 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Remember,

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:43.800 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Theocratic Ministry School

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.436 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
didn’t get under way until 1943,

00:04:46.436 --> 00:04:48.171 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it took time for the brothers to develop

00:04:48.171 --> 00:04:50.807 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the skills to deliver an hour talk.

00:04:50.807 --> 00:04:53.443 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But in time, they were delivering

00:04:53.443 --> 00:04:55.445 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
excellent public talks!

00:04:56.579 --> 00:04:57.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you remember

00:04:57.981 --> 00:04:59.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we had individual handbills

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:01.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each public talk

00:05:01.584 --> 00:05:04.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the name of the speaker printed on them?

00:05:06.255 --> 00:05:08.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Until 1959,

00:05:08.257 --> 00:05:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only brothers were enrolled in the school.

00:05:11.294 --> 00:05:13.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For some years, during the first few minutes

00:05:13.596 --> 00:05:16.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the school there was a roll call,

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the names of all the brothers
enrolled in the school were read out.

00:05:19.402 --> 00:05:23.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when your name was read out,
you were to answer, “Present.”

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
A few rebels would say, “Here.”

00:05:25.942 --> 00:05:28.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you were supposed to say, “Present.”

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, initially,
according to the instructions,

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:33.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if anyone was deliberately

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:36.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and habitually absent over a period of time,

00:05:36.452 --> 00:05:38.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was dropped from the school.

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:42.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, that was discontinued.

00:05:42.658 --> 00:05:46.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, the roll-call arrangement
got me into a bit of trouble.

00:05:46.829 --> 00:05:50.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You see, in our congregation
when the roll was being called each week,

00:05:50.533 --> 00:05:52.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I noticed that there
were a few young brothers

00:05:52.702 --> 00:05:56.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were just a little bit older than I was
who would answer, “Present.”

00:05:56.873 --> 00:06:00.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one night after the school,
I asked the school servant

00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:03.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if I could have my name read out
at the next meeting.

00:06:03.546 --> 00:06:05.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He warmly commended me.

00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:09.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And sure enough,
I got my name read out the following week.

00:06:09.385 --> 00:06:12.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Everyone congratulated me after the meeting.

00:06:12.588 --> 00:06:14.190 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I couldn’t understand why.

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I only said, “Present.”

00:06:16.225 --> 00:06:20.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The problem was that I didn’t know
that when you got your name read out,

00:06:20.563 --> 00:06:22.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were agreeing to give a talk.

00:06:22.698 --> 00:06:26.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I thought I was just signing up
to have my name read out.

00:06:26.436 --> 00:06:31.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, a couple of months later,
on April 8, 1953,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I delivered my first
eight-minute talk on the theme

00:06:34.677 --> 00:06:37.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Proclaiming the World’s Doom.”

00:06:37.847 --> 00:06:39.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why an eight-minute talk?

00:06:39.415 --> 00:06:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we didn’t have Bible readings yet.

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:43.586 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when you were on the school,

00:06:43.586 --> 00:06:46.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you were giving an eight-minute talk.

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:50.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today, we make sure
everyone understands what’s involved

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in being a student in the midweek meeting.

00:06:53.696 --> 00:06:55.665 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In 1950,

00:06:55.665 --> 00:06:57.767 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we received the <i>New World Translation </i>

00:06:57.767 --> 00:07:00.303 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<i>of the Christian Greek Scriptures</i>  in English,

00:07:00.303 --> 00:07:01.671 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we were encouraged

00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:02.972 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to bring it to the meetings.

00:07:02.972 --> 00:07:06.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So for the Hebrew Scriptures,
you would have the <i>American Standard Version </i>

00:07:06.375 --> 00:07:08.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or the <i>King James Version </i>

00:07:08.044 --> 00:07:09.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>—</i>mostly the <i>American Standard Version </i>

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.248 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because it had Jehovah’s name.

00:07:12.248 --> 00:07:14.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’d have two Bibles
to bring to the meeting.

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s the one for the Hebrew Scriptures

00:07:16.819 --> 00:07:20.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the <i>New World Translation</i>
for the Greek Scriptures—two Bibles.

00:07:20.256 --> 00:07:21.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It wasn’t too bad.

00:07:22.592 --> 00:07:26.129 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But later, the <i>New World Translation </i>
<i>of the Hebrew Scriptures</i>

00:07:26.129 --> 00:07:28.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was released in installments.

00:07:28.631 --> 00:07:31.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you’d get a volume every year or two.

00:07:31.134 --> 00:07:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we received each new volume,

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we were encouraged
to bring it to the meeting.

00:07:36.339 --> 00:07:40.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in time, those volumes
started to pile up

00:07:40.209 --> 00:07:42.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that by 1960,

00:07:42.512 --> 00:07:45.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you might have volumes 1 through 5
of the Hebrew Scriptures,

00:07:45.848 --> 00:07:49.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also the Greek Scriptures,
and your regular study aids!

00:07:49.585 --> 00:07:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we had thick study aids in those days.

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:56.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had big briefcases
and strong backs in those days.

00:07:56.526 --> 00:07:59.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were really happy to get
the complete <i>New World Translation </i>

00:07:59.829 --> 00:08:03.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in just one volume in 1961.

00:08:05.568 --> 00:08:07.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s say a word about music.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s something that’s near
and dear to my heart.

00:08:10.773 --> 00:08:14.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For many years,
it was left up to the local servants

00:08:14.377 --> 00:08:17.346 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to decide which songs the congregation
would sing at the meetings.

00:08:17.346 --> 00:08:21.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the chairman of a particular meeting
would select the songs,

00:08:21.017 --> 00:08:24.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but his choice wasn’t always final.

00:08:24.086 --> 00:08:26.556 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Many Kingdom Halls had a piano

00:08:26.556 --> 00:08:27.990 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or some other instrument

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:29.325 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to accompany the singing.

00:08:29.325 --> 00:08:32.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But often the musician couldn’t play
all of the songs in the book,

00:08:32.995 --> 00:08:36.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we’d have to sing the songs he could play.

00:08:36.432 --> 00:08:40.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got to know those few songs really well!

00:08:40.436 --> 00:08:44.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those humble musicians
did their best to accompany our singing.

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:46.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as a result of all this,

00:08:46.976 --> 00:08:50.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the words to those songs
we sang nearly 70 years ago

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:52.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still come readily to mind.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember the written review?

00:08:56.752 --> 00:08:58.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe you don’t.

00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:01.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Congregations periodically

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:04.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had a written review of material
that had been covered

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Theocratic Ministry School
over the previous weeks.

00:09:06.596 --> 00:09:08.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, we had a half hour to answer

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:11.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about 25 questions.

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:13.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then, when the half hour was up,

00:09:13.436 --> 00:09:15.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we would write our name on the paper,

00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:18.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hand it in to the school servant,

00:09:18.874 --> 00:09:22.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he would take
all the papers home to grade them.

00:09:22.178 --> 00:09:26.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if there were 25 questions,
you’d get 4 points apiece

00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:29.218 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for each correct answer—100 points total.

00:09:29.218 --> 00:09:33.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then a week later,
he’d return the papers to us at the meeting.

00:09:33.723 --> 00:09:37.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, in the early years of the arrangement
(I remember well),

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:42.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he’d announce the highest
and lowest grade to the congregation.

00:09:42.064 --> 00:09:44.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, thankfully, he didn’t mention the names

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the one who got
the highest and lowest score.

00:09:47.069 --> 00:09:49.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, later, that arrangement to announce

00:09:49.138 --> 00:09:51.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the highest and lowest grade
was discontinued.

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:54.777 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when circuit assemblies

00:09:54.777 --> 00:09:56.912 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
began on Friday evening

00:09:56.912 --> 00:09:59.115 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and continued through Sunday afternoon?

00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:00.616 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A full program

00:10:00.616 --> 00:10:03.753 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was presented Saturday afternoon and evening.

00:10:04.654 --> 00:10:05.921 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There was never a dull moment

00:10:05.921 --> 00:10:07.356 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on Saturday night.

00:10:07.356 --> 00:10:08.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
There were lively demonstrations

00:10:08.958 --> 00:10:10.326 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that kept our interest

00:10:10.326 --> 00:10:11.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
right up to the end of the program.

00:10:13.596 --> 00:10:17.466 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes the sets were very elaborate.

00:10:17.466 --> 00:10:20.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
suppose a publisher was demonstrating

00:10:20.703 --> 00:10:22.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a presentation from door to door.

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:26.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, today
we’d just imagine there was a door.

00:10:26.309 --> 00:10:29.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But back then at the circuit assembly,

00:10:29.211 --> 00:10:32.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there might be a frame
with a painted door on the stage,

00:10:32.982 --> 00:10:36.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and maybe even a doorbell
for the publisher to ring.

00:10:36.585 --> 00:10:39.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, if the householder
was supposed to be interested,

00:10:39.689 --> 00:10:43.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you knew it
because the house number was 777.

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:46.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if the householder
was going to be opposed,

00:10:46.195 --> 00:10:51.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you knew that as well
because the house number would be 666.

00:10:51.033 --> 00:10:53.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, on one program that I remember,

00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:58.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the publisher knocks on the door
and a brother dressed as a priest answers.

00:10:58.207 --> 00:11:01.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He puts up a real argument about the Trinity.

00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:03.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk about visual aids

00:11:03.646 --> 00:11:07.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—but you never forgot what you saw and heard!

00:11:08.784 --> 00:11:13.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do you remember when
each congregation had a congregation servant

00:11:13.089 --> 00:11:15.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and up to seven other servants:

00:11:15.391 --> 00:11:18.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the assistant congregation servant,
the Bible study servant,

00:11:18.828 --> 00:11:21.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the accounts servant,
the <i>Watchtower</i>  study servant,

00:11:21.997 --> 00:11:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the magazine-territory servant,
the literature servant, 

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:27.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the Theocratic Ministry School servant?

00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, at that time,
apart from book study conductors,

00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:34.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you couldn’t have more than
eight servants in the congregation.

00:11:35.478 --> 00:11:38.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So unless someone moved,

00:11:38.247 --> 00:11:41.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a young man had no chance
of becoming a servant.

00:11:41.917 --> 00:11:46.188 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So how could a young man
reach out for more responsibility?

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:49.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how would the prophecy recorded

00:11:49.325 --> 00:11:52.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Micah 5:5 ever be fulfilled?

00:11:52.828 --> 00:11:54.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There Jehovah promised:

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:58.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“We will raise up against him
seven shepherds,

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:01.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
yes, eight princes of mankind.”

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:04.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, seven represents completeness.

00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:07.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So eight princes—that would indicate

00:12:07.176 --> 00:12:10.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be
more than enough men in the congregations

00:12:10.079 --> 00:12:12.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide theocratic direction.

00:12:12.148 --> 00:12:14.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how could that be
when there was basically

00:12:14.984 --> 00:12:18.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a limit of eight servants per congregation?

00:12:18.921 --> 00:12:22.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The answer came in 1971.

00:12:22.491 --> 00:12:24.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were thrilled when we understood

00:12:24.527 --> 00:12:27.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that each congregation has a body of elders,

00:12:27.563 --> 00:12:31.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there is no set number
of elders or ministerial servants.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As many as are qualified can be appointed.

00:12:36.238 --> 00:12:40.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, when I was baptized 66 years ago,

00:12:40.476 --> 00:12:44.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you didn’t have to be approved
for baptism by the congregation.

00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:47.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The only questions asked
of baptism candidates

00:12:47.817 --> 00:12:51.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were the two they answered
at the conclusion of the baptism talk.

00:12:52.054 --> 00:12:55.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That led to a few strange situations.

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:56.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On a few occasions

00:12:56.926 --> 00:12:58.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—much to the surprise of the servants—

00:12:58.928 --> 00:13:00.763 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
someone would rush up

00:13:00.763 --> 00:13:01.997 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to the front of the hall at the end

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:03.199 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the baptism talk,

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.568 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
answer the two questions,

00:13:05.568 --> 00:13:07.803 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and get baptized.

00:13:07.803 --> 00:13:10.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Something more was needed

00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:13.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—assurance that the individual
really knew what he was doing

00:13:13.976 --> 00:13:18.280 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and especially that he was living
in harmony with Scriptural principles.

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in 1967,

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
questions were provided
so that the responsible brothers

00:13:24.753 --> 00:13:29.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be assured that each candidate
was truly qualified for baptism.

00:13:30.259 --> 00:13:33.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those questions have been refined
over the years.

00:13:33.229 --> 00:13:37.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And today, we go over some 60 questions

00:13:37.032 --> 00:13:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with baptism candidates.

00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:41.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The copper has turned to gold.

00:13:43.138 --> 00:13:44.540 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Do you remember when there were

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:47.409 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
very few pictures in our publications?

00:13:47.409 --> 00:13:48.744 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the few that we had

00:13:48.744 --> 00:13:50.246 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were usually in black and white

00:13:50.246 --> 00:13:52.414 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
or only two colors.

00:13:52.414 --> 00:13:54.583 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Today, our spiritual food

00:13:54.583 --> 00:13:56.952 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is served in attractive publications

00:13:56.952 --> 00:13:58.954 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in full color.

00:13:59.955 --> 00:14:01.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, those of us who’ve served

00:14:01.957 --> 00:14:04.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in foreign-language congregations
will also remember

00:14:04.727 --> 00:14:06.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when a new publication in English

00:14:06.729 --> 00:14:11.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
might not be available
in another language for several years.

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:15.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Study articles trailed by several months.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:17.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, that’s before it became possible
for the branches

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do simultaneous printing.

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:21.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So here’s how it worked.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:25.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Material in English
would be mailed to the branches

00:14:25.047 --> 00:14:27.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by regular mail for translation.

00:14:27.616 --> 00:14:32.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If the translators had a question
about the meaning of a sentence in English,

00:14:32.555 --> 00:14:36.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would use regular mail
to send their question to headquarters.

00:14:36.725 --> 00:14:40.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In time, headquarters would answer back
by regular mail.

00:14:40.329 --> 00:14:43.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This back and forth
—it could take quite a while.

00:14:43.499 --> 00:14:46.435 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in some countries, mail service was poor.

00:14:47.903 --> 00:14:51.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, today,
thanks to special computer programs

00:14:51.373 --> 00:14:53.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our brothers have developed

00:14:53.475 --> 00:14:55.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the ability to communicate electronically

00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:57.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and some other factors, we’re able to release

00:14:57.913 --> 00:15:01.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
most language editions simultaneously
with the English.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an improvement!

00:15:05.454 --> 00:15:07.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, speaking of our literature,

00:15:07.756 --> 00:15:11.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do you realize that it’s been some 31 years

00:15:11.827 --> 00:15:14.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
since the decision was made
that in the United States

00:15:14.897 --> 00:15:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d no longer ask
for a contribution for our literature?

00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:21.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Later, the arrangement
was extended worldwide.

00:15:21.937 --> 00:15:26.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s been a real blessing for our brothers!

00:15:26.308 --> 00:15:28.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we were asking
for contributions for literature,

00:15:31.347 --> 00:15:34.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some brothers in Africa and other places

00:15:34.283 --> 00:15:37.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
couldn’t afford to have a <i>Watchtower </i>
for every member of the family.

00:15:37.953 --> 00:15:41.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were just too poor.

00:15:41.223 --> 00:15:43.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what about bound books?

00:15:43.993 --> 00:15:45.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ll tell you an experience.

00:15:45.995 --> 00:15:48.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In one African country, a missionary noticed

00:15:48.931 --> 00:15:51.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that a young brother quoted
a wide variety of scriptures

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his comments, and he got curious.

00:15:54.637 --> 00:15:56.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One day, he asked the young brother,

00:15:56.171 --> 00:15:59.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“How did you come to know
so many scriptures?”

00:15:59.708 --> 00:16:02.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brother replied:
“It’s the <i>Reasoning </i> book.

00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:06.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read it every chance I get.”

00:16:06.048 --> 00:16:08.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The missionary asked him, “What do you mean

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:11.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you read it every chance you get?”

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he replied:
“I don’t have a <i>Reasoning</i>  book myself.

00:16:15.524 --> 00:16:17.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I could never afford one.

00:16:17.459 --> 00:16:19.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But I know a sister who has one,

00:16:19.662 --> 00:16:22.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and she lets me borrow it from time to time.

00:16:22.531 --> 00:16:26.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I read it every chance I get.”

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you can imagine,

00:16:29.505 --> 00:16:32.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the missionary went out
and bought him a <i>Reasoning </i> book

00:16:32.141 --> 00:16:35.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and a <i>New World Translation </i>
for good measure.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:37.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was a great investment.

00:16:37.813 --> 00:16:40.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The young brother
was later called into Bethel,

00:16:40.315 --> 00:16:42.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and where do you think he was assigned?

00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:44.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To the literature department.

00:16:44.887 --> 00:16:48.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers knew
that he appreciated the literature so much

00:16:48.924 --> 00:16:53.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he’d make sure the congregations
had the literature they needed.

00:16:55.064 --> 00:16:57.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, looking back,

00:16:57.132 --> 00:17:00.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can see that the arrangements
back then served a purpose.

00:17:00.536 --> 00:17:02.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were like fine copper.

00:17:02.838 --> 00:17:06.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do not look down on them.

00:17:06.208 --> 00:17:08.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, we take the view expressed

00:17:08.644 --> 00:17:10.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Zechariah 4:10:

00:17:10.879 --> 00:17:14.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who has despised the day

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:16.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of small beginnings?”

00:17:16.652 --> 00:17:20.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, as those taking the lead
saw a better way of doing things,

00:17:20.589 --> 00:17:23.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they didn’t hesitate to make adjustments.

00:17:23.192 --> 00:17:25.694 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s very faith-strengthening.

00:17:25.694 --> 00:17:28.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the best is yet to come!

00:17:30.566 --> 00:17:32.568 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As I mentioned in the beginning,

00:17:32.568 --> 00:17:36.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this may be the first time that some of you
have heard about these things.

00:17:36.171 --> 00:17:39.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not ask someone
who has been in the truth for many years

00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:41.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what it was like
when he was new in the truth?

00:17:41.376 --> 00:17:45.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That could lead
to a very stimulating discussion!
