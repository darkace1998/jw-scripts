00:00:02.356 --> 00:00:05.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, dear brothers and sisters,

00:00:05.693 --> 00:00:07.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our program.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:10.656 line:10% position:50% align:center
Today, we’ll consider

00:00:10.656 --> 00:00:13.617 line:10% position:50% align:center
how we can use Bible principles

00:00:13.617 --> 00:00:15.619 line:10% position:50% align:center
to make good decisions.

00:00:16.287 --> 00:00:20.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
But first, let’s enjoy
some encouraging updates.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:25.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re pleased to share news
about two recent special conventions.

00:00:26.297 --> 00:00:31.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the weekend of May 23-25, 2025,

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:36.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
a special convention was held
in Santa Cruz, Bolivia.

00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:41.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the largest theocratic event
ever held in Bolivia.

00:00:41.186 --> 00:00:46.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 1,900 delegates came
from some 10 countries.

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:51.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peak attendance was 19,233,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 277 got baptized.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, on June 13-15,

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:04.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
a special convention
was held in Tiranë, Albania.

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:05.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
The peak attendance

00:01:05.878 --> 00:01:09.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
was 8,987,

00:01:09.173 --> 00:01:14.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
including nearly 2,000 delegates
from 17 countries.

00:01:14.887 --> 00:01:18.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was the largest
convention of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:01:18.098 --> 00:01:21.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
ever held in Albania,

00:01:21.101 --> 00:01:24.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 83 were baptized.

00:01:25.773 --> 00:01:30.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a delight to see
Jehovah’s people sharing together

00:01:30.277 --> 00:01:32.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
in pure worship!

00:01:33.572 --> 00:01:36.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
These occasions remind us of the words

00:01:36.158 --> 00:01:38.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Psalm 133:1:

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! How good and how pleasant it is

00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:48.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
for brothers to dwell together in unity!”

00:01:49.838 --> 00:01:54.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s discuss
how we as Christians

00:01:54.093 --> 00:01:59.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
can make wise decisions
using Bible principles

00:01:59.098 --> 00:02:02.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
rather than relying on a list of rules.

00:02:03.852 --> 00:02:06.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider this simple illustration:

00:02:06.897 --> 00:02:11.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
As children, our parents
gave us rules to keep us safe.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
They likely said, “Always hold my hand

00:02:16.407 --> 00:02:18.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
when crossing the street.”

00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:24.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our parents made that rule
to protect us from real danger.

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:26.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as we got older,

00:02:26.834 --> 00:02:30.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
we no longer needed to hold
Mom or Dad’s hand.

00:02:30.921 --> 00:02:32.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did the danger go away?

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:34.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:02:34.591 --> 00:02:39.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we learned to look
at the traffic in front of us

00:02:39.221 --> 00:02:42.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cross the road safely.

00:02:42.558 --> 00:02:45.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, it would seem odd

00:02:45.728 --> 00:02:48.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
if a healthy, 30-year-old man

00:02:48.647 --> 00:02:52.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
still needed to hold
his mother’s hand to cross the street.

00:02:54.611 --> 00:02:57.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, mature Christians

00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:00.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t need a rule for every situation.

00:03:01.076 --> 00:03:04.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we look at each situation

00:03:04.663 --> 00:03:07.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
and consider Bible principles.

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:11.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
If no Bible law is directly involved,

00:03:11.754 --> 00:03:14.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we use our Bible-trained conscience

00:03:14.673 --> 00:03:16.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a good decision.

00:03:17.426 --> 00:03:22.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, consider the use
of symbols or customs

00:03:22.431 --> 00:03:26.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may have roots in false religion.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our vast organization

00:03:29.354 --> 00:03:32.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
that spans 240 lands,

00:03:32.733 --> 00:03:36.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
can you imagine how many
different symbols and customs

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers encounter?

00:03:39.782 --> 00:03:42.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we make good decisions

00:03:42.367 --> 00:03:46.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the use of a certain symbol or custom?

00:03:47.247 --> 00:03:51.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, here are three
basic principles to consider.

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:57.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Would Jehovah be offended by this?

00:03:58.592 --> 00:04:03.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 2 Corinthians 6:17,
Jehovah gives us clear direction:

00:04:04.431 --> 00:04:08.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Therefore, get out from among them,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and separate yourselves,’

00:04:10.062 --> 00:04:14.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“says Jehovah,
‘and quit touching the unclean thing’;

00:04:14.316 --> 00:04:16.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and I will take you in.’”

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:19.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
This principle emphasizes

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:23.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Christians must stay far away

00:04:23.158 --> 00:04:27.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
from any symbol or custom
related to false religion

00:04:27.121 --> 00:04:29.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
or spiritism.

00:04:29.873 --> 00:04:34.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) How would this affect others

00:04:34.044 --> 00:04:36.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the congregation?

00:04:36.713 --> 00:04:40.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 14:19 and 21 remind us:

00:04:41.677 --> 00:04:46.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So, then, let us pursue
the things making for peace

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:49.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the things that build one another up.”

00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:52.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It is best not to eat meat or drink wine

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
or do anything
over which your brother stumbles.”

00:04:57.901 --> 00:05:01.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if a symbol
or custom isn’t wrong in itself,

00:05:01.947 --> 00:05:03.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to consider

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
how others in the congregation might view it.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never want our actions

00:05:11.415 --> 00:05:14.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
to offend others needlessly.

00:05:15.335 --> 00:05:20.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the same time,
as mature Christians we respect the right

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:23.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
that others have to make their own decisions

00:05:23.677 --> 00:05:27.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on their Bible-trained conscience.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
(3) How is this symbol or custom

00:05:32.686 --> 00:05:37.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
viewed by people
in my culture or community?

00:05:38.483 --> 00:05:40.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible principle at

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:45.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
1 Corinthians 9:20, 21, and 23 is:

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To the Jews I became as a Jew

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:50.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to gain Jews;

00:05:50.913 --> 00:05:54.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to those under law I became as under law,

00:05:54.374 --> 00:05:57.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“though I myself am not under law,

00:05:57.294 --> 00:06:00.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to gain those under law.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
“To those without law
I became as without law,

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“although I am not without law toward God

00:06:08.096 --> 00:06:10.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but under law toward Christ,

00:06:10.224 --> 00:06:13.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to gain those without law.”

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I do all things
for the sake of the good news,

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to share it with others.”

00:06:21.026 --> 00:06:24.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
The principle here
is that we take into account

00:06:24.655 --> 00:06:28.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
how others feel about and view matters.

00:06:29.284 --> 00:06:31.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing how a certain symbol or custom

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
is viewed in our own country or community

00:06:35.332 --> 00:06:37.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
is very important.

00:06:37.668 --> 00:06:42.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that is very offensive
in our land or culture

00:06:42.673 --> 00:06:45.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be viewed as completely innocent

00:06:45.968 --> 00:06:48.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
in another land or culture.

00:06:50.013 --> 00:06:52.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in 1976,

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:57.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
the <i>Awake! </i> magazine
posed this important question:

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:01.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What should be a Christian’s attitude

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“toward shapes and designs
that have at some time or place

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“been connected with false religion?

00:07:08.865 --> 00:07:10.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This question may be involved

00:07:10.951 --> 00:07:13.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when you choose wallpaper for your home,

00:07:13.745 --> 00:07:16.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the print on a necktie or dress,

00:07:16.373 --> 00:07:18.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or jewelry such as

00:07:18.375 --> 00:07:23.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“cuff links, a bracelet
or a necklace to purchase.

00:07:23.088 --> 00:07:27.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It may even be of concern
regarding the design of lamps or dishes.

00:07:27.926 --> 00:07:30.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You might wonder, ‘Is this design

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:33.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
somehow connected
with idolatrous worship?’”

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it offered this key thought:

00:07:37.686 --> 00:07:40.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many times a design will change

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:44.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in significance
according to location and time.

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:46.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A certain shape may have
a particular meaning

00:07:46.903 --> 00:07:49.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to an observer at one time and place,

00:07:49.906 --> 00:07:53.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but a different meaning
to an observer elsewhere

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:55.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in another age.”

00:07:55.871 --> 00:08:00.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So the Christian needs to be
primarily concerned about what?

00:08:00.125 --> 00:08:02.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not what a certain symbol or design

00:08:02.711 --> 00:08:05.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
“possibly meant thousands of years ago

00:08:05.589 --> 00:08:09.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or how it might be thought of
on the other side of the world,

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:13.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
but what it means now
to most people where he lives.”

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:18.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article gave examples
of common symbols

00:08:18.018 --> 00:08:22.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at one time were associated
with false worship

00:08:22.064 --> 00:08:25.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
but no longer have that meaning today.

00:08:26.151 --> 00:08:30.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
The examples mentioned
included the heart,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fleur-de-lis, and the pomegranate.

00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:37.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article concluded
with this practical advice:

00:08:37.954 --> 00:08:41.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With so many different designs

00:08:41.249 --> 00:08:43.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“having been used in false worship,

00:08:43.710 --> 00:08:46.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“if a person went to the trouble
and took the time

00:08:46.755 --> 00:08:50.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he might find an undesirable connection

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:54.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with almost every design
he sees around him.

00:08:54.513 --> 00:08:56.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But why do that?

00:08:56.515 --> 00:08:59.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Would it not be needlessly upsetting?

00:08:59.684 --> 00:09:03.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And is that the best use
of one’s time and attention?

00:09:03.688 --> 00:09:08.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If a particular design or shape
is commonly understood where you live

00:09:08.318 --> 00:09:12.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to be a religious symbol,
there is good reason to avoid it.

00:09:12.364 --> 00:09:16.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or if <i>many</i> people locally
have become especially sensitive

00:09:16.326 --> 00:09:18.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about some shape or decoration,

00:09:18.703 --> 00:09:22.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the mature Christian
might choose to shun it

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:26.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
so as to avoid needless disturbance
or stumbling.”

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are helpful principles, aren’t they?

00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:33.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true with customs.

00:09:34.302 --> 00:09:37.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way they are viewed
can change over time.

00:09:38.306 --> 00:09:41.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Awake!</i>  of January 8, 2000,

00:09:41.726 --> 00:09:44.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
featured an article entitled

00:09:44.938 --> 00:09:49.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A Balanced View of Popular Customs.”

00:09:49.818 --> 00:09:51.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
It observed:

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Customs have been
profoundly influenced by religion.

00:09:56.283 --> 00:10:00.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many, in fact, arose from old superstitions

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:03.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
and non-Biblical religious ideas.”

00:10:04.875 --> 00:10:08.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article mentioned several examples.

00:10:08.003 --> 00:10:12.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of these customs may have had
false religious origins.

00:10:12.632 --> 00:10:14.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, the article noted:

00:10:15.093 --> 00:10:17.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Over the years, however,

00:10:17.095 --> 00:10:20.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the religious associations have faded,

00:10:20.432 --> 00:10:23.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and today these practices and customs

00:10:23.477 --> 00:10:26.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
have no religious significance.”

00:10:26.897 --> 00:10:29.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then it asked: “So, what should a Christian

00:10:29.608 --> 00:10:31.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
“primarily be concerned about?

00:10:31.818 --> 00:10:33.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Although there may be reason

00:10:33.904 --> 00:10:37.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to examine the origin
of a particular custom,

00:10:37.157 --> 00:10:40.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in some cases
it is more important to consider 

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:43.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“what the custom means</i>
<i> to people at the time</i>

00:10:43.288 --> 00:10:47.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“and in the place where one now lives.</i>

00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:49.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If a custom has unscriptural

00:10:49.628 --> 00:10:51.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or otherwise negative connotations

00:10:51.963 --> 00:10:54.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
“during a particular period of the year

00:10:54.382 --> 00:10:57.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or under certain circumstances,

00:10:57.093 --> 00:11:01.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christians may wisely decide
to avoid it at that time.”

00:11:02.265 --> 00:11:04.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some common examples today?

00:11:05.894 --> 00:11:09.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about covering your mouth
when yawning?

00:11:10.732 --> 00:11:14.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
In ancient times, some people did so

00:11:14.778 --> 00:11:19.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they thought it would prevent
one’s soul from escaping.

00:11:20.992 --> 00:11:23.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about today?

00:11:23.245 --> 00:11:28.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, it is commonly viewed
as a way of being polite

00:11:28.124 --> 00:11:31.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
and does not have a spiritistic meaning.

00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:35.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about wedding rings?

00:11:35.006 --> 00:11:39.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some historians claim
wedding rings have pagan roots.

00:11:40.345 --> 00:11:44.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, today most people
simply view wedding rings

00:11:44.349 --> 00:11:48.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a sign that the wearer is married.

00:11:50.188 --> 00:11:54.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
An example that illustrates
the importance of timing

00:11:54.234 --> 00:11:56.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
is string lights.

00:11:56.653 --> 00:11:58.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many Bethelites here at Warwick

00:11:58.697 --> 00:12:01.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
enjoy putting white string lights

00:12:01.283 --> 00:12:05.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
on their balconies as decorations

00:12:05.036 --> 00:12:09.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
—except during November and December.

00:12:10.458 --> 00:12:12.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not then?

00:12:12.502 --> 00:12:15.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because in this region of the world,

00:12:15.255 --> 00:12:19.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
string lights are closely associated
with Christmas,

00:12:19.259 --> 00:12:21.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
a false religious holiday.

00:12:22.262 --> 00:12:25.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our Bethel family
avoids even the appearance

00:12:25.849 --> 00:12:30.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
of participating
in that false religious celebration.

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another example
is toasting

00:12:35.734 --> 00:12:38.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
or clinking glasses.

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:43.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
For years, Jehovah’s Witnesses
have avoided this practice

00:12:43.116 --> 00:12:47.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it may have had origins
in false religion.

00:12:48.246 --> 00:12:51.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, now in most places,

00:12:51.082 --> 00:12:54.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
toasting or clinking glasses

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:57.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
no longer has any religious association.

00:12:58.506 --> 00:13:02.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is viewed simply as a friendly custom.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, after prayerful consideration,

00:13:07.599 --> 00:13:10.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body has concluded

00:13:10.268 --> 00:13:13.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there is no need to make a rule

00:13:13.271 --> 00:13:17.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding toasting and clinking glasses.

00:13:17.567 --> 00:13:21.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each Christian should use the principles

00:13:21.571 --> 00:13:24.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have discussed in this update

00:13:24.074 --> 00:13:29.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his own Bible-trained conscience
to make a good decision.

00:13:30.038 --> 00:13:32.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this mean?

00:13:32.374 --> 00:13:35.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are we saying that toasting is OK now

00:13:35.669 --> 00:13:39.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
at all times and in every situation?

00:13:40.131 --> 00:13:42.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:13:42.133 --> 00:13:47.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are simply saying
that there is no need to make a rule.

00:13:47.931 --> 00:13:52.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each Christian will need
to use Bible principles

00:13:52.602 --> 00:13:56.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make a good decision in each instance.

00:13:57.399 --> 00:14:00.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since there are so many different situations

00:14:00.568 --> 00:14:05.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could arise in the 240 lands
where Jehovah’s people serve,

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
what a blessing
that Jehovah has given us

00:14:11.454 --> 00:14:14.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
these Bible principles!

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:18.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s briefly review them.

00:14:19.713 --> 00:14:22.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, and most important,

00:14:22.924 --> 00:14:27.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
we love Jehovah
and always want to please him<b>.</b>

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:31.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we might ask ourselves,

00:14:31.099 --> 00:14:34.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Would Jehovah
be offended by the toast?’

00:14:35.437 --> 00:14:40.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, is it associated
with a religious or nationalistic holiday?

00:14:41.776 --> 00:14:46.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or is it a simple expression or gesture

00:14:46.698 --> 00:14:49.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
promoting friendship or health?

00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:55.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we love our brothers and sisters

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:59.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would not want
to needlessly offend them.

00:15:00.253 --> 00:15:04.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
We respect their feelings
and their conscience.

00:15:04.924 --> 00:15:06.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third,

00:15:06.926 --> 00:15:10.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we love
Jehovah and people,

00:15:10.472 --> 00:15:15.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are sensitive
to how any custom is viewed

00:15:15.018 --> 00:15:18.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our own local culture or community.

00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:22.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what have we learned?

00:15:22.859 --> 00:15:27.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah doesn’t burden us
with endless rules.

00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:32.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, he lovingly
provides principles in his Word.

00:15:33.661 --> 00:15:37.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
These help us make wise, thoughtful,

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:39.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
and loving decisions

00:15:39.584 --> 00:15:42.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding symbols and customs.

00:15:43.588 --> 00:15:47.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re also reminded
to respect the conscience of others

00:15:47.926 --> 00:15:52.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and avoid imposing
our personal views on others.

00:15:53.306 --> 00:15:55.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has given us freedom,

00:15:55.642 --> 00:15:59.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we respect the freedom
that others have too.

00:16:01.022 --> 00:16:05.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
By applying Bible principles
with love and discernment,

00:16:06.444 --> 00:16:11.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
we remain united
and avoid stumbling others.

00:16:12.283 --> 00:16:14.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is our earnest prayer?

00:16:15.161 --> 00:16:18.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is just as the apostle Paul expressed

00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:21.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ephesians 4:13,

00:16:21.042 --> 00:16:26.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “we all attain
to the oneness of the faith

00:16:26.047 --> 00:16:29.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and of the accurate knowledge
of the Son of God,

00:16:29.592 --> 00:16:32.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to being a full-grown man,

00:16:32.971 --> 00:16:35.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
“attaining the measure of stature

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
that belongs to the fullness of the Christ.”

00:16:41.104 --> 00:16:43.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:16:43.398 --> 00:16:48.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
please know
that we love you all very much.

00:16:50.196 --> 00:16:55.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:16:55.201 --> 00:16:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.
