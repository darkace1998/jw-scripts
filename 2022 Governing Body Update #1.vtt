00:00:01.351 --> 00:00:03.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:00:03.353 --> 00:00:06.289 line:10% position:50% align:center
welcome to this update!

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:10.226 line:10% position:50% align:center
The Omicron variant of the COVID-19 virus

00:00:10.226 --> 00:00:13.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
has quickly spread throughout the world.

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
The number of cases has exploded.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re saddened to report

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:21.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
that as of Friday, January 21,

00:00:21.905 --> 00:00:25.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
26,813 of our brothers

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:29.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
have now died from COVID-19.

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:32.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there have been
some encouraging developments.

00:00:32.916 --> 00:00:35.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those who are vaccinated,

00:00:35.218 --> 00:00:38.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
cases of Omicron are generally milder

00:00:38.688 --> 00:00:42.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have not led to hospitalization or death.

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:45.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, you may have heard reports

00:00:45.762 --> 00:00:49.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there has been a major outbreak
of Omicron in Puerto Rico.

00:00:49.833 --> 00:00:52.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
You may also know that Puerto Rico

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:55.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
has a very high rate of vaccination.

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:59.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although 551 cases were reported

00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:02.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
among our brothers
during the recent outbreak,

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:05.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
only three of our brothers have died.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it is our understanding that all of them

00:01:08.284 --> 00:01:11.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
had serious underlying health issues.

00:01:12.288 --> 00:01:15.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even one death is too many,

00:01:15.191 --> 00:01:18.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
yet we’re relieved that so few died.

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:22.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our hearts go out to all
who have lost loved ones.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please continue to be careful.

00:01:26.102 --> 00:01:28.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
The pandemic is not over,

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:31.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we need to continue
to take practical steps

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:35.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
to protect our lives and our health.

00:01:36.412 --> 00:01:38.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to the pandemic,

00:01:38.715 --> 00:01:42.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
it has been sobering
to watch recent world events unfold.

00:01:42.786 --> 00:01:46.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see one natural disaster after another,

00:01:46.589 --> 00:01:49.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we hear threats of war.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:52.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The king of the north”
and “the king of the south”

00:01:52.095 --> 00:01:55.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
continue “pushing” one another.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:59.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we hear all these things
happening in the world,

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:03.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
it reminds us how vital it is
that we “keep on the watch”.

00:02:03.706 --> 00:02:06.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to stay awake spiritually

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not doze off or get distracted.

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:11.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:02:11.114 --> 00:02:16.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we are living
in the most critical time in human history.

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:20.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus knew that the last days
would bring challenges

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would test our spiritual focus.

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
Out of his deep love, he urged his followers

00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:30.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Luke chapter 21

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:33.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 34-36:

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But pay attention to yourselves

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:40.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that your hearts never become weighed down

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with overeating and heavy drinking
and anxieties of life,

00:02:44.814 --> 00:02:49.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and suddenly that day
be instantly upon you as a snare.

00:02:49.752 --> 00:02:54.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For it will come upon all those dwelling
on the face of the whole earth.

00:02:54.524 --> 00:02:59.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep awake, then,
all the time making supplication

00:02:59.495 --> 00:03:03.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you may succeed
in escaping all these things

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:07.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
that must occur and in standing
before the Son of man.”

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:11.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
We constantly hear encouraging reports

00:03:11.774 --> 00:03:16.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you dear brothers and sisters
are working hard to “keep awake”

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:20.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remain busy in your service to Jehovah.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re busy in your personal ministry

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
—writing letters, making phone calls,

00:03:25.722 --> 00:03:30.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looking for opportunities
to share the good news informally—

00:03:30.493 --> 00:03:33.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many were able to auxiliary pioneer

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the recent campaign.

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:40.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
Staying busy in Jehovah’s service
is a protection for us.

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:44.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
But more is required to protect our hearts.

00:03:44.407 --> 00:03:47.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s vital for all of us to “keep awake”

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be watchful of things

00:03:50.146 --> 00:03:53.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could pose a danger to us spiritually.

00:03:54.751 --> 00:03:57.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some of these dangers?

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus mentioned things
like “overeating and heavy drinking

00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:03.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
and anxieties of life.”

00:04:03.927 --> 00:04:07.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are some ways
that these things could cause our hearts

00:04:07.764 --> 00:04:10.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “become weighed down”?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:15.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, let’s talk
about one common cause for anxiety

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:17.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
—social isolation.

00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:21.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt we have never felt as isolated

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we have during this pandemic.

00:04:23.746 --> 00:04:28.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
True, it has been necessary
to isolate ourselves physically

00:04:28.451 --> 00:04:31.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

00:04:31.854 --> 00:04:34.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
But if we’re not careful,

00:04:34.824 --> 00:04:38.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
we could start
to isolate ourselves in other ways.

00:04:38.995 --> 00:04:42.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe at times, we feel Zoom fatigue,

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:46.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we even want
to isolate ourselves virtually.

00:04:46.903 --> 00:04:49.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the danger?

00:04:49.238 --> 00:04:52.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 18:1 says:

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:55.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whoever isolates himself

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
“pursues his own selfish desires;

00:04:58.314 --> 00:05:01.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
he rejects all practical wisdom.”

00:05:01.884 --> 00:05:06.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
It takes effort to reach out
to our brothers by telephone,

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:11.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
by videoconference,
or even with an email or text message,

00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:16.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
but so often the encouragement
that we receive from doing so

00:05:16.332 --> 00:05:19.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes the effort so worthwhile.

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:23.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, we receive back
more than what we may have given.

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:28.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as Jesus said at Acts 20:35:

00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:31.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is more happiness in giving

00:05:31.714 --> 00:05:34.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
than there is in receiving.”

00:05:34.484 --> 00:05:38.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
An article on jw.org entitled

00:05:38.388 --> 00:05:40.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How to Deal With Isolation”

00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:43.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
made an interesting point
under the heading

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:45.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Cultivate friendships”:

00:05:46.662 --> 00:05:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Friendships benefit
your mental and emotional health

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:55.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and are even more important
when face-to-face connections are difficult.

00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you are confined at home,

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you may be able to use videoconferencing

00:06:00.676 --> 00:06:04.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or voice calls
to maintain existing friendships

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
and build new ones.”

00:06:07.016 --> 00:06:11.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need our brothers and sisters,
and they need us!

00:06:11.587 --> 00:06:15.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
To have a friend, we must be a friend.

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:17.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be a friend!

00:06:17.693 --> 00:06:20.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could you reach out to someone this week?

00:06:20.897 --> 00:06:23.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you can think of a friend

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:26.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
whom you haven’t been able
to talk with for some time.

00:06:26.602 --> 00:06:29.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
The joy of speaking with your friend

00:06:29.505 --> 00:06:33.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
will no doubt calm
some of the anxieties in your heart.

00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:39.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t wait to get back
to our Kingdom Halls, Assembly Halls,

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:42.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have our large regional conventions,

00:06:42.385 --> 00:06:46.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
special conventions,
and even international conventions.

00:06:46.889 --> 00:06:51.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the meantime, we are grateful
that we have other means

00:06:51.394 --> 00:06:54.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
to enjoy these programs, such as Zoom,

00:06:54.697 --> 00:06:58.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
JW Stream and, in some cases,

00:06:58.301 --> 00:07:00.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
TV and radio.

00:07:01.404 --> 00:07:06.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, most congregations
are using Zoom for their meetings.

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it encouraging
to see our brothers’ and sisters’ faces?

00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:14.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate
being able to see them comment

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see them singing from the heart.

00:07:17.053 --> 00:07:22.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
This also helps us
to fight feelings of isolation.

00:07:22.024 --> 00:07:25.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply turning your camera on and smiling,

00:07:25.695 --> 00:07:27.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
even a simple wave,

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be such an encouragement to others.

00:07:31.033 --> 00:07:34.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can make it our goal to connect early

00:07:34.871 --> 00:07:38.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stay longer after the meeting.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can enjoy visiting
with the friends in breakout rooms.

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:46.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
these are some practical ways

00:07:46.449 --> 00:07:50.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can fight back
against feelings of isolation

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:52.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the anxiety that isolation

00:07:52.855 --> 00:07:55.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
can create in our hearts.

00:07:56.626 --> 00:08:01.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another danger
that Jesus mentioned was heavy drinking.

00:08:01.464 --> 00:08:03.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, there’s nothing wrong

00:08:03.833 --> 00:08:06.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
with drinking alcohol in moderation.

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:11.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures describe wine
as a gift from God,

00:08:11.207 --> 00:08:14.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
designed to make the “heart rejoice.”

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
But some caution is needed.

00:08:16.312 --> 00:08:18.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:08:18.314 --> 00:08:22.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, Jesus specifically cautioned

00:08:22.251 --> 00:08:25.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our hearts
could become “weighed down

00:08:25.555 --> 00:08:28.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
with . . . heavy drinking.”

00:08:28.224 --> 00:08:31.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Secular reports indicate that many people

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:36.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
have increased their alcohol consumption
during the pandemic.

00:08:37.033 --> 00:08:42.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
The article “Alcohol Consumption
—How Can You Stay in Control?”

00:08:42.038 --> 00:08:44.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org states:

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Some people drink more alcohol

00:08:46.776 --> 00:08:50.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when they feel stressed,
lonely, or simply bored.

00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:53.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Are you drinking more than you used to?

00:08:53.649 --> 00:08:56.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If so, how can you make sure

00:08:56.285 --> 00:08:59.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that your drinking does not get out of hand

00:08:59.055 --> 00:09:01.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
or lead to alcohol dependence?”

00:09:02.458 --> 00:09:05.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even if a person does not get drunk,

00:09:05.127 --> 00:09:09.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
immoderate drinking
can pose spiritual dangers.

00:09:10.666 --> 00:09:14.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 5:11 says:

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Woe to those who get up early
in the morning to drink alcohol,

00:09:19.275 --> 00:09:22.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who linger late into the evening darkness

00:09:22.678 --> 00:09:24.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
until wine inflames them!”

00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:27.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why these woes?

00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:32.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the spiritual consequences
in the second half of verse 12:

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They do not consider
the activity of Jehovah,

00:09:35.825 --> 00:09:39.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they do not see the work of his hands.”

00:09:39.929 --> 00:09:44.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Immoderate drinking
can weigh our hearts down

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and cause us to neglect spiritual things.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can cause us
to slow down in the race for life

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even to stop running altogether.

00:09:54.143 --> 00:09:57.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
No wonder Jesus specifically mentioned it

00:09:57.947 --> 00:10:01.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
when discussing the need
to keep awake spiritually.

00:10:02.885 --> 00:10:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not review that article on jw.org,

00:10:07.256 --> 00:10:09.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
which features five tips

00:10:09.492 --> 00:10:13.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us keep alcohol in its proper place?

00:10:14.997 --> 00:10:19.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is another potential danger
to our spiritual alertness?

00:10:19.835 --> 00:10:22.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Misuse of social media.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:28.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s been a lot of concern
from governmental and medical authorities

00:10:28.077 --> 00:10:30.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the effect that social media

00:10:30.313 --> 00:10:34.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
is having on people’s
mental and emotional health.

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:38.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even more important
are the spiritual concerns:

00:10:38.454 --> 00:10:42.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
the content, the people,
and the amount of time involved.

00:10:42.958 --> 00:10:45.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can be addictive.

00:10:45.428 --> 00:10:50.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
if you decide to allow your family

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:54.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use social media, please be alert.

00:10:54.036 --> 00:10:56.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make sure you have good association

00:10:56.405 --> 00:11:00.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those who promote good spiritual habits,

00:11:00.242 --> 00:11:03.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether on screen or off.

00:11:03.312 --> 00:11:08.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
The whiteboard animation
<i>Be Social-Network Smart</i>

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:10.186 line:10% position:50% align:center
provides some good reminders

00:11:10.186 --> 00:11:15.124 line:10% position:50% align:center
on how to be balanced yet cautious
when using social media.

00:11:15.958 --> 00:11:19.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the final challenge
we want to consider?

00:11:19.028 --> 00:11:21.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tests of neutrality.

00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:25.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
With so many different
challenging situations in the world

00:11:25.735 --> 00:11:29.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even the threat of war in some countries,

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:32.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
we need to be sure
that we are not allowing our hearts

00:11:32.808 --> 00:11:35.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take sides on these issues.

00:11:35.211 --> 00:11:39.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
How sad it has been
to see simple public health measures

00:11:39.115 --> 00:11:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
like wearing masks, handwashing,

00:11:41.851 --> 00:11:45.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
physical distancing, and vaccinations

00:11:45.354 --> 00:11:49.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
become controversial, even political!

00:11:49.558 --> 00:11:51.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our brothers and sisters

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been influenced by the political views

00:11:54.764 --> 00:11:57.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those in their community.

00:11:57.333 --> 00:11:59.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some have turned to the Internet

00:11:59.869 --> 00:12:02.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have been deeply influenced

00:12:02.104 --> 00:12:04.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
by official-appearing websites

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
filled with highly political propaganda.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:11.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters, be careful.

00:12:11.213 --> 00:12:13.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just because something appears

00:12:13.549 --> 00:12:16.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
on an official-looking web page
on the Internet

00:12:16.552 --> 00:12:18.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not make it true.

00:12:18.754 --> 00:12:21.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
We must guard
against “the spirit of the world”

00:12:21.957 --> 00:12:24.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remain neutral.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:28.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
How appropriate are Jesus’ words:

00:12:28.297 --> 00:12:31.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pay attention to yourselves

00:12:31.233 --> 00:12:35.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your hearts
never become weighed down.”

00:12:35.271 --> 00:12:38.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s keep focused on God’s Kingdom

00:12:38.574 --> 00:12:42.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the only solution
to this world’s problems.

00:12:42.645 --> 00:12:46.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
What has helped
some families to keep awake?

00:12:46.415 --> 00:12:49.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see as we watch the following video.

00:12:51.387 --> 00:12:52.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic,

00:12:52.655 --> 00:12:54.590 line:10% position:50% align:center
it was definitely difficult

00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:56.425 line:10% position:50% align:center
to keep a good routine

00:12:56.425 --> 00:12:59.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it was very easy to form bad habits.

00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:02.498 line:10% position:50% align:center
During isolation,

00:13:02.498 --> 00:13:04.700 line:10% position:50% align:center
I spent more time in front of the computer,

00:13:04.700 --> 00:13:06.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it disturbed my sleep pattern.

00:13:07.369 --> 00:13:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had to make an adjustment

00:13:09.405 --> 00:13:12.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
(because with bad habits, you know,
they’re easy to form and hard to break),

00:13:12.408 --> 00:13:15.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I did a little bit
of replacement therapy (I call it),

00:13:15.744 --> 00:13:19.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
where you switch from mindless TV watching

00:13:19.081 --> 00:13:20.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to something
that’s a little bit more profitable,

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:23.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is our own TV station,
JW Broadcasting®.

00:13:25.187 --> 00:13:27.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I spent a lot of time watching television,

00:13:27.823 --> 00:13:31.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
I heard a lot of negative information
about vaccination.

00:13:31.026 --> 00:13:32.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was frightened.

00:13:33.662 --> 00:13:35.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt pressure from the media,

00:13:35.531 --> 00:13:38.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I decided
not to get vaccinated for some time.

00:13:41.203 --> 00:13:43.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
We often asked Jehovah for guidance.

00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:48.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body updates were timely

00:13:48.244 --> 00:13:50.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped us to make the right decisions.

00:13:53.182 --> 00:13:57.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the pandemic first started,
I had a lot of free time on my hands,

00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:00.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I was just on social media all the time

00:14:00.556 --> 00:14:02.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
or on technology all the time.

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:04.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Family worship was an excellent opportunity

00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:08.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us to be able to talk about social media
—to really get Jehovah’s thinking on it—

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:12.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can balance it
while not eliminating it completely,

00:14:12.067 --> 00:14:14.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we controlled it
and it didn’t control us.

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:19.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a slow process,
but eventually I deleted my social media

00:14:19.441 --> 00:14:23.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
and began setting time limits for other apps

00:14:23.913 --> 00:14:25.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would take a lot of my time.

00:14:26.448 --> 00:14:29.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our family decided
to spend more time together.

00:14:29.985 --> 00:14:32.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
We played music and danced together.

00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:36.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
We played board games
and went for walks together in the forest.

00:14:36.191 --> 00:14:39.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helped us
to reduce the time we used for social media.

00:14:41.564 --> 00:14:44.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided to keep my schedule busy,

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:48.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I started a few new hobbies,
like knitting and gardening.

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:55.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw a lot of benefit in staying close
to the congregation through Zoom,

00:14:55.945 --> 00:14:58.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though Zoom is not easy for me.

00:14:58.247 --> 00:14:59.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Being able to spend time

00:14:59.949 --> 00:15:03.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
with people who were going
through the same thing as I was,

00:15:03.385 --> 00:15:04.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
was really beneficial.

00:15:04.787 --> 00:15:06.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could all talk
about what we were dealing with

00:15:06.789 --> 00:15:08.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encourage each other as well.

00:15:08.924 --> 00:15:12.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
We arranged
online Bible-based games through Zoom<i>.</i> 

00:15:13.062 --> 00:15:16.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found it nice to use Zoom
to connect with the congregation

00:15:16.599 --> 00:15:19.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
for events that were planned
by those in our hall.

00:15:19.501 --> 00:15:21.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them were interviews

00:15:21.437 --> 00:15:23.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those who have been
in our hall for a long time,

00:15:23.739 --> 00:15:26.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
so it was nice to hear those experiences

00:15:26.075 --> 00:15:28.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and be able to draw closer to them.

00:15:28.611 --> 00:15:31.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the pandemic,
I would reach out to others

00:15:31.814 --> 00:15:35.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
—either a phone call
or a little card or a text message

00:15:35.084 --> 00:15:37.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just dropping something off
at someone’s door—

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it helped me to feel closer
to my brothers and sisters too.

00:15:40.789 --> 00:15:44.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body updates
were an absolute lifeline.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were something that really helped us
to focus all of our activity.

00:15:48.564 --> 00:15:51.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
As parents, they helped us
to have clear direction,

00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:54.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we felt like we were guided
through the whole pandemic

00:15:54.737 --> 00:15:56.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encouraged at the same time.

00:15:57.272 --> 00:16:02.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also have been able to see Jehovah
answer my personal prayers even more so

00:16:02.277 --> 00:16:05.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see just how he
is holding all of us up

00:16:05.481 --> 00:16:09.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
during this difficult time,
because I don’t think any of us

00:16:09.184 --> 00:16:11.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
could get through this pandemic without him.

00:16:13.188 --> 00:16:18.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are proud of these families
for keeping awake to spiritual dangers.

00:16:18.093 --> 00:16:22.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice
how they counteracted social isolation?

00:16:22.231 --> 00:16:25.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have reached out to others regularly.

00:16:25.134 --> 00:16:27.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
They use videoconferencing

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:31.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay close
to their congregations and dear friends.

00:16:31.306 --> 00:16:35.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice how they addressed
their use of social media?

00:16:35.844 --> 00:16:38.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
They talked about it as a family

00:16:38.547 --> 00:16:41.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and decided either to reduce the time spent

00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:44.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
or eliminate it completely.

00:16:44.219 --> 00:16:47.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have also increased
the time they spend together,

00:16:47.756 --> 00:16:51.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
including enjoyable outdoor activities.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did they handle tests of neutrality?

00:16:55.397 --> 00:16:59.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
They prayed to Jehovah
and trusted the information

00:16:59.668 --> 00:17:02.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided by “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:17:02.805 --> 00:17:06.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
in making their own personal decisions.

00:17:08.143 --> 00:17:12.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Very soon, Jehovah’s day
will come upon all the earth.

00:17:12.848 --> 00:17:16.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s vital that we keep awake.

00:17:16.151 --> 00:17:20.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now is not the time
to become spiritually drowsy or distracted!

00:17:21.724 --> 00:17:26.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Jesus’ words at Luke 21:36:

00:17:26.061 --> 00:17:30.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep awake, then,
all the time making supplication

00:17:30.899 --> 00:17:34.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you may succeed
in escaping all these things

00:17:34.436 --> 00:17:38.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
that must occur and in standing
before the Son of man.”

00:17:40.008 --> 00:17:42.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
By earnestly supplicating Jehovah

00:17:42.745 --> 00:17:45.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
and applying the fine direction
we are receiving,

00:17:45.848 --> 00:17:48.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will be successful!

00:17:49.551 --> 00:17:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center

of Jehovah’s Witnesses,
