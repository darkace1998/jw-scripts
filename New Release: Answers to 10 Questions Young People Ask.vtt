00:00.917 --> 00:05.655
We’re also pleased to announce 
the release of a new brochure 


00:05.655 --> 00:10.393
entitled 
Answers to 10 Questions Young People Ask.


00:10.393 --> 00:15.031
The content of this 32-page, 
full-color brochure 


00:15.032 --> 00:19.035
is based on articles 
in Awake! and the two volumes 


00:19.035 --> 00:23.507
of Questions Young People Ask
—Answers That Work, as well as 


00:23.507 --> 00:28.244
the “Young People Ask” articles 
on the jw.org website. 


00:28.243 --> 00:31.915
This new brochure 
will be particularly helpful 


00:31.915 --> 00:36.518
to those who speak a language 
in which that material is not available. 


00:36.518 --> 00:41.123
However, all young people 
can benefit from this new brochure 


00:41.123 --> 00:46.128
because the original articles 
have been updated and rewritten.


00:46.128 --> 00:50.600
Each section of the brochure 
addresses one question. 


00:50.600 --> 00:55.472
After stating the question, 
the section begins with a pointed statement 


00:55.472 --> 00:58.340
under the feature 
“Why It Matters,” 


00:58.340 --> 01:02.212
letting the reader know 
why that question is relevant. 


01:02.212 --> 01:06.750
Then, a “What Would You Do?” 
scenario is presented, 


01:06.750 --> 01:09.952
putting the reader 
in a hypothetical situation 


01:09.952 --> 01:12.089
related to the topic. 


01:12.088 --> 01:15.023
After discussing various principles, 


01:15.023 --> 01:18.828
Scriptural advice 
directs the reader to the best answers 


01:18.828 --> 01:21.363
for that particular question.


01:21.363 --> 01:24.466
The 10 Questions brochure 
is interactive, 


01:24.467 --> 01:26.970
allowing the reader 
to write responses 


01:26.970 --> 01:29.372
to the various questions presented. 


01:29.372 --> 01:33.710
The final topic, 
“How Can the Bible Help Me?,” 


01:33.710 --> 01:37.847
is designed to invite readers 
who are not Jehovah’s Witnesses 


01:37.847 --> 01:39.982
to accept a Bible study. 


01:39.982 --> 01:42.985
The brochure 
makes numerous references 


01:42.985 --> 01:45.322
to the jw.org website 


01:45.322 --> 01:49.592
and directs readers to more information 
that can be found there. 


01:49.592 --> 01:53.395
Also, the brochure 
is designed in such a way 


01:53.395 --> 01:57.533
that young people can be comfortable 
sharing it with their peers 


01:57.533 --> 02:00.068
and with others in the ministry.


02:00.068 --> 02:05.006
This brochure 
is already approved for translation 


02:05.007 --> 02:08.579
into 324 languages. 


02:08.578 --> 02:13.583
Of these languages, 
223 do not produce Awake! 


02:13.583 --> 02:17.253
and 262 have not produced 


02:17.253 --> 02:19.255
the Young People Ask books. 


02:19.255 --> 02:23.392
So we expect that Answers 
to 10 Questions Young People Ask 


02:23.392 --> 02:26.129
will help 
many more youths benefit 


02:26.128 --> 02:29.198
from the Bible’s practical wisdom.


02:29.198 --> 02:33.001
Following this program, 
digital formats of the brochure 


02:33.002 --> 02:36.472
will become available 
on the jw.org website, 


02:36.472 --> 02:41.410
the JW Library app, 
and on Watchtower ONLINE LIBRARY 


02:41.410 --> 02:44.047
as they are produced 
in each language. 


02:44.047 --> 02:48.552
Additionally, printed copies 
of the brochure can be requested 


02:48.552 --> 03:03.184
through your congregation 
at the conclusion of this program.
