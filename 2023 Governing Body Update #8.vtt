00:00:01.647 --> 00:00:05.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Welcome, dear brothers and sisters,

00:00:05.234 --> 00:00:07.236 line:10% position:50% align:center
to our update!

00:00:08.112 --> 00:00:11.240 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’d like to begin with a brief report

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.951 line:10% position:50% align:center
about some of the disasters

00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:18.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have continued to affect
our brothers recently.

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:22.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
In September, our brothers in Greece

00:00:23.544 --> 00:00:27.715 line:10% position:50% align:center
faced heavy rain and severe flooding.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:32.011 line:10% position:50% align:center
In October, our brothers in Mexico

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.848 line:10% position:50% align:center
dealt with a Category 5 hurricane,

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:38.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
which caused widespread damage.

00:00:38.642 --> 00:00:40.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in November,

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:42.813 line:10% position:50% align:center
our brothers in the Philippines

00:00:42.813 --> 00:00:47.818 line:10% position:50% align:center
experienced a magnitude 6.7 earthquake.

00:00:48.777 --> 00:00:52.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly, as a result of the earthquake,

00:00:52.865 --> 00:00:55.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of our dear sisters died

00:00:55.492 --> 00:00:59.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ten brothers and sisters were injured.

00:01:00.706 --> 00:01:04.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to pray for those affected

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the many disasters
happening around the world.

00:01:09.882 --> 00:01:12.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we thank all of you

00:01:12.593 --> 00:01:15.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
for your support and prayers.

00:01:15.763 --> 00:01:20.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of you
are working hard with disaster relief.

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:24.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many more of you
are making generous donations,

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:28.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
which allow us to provide the necessities

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:30.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our brothers and sisters

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:35.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to rebuild their homes and Kingdom Halls.

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:39.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so grateful for your help!

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:41.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body,

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
we say thank you!

00:01:46.251 --> 00:01:49.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, for the rest of our update,

00:01:49.088 --> 00:01:51.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s discuss the theme

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We Recommend Ourselves
as God’s Ministers.”

00:01:56.512 --> 00:02:00.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is based on 2 Corinthians 6:4,

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:02.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
where the apostle Paul said:

00:02:03.185 --> 00:02:07.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In every way we recommend ourselves

00:02:07.856 --> 00:02:10.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
as God’s ministers.”

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:13.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:02:13.278 --> 00:02:15.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note on this verse says:

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Greek verb rendered
‘we recommend ourselves

00:02:20.577 --> 00:02:22.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘conveys the idea

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:27.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
we prove [or] (show) ourselves to be.’”

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how do we show ourselves

00:02:31.463 --> 00:02:34.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be ministers of the true God?

00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:40.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
One important way is by our appearance.

00:02:40.764 --> 00:02:43.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all want to reflect well

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:47.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the God we love and worship.

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:49.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we do that?

00:02:49.523 --> 00:02:52.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
By following Bible principles.

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, consider the principle

00:02:55.612 --> 00:03:00.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded at 1 Timothy 2:9, 10:

00:03:02.161 --> 00:03:06.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Likewise, the women should adorn themselves

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in appropriate dress,

00:03:09.585 --> 00:03:14.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with modesty and soundness of mind,

00:03:14.882 --> 00:03:17.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not with styles of hair braiding and gold

00:03:17.718 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or pearls or very expensive clothing,

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:25.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but in the way that is proper for women

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for women professing devotion to God,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
namely, through good works.”

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although that counsel is directed

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Christian women,

00:03:39.907 --> 00:03:44.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
the principle applies equally
to men and women.

00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:48.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
So one way all of us

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:52.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
can “recommend ourselves as God’s ministers”

00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:57.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by making sure that our appearance

00:03:57.216 --> 00:04:00.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
is appropriate and modest,

00:04:00.803 --> 00:04:04.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflecting soundness of mind.

00:04:05.265 --> 00:04:08.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
But does that mean
that all of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:04:08.894 --> 00:04:10.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
make the same choices?

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:15.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Should we wear a uniform

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
or adopt a single form

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
of appropriate dress and grooming?

00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:23.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:04:23.575 --> 00:04:26.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are well over eight million

00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:28.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide,

00:04:28.872 --> 00:04:33.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have a wide range of cultures.

00:04:33.585 --> 00:04:37.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has drawn these millions of people,

00:04:37.506 --> 00:04:41.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he loves variety!

00:04:43.303 --> 00:04:45.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask:

00:04:45.305 --> 00:04:49.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the wearing of a beard?

00:04:49.685 --> 00:04:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is that an appropriate choice
for a brother to make?

00:04:54.356 --> 00:04:56.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help us answer that question,

00:04:56.692 --> 00:04:59.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s watch the following video,

00:04:59.945 --> 00:05:04.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
which reviews the history of beards

00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
among Jehovah’s people.

00:05:10.747 --> 00:05:12.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
In patriarchal times,

00:05:12.791 --> 00:05:16.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was customary for men to wear beards.

00:05:16.503 --> 00:05:20.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
This practice continued among the Israelites.

00:05:20.215 --> 00:05:22.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
An Israelite man would shave

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:24.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
only when he was humiliated or grieving.

00:05:26.513 --> 00:05:28.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, when the king of Ammon

00:05:28.724 --> 00:05:30.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
humiliated David’s servants

00:05:30.642 --> 00:05:32.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
by shaving their beards,

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
David protected their dignity

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:35.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
by telling them:

00:05:35.606 --> 00:05:38.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stay in Jericho until your beards grow back,

00:05:38.567 --> 00:05:40.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then return.”

00:05:40.736 --> 00:05:42.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Centuries later,

00:05:42.321 --> 00:05:44.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prophet Ezekiel shaved his beard

00:05:44.239 --> 00:05:46.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his head to symbolize

00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:48.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
the great distress and grief

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:51.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would soon afflict Jerusalem.

00:05:51.288 --> 00:05:52.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about Jesus?

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:56.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did he too, as an Israelite, wear a beard?

00:05:56.251 --> 00:05:57.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some years,

00:05:57.586 --> 00:05:59.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on the conclusions

00:05:59.046 --> 00:06:00.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
of certain archaeologists,

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:03.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
our publications most often portrayed Jesus

00:06:03.634 --> 00:06:05.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
as clean-shaven.

00:06:05.761 --> 00:06:09.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in 1968, <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:06:09.014 --> 00:06:11.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
considered more reliable evidence

00:06:11.475 --> 00:06:13.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
from both historical sources

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:15.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Scriptures.

00:06:15.187 --> 00:06:17.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
None of the four Gospels indicate

00:06:17.648 --> 00:06:19.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus’ appearance

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
stood out as different.

00:06:21.443 --> 00:06:23.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
He did what was customary

00:06:23.362 --> 00:06:25.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
 among Jewish men at that time:

00:06:25.656 --> 00:06:27.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wore a beard.

00:06:28.283 --> 00:06:30.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our videos and artwork

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our publications ever since

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
have consistently portrayed Jesus

00:06:34.456 --> 00:06:36.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a well-groomed beard.

00:06:38.335 --> 00:06:40.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the time the Christian congregation

00:06:40.087 --> 00:06:41.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
was established,

00:06:41.463 --> 00:06:43.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Romans had adopted

00:06:43.048 --> 00:06:44.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
the practice of shaving.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were Jewish Christians

00:06:46.426 --> 00:06:48.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
then expected to shave,

00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:49.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
or were Gentile Christians

00:06:49.888 --> 00:06:51.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
expected to grow beards

00:06:51.556 --> 00:06:52.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to blend in

00:06:52.933 --> 00:06:54.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
with their Jewish brothers?

00:06:54.393 --> 00:06:55.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently not.

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the Scriptures

00:06:57.354 --> 00:06:59.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
neither command true worshippers

00:06:59.189 --> 00:07:00.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
to grow a beard

00:07:00.732 --> 00:07:02.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor command them to shave,

00:07:02.776 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
this was a matter of personal decision.

00:07:06.655 --> 00:07:10.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

00:07:10.158 --> 00:07:11.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
beards were common

00:07:11.702 --> 00:07:13.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
even among the Bible students,

00:07:13.453 --> 00:07:16.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
as seen in these photos of pilgrim brothers

00:07:16.623 --> 00:07:18.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
who traveled for the organization.

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:22.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Russell too wore a beard.

00:07:22.087 --> 00:07:24.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
One newspaper editor called him

00:07:24.256 --> 00:07:26.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
a “well-groomed minister.”

00:07:26.717 --> 00:07:29.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “It had never occurred to me

00:07:29.052 --> 00:07:30.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he was any different

00:07:30.637 --> 00:07:32.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from thousands of other preachers . . .

00:07:32.764 --> 00:07:35.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His soft, white, flowing beard is . . .

00:07:35.058 --> 00:07:37.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the beard of a patriarch, a father.

00:07:37.853 --> 00:07:40.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives you confidence.”

00:07:40.355 --> 00:07:42.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon after World War I,

00:07:42.274 --> 00:07:45.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
shaving enjoyed a resurgence in popularity.

00:07:45.736 --> 00:07:47.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1919,

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
when this photo of the pilgrims was taken,

00:07:49.823 --> 00:07:51.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
most did not have a beard.

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, although our publications

00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:56.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
said little about the subject at the time,

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
very few brothers grew beards.

00:07:59.374 --> 00:08:01.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Starting in the 1960’s, in many lands,

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:04.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
beards became associated with those

00:08:04.463 --> 00:08:05.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
who were rebelling

00:08:05.672 --> 00:08:07.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
against established authority.

00:08:07.674 --> 00:08:09.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where that was the case, most men

00:08:09.843 --> 00:08:12.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both Witnesses and non-Witnesses—

00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
chose to shave.

00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:16.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the negative connotations

00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:18.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
associated with wearing a beard,

00:08:18.185 --> 00:08:20.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
most brothers who wore a beard

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:22.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
did not serve as ministerial servants, 

00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:25.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
elders, or in other appointed positions.

00:08:26.234 --> 00:08:28.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the passing of time, in some lands,

00:08:28.904 --> 00:08:30.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
beards became more common

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
and were not associated with rebellion.

00:08:33.283 --> 00:08:35.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
In those places, some brothers with beards

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:36.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
were appointed

00:08:36.787 --> 00:08:38.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
as ministerial servants and elders.

00:08:39.706 --> 00:08:42.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
In recent times, the wearing of a beard

00:08:42.501 --> 00:08:45.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
has become common in many more lands.

00:08:46.171 --> 00:08:48.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how should we view a brother

00:08:48.215 --> 00:08:50.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
who chooses to grow a beard today?

00:08:54.721 --> 00:08:59.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
The video ended with an intriguing question:

00:09:00.227 --> 00:09:02.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should we view a brother

00:09:02.896 --> 00:09:05.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
who chooses to grow a beard today?

00:09:07.025 --> 00:09:10.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has asked me to read 

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:12.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
the following announcement:

00:09:13.782 --> 00:09:16.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A number of branch offices around the world

00:09:16.952 --> 00:09:20.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have written to us indicating

00:09:20.247 --> 00:09:23.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that there continue to be questions

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:26.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about whether or not it is proper

00:09:26.586 --> 00:09:30.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for a brother in an appointed position
to wear a beard.

00:09:31.341 --> 00:09:34.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After prayerful consideration,

00:09:34.678 --> 00:09:36.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Governing Body has concluded

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:40.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that there is a need to clarify this matter.

00:09:42.269 --> 00:09:46.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Governing Body does not have an issue

00:09:46.064 --> 00:09:48.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“with brothers wearing beards.

00:09:48.859 --> 00:09:50.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why not?

00:09:50.652 --> 00:09:55.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because the Scriptures
do not condemn the wearing of beards.

00:09:56.616 --> 00:10:00.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore, as time has passed,

00:10:00.078 --> 00:10:03.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we have noted that in many lands,

00:10:03.373 --> 00:10:08.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is acceptable for men
who hold responsible positions

00:10:08.378 --> 00:10:12.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in business and government to wear beards.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:17.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thus, whether a brother wears a beard

00:10:17.471 --> 00:10:21.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is a personal decision.

00:10:21.141 --> 00:10:23.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A brother’s qualifications

00:10:23.185 --> 00:10:27.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to serve as an elder
or ministerial servant

00:10:27.022 --> 00:10:31.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
“are based on his spirituality,

00:10:31.485 --> 00:10:35.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not on whether he chooses to wear a beard.

00:10:35.739 --> 00:10:38.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This direction also applies

00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:42.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to special full-time servants at Bethel

00:10:42.078 --> 00:10:46.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and those in the field,
including special pioneers,

00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:49.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“missionaries, and circuit overseers.

00:10:50.754 --> 00:10:54.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In harmony with Romans 14:4,

00:10:54.633 --> 00:10:58.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
“neither the elders nor any other Christian

00:10:58.470 --> 00:11:01.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
“should feel compelled to judge a brother

00:11:01.848 --> 00:11:05.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who chooses to wear a beard.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We trust that these comments

00:11:07.938 --> 00:11:10.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will help us to remain on guard

00:11:10.857 --> 00:11:15.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“against anything that might cause division

00:11:15.278 --> 00:11:18.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
among Jehovah’s people”

00:11:18.323 --> 00:11:21.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
—end of the announcement
from the Governing Body.

00:11:23.912 --> 00:11:28.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
This direction, however,
may raise some questions.

00:11:29.918 --> 00:11:32.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, here’s one:

00:11:32.295 --> 00:11:37.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is the Governing Body
providing this direction at this time?

00:11:38.426 --> 00:11:41.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as recorded at 1 Corinthians 7:31,

00:11:41.763 --> 00:11:44.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
the apostle Paul was inspired to write:

00:11:45.433 --> 00:11:49.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The scene of this world is changing.”

00:11:50.855 --> 00:11:55.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note on that verse shows
that Paul may have been alluding 

00:11:55.318 --> 00:11:59.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the way that scenes change swiftly

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:01.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a theater,

00:12:01.992 --> 00:12:06.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
with actors passing quickly
on and off the stage.

00:12:08.498 --> 00:12:13.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
In keeping with the principle
of Paul’s inspired statement,

00:12:13.503 --> 00:12:17.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
grooming styles have changed over the years.

00:12:17.591 --> 00:12:20.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, more and more, beards

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
are worn by men in responsible positions

00:12:24.347 --> 00:12:28.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
who project a respectable appearance.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s another question:

00:12:32.564 --> 00:12:35.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
How should we view a brother

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:37.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
who decides to grow a beard?

00:12:39.029 --> 00:12:42.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we should apply Jesus’ counsel

00:12:42.407 --> 00:12:45.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
found at John 7:24:

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:50.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Stop judging by the outward appearance.”

00:12:51.291 --> 00:12:53.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we saw in the video,

00:12:53.335 --> 00:12:56.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
grooming styles have changed over time.

00:12:58.048 --> 00:13:00.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not all of such changes are bad.

00:13:01.551 --> 00:13:03.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate: None of us

00:13:03.845 --> 00:13:06.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
would likely choose
to dress and groom ourselves

00:13:06.556 --> 00:13:09.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
as people did in Bible times

00:13:09.893 --> 00:13:14.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor even as people did a century ago.

00:13:15.649 --> 00:13:19.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, most choose to follow the styles

00:13:19.569 --> 00:13:22.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are prevalent now,

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
not those from decades past.

00:13:25.992 --> 00:13:29.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Generally speaking, it’s not bad or wrong

00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:31.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
to dress and groom ourselves

00:13:31.331 --> 00:13:35.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
as people in our community commonly do

00:13:35.377 --> 00:13:39.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
as long as that style

00:13:39.297 --> 00:13:42.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not violate Bible principles.

00:13:43.677 --> 00:13:45.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
We always want to be sure

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our appearance

00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:50.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflects cleanliness,

00:13:50.767 --> 00:13:55.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
modesty, and soundness of mind.

00:13:56.064 --> 00:13:58.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s another question:

00:13:58.483 --> 00:14:01.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we promote unity

00:14:01.528 --> 00:14:03.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
in light of this direction?

00:14:05.281 --> 00:14:08.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after viewing this program,

00:14:08.201 --> 00:14:11.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
some might have to contend

00:14:11.079 --> 00:14:14.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
with strong feelings.

00:14:14.332 --> 00:14:17.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, some might feel

00:14:17.335 --> 00:14:20.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
as though they’ve been vindicated,

00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:22.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying, in effect:

00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:27.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what I’ve been saying
for a long time.

00:14:28.012 --> 00:14:33.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
This proves that I was right all along!”

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:38.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others might feel disappointed,

00:14:38.773 --> 00:14:40.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying, in effect:

00:14:40.775 --> 00:14:45.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I supported the policy
about grooming for all those years.

00:14:45.989 --> 00:14:48.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I feel let down!”

00:14:50.076 --> 00:14:52.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is either reaction appropriate?

00:14:53.663 --> 00:14:55.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not really.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:57.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what the apostle Paul

00:14:57.667 --> 00:14:59.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
was inspired to write

00:14:59.919 --> 00:15:03.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Corinthians chapter 1

00:15:03.214 --> 00:15:05.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse number 10:

00:15:06.342 --> 00:15:09.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I urge you, brothers,

00:15:09.429 --> 00:15:12.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:15:12.682 --> 00:15:17.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that you should all speak in agreement

00:15:17.312 --> 00:15:22.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and that there should be
no divisions among you,

00:15:22.233 --> 00:15:26.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but that you may be completely united

00:15:26.362 --> 00:15:30.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the same mind
and in the same line of thought.”

00:15:32.535 --> 00:15:35.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does that principle apply here?

00:15:36.414 --> 00:15:40.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we’ve been promoting

00:15:40.043 --> 00:15:45.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
our own opinion on this subject,

00:15:45.006 --> 00:15:49.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
contradicting the guidance
from the organization,

00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:51.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
have we been promoting unity?

00:15:52.514 --> 00:15:56.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have we helped the brotherhood
to be “completely united . . .

00:15:56.309 --> 00:15:58.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the same line of thought”?

00:15:59.771 --> 00:16:02.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly not.

00:16:02.232 --> 00:16:04.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any who’ve done so

00:16:04.651 --> 00:16:08.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to adjust their thinking and attitude.

00:16:09.614 --> 00:16:11.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:15.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’ve loyally supported
the organization’s direction

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the years,

00:16:17.789 --> 00:16:20.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
do we have any Scriptural reason

00:16:20.166 --> 00:16:22.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
to regret our course?

00:16:23.127 --> 00:16:25.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly not!

00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:29.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah values our loyal service;

00:16:29.467 --> 00:16:32.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
he also appreciates our humble willingness

00:16:32.846 --> 00:16:35.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be obedient and submissive

00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:40.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the direction we receive
from God’s organization.

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Back in the first century C.E.,

00:16:44.774 --> 00:16:49.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
some Christians allowed
the issue of circumcision

00:16:49.404 --> 00:16:51.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cause division.

00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:57.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the holy spirit
directed the governing body

00:16:57.620 --> 00:17:01.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
to resolve that issue and promote unity.

00:17:01.916 --> 00:17:04.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
Similarly, the Governing Body today

00:17:04.961 --> 00:17:07.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
is striving to promote unity.

00:17:08.631 --> 00:17:13.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never want the matter of beards

00:17:13.136 --> 00:17:16.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cause division among us.

00:17:17.891 --> 00:17:19.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us need to remember

00:17:19.934 --> 00:17:23.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the earthly part
of Jehovah’s organization

00:17:23.062 --> 00:17:24.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
is always striving

00:17:24.939 --> 00:17:28.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reflect the heavenly part

00:17:28.526 --> 00:17:31.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to keep up with it, as it were.

00:17:31.321 --> 00:17:33.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember how fast

00:17:33.323 --> 00:17:37.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
the chariot in Ezekiel’s vision moved?

00:17:37.535 --> 00:17:40.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like “flashes of lightning.”

00:17:41.706 --> 00:17:46.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any who seek to run ahead of that chariot,

00:17:46.377 --> 00:17:50.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to force change prematurely,

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:53.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
or who lag behind,

00:17:53.551 --> 00:17:56.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
hesitating to support changes

00:17:56.721 --> 00:17:59.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
that have come from the faithful slave,

00:17:59.474 --> 00:18:04.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not keeping pace
with Jehovah’s organization.

00:18:06.314 --> 00:18:10.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
In conclusion, are we not grateful

00:18:10.985 --> 00:18:14.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this balanced direction regarding beards?

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:18.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has dignified us.

00:18:18.242 --> 00:18:20.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
He allows each brother the freedom

00:18:20.828 --> 00:18:25.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
to choose whether or not
he will wear a beard.

00:18:26.834 --> 00:18:29.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re confident that all of you

00:18:29.837 --> 00:18:32.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
are determined to keep pace,

00:18:32.715 --> 00:18:35.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
adjust your views as needed,

00:18:35.468 --> 00:18:40.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continue to serve Jehovah loyally,

00:18:40.181 --> 00:18:43.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
promoting love and unity

00:18:43.518 --> 00:18:47.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
among your brothers and sisters.

00:18:48.398 --> 00:18:53.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:18:53.111 --> 00:18:56.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting®.
