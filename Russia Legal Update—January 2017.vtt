00:01.818 --> 00:04.220
Thank you for joining us for this update


00:04.220 --> 00:06.588
on the legal situation in Russia. 


00:06.588 --> 00:09.591
Our report will discuss
the latest developments


00:09.592 --> 00:13.000
after an important court decision
on January 16, 2017.


00:30.447 --> 00:31.882
For some time, 


00:31.882 --> 00:33.484
the Russian government has claimed


00:33.483 --> 00:36.385
that Jehovah’s Witnesses are “extremists.” 


00:36.385 --> 00:38.588
Last year, the Prosecutor General


00:38.588 --> 00:41.156
issued a warning for extremist activity


00:41.157 --> 00:44.760
against the Administrative Center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia,


00:44.760 --> 00:46.763
which is our branch office. 


00:46.763 --> 00:48.765
We appealed that warning, 


00:48.765 --> 00:52.502
as we have not been engaged
in any extremist activity. 


00:52.502 --> 00:55.172
But on January 16 of this year,


00:55.172 --> 00:58.307
the Moscow City Court
dismissed that appeal. 


00:58.307 --> 01:03.012
The three-judge panel rejected 
all arguments filed by our attorneys 


01:03.012 --> 01:05.682
and rendered its decision
after a ten-minute recess. 


01:05.682 --> 01:07.584
Now, we don’t know 


01:07.583 --> 01:10.220
what the implications 
of the decision will be. 


01:10.220 --> 01:12.455
But we do know that in the past


01:12.455 --> 01:16.625
when warnings have been issued in Russia
against some of our local entities,


01:16.625 --> 01:19.000
our property has later been seized.


01:20.530 --> 01:23.800
Despite the outcome,
the January 16 court hearing


01:23.800 --> 01:26.502
provided a great witness. 


01:26.502 --> 01:29.339
Our representatives
were given the opportunity


01:29.338 --> 01:33.141
to present evidence showing
that certain Russian officials 


01:33.142 --> 01:35.312
have been running a campaign 


01:35.312 --> 01:39.049
of painting us as 
an “extremist” organization. 


01:39.048 --> 01:42.185
Additionally, 
our brothers highlighted the peace


01:42.185 --> 01:44.753
that exists among Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


01:44.753 --> 01:48.625
We now have
Brother Sergey Cherepanov with us


01:48.625 --> 01:51.727
live from the Administrative 
Center in Russia. 


01:51.727 --> 01:54.430
Now, Sergey, 
what does this recent 


01:54.430 --> 01:57.000
court decision really mean?


01:58.502 --> 02:02.139
What the government chooses to do now,
we don’t know. 


02:02.138 --> 02:06.475
But what we do know is that our brothers
will continue worshipping Jehovah. 


02:06.475 --> 02:08.912
They will go to the meetings; 


02:08.912 --> 02:10.947
they will go in the field ministry 


02:10.947 --> 02:13.415
and keep up with their spiritual routine. 


02:13.415 --> 02:16.152
Whatever the future may bring, 


02:16.152 --> 02:20.157
we know that worshipping Jehovah
will continue in Russia. 


02:20.157 --> 02:22.859
And, of course, 
we have done everything possible,


02:22.858 --> 02:25.461
and we will continue doing so


02:25.462 --> 02:29.332
—that is, to legally defend our right 


02:29.332 --> 02:31.902
to worship Jehovah freely in Russia. 


02:31.902 --> 02:35.739
But we have to understand
that we cannot expect 


02:35.738 --> 02:39.375
perfect justice in this world of injustice.


02:39.375 --> 02:42.478
Well, considering
 the groundless accusations


02:42.478 --> 02:45.815
that are being made
against Jehovah’s people in Russia,


02:45.815 --> 02:47.817
how did the brothers and sisters react? 


02:47.817 --> 02:49.452
Are they bitter?


02:49.452 --> 02:51.487
No, not at all. 


02:51.487 --> 02:55.492
While our brothers continue to be
in subjection to the authorities,


02:55.492 --> 02:58.695
we respect the authorities
and we understand


02:58.695 --> 03:00.963
that not all of them are against us. 


03:00.963 --> 03:03.431
But just like Paul admonished


03:03.432 --> 03:07.970
in his first letter to Timothy 2:1, 2,


03:07.970 --> 03:10.240
we pray for them so that they will


03:10.240 --> 03:12.642
understand the nature of our work


03:12.642 --> 03:15.110
and we would be able to continue our 


03:15.110 --> 03:19.682
“calm and quiet life with complete
godly devotion.”


03:19.682 --> 03:22.685
That’s a wonderful attitude to have. 


03:22.685 --> 03:26.388
What is the message
that the brothers and sisters in Russia


03:26.388 --> 03:29.425
would like to convey 
to our worldwide brotherhood?


03:29.425 --> 03:33.395
Well, brothers, you don’t need to be 
overly worried about us,


03:33.395 --> 03:36.132
but please keep us in your prayers.


03:36.132 --> 03:40.270
We certainly will, Sergey, 
and please convey our love 


03:40.270 --> 03:43.072
to all the brothers and sisters 
there in Russia.


03:43.072 --> 03:46.575
We will. 
Thank you very much.


03:46.575 --> 03:49.212
Although the legal case
is currently focused


03:49.212 --> 03:51.480
on the Administrative Center in Russia, 


03:51.480 --> 03:53.783
how did we get to where we are today? 


03:53.783 --> 03:55.885
To understand the background,


03:55.885 --> 03:58.453
we need to go back to 2015


03:58.453 --> 04:02.458
when a city court ruled on allegations
against Jehovah’s Witnesses 


04:02.458 --> 04:05.000
in the city of Taganrog, Russia.


04:17.473 --> 04:19.408
On November 30, 2015, 


04:19.408 --> 04:23.880
the Taganrog City Court 
convicted 16 Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


04:23.880 --> 04:26.015
and in March of the next year, 


04:26.015 --> 04:29.000
the Rostov Regional Court 
confirmed this decision.


04:30.320 --> 04:32.388
I was hoping that the arguments 


04:32.388 --> 04:34.823
by the defense and statements of the accused


04:34.823 --> 04:36.825
would be heard by the Judicial Chamber 


04:36.825 --> 04:38.762
and we would be excused, 


04:38.762 --> 04:40.597
but neither were heard at that time.


04:40.597 --> 04:43.532
So, on what are the charges
of extremism based? 


04:43.532 --> 04:46.369
The first step taken by the authorities
was to get several publications 


04:46.368 --> 04:51.000
of Jehovah’s Witnesses added 
to the Federal List of Extremist Materials.


04:52.208 --> 04:54.610
It means that importing
these publications into the country,


04:54.610 --> 04:56.612
storing them in their places of worship, 


04:56.612 --> 04:58.915
and distributing them was prohibited. 


04:58.915 --> 05:01.683
The basic reasons to ban these publications


05:01.683 --> 05:03.720
were based on statements which alleged 


05:03.720 --> 05:07.590
that they incite religious discord 
by pointing out the superiority 


05:07.590 --> 05:10.460
of Jehovah’s Witnesses
over all other religions.


05:10.460 --> 05:13.395
Following that logic, 
the courts have pronounced as extremist 


05:13.395 --> 05:15.632
over 80 publications of Jehovah’s Witnesses 


05:15.632 --> 05:17.667
and their official website. 


05:17.667 --> 05:20.404
Not surprisingly,
many specialists in the field of human rights 


05:20.403 --> 05:23.000
consider the court decisions erroneous.


05:24.240 --> 05:27.000
If I say that my faith is the right one, 


05:28.043 --> 05:30.145
it is the only true religion, 


05:30.145 --> 05:32.182
what would that mean? 


05:32.182 --> 05:34.484
Is it advocating exclusivity? 


05:34.483 --> 05:37.153
or inferiority? or supremacy? 


05:37.153 --> 05:39.721
No, of course not!


05:39.722 --> 05:42.325
Jehovah’s Witnesses 
stopped using these publications 


05:42.325 --> 05:44.427
and removed them 
from their places of worship. 


05:44.427 --> 05:46.462
Despite this,
the authorities moved on


05:46.462 --> 05:49.000
to the second stage of their persecution.


05:50.265 --> 05:53.002
For several years, 
law enforcement officers 


05:53.002 --> 05:55.805
have repeatedly used 
the following scenario: 


05:55.805 --> 05:58.173
A third party plants banned literature 


05:58.173 --> 06:00.743
at the place of worship 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


06:00.743 --> 06:04.080
A few minutes later, 
police officers and prosecutors show up 


06:04.080 --> 06:06.948
to inspect and search the building and, 


06:06.948 --> 06:10.251
as if by chance, find planted publications. 


06:10.252 --> 06:12.922
And all this is done just to accuse believers 


06:12.922 --> 06:15.859
of extremism and to ban their activity.


06:15.858 --> 06:17.860
As a result of such literature plantings, 


06:17.860 --> 06:21.630
the authorities have succeeded 
in liquidating seven local entities 


06:21.630 --> 06:24.267
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 
in different cities of Russia. 


06:24.267 --> 06:26.802
This was the third step 
of the persecution.


06:26.802 --> 06:28.939
It is important to understand 


06:28.938 --> 06:32.508
that a Local Religious Organization
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, or LRO, 


06:32.508 --> 06:35.478
is not the same thing as a congregation 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


06:35.478 --> 06:39.281
An LRO includes 10-15 believers
and has certain rights, 


06:39.282 --> 06:41.850
such as to own and maintain 
a religious building. 


06:41.850 --> 06:44.087
The actual activities 
relating to their worship 


06:44.087 --> 06:47.924
is carried out by the believers, 
independently of the LRO.


06:47.923 --> 06:50.860
And at last the authorities 
moved on to their main goal. 


06:50.860 --> 06:54.063
With reference to the fact 
that local entities had been banned, 


06:54.063 --> 06:56.731
the prosecutor’s office 
now expressed its readiness 


06:56.732 --> 06:59.669
to ban the headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia. 


06:59.668 --> 07:02.538
Prior to this, 
the prosecutor’s office had already 


07:02.538 --> 07:04.440
initiated several inspections. 


07:04.440 --> 07:07.977
Then, in 2013, 
a team of approximately 60 officials 


07:07.977 --> 07:10.547
turned up at the Administrative Center 
to inspect it. 


07:10.547 --> 07:12.349
However, despite all their efforts, 


07:12.348 --> 07:14.350
nothing unlawful was found. 


07:14.350 --> 07:17.220
Such events remind 
many human rights advocates 


07:17.220 --> 07:20.000
of the days of religious repression 
in the past.


07:22.258 --> 07:24.226
I’ve known about Jehovah’s Witnesses 


07:24.227 --> 07:26.229
for many years. 


07:26.228 --> 07:28.430
During Soviet times, 


07:28.430 --> 07:31.733
they were persecuted for their faith 


07:31.733 --> 07:35.103
and received long sentences 


07:35.103 --> 07:38.006
in prison camps. 


07:38.007 --> 07:41.000
They would go to prison for their faith. 


07:42.312 --> 07:46.849
Such sincere feelings call for respect. 


07:46.848 --> 07:51.000
Heartfelt faith excludes extremism.


07:52.955 --> 07:55.123
Although Jehovah’s Witnesses in Russia 


07:55.123 --> 07:57.125
are going through certain difficulties, 


07:57.125 --> 07:58.928
today our brothers and sisters 


07:58.928 --> 08:02.398
continue to serve Jehovah 
with great joy and zeal. 


08:02.398 --> 08:04.700
We are also receiving words of support 


08:04.700 --> 08:07.000
from our brothers and sisters 
all around the world.


08:10.305 --> 08:12.675
During this difficult time of persecution, 


08:12.675 --> 08:16.000
I have received a lot of help 
from our brothers and sisters. 


08:17.680 --> 08:20.482
Recently, one brother from New Zealand 


08:20.482 --> 08:24.920
wrote that his 6-year-old son
is praying for me every night. 


08:24.920 --> 08:27.000
It was a great encouragement.


08:28.523 --> 08:30.893
And, of course, we remember one family 


08:30.893 --> 08:33.061
who sent us greetings from France


08:33.062 --> 08:36.265
—nine people, 
seven of them were children. 


08:36.265 --> 08:38.000
That’s something!


08:39.068 --> 08:42.771
My relationship with Jehovah 
is only getting stronger through all of this. 


08:42.772 --> 08:44.774
During any trial, 


08:44.773 --> 08:48.210
I try to get to know him better
—understand him—


08:48.210 --> 08:51.000
and it strengthens our relationship.


08:58.420 --> 09:01.390
Brothers, endure difficulties, 
stand firm in the faith, 


09:01.390 --> 09:04.000
and blessings from Jehovah will come!


09:05.160 --> 09:08.998
Our brothers in Russia have gone 
through a lot in the past few years. 


09:08.998 --> 09:11.833
King Hezekiah experienced 
something similar,


09:11.833 --> 09:15.771
as you may remember from last year’s
regional convention drama. 


09:15.772 --> 09:19.775
Jehovah said at Isaiah 30:15: 


09:19.775 --> 09:23.612
“Your strength will be in keeping calm 


09:23.612 --> 09:25.749
and showing trust.” 


09:25.748 --> 09:28.183
Now, Hezekiah trusted in Jehovah, 


09:28.183 --> 09:30.986
and Jehovah proved to be with him.


09:30.987 --> 09:34.157
But how can we remain calm 


09:34.157 --> 09:37.260
when negative things take place 
around us? 


09:37.260 --> 09:40.495
Well, first, we trust that Jehovah 


09:40.495 --> 09:43.065
will care for us 
no matter what happens. 


09:43.065 --> 09:47.068
We know that he’s pleased 
by our faith and courage. 


09:47.068 --> 09:51.006
Second, 
we know that all that we are asking for 


09:51.007 --> 09:54.544
is to be able to worship Jehovah 
in love and peace. 


09:54.543 --> 09:57.380
Our neutral, peace-loving stand 


09:57.380 --> 09:59.848
is known around the world. 


09:59.848 --> 10:04.000
And third, 
our worldwide brotherhood stands with us.


10:05.387 --> 10:07.390
Brothers and sisters in Russia, 


10:07.390 --> 10:10.392
your trust in Jehovah is a great example 


10:10.392 --> 10:12.429
for all of us to imitate. 


10:12.428 --> 10:15.430
Please know that we are praying 
in your behalf 


10:15.430 --> 10:17.867
because we love you very much. 


10:17.867 --> 10:21.104
There’s no doubt that Jehovah 
is on your side, 


10:21.103 --> 10:25.708
and he will continue to guide 
and protect you.


10:25.708 --> 10:27.710
This is JW Broadcasting 


10:27.710 --> 11:14.842
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
