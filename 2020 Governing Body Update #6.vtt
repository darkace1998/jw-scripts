These are challenging times, aren’t they?

00:00:05.221 --> 00:00:06.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Think of the challenges

00:00:06.923 --> 00:00:09.292 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
this pandemic has created.

00:00:09.292 --> 00:00:11.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has closed down businesses,

00:00:11.294 --> 00:00:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
delayed school openings,

00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:15.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
postponed sporting events, and more,

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it has not stopped
the flow of spiritual food.

00:00:20.003 --> 00:00:22.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus knew long ago that his followers

00:00:22.806 --> 00:00:25.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would find themselves in the time of the end,

00:00:25.141 --> 00:00:28.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
facing the most distressing period
in human history.

00:00:28.645 --> 00:00:30.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he assured them

00:00:30.647 --> 00:00:32.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that through a faithful slave

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:35.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would receive “food at the proper time,”

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:37.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would give them hope

00:00:37.187 --> 00:00:40.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and strengthen them to endure.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
True, we’ve had to adjust

00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how we prepare and serve this spiritual food.

00:00:45.328 --> 00:00:47.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, we’ve continued to receive

00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:50.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Watchtower</i>  and <i>Awake!</i>  magazines,

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
meeting workbooks,
new original songs and videos,

00:00:53.536 --> 00:00:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an entire convention program,

00:00:55.872 --> 00:00:58.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even the release
of the <i>New World Translation </i>

00:00:58.708 --> 00:01:00.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in more languages.

00:01:01.444 --> 00:01:05.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is exactly
what Jehovah promised he would provide,

00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:09.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as stated at Isaiah 65:13:

00:01:10.487 --> 00:01:14.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Therefore this is
what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:

00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:18.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! My servants will eat,

00:01:18.194 --> 00:01:20.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but you will go hungry.

00:01:20.196 --> 00:01:23.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! My servants will drink,

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:25.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘but you will go thirsty.

00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:28.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Look! My servants will rejoice,

00:01:28.872 --> 00:01:31.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but you will suffer shame.’”

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those words aren’t just a reassurance;

00:01:35.545 --> 00:01:37.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’re a promise.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Despite all the chaos in the world around us,

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:44.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we will have the spiritual food
that we need to stay strong.

00:01:44.921 --> 00:01:47.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you might wonder:

00:01:47.157 --> 00:01:50.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘What adjustments
has the Governing Body made

00:01:50.126 --> 00:01:54.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘to provide spiritual food
at the proper time despite the pandemic?

00:01:55.832 --> 00:01:59.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How have we seen
Jehovah’s blessing on these adjustments?

00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:02.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘And on a personal level,

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:04.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘what can each one of us do

00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show our appreciation
for these provisions?’

00:02:09.445 --> 00:02:12.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Restrictions and lockdowns
haven’t stopped the work

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:16.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of writing and publishing
spiritually upbuilding food.

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:21.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One example of this is the recent update
to the study edition

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:24.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>New World Translation </i>
<i>of the Holy Scriptures.</i>

00:02:25.028 --> 00:02:28.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Galatians and Ephesians
are now available in English,

00:02:28.531 --> 00:02:31.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with over 340 new study notes,

00:02:31.734 --> 00:02:34.704 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a video, media gallery items,

00:02:34.704 --> 00:02:36.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and new articles in the Appendix.

00:02:37.941 --> 00:02:41.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how about the jw.org® website?

00:02:41.778 --> 00:02:45.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The brothers have been
hard at work there too.

00:02:45.148 --> 00:02:47.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Articles such as

00:02:47.617 --> 00:02:50.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“What Does the Bible Say About Pandemics?”

00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:54.257 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and “How to Deal With Isolation”
have been added.

00:02:55.425 --> 00:02:58.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Other articles about distance learning,

00:02:58.127 --> 00:03:02.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
domestic abuse, and alcohol consumption
have also been added

00:03:02.732 --> 00:03:06.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the very issues
that are on many people’s minds right now.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:13.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has the pandemic affected the production
of our various video projects?

00:03:13.543 --> 00:03:15.778 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can imagine,

00:03:15.778 --> 00:03:18.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Bethel facilities on lockdown

00:03:18.181 --> 00:03:21.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with physical distancing
measures in place,

00:03:21.451 --> 00:03:25.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve had to rethink
how videos can be safely produced.

00:03:25.822 --> 00:03:28.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the following video report,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:32.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Bob Batko, a member
of the Central America Branch Committee,

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:36.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explains adjustments
the regional video team has made.

00:03:38.501 --> 00:03:40.503 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
To keep the cameras rolling,

00:03:40.503 --> 00:03:41.671 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the regional video team

00:03:41.671 --> 00:03:42.839 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
hosted here at the branch

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:45.975 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
had to overcome some pretty big challenges.

00:03:45.975 --> 00:03:48.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of them was casting.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:52.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We couldn’t invite local brothers and sisters
to come in to play roles,

00:03:52.682 --> 00:03:57.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor could the Bethel team
go out to shoot on location.

00:03:57.553 --> 00:04:00.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did it require?

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Adapting to the local circumstances.

00:04:03.693 --> 00:04:07.063 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That meant shooting on Bethel property

00:04:07.063 --> 00:04:09.899 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with Bethel personnel.

00:04:09.899 --> 00:04:12.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that may seem limiting,

00:04:12.535 --> 00:04:16.572 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they found a solution—the green screen.

00:04:16.572 --> 00:04:19.709 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That meant that they could shoot in studio

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the actor could virtually be anywhere.

00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:30.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When working on a set here,
rigorous safety precautions need to be taken.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Cast and crew members
get their temperature checked

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:35.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the beginning and the end of each day.

00:04:35.458 --> 00:04:37.060 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everyone (everyone)

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wears face masks, including the actors

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:42.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—unless they’re being filmed.

00:04:42.332 --> 00:04:45.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The actors maintain physical distancing

00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when with anyone
other than their mate or roommate.

00:04:48.972 --> 00:04:52.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To minimize contact
with the hair and makeup team,

00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:55.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they’ve taken advantage of videoconferencing.

00:04:55.278 --> 00:04:58.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they would teach the wives
how to put beards

00:04:58.414 --> 00:05:01.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on their husbands in their Bethel rooms.

00:05:01.117 --> 00:05:04.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way, only touch-ups
need to be done on set,

00:05:04.487 --> 00:05:08.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even then,
personal protective equipment is used.

00:05:08.324 --> 00:05:12.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And everything is disinfected
before and after each session.

00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:18.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In doing all of this,
there was a wonderful spirit of unity.

00:05:18.334 --> 00:05:22.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the lockdown,
no commuters have been able to come in;

00:05:23.673 --> 00:05:27.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so, many from other Bethel departments
have been made available

00:05:27.176 --> 00:05:29.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help with the work.

00:05:29.078 --> 00:05:30.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some are helping on the production team,

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others by sewing wardrobes and building sets.

00:05:35.284 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And nobody went hungry.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All the meals were provided.

00:05:41.324 --> 00:05:44.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In all of this, it’s obvious
that Jehovah blessed

00:05:44.027 --> 00:05:48.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not just these arrangements
but also the Governing Body

00:05:48.164 --> 00:05:51.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that they could provide
the much needed spiritual food

00:05:51.968 --> 00:05:54.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on time.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you can see,

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:02.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ve had to adjust
many aspects of video production,

00:06:02.678 --> 00:06:06.315 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re grateful
for the hard work of all involved.

00:06:06.315 --> 00:06:09.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In fact, all of our video teams,

00:06:09.485 --> 00:06:11.921 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the ones at world headquarters,

00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:15.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are taking similar steps
to keep production going

00:06:15.591 --> 00:06:17.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while remaining safe.

00:06:18.294 --> 00:06:20.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But do you see the point?

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:24.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The menu of spiritual food
prepared well before the pandemic

00:06:24.834 --> 00:06:28.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be presented just as planned.

00:06:28.204 --> 00:06:30.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You might say that we’ve had to adjust some

00:06:30.873 --> 00:06:34.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the “kitchen utensils”
and “cooking methods,”

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:39.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the meal itself
is unchanged and just as nourishing.

00:06:39.215 --> 00:06:41.250 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you won’t miss a thing!

00:06:42.485 --> 00:06:46.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another vital part of the process
in providing spiritual food

00:06:46.456 --> 00:06:50.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to Jehovah’s people worldwide is translation.

00:06:50.526 --> 00:06:53.096 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that hasn’t stopped either.

00:06:53.096 --> 00:06:56.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Translation teams
have been able to continue their work

00:06:56.766 --> 00:06:58.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by videoconference,

00:06:58.801 --> 00:07:01.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the results have been thrilling.

00:07:01.904 --> 00:07:06.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, since the start of the pandemic,

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:09.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>New World Translation</i>  has been released

00:07:09.212 --> 00:07:14.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in whole or in part in 19 languages.

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:17.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of these releases had been planned

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:20.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in conjunction with regional conventions

00:07:20.156 --> 00:07:22.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were to be held later this year.

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:25.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when the decision was made

00:07:25.261 --> 00:07:29.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to present
a global convention program by video,

00:07:29.332 --> 00:07:34.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Teaching Committee asked
if these newly translated Bibles

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:38.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could be released
before the convention began in July.

00:07:38.641 --> 00:07:42.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That way, translators
could use the new Bibles

00:07:42.645 --> 00:07:45.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when translating the convention program,

00:07:45.414 --> 00:07:49.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and publishers could follow along
with all six sessions

00:07:49.619 --> 00:07:52.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
using their newly released Bibles.

00:07:53.556 --> 00:07:56.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, through a tremendous effort

00:07:56.659 --> 00:07:59.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with Jehovah’s blessing,

00:07:59.428 --> 00:08:02.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
13 Bibles were released in digital format

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:05.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at special meetings

00:08:05.034 --> 00:08:07.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the weeks leading up to the convention.

00:08:07.837 --> 00:08:10.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can imagine how thrilled the brothers were

00:08:10.706 --> 00:08:14.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to receive these Bibles
in their local languages

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:16.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just in time for the convention.

00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:23.152 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of those new translations
was in the Oromo language.

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:27.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this video report,
Brother Delroy Williamson,

00:08:27.557 --> 00:08:30.159 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a member of the Ethiopia Branch Committee,

00:08:30.159 --> 00:08:32.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
describes the challenges that they faced

00:08:32.962 --> 00:08:36.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how they overcame them
with Jehovah’s help.

00:08:37.967 --> 00:08:39.969 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were very excited to learn

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:42.605 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that despite the COVID-19 pandemic,

00:08:42.605 --> 00:08:44.674 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the complete <i>New World Translation </i>

00:08:44.674 --> 00:08:46.676 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would be released digitally

00:08:46.676 --> 00:08:48.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Oromo language.

00:08:48.678 --> 00:08:50.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all congregations in Ethiopia

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:53.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were invited to attend a special meeting,

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:57.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which would be streamed countrywide
over the Internet.

00:08:57.019 --> 00:09:00.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But just five days before the release date,

00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:02.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
civil unrest broke out in the country,

00:09:02.658 --> 00:09:07.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and because of this,
the government shut down the Internet.

00:09:07.396 --> 00:09:10.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Suddenly, there was no way
to access the program online.

00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:15.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is where we really saw
Jehovah’s hand in matters.

00:09:15.771 --> 00:09:17.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the program was being planned,

00:09:17.773 --> 00:09:19.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Branch Committee received approval

00:09:19.976 --> 00:09:22.345 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prerecord the released talks

00:09:22.345 --> 00:09:25.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to broadcast the program via satellite.

00:09:25.781 --> 00:09:27.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This would enable the meeting

00:09:27.783 --> 00:09:30.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reach the most distant parts
of our branch territory.

00:09:31.954 --> 00:09:36.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that satellite broadcast
became the main way

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:40.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for over 12,000 of our brothers
to view the special meeting.

00:09:40.363 --> 00:09:43.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in the areas of the country
not covered by the satellite,

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:46.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers listened
to the program by telephone.

00:09:46.936 --> 00:09:51.240 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just two days after the program,
Internet access was restored

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the brothers with an Internet connection
downloaded the Bible

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then transferred the file
to those without Internet access.

00:09:58.948 --> 00:10:01.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was really faith-strengthening to see

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:05.888 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
how despite a pandemic, despite unrest,

00:10:05.888 --> 00:10:09.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
despite the country being
in a state of emergency,

00:10:09.125 --> 00:10:12.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our spiritual food supply continued to flow.

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:19.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing
for our Oromo-speaking brothers and sisters!

00:10:19.235 --> 00:10:22.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Besides new Bibles, our translation teams

00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:25.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have also been busy with other projects.

00:10:25.841 --> 00:10:30.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,
the 2020 Governing Body Update Reports,

00:10:30.413 --> 00:10:33.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as the one you’re watching right now,

00:10:33.015 --> 00:10:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been a landmark
in simultaneous communication.

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second report was uploaded

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in about 400 languages simultaneously.

00:10:43.559 --> 00:10:47.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the largest simultaneous
multilanguage video release

00:10:47.763 --> 00:10:49.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in our history.

00:10:49.932 --> 00:10:53.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this turned out to be a dry run

00:10:53.436 --> 00:10:55.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an even bigger task:

00:10:55.805 --> 00:10:58.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The first day

00:10:58.207 --> 00:11:01.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 2020 “Always Rejoice”! Convention

00:11:01.143 --> 00:11:05.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was also uploaded in about 400 languages

00:11:05.047 --> 00:11:08.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
within 24 hours of English.

00:11:09.485 --> 00:11:12.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Preparing translations for every talk

00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:16.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was a massive effort
on a very tight schedule.

00:11:17.259 --> 00:11:21.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many local brothers
used their own resources to assist

00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:25.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and worked tirelessly
to provide quality translations.

00:11:25.501 --> 00:11:27.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In many cases,

00:11:27.503 --> 00:11:31.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the dubbing of the talks
was so well synced

00:11:31.073 --> 00:11:33.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some brothers actually thought

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:36.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the talks were being delivered
in their language.

00:11:36.712 --> 00:11:39.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s just one example from Kenya

00:11:39.749 --> 00:11:41.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Kikamba language.

00:12:02.004 --> 00:12:06.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, don’t be fooled:
Brother Schafer hasn’t mastered Kikamba.

00:12:07.743 --> 00:12:11.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But thanks to the skills
of our translation team,

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.117 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the results were convincing enough
for some to say,

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:18.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It’s so wonderful that these brothers
learned our language!”

00:12:19.655 --> 00:12:23.626 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, regarding all this work
being done in writing,

00:12:23.626 --> 00:12:26.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
video production, translation, and more,

00:12:26.662 --> 00:12:28.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we might ask,

00:12:28.664 --> 00:12:33.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘How has all this been possible,
especially now?’

00:12:33.569 --> 00:12:35.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the answer

00:12:35.938 --> 00:12:40.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Zechariah 4:6:

00:12:40.976 --> 00:12:45.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Not by a military force, nor by power,

00:12:45.347 --> 00:12:49.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but by my spirit,’ says Jehovah of armies.”

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:55.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
None of this would be possible
without Jehovah’s holy spirit.

00:12:56.959 --> 00:12:59.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can we all show appreciation

00:12:59.395 --> 00:13:04.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the way we’re being spiritually fed
during this difficult time?

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:06.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Consider three ways.

00:13:06.869 --> 00:13:10.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First and foremost, take full advantage

00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:13.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this spiritual banquet
that Jehovah is providing.

00:13:13.843 --> 00:13:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read the Bible every day;

00:13:16.378 --> 00:13:18.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to the extent that you can,

00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:21.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
read each new magazine and publication

00:13:21.851 --> 00:13:25.054 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and watch each new video available
in your language.

00:13:26.422 --> 00:13:31.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not long ago,
receiving our spiritual food digitally

00:13:31.093 --> 00:13:33.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would’ve been hard to even imagine,

00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:38.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and yet now we probably wonder
how we’d be coping with this pandemic

00:13:38.834 --> 00:13:42.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without tools like <i>JW Library</i>®.

00:13:42.037 --> 00:13:45.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has been preparing us over the years

00:13:45.441 --> 00:13:48.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be ready for something like this.

00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:52.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even the older ones in our congregation
have gotten more comfortable

00:13:52.615 --> 00:13:55.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their electronic devices.

00:13:55.618 --> 00:14:00.623 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even though some of our brothers
have very limited access to this technology,

00:14:00.623 --> 00:14:03.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just think about how much these tools

00:14:03.692 --> 00:14:06.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are helping us as an organization

00:14:06.028 --> 00:14:09.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study, share, and distribute God’s Word

00:14:09.598 --> 00:14:11.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the face of this crisis.

00:14:13.002 --> 00:14:15.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keeping ourselves well-fed spiritually

00:14:15.804 --> 00:14:18.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will help us to focus our minds

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:20.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on what Paul described

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at Philippians 4:8:

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:28.884 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Whatever things are of serious concern,

00:14:28.884 --> 00:14:31.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are righteous,

00:14:31.487 --> 00:14:33.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are chaste,

00:14:33.822 --> 00:14:36.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are lovable,

00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:38.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are well-spoken-of,

00:14:38.894 --> 00:14:41.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whatever things are virtuous,

00:14:41.397 --> 00:14:44.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and whatever things are praiseworthy,

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:48.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
continue considering these things.”

00:14:49.672 --> 00:14:53.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Second, we can show our appreciation

00:14:53.309 --> 00:14:57.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by praying for those working hard
to support the Kingdom work

00:14:57.212 --> 00:15:00.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at world headquarters and in the branches

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:04.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and remote translation offices
around the world.

00:15:04.086 --> 00:15:09.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many Bethel families
have been on lockdown for over five months.

00:15:09.091 --> 00:15:14.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our Bethel family members
have willingly obeyed the direction given

00:15:14.029 --> 00:15:19.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to protect the Kingdom work
and the flow of spiritual food.

00:15:19.034 --> 00:15:21.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re very proud of them

00:15:21.503 --> 00:15:24.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and truly appreciate their cooperation

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as that of their families
and congregations.

00:15:29.211 --> 00:15:33.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Third, we can be generous
with our spiritual food.

00:15:33.716 --> 00:15:35.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Have a full share

00:15:35.050 --> 00:15:38.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in preaching and teaching
despite the limitations

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re facing right now.

00:15:41.991 --> 00:15:46.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Also, if you find a verse you love
in your Bible reading

00:15:46.362 --> 00:15:50.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a point that stands out
in an article or video,

with your brothers and sisters.

One aspect
of our spiritual food is our songs.

While you may have missed singing together

00:16:05.648 --> 00:16:08.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at your meetings or the convention,

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:10.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers and sisters

00:16:10.085 --> 00:16:14.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are still finding ways
to sing together—virtually.

00:16:14.923 --> 00:16:19.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The following video clip
of the song “Our Joy Eternally”

00:16:19.762 --> 00:16:22.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was made by brothers and sisters

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:24.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving as remote volunteers in France

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while they were under lockdown.

00:16:27.069 --> 00:16:31.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Each person recorded
his or her part individually,

00:16:31.106 --> 00:16:33.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then they were edited together

00:16:33.876 --> 00:16:37.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to create one virtual chorus.

00:17:52.888 --> 00:17:55.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure you’d agree that

00:17:55.224 --> 00:17:58.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was a very refreshing way
to end our program.

00:17:58.961 --> 00:18:02.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our love for Jehovah
and our determination

00:18:02.564 --> 00:18:06.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to live by his standards
are being tested each day.

00:18:06.602 --> 00:18:10.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And yet, because we’re being
well-fed spiritually,

00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:14.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have everything we need
to meet those tests with joy.

00:18:15.577 --> 00:18:18.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dear brothers and sisters,

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:21.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please be assured of the warm love
