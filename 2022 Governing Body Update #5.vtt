00:00:01.451 --> 00:00:03.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,

00:00:03.286 --> 00:00:05.755 line:10% position:50% align:center
welcome to our update!

00:00:05.755 --> 00:00:07.757 line:10% position:50% align:center
Since our last report,

00:00:07.757 --> 00:00:10.660 line:10% position:50% align:center
there have been some exciting developments.

00:00:11.327 --> 00:00:14.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
On May 31, 2022,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body
informed all Branch Committees

00:00:17.467 --> 00:00:20.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we would now resume all forms

00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:23.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our public ministry
except house-to-house work.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Around the world,
our brothers and sisters were thrilled

00:00:27.944 --> 00:00:30.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
to resume public witnessing.

00:00:30.714 --> 00:00:33.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
After resuming in-person preaching,

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:37.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
one sister said:
“It was like we were resurrected.

00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:40.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We were gone,
and then we were back.

00:00:40.924 --> 00:00:42.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was unifying.”

00:00:44.094 --> 00:00:48.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
And a brother said:
“It was like riding a bicycle.

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:52.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
It all came back quickly,
and we had a great time.”

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
A member of the Branch Committee
in the United States

00:00:57.207 --> 00:01:00.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
was working with a small group
making return visits

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:04.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they hadn’t made in person
since before the pandemic.

00:01:04.981 --> 00:01:09.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “I was worried
that people would be standoffish

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:12.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or that they’d be worried about the virus.

00:01:12.655 --> 00:01:15.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that just wasn’t the case at all!”

00:01:16.693 --> 00:01:20.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
After having a good discussion
with his return visit,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
the brother said, “It was so refreshing

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
to actually witness to someone
in person at the door.”

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently, I had a similar experience
when sharing in street work.

00:01:34.377 --> 00:01:39.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
A young woman noticed that the brother
with me had <i>Watchtower</i> magazines,

00:01:39.415 --> 00:01:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she stopped us.

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:46.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said that she was so happy
to see Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:48.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
That led to a good discussion,

00:01:48.358 --> 00:01:52.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
and arrangements were made
for a sister to contact her.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was such a pleasure
to be in street work again!

00:01:59.803 --> 00:02:03.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Zambia,
a public bus driver stopped the bus

00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:06.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he saw our brothers street witnessing,

00:02:06.142 --> 00:02:09.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he received a magazine from the brothers.

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:13.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
He asked them to preach to his passengers.

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:19.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of the passengers on the bus
gladly listened and took magazines.

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:24.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
The weekend of June 25, 2022,

00:02:24.127 --> 00:02:29.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a milestone for our translation efforts.

00:02:29.132 --> 00:02:31.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thirteen language editions

00:02:31.234 --> 00:02:33.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i>

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
were released in one weekend!

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of the releases
were of individual Bible books,

00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:45.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
others were the complete edition
of the Greek Scriptures,

00:02:45.548 --> 00:02:48.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some were of the complete Bible.

00:02:49.152 --> 00:02:52.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Previously, the largest number of Bibles

00:02:52.288 --> 00:02:55.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
released in a single weekend was six.

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:59.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank Jehovah for these precious gifts!

00:03:01.531 --> 00:03:04.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
On June 7, 2022,

00:03:04.868 --> 00:03:07.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
the European Court of Human Rights

00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:12.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
ruled in favor
of Jehovah’s Witnesses in 21 cases

00:03:12.075 --> 00:03:14.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all in one day!

00:03:15.578 --> 00:03:20.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our previous record
for court victories awarded in one day

00:03:20.383 --> 00:03:24.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
was on May 3, 1943,

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:28.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we won 12 cases
in the United States Supreme Court.

00:03:28.892 --> 00:03:33.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
We praise Jehovah for these fine victories.

00:03:34.898 --> 00:03:38.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty of the twenty-one cases this month

00:03:38.334 --> 00:03:41.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
form a historic judgment

00:03:41.905 --> 00:03:46.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
against Russia
for persecuting Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:03:46.242 --> 00:03:48.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did the court decide?

00:03:48.444 --> 00:03:50.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following video,

00:03:50.446 --> 00:03:53.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers working
with the World Headquarters Legal Department

00:03:53.917 --> 00:03:55.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
answer these questions.

00:03:57.353 --> 00:04:01.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, this decision is truly historic!

00:04:01.624 --> 00:04:06.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the court consolidated
20 of our cases into one decision

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:10.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ruled conclusively
in our favor in all of them.

00:04:11.501 --> 00:04:15.471 line:10% position:50% align:center
Throughout the 196-page decision,

00:04:15.471 --> 00:04:18.975 line:10% position:50% align:center
the court meticulously dismantles the lies

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:23.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Russia has used to persecute
our brothers and ban our worship.

00:04:25.114 --> 00:04:30.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shane, in what way specifically
did the court condemn Russia?

00:04:30.119 --> 00:04:31.387 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, the decision

00:04:31.387 --> 00:04:34.190 line:10% position:50% align:center
unambiguously declares that Russia

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.293 line:10% position:50% align:center
is guilty of carrying out a premeditated

00:04:37.293 --> 00:04:42.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
and relentless attack
on innocent worshippers and on pure worship.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:46.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,
in paragraph 254 of the decision,

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:50.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
the European Court states
that the Russian authorities had pursued

00:04:50.473 --> 00:04:53.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
“a policy of intolerance . . .

00:04:53.276 --> 00:04:57.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“designed to cause
Jehovah’s Witnesses to abandon their faith

00:04:57.046 --> 00:04:59.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to prevent others from joining it.”

00:04:59.315 --> 00:05:03.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course,
that policy was entirely unsuccessful.

00:05:03.086 --> 00:05:05.021 line:10% position:50% align:center
In fact, this judgment

00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:08.191 line:10% position:50% align:center
completely exonerates Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
For example, Russia claimed

00:05:10.393 --> 00:05:12.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our publications and website

00:05:12.195 --> 00:05:16.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
are extremist simply because we believe
that we have the truth.

00:05:16.432 --> 00:05:19.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
In response, the European Court ruled

00:05:19.302 --> 00:05:23.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “any religious entity
or individual believers

00:05:23.272 --> 00:05:26.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have the right to proclaim
and defend their doctrine

00:05:26.275 --> 00:05:28.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the true and superior one.”

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:32.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shane, what else
did the court say in our favor?

00:05:32.715 --> 00:05:36.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
The European Court
confirms our right to engage

00:05:36.352 --> 00:05:38.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our door-to-door preaching,

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:42.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
for parents to teach their children
to worship Jehovah,

00:05:42.158 --> 00:05:44.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
to own and use our places of worship,

00:05:44.961 --> 00:05:47.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
to refuse military service,

00:05:47.363 --> 00:05:51.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
to refuse blood transfusions
and choose effective alternatives,

00:05:51.467 --> 00:05:54.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to be politically neutral.

00:05:54.003 --> 00:05:55.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
In all of these areas,

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:59.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
the European Court concludes
that our religious beliefs and activities

00:05:59.175 --> 00:06:02.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
are entirely peaceful and are protected

00:06:02.512 --> 00:06:04.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the right to freedom of religion.

00:06:04.847 --> 00:06:06.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among other things,

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:11.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
the decision orders Russia
to stop persecuting Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
restore our legal status,
release those who are in prison,

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
allow us to use our literature and website,

00:06:18.961 --> 00:06:22.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and either return
the properties that were confiscated

00:06:22.532 --> 00:06:26.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
or pay us the equivalent
of over 65 million dollars (U.S.).

00:06:26.502 --> 00:06:28.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Outstanding!

00:06:28.604 --> 00:06:30.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are just so grateful

00:06:30.673 --> 00:06:34.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the many brothers and sisters
who worked tirelessly

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:38.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring these cases
before the European Court of Human Rights.

00:06:38.848 --> 00:06:42.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time will tell whether Russia
will comply with this decision.

00:06:42.985 --> 00:06:45.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even if it does not,

00:06:45.354 --> 00:06:49.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
this decision is legally binding
on the 46 countries

00:06:49.826 --> 00:06:53.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have submitted
to the jurisdiction of the European Court.

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:58.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, the rights of over
one and a half million Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:06:58.367 --> 00:07:02.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
who live in these lands
are better protected than ever.

00:07:02.905 --> 00:07:04.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
But even more,

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
because the European Court
is held in such high regard,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:12.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
this decision will have great weight
before high courts worldwide.

00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:15.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank Jehovah

00:07:15.818 --> 00:07:19.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
for this historic victory
—this resounding victory—

00:07:19.455 --> 00:07:21.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the European Court!

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:27.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re confident that, regardless
of what the secular authorities do,

00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:32.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is going to continue
to be with our brothers.

00:07:32.235 --> 00:07:34.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we know that?

00:07:34.237 --> 00:07:38.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of what is stated at Isaiah 54:17.

00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we read:

00:07:40.476 --> 00:07:44.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘No weapon formed against you
will have any success,

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and you will condemn any tongue

00:07:47.083 --> 00:07:50.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘that rises up against you in the judgment.

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:53.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This is the heritage
of the servants of Jehovah,

00:07:53.756 --> 00:07:57.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their righteousness is from me,’
declares Jehovah.”

00:07:58.194 --> 00:08:02.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our “heritage” from Jehovah assures us

00:08:02.064 --> 00:08:06.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his constant support now and forever.

00:08:06.002 --> 00:08:07.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that assurance,

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
no opposition will weaken our faith

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
or deprive us
of the peace and spiritual prosperity

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:16.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
we enjoy as God’s servants.

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:21.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is clearly seen when we consider 
how Jehovah helped our brothers

00:08:21.918 --> 00:08:25.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
during the persecution
in the former Soviet Union.

00:08:26.889 --> 00:08:28.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the rest of this update,

00:08:28.891 --> 00:08:31.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to consider some examples

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:35.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
of how Jehovah
looked after his people during that time.

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:40.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know this will be so encouraging
not only for our brothers in Russia

00:08:40.836 --> 00:08:42.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also for all of us,

00:08:42.972 --> 00:08:47.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
since we are all facing opposition
in one way or another.

00:08:48.377 --> 00:08:50.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we watch the following interviews,

00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:53.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
ask yourself: ‘If this happened to me,

00:08:53.883 --> 00:08:56.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘what would I do?

00:08:56.352 --> 00:08:58.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What helped these brothers and sisters

00:08:58.688 --> 00:09:01.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain loyal to Jehovah?’

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:06.229 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was baptized at the age of 15.

00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:07.430 line:10% position:50% align:center
A few weeks later,

00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:09.532 line:10% position:50% align:center
the school administration discovered

00:09:09.532 --> 00:09:13.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I am one of Jehovah’s Witnesses
and decided to try to readjust me

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:17.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our family
so that we would renounce our faith.

00:09:17.073 --> 00:09:19.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
They did not stop
pressuring us for three years.

00:09:19.642 --> 00:09:24.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the age of 18,
I received a conscription to the Soviet army,

00:09:24.313 --> 00:09:29.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I refused and was sentenced
to two years of imprisonment.

00:09:29.318 --> 00:09:31.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
After serving the sentence,

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
I married
a lovely and faithful sister, Lidija.

00:09:34.257 --> 00:09:37.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon after,
I received a second call to join the army.

00:09:37.326 --> 00:09:38.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time, the court rendered

00:09:38.995 --> 00:09:42.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sentence of three years
in a unit of strict regime.

00:09:42.465 --> 00:09:44.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was born in Ukraine.

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I got married,
I moved to live with my husband in Lithuania.

00:09:49.038 --> 00:09:53.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seven months later,
my husband received a prison sentence.

00:09:53.442 --> 00:09:57.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emotionally, this was so difficult
that I ended up in a hospital.

00:09:58.481 --> 00:10:01.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon we lost our unborn baby,

00:10:01.417 --> 00:10:04.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and here I was alone in a foreign land,

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
unable to speak the local language.

00:10:07.223 --> 00:10:12.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
In view of the imprisonment of my husband,
I was not able to find a job.

00:10:12.228 --> 00:10:15.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prison guards were cruel
and would often beat the prisoners.

00:10:15.898 --> 00:10:19.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
I suffered such mistreatment as well.

00:10:19.135 --> 00:10:22.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than that,
I was isolated from my family

00:10:22.538 --> 00:10:25.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from my spiritual brothers and sisters.

00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:29.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
The hardest part
was the separation from my dear wife, Lidija.

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even so,

00:10:31.213 --> 00:10:35.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lidija was a special source
of support for me.

00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:36.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost every day,

00:10:36.952 --> 00:10:38.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
she wrote me letters.

00:10:38.788 --> 00:10:40.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
I received more letters

00:10:40.723 --> 00:10:44.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
than all the other 30 inmates combined.

00:10:44.694 --> 00:10:46.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
To support my husband spiritually,

00:10:46.729 --> 00:10:50.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
in my letters
I would include verses from the Scriptures

00:10:50.199 --> 00:10:52.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
and quotations from the publications,

00:10:52.268 --> 00:10:55.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to put them in a way
that the censorship

00:10:55.071 --> 00:10:57.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
would not be able to spot them.

00:10:57.106 --> 00:11:00.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christian meetings
were a source of strength for me.

00:11:00.376 --> 00:11:02.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never missed them.

00:11:02.178 --> 00:11:06.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
On one occasion,
when we held a meeting in our home,

00:11:06.015 --> 00:11:08.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
a group of militia and KGB broke in.

00:11:08.718 --> 00:11:12.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result,
I received a call to appear before the court.

00:11:12.021 --> 00:11:15.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the day of the court hearing,
I was very worried,

00:11:15.825 --> 00:11:18.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah gave me such calmness

00:11:18.461 --> 00:11:21.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
that fear and nervousness disappeared.

00:11:21.464 --> 00:11:25.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was sentenced to pay a fine of 50 rubles.

00:11:25.167 --> 00:11:28.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the time,
it was a large sum of money,

00:11:28.204 --> 00:11:30.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I was not intimidated

00:11:30.206 --> 00:11:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
and never stopped attending meetings.

00:11:33.809 --> 00:11:37.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
I used opportunities
to give a witness to others in the prison.

00:11:38.047 --> 00:11:40.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were instances

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:44.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
when an audience
of dozens of prisoners would listen to me.

00:11:45.554 --> 00:11:49.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
When they asked questions
that were more difficult to answer,

00:11:49.692 --> 00:11:53.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would analyze them and ponder over them

00:11:53.896 --> 00:11:57.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
so as to be able to explain
the grounds for my beliefs.

00:11:58.667 --> 00:12:01.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prayer was a constant companion.

00:12:01.771 --> 00:12:05.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw how Jehovah responded to them.

00:12:05.508 --> 00:12:09.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes he would answer
in a way I did not expect.

00:12:09.979 --> 00:12:13.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always stayed focused
on the reason why Jehovah wants me

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain faithful to him
through all these difficulties,

00:12:16.886 --> 00:12:18.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this helped a lot.

00:12:18.554 --> 00:12:21.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were many occasions
when the help I received

00:12:21.791 --> 00:12:25.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
could not have come
from any other source but Jehovah.

00:12:25.361 --> 00:12:28.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, he became my best Friend.

00:12:28.230 --> 00:12:31.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would always come to the rescue.

00:12:31.267 --> 00:12:33.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
The weaker I was,

00:12:33.369 --> 00:12:36.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more help that came from Jehovah.

00:12:36.939 --> 00:12:41.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let us not think
about how we are going to endure tests;

00:12:41.377 --> 00:12:44.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
think about how Jehovah will help us.

00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:48.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will give us strength
to endure everything.

00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:53.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enduring the things Jehovah
allows us to experience is not in vain,

00:12:53.589 --> 00:12:55.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it is beneficial for us.

00:12:55.691 --> 00:12:59.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
It fortifies and tempers our faith,
so to speak.

00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:04.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
What we need is the right,
positive attitude toward

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
the difficulties we face.

00:13:05.768 --> 00:13:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we have to be determined

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:10.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stay faithful to Jehovah to the end.

00:13:12.208 --> 00:13:17.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate your faithful endurance,
Brother and Sister Pudžiuvys.

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
You reminded us how vital it is

00:13:21.183 --> 00:13:24.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
to regularly attend meetings
and share in the ministry

00:13:24.954 --> 00:13:28.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
—both before and during times of persecution.

00:13:29.558 --> 00:13:34.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
This helps to stabilize us
and keep our faith strong.

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:39.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our next interview,
notice how parental training,

00:13:39.535 --> 00:13:42.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
regularly taking in spiritual food,

00:13:42.037 --> 00:13:45.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and remaining determined never to compromise

00:13:45.274 --> 00:13:49.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped Iósif and Véra Rúsu
to endure persecution.

00:13:51.981 --> 00:13:54.049 line:10% position:50% align:center
I dealt with persecution

00:13:54.049 --> 00:13:56.051 line:10% position:50% align:center
when I was six years old.

00:13:57.419 --> 00:13:59.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
My father and older brother

00:13:59.421 --> 00:14:02.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
were sentenced to 25 years in prison

00:14:02.658 --> 00:14:04.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
as conscientious objectors.

00:14:06.195 --> 00:14:09.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wondered if I would ever see them again.

00:14:10.232 --> 00:14:15.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, thankfully,
they were released two years later.

00:14:16.071 --> 00:14:18.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their example has strengthened me

00:14:18.874 --> 00:14:21.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain faithful to Jehovah.

00:14:22.578 --> 00:14:26.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
I also faced persecution when I was a child.

00:14:26.115 --> 00:14:29.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
At school,
I was often beaten because I preached,

00:14:29.585 --> 00:14:34.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t wear the Soviet star and tie,
and I didn’t sing patriotic songs.

00:14:35.224 --> 00:14:37.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
From an early age,

00:14:37.226 --> 00:14:40.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
my parents taught me to love Jehovah,

00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:42.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
to read from the Bible,

00:14:42.698 --> 00:14:45.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
to sing praises to him,

00:14:45.167 --> 00:14:47.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to learn verses by heart.

00:14:48.571 --> 00:14:53.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
They took us with them to the meetings
that were held three times a week.

00:14:54.076 --> 00:14:56.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
I loved to participate.

00:14:56.645 --> 00:14:59.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always had my hand up.

00:15:00.683 --> 00:15:04.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents taught me how to respond
to those who would put pressure on us

00:15:04.553 --> 00:15:06.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
to betray my brothers or my parents.

00:15:07.923 --> 00:15:12.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
The love and trust in Jehovah
that my parents planted in my heart

00:15:12.661 --> 00:15:16.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me to cherish him
and to want to remain loyal to him.

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:20.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was 15,

00:15:20.169 --> 00:15:24.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
our family was deported to Siberia by train.

00:15:24.473 --> 00:15:27.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
In these difficult conditions,

00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:31.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found comfort and joy in the spiritual food

00:15:31.981 --> 00:15:35.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we managed to take from home.

00:15:35.517 --> 00:15:38.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those were the most important things.

00:15:38.721 --> 00:15:43.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the way there on the train,
we sang songs.

00:15:44.426 --> 00:15:46.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ten years later,

00:15:46.528 --> 00:15:48.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I was in Kazakhstan,

00:15:48.564 --> 00:15:52.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was arrested and sentenced to five years.

00:15:52.468 --> 00:15:55.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oftentimes, the prison guards pressured me

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:57.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
to compromise and renounce my faith.

00:15:58.974 --> 00:16:03.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
But meditating
on the issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty

00:16:03.312 --> 00:16:05.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped me to stay firm.

00:16:06.248 --> 00:16:09.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prayed to Jehovah
for the strength to endure

00:16:09.685 --> 00:16:12.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to remain faithful.

00:16:12.221 --> 00:16:15.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reading the Bible helped me to endure trials

00:16:15.391 --> 00:16:19.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not to make any compromises,
no matter what.

00:16:20.663 --> 00:16:23.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
After I finished my prison sentence,

00:16:23.932 --> 00:16:26.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
I returned to Moldova.

00:16:26.802 --> 00:16:30.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, in 1967,

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:32.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
Véra and I got married.

00:16:32.941 --> 00:16:34.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two years later, Iósif

00:16:34.943 --> 00:16:37.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
was tried by the Supreme Court of Moldova

00:16:37.946 --> 00:16:39.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sentenced

00:16:41.016 --> 00:16:43.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
to ten years in a maximum-security camp.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly, I was left alone at 18
with a one-year-old boy.

00:16:50.325 --> 00:16:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was often called by the KGB
and interrogated for hours,

00:16:54.963 --> 00:16:57.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes for five hours.

00:16:57.833 --> 00:17:02.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
They told me many lies
and attempted to sow doubts in my mind.

00:17:03.172 --> 00:17:05.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next few years,

00:17:05.174 --> 00:17:08.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw my son grow up only in photographs

00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when Véra would visit me twice a year.

00:17:11.847 --> 00:17:15.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the things I especially
looked forward to receiving from her

00:17:15.718 --> 00:17:17.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a new pair of boots.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
The other brothers and sisters
and I wrote the magazines

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:25.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
on very thin sheets of paper
that had the shape of a sole.

00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:31.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
We removed the soles of the boots,
filled them with magazines,

00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:33.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then nailed the soles back on.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:39.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was possible to fit
seven magazines in one pair of boots.

00:17:39.241 --> 00:17:41.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
During persecution,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:46.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
your relationship with Jehovah
becomes closer, more real.

00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:49.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is kind.

00:17:49.218 --> 00:17:53.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is giving me
“the power beyond what is normal.”

00:17:53.188 --> 00:17:56.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my life, the greater the trials,

00:17:56.825 --> 00:18:01.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more opportunities Jehovah gave me
to talk about his purpose and his Kingdom.

00:18:01.697 --> 00:18:04.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
The way Jehovah helps me focus on what I have

00:18:04.933 --> 00:18:07.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not on the hardships that I have endured

00:18:07.770 --> 00:18:12.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
brings me so much joy and comfort.

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have no reason not to be happy.

00:18:17.412 --> 00:18:22.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, Brother and Sister Rúsu,
for sharing your experience with us.

00:18:23.452 --> 00:18:28.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice what helped them
prepare for and face persecution?

00:18:29.258 --> 00:18:31.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to good parental training,

00:18:31.994 --> 00:18:34.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
they regularly took in spiritual food

00:18:34.763 --> 00:18:38.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learned Bible verses by heart

00:18:38.167 --> 00:18:43.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they kept clearly in mind
the issue of Jehovah’s sovereignty,

00:18:43.172 --> 00:18:47.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
remaining determined never to compromise.

00:18:47.309 --> 00:18:49.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can do the same today.

00:18:50.712 --> 00:18:53.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of these couples remind us of the words

00:18:53.348 --> 00:18:56.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
recorded at Hebrews 13:6:

00:18:56.451 --> 00:19:00.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is my helper; I will not be afraid.

00:19:00.622 --> 00:19:02.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
What can man do to me?”

00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:04.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah truly was the Helper

00:19:04.993 --> 00:19:09.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our brothers and sisters
in the former Soviet Union.

00:19:09.198 --> 00:19:13.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite all the waves of persecution
that our brothers faced,

00:19:13.836 --> 00:19:17.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
they remained
faithful and their numbers grew.

00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:23.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in 1949,
there were about 10,000 Witnesses

00:19:23.345 --> 00:19:26.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the countries
that formed the Soviet Union,

00:19:26.982 --> 00:19:29.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
and most of those were in Western Ukraine.

00:19:30.719 --> 00:19:33.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the number of publishers
in those countries

00:19:33.755 --> 00:19:37.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
is over 380,000!

00:19:38.393 --> 00:19:40.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Truly, Jehovah helped them.

00:19:41.496 --> 00:19:44.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the late 1970’s and 1980’s,

00:19:44.566 --> 00:19:48.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
I worked very closely
with the brothers behind the Iron Curtain.

00:19:48.437 --> 00:19:50.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw not only their faith

00:19:50.439 --> 00:19:54.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also the many ways
that Jehovah helped them.

00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:58.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah always made sure
they had the spiritual food they needed.

00:20:00.082 --> 00:20:04.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers really appreciated
the importance of attending meetings,

00:20:04.686 --> 00:20:08.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though these were held in small groups.

00:20:08.257 --> 00:20:11.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they loved to sing theocratic songs,

00:20:11.793 --> 00:20:14.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
learning many of these by heart.

00:20:14.997 --> 00:20:18.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to risk their freedom
and even their safety

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:21.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to attend in-person meetings,

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:24.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they always made the effort.

00:20:24.673 --> 00:20:28.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though the Devil
tried to break their integrity,

00:20:28.243 --> 00:20:32.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
I saw again and again
how Jehovah prospered our brothers

00:20:32.147 --> 00:20:34.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
and helped them to remain faithful.

00:20:36.518 --> 00:20:39.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Russian government
can liquidate a legal entity,

00:20:39.955 --> 00:20:43.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they can never liquidate
Jehovah’s organization.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:47.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will happen to the king of the north?

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:51.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daniel 11:45 tells us:

00:20:51.466 --> 00:20:54.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will come all the way to his end,

00:20:54.903 --> 00:20:57.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there will be no helper for him.”

00:20:57.973 --> 00:21:01.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There will be no helper”
for the king of the north.

00:21:01.209 --> 00:21:04.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who will be our “helper”?

00:21:04.646 --> 00:21:08.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Hebrews 13:6 say?

00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:11.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is my helper.”

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:16.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters,
be determined, come what may,

00:21:16.158 --> 00:21:20.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put your full confidence
in Jehovah and be faithful.

00:21:20.495 --> 00:21:23.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will be your Helper!

00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:26.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
We dearly love each one of you.

00:21:26.835 --> 00:21:30.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:21:30.272 --> 00:21:32.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
