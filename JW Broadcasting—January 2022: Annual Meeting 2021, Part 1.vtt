Welcome to the January 2022 edition

00:00:05.021 --> 00:00:07.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:29.112 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The 137th annual meeting

00:00:29.112 --> 00:00:31.581 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society

00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:33.083 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of Pennsylvania

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:36.986 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was held on October 2, 2021.

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:41.758 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How joyful it was to be together in person

00:00:41.758 --> 00:00:44.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Warwick auditorium for this event!

00:00:44.894 --> 00:00:47.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Bethel family members in attendance

00:00:47.564 --> 00:00:51.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoyed a wonderful lineup
of spiritual talks,

00:00:51.067 --> 00:00:54.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exciting updates, and videos.

00:00:54.204 --> 00:00:57.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now we’re delighted to be able to share

00:00:57.273 --> 00:01:02.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire program with you
here on JW Broadcasting.

00:01:02.178 --> 00:01:06.149 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body assigned me
to be the chairman for the annual meeting

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:10.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to anchor
the January and February JW Broadcasts.

00:01:10.954 --> 00:01:14.390 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This month,
we’ll see the first part of the program,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Part 2 will be featured
in next month’s broadcast.

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:22.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So please enjoy the first half

00:01:22.232 --> 00:01:24.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the 2021 annual meeting.

00:01:26.803 --> 00:01:30.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know what time it is?

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of us are conscious of time every day.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have a time to go to work,
a time to go to school, a time to eat,

00:01:38.848 --> 00:01:41.551 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a time for our Christian meetings,

00:01:41.551 --> 00:01:44.487 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even a time for association

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:46.756 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with our dear friends.

00:01:46.756 --> 00:01:49.125 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the Great Timekeeper,

00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:53.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah reminds us at Ecclesiastes 3:1

00:01:53.463 --> 00:01:57.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there is a proper “time for everything.”

00:01:57.433 --> 00:02:00.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And thus, it’s not surprising
that the Bible speaks

00:02:00.537 --> 00:02:04.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the right time for various events.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, at Leviticus 26:4,

00:02:08.545 --> 00:02:11.881 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah promised the obedient Israelites

00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:16.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he would bless them
with “showers of rain at [the] proper time.”

00:02:16.753 --> 00:02:20.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that’s just a detail, probably,
for most of us.

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you’ve ever lived
in a farming community

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:24.961 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or you’ve done farming yourself,

00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:28.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that rain at the right time

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:31.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can give you a bumper crop,

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but rain at the wrong time

00:02:33.536 --> 00:02:37.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
can completely destroy that same crop.

00:02:37.974 --> 00:02:41.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even words can be spoken at the right time.

00:02:41.044 --> 00:02:44.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 15:23 says:

00:02:44.047 --> 00:02:46.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A word spoken at the right time

00:02:46.783 --> 00:02:49.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—how good it is!”

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:53.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, it is a fundamental principle

00:02:53.223 --> 00:02:56.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that timing is everything.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, think for a moment
about prophesied events

00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:03.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that took place right on time.

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:07.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was baptized at precisely the time

00:03:07.503 --> 00:03:10.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the Messiah was prophesied to appear.

00:03:10.473 --> 00:03:13.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Kingdom began its heavenly rule

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:17.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right on time in 1914.

00:03:17.313 --> 00:03:20.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And looking to the future, Jesus said

00:03:20.416 --> 00:03:22.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has set the time,

00:03:22.485 --> 00:03:26.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even the exact day and the hour,

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the end of this wicked system of things.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does the Governing Body know

00:03:34.264 --> 00:03:36.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when Armageddon is going to come?

00:03:38.368 --> 00:03:40.870 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, we do.

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s going to come right on time.

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:48.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have full confidence in that
—don’t we?—

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:52.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah is going to bring about
those earth-shaking events

00:03:52.782 --> 00:03:55.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly on time.

00:03:55.885 --> 00:03:59.122 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is something else
that Jehovah has promised

00:03:59.122 --> 00:04:01.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide at the proper time.

00:04:01.124 --> 00:04:02.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you go to your Bibles?

00:04:02.926 --> 00:04:07.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s look at Matthew chapter 24

00:04:07.797 --> 00:04:09.799 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and verse 45.

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:16.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here Jesus posed this question:

00:04:16.306 --> 00:04:20.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Who really is
the faithful and discreet slave

00:04:20.243 --> 00:04:23.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“whom his master appointed
over his domestics,

00:04:23.546 --> 00:04:26.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to give them their food

00:04:26.716 --> 00:04:30.086 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“at the proper time?

00:04:30.086 --> 00:04:32.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Happy is that slave if his master

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:35.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“on coming finds him doing so!

00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:38.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Truly I say to you, he will appoint him

00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:41.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
over all his belongings.”

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:43.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, what did Jesus say here?

00:04:43.967 --> 00:04:48.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that he would appoint
a “faithful and discreet slave”

00:04:48.137 --> 00:04:50.540 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would provide the spiritual food.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is another important detail there
—did you notice it?

00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:59.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He added “at the proper time.”

00:04:59.782 --> 00:05:04.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because of Jehovah’s
perfect sense of time,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.291 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he knows exactly what his people need

00:05:08.291 --> 00:05:13.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he knows exactly the right time
to provide it.

00:05:13.296 --> 00:05:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just consider
 a couple of examples of this.

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:21.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Just as World War II was erupting,

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the November 1, 1939, issue of <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:05:25.074 --> 00:05:27.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
featured an in-depth discussion

00:05:27.844 --> 00:05:30.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the topic of neutrality.

00:05:30.913 --> 00:05:35.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That timing was absolutely perfect.

00:05:35.485 --> 00:05:37.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of those articles,

00:05:37.754 --> 00:05:40.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our brothers worldwide

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:43.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
knew exactly what to do

00:05:43.359 --> 00:05:48.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the war engulfed the entire planet.

00:05:48.264 --> 00:05:53.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, after the war
as the organization was rapidly growing,

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:55.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s organization arranged

00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:59.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
large international conventions

00:05:59.142 --> 00:06:01.277 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that were held in New York City.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:06.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1958, a quarter of a million people
—can you imagine?—

00:06:06.282 --> 00:06:09.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
overflowed Yankee Stadium
and the Polo Grounds.

00:06:09.552 --> 00:06:11.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Were any of you there?

00:06:12.655 --> 00:06:15.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, it’s so wonderful that we still have
a few people who were there.

00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:21.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not that I wasn’t
in the truth at that time;

00:06:21.898 --> 00:06:24.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s just that I wasn’t
in the world at that time.

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:29.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that amazing convention

00:06:29.672 --> 00:06:32.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
came just on time.

00:06:32.508 --> 00:06:36.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It energized God’s people
and, we could say,

00:06:36.946 --> 00:06:41.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it put Jehovah’s Witnesses on the map.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was hard to ignore a convention

00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:47.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of a quarter of a million people.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:51.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, fast forward to 2020

00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:54.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at a time when the world was engulfed

00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:57.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a global pandemic.

00:06:57.433 --> 00:07:00.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Large gatherings were prohibited
in most countries.

00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:03.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Could we go to Yankee Stadium and have

00:07:03.406 --> 00:07:06.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
250,000 people there?

00:07:06.075 --> 00:07:07.643 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:07:07.643 --> 00:07:09.812 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But right on time,

00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:13.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah guided
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that our worldwide brotherhood

00:07:15.485 --> 00:07:19.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
could enjoy the convention program from home

00:07:19.255 --> 00:07:22.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—truly, spiritual “food

00:07:22.558 --> 00:07:25.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the proper time.”

00:07:25.294 --> 00:07:29.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during the pandemic, we’ve had
to change our methods, haven’t we?

00:07:29.932 --> 00:07:34.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve had to receive direction
about how to carry out our preaching work

00:07:34.303 --> 00:07:37.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how to carry out
our congregation meetings.

00:07:37.173 --> 00:07:39.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But throughout this period, we have received

00:07:39.942 --> 00:07:43.012 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
powerful, powerful evidence

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:48.017 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jehovah has given this direction to us
at the proper time.

00:07:48.017 --> 00:07:50.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let me just give you
a couple of examples.

00:07:50.987 --> 00:07:57.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During the 2021 service year,

00:07:57.059 --> 00:08:00.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at least 22 branches

00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:05.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have reported an all-time peak
in the number of publishers.

00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:08.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine—during the pandemic?

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:12.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, the Korea branch

00:08:12.074 --> 00:08:15.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has reported a new peak in publishers

00:08:15.411 --> 00:08:20.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
every month during the 2021 service year.

00:08:20.016 --> 00:08:23.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that amazing—during a pandemic?

00:08:31.594 --> 00:08:34.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And with so many wonderful things
happening in the field,

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:36.832 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sure that you’re all wondering

00:08:36.832 --> 00:08:40.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about our worldwide Memorial attendance

00:08:40.636 --> 00:08:43.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 2021.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, by the undeserved kindness

00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:49.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our amazing God, Jehovah,

00:08:49.078 --> 00:08:52.949 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have reached an all-time peak,

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:57.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
crossing the 21 million mark.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Would you like to know the exact figure?

00:09:05.628 --> 00:09:07.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, “keep on the watch”!

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’ll be announced today at the proper time.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, today in our program,

00:09:15.905 --> 00:09:18.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are going to have a wonderful buffet

00:09:18.708 --> 00:09:23.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of rich spiritual food
of many varieties and types.

00:09:23.679 --> 00:09:27.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And by the end of the program,
I’m sure that you’ll agree

00:09:27.717 --> 00:09:30.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it was just what we needed

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at this moment in time.

00:09:34.357 --> 00:09:37.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, last year at the 2020 annual meeting,

00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:39.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body was excited to release

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:44.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a new publication to study
with interested ones entitled

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:49.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course</i>.

00:09:49.105 --> 00:09:52.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It introduced a new and innovative way

00:09:52.608 --> 00:09:55.645 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to study the Bible with interested ones.

00:09:55.645 --> 00:09:58.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How has the publication
been received by Jehovah’s people?

00:09:58.814 --> 00:10:00.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And maybe more to the point,

00:10:00.816 --> 00:10:03.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How is this new format touching the hearts

00:10:03.886 --> 00:10:06.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those studying the Bible with us?

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:09.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please enjoy this video.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:19.869 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
How thrilled we were

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.637 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at last year’s annual meeting

00:10:21.637 --> 00:10:23.773 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to receive a new publication:

00:10:24.473 --> 00:10:28.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>
<i>—An Interactive Bible Course </i>!

00:10:28.911 --> 00:10:31.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Already many publishers are having success

00:10:31.747 --> 00:10:35.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in conducting progressive studies
using this new tool.

00:10:36.752 --> 00:10:39.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As you listen to experiences
from around the world,

00:10:39.789 --> 00:10:43.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
note the evidence of Jehovah’s blessing.

00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:45.895 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
When they made the announcement

00:10:45.895 --> 00:10:47.229 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the new publication,

00:10:47.229 --> 00:10:49.832 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for me it was just pure excitement.

00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:51.467 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Actually, I was so overjoyed

00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:53.502 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that I kept going to the website

00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:55.304 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
around the time of the release,

00:10:55.304 --> 00:10:57.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at times I would even refresh my browser

00:10:57.573 --> 00:11:00.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a few times a day to see when it was out.

00:11:00.109 --> 00:11:02.144 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Having all the teaching methods

00:11:02.144 --> 00:11:03.512 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
right in our hands

00:11:03.512 --> 00:11:05.381 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—what more can we ask for?

00:11:05.381 --> 00:11:08.818 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We were so excited that during this pandemic,

00:11:08.818 --> 00:11:10.653 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has given us something

00:11:10.653 --> 00:11:12.421 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to energize our ministry.

00:11:13.956 --> 00:11:18.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you heard that we would be using
a new method for conducting studies,

00:11:18.794 --> 00:11:21.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were you a bit hesitant?

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:24.133 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pay close attention
to what experienced teachers are saying

00:11:24.133 --> 00:11:26.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the benefits of this approach.

00:11:28.137 --> 00:11:30.139 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Before, it wasn’t uncommon

00:11:30.139 --> 00:11:32.174 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to hear students start their comments

00:11:32.174 --> 00:11:34.543 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with expressions like “the paragraph says”

00:11:34.543 --> 00:11:36.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or “as the book mentions.”

00:11:36.045 --> 00:11:37.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now it’s not like that.

00:11:37.413 --> 00:11:39.548 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the old way of teaching,

00:11:39.548 --> 00:11:41.951 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
it was a bit difficult for me to discern

00:11:41.951 --> 00:11:44.153 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
if my Bible students really understood

00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:48.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what they were learning
or if the truth reached their hearts.

00:11:48.157 --> 00:11:49.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think I was using

00:11:49.725 --> 00:11:51.160 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
too many additional points

00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.628 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to convey one idea

00:11:52.628 --> 00:11:54.497 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and just explaining too much,

00:11:54.497 --> 00:11:58.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so my Bible students
would get even more confused.

00:11:59.235 --> 00:12:01.537 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With some well-educated people,

00:12:01.537 --> 00:12:03.339 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the studies were in a sense

00:12:03.339 --> 00:12:05.074 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
too easy for them.

00:12:05.074 --> 00:12:08.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They found the answer very easily
from the paragraph

00:12:08.544 --> 00:12:11.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and were able to answer correctly,

00:12:11.313 --> 00:12:14.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it was very hard to know
what they really thought about the matter.

00:12:15.851 --> 00:12:17.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With this new book,

00:12:17.853 --> 00:12:19.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems like it is easier to see

00:12:19.855 --> 00:12:23.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the person’s genuine thoughts on the matter.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.928 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In the previous method,

00:12:25.928 --> 00:12:27.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
you would see the student

00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.433 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
looking at the book a lot,

00:12:30.433 --> 00:12:32.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but that doesn’t happen now.

00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:34.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look at the student,

00:12:34.703 --> 00:12:38.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you can tell he is thinking about the answer

00:12:38.073 --> 00:12:40.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of looking for the answer.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:44.046 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They used to enjoy
the Bible study in the past,

00:12:44.046 --> 00:12:48.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but now they enjoy it much more.

00:12:48.083 --> 00:12:50.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now they are able to keep focused

00:12:50.453 --> 00:12:54.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the beginning to the end of our session.

00:12:54.123 --> 00:12:58.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They feel motivated and closer to Jehovah.

00:13:00.129 --> 00:13:02.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To reach the heart of a Bible student,

00:13:02.465 --> 00:13:05.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we need to understand
what he’s thinking and feeling.

00:13:06.569 --> 00:13:10.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How does the <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>  book
help us to do that?

00:13:11.073 --> 00:13:13.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the things I love about it

00:13:13.075 --> 00:13:15.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is how after we read the Bible verse,

00:13:15.744 --> 00:13:17.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there are the questions that follow it

00:13:17.813 --> 00:13:19.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are perfectly phrased for us.

00:13:19.882 --> 00:13:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It really engages our students’ hearts,

00:13:22.051 --> 00:13:24.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helps them to understand

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Bible teachings right away,

00:13:26.055 --> 00:13:28.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it helps us to see
what’s in their heart as well.

00:13:28.991 --> 00:13:30.993 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It lets the student express

00:13:30.993 --> 00:13:32.761 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what is in his heart,

00:13:32.761 --> 00:13:35.097 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
which allows us to help him.

00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.132 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The first time I looked

00:13:37.132 --> 00:13:38.501 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
through this publication,

00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:39.668 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I could already see

00:13:39.668 --> 00:13:41.837 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how appealing its format is.

00:13:41.837 --> 00:13:43.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are no lengthy paragraphs,

00:13:43.839 --> 00:13:46.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it is prepared in a very interactive way.

00:13:48.511 --> 00:13:51.013 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With this new method, I definitely talk less.

00:13:51.013 --> 00:13:52.748 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
My students talk more.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:55.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the one that starts it all off

00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:57.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the introduction video—

00:13:57.353 --> 00:13:59.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just makes everything fit together.

00:13:59.922 --> 00:14:01.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And one of the amazing things

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:05.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that it introduces right away is the prayer,

00:14:05.327 --> 00:14:08.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because often as a teacher,
we didn’t know exactly

00:14:08.364 --> 00:14:10.833 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when to introduce prayer or how to do it,

00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:12.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the video does it for us.

00:14:26.715 --> 00:14:30.786 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, teachers are excited
about the new book.

00:14:30.786 --> 00:14:34.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what impact
is it having on their students?

00:14:35.491 --> 00:14:36.792 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Bible students

00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:38.794 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
have been pleasantly surprised.

00:14:38.794 --> 00:14:41.063 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I asked one student how he felt

00:14:41.063 --> 00:14:43.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be using this new publication.

00:14:43.732 --> 00:14:45.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the response was:

00:14:45.734 --> 00:14:48.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Why didn’t we do this sooner?

00:14:48.203 --> 00:14:51.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s great!
I’m a lot calmer.”

00:14:51.106 --> 00:14:53.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another student
told me that she was relieved

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:55.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to no longer have to find the answers

00:14:55.644 --> 00:14:58.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but, rather, to express
her thoughts and feelings.

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:00.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
During our discussion

00:15:00.649 --> 00:15:02.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the “Dig Deeper” section in lesson 02,

00:15:02.885 --> 00:15:05.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
my Bible student really appreciated

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:08.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the scriptures and the beautiful artwork.

00:15:09.258 --> 00:15:12.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that he
could already see himself in Paradise

00:15:12.261 --> 00:15:14.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
enjoying the many promises of Jehovah.

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:17.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He said that our discussion

00:15:17.066 --> 00:15:20.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made him feel Jehovah’s love.

00:15:20.502 --> 00:15:21.670 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
With the students,

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:23.973 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
they’re not so overwhelmed with the new book

00:15:23.973 --> 00:15:26.008 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
when we ask them to prepare the lesson.

00:15:26.008 --> 00:15:28.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With the <i>Bible Teach</i>  book,
when we would ask them

00:15:28.444 --> 00:15:30.746 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to prepare these paragraphs,

00:15:30.746 --> 00:15:32.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was like you asked them
to go to the dentist.

00:15:32.381 --> 00:15:34.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They just seemed so intimidated by it.

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:38.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now they smile, and they’re like,
“OK, I can do that.”

00:15:38.954 --> 00:15:40.956 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One student in particular

00:15:40.956 --> 00:15:42.992 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
wrote in the “Goal” box:

00:15:42.992 --> 00:15:44.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
“I want to share the points

00:15:44.693 --> 00:15:46.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“from this lesson

00:15:46.095 --> 00:15:48.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with my friends and work colleagues
within a week.”

00:15:48.597 --> 00:15:50.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he did.

00:15:50.866 --> 00:15:53.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the videos that was really effective

00:15:53.202 --> 00:15:55.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the one from lesson 04,

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:57.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>My Search for the True God</i>.

00:15:57.206 --> 00:16:00.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It shows the experience
of Sister Soten Yoeun.

00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:02.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
My students were deeply moved.

00:16:03.479 --> 00:16:06.215 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They really felt Jehovah’s love for them

00:16:06.215 --> 00:16:08.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and wanted to speak with him.

00:16:08.417 --> 00:16:11.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They felt motivated to pray.

00:16:11.954 --> 00:16:15.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were studying the first lesson
with an 83-year-old lady

00:16:15.591 --> 00:16:19.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we came across Matthew 7:7.

00:16:21.163 --> 00:16:23.666 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She read it in her own Bible,

00:16:23.666 --> 00:16:26.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at first she didn’t quite understand it.

00:16:29.605 --> 00:16:32.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then we pondered over the verse
together with the question.

00:16:32.508 --> 00:16:35.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then all of a sudden she asked:

00:16:35.444 --> 00:16:37.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Oh! Does this verse mean

00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that I should dig
for the answers in the Bible myself

00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:43.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
instead of asking a priest?”

00:16:43.919 --> 00:16:46.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was quite a special moment.

00:16:47.089 --> 00:16:48.290 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The video

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:50.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
under “Learn to enjoy Bible reading”

00:16:50.693 --> 00:16:53.128 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was very helpful for one young man.

00:16:53.128 --> 00:16:54.663 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After watching it,

00:16:54.663 --> 00:16:58.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he set the goal
of reading the Bible every day.

00:16:59.234 --> 00:17:00.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With one Bible student,

00:17:00.636 --> 00:17:03.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had encouraged him
to become an unbaptized publisher

00:17:03.038 --> 00:17:05.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the previous study book.

00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:10.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now when we were in lesson 02
of our new study publication,

00:17:10.112 --> 00:17:14.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he expressed the desire
to become an unbaptized publisher

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:18.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he felt he could share
one or two points from each lesson

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with his friends and others that he knew.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:25.260 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so now he is approved,
and he’s doing very well in the ministry.

00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:30.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thanks to this new book,
I now conduct 15 Bible studies.

00:17:30.232 --> 00:17:33.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The book helps them to maintain
the desire and motivation

00:17:33.802 --> 00:17:35.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep learning about Jehovah,

00:17:35.804 --> 00:17:39.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his beautiful qualities,
and the future that awaits us.

00:17:40.876 --> 00:17:44.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly,
our worldwide brotherhood is excited

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:47.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to use <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:50.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a tremendous gift from Jehovah!

00:17:50.886 --> 00:17:53.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of all the facets of our ministry,

00:17:53.522 --> 00:17:55.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
without question

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:57.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conducting a progressive Bible study

00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:00.329 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is the most satisfying aspect.

00:18:00.329 --> 00:18:01.930 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And now we have the tool

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:03.966 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the method to make it much easier.

00:18:03.966 --> 00:18:06.168 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I’m very grateful for this tool.

00:18:06.168 --> 00:18:08.604 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It really helps us to sense

00:18:08.604 --> 00:18:10.706 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
how close the Governing Body

00:18:10.706 --> 00:18:13.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recognizes we are to the end,

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:16.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but it in no way feels like a rushed program.

00:18:16.311 --> 00:18:19.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The heart is definitely
being reached gently and lovingly,

00:18:19.782 --> 00:18:22.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but then that is what motivates quickly.

00:18:22.651 --> 00:18:24.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try and introduce it as much as you can.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:26.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Start those Bible studies.

00:18:26.555 --> 00:18:28.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when you do,

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:30.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please invite me
to join in on your new Bible study.

00:18:42.671 --> 00:18:44.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The new book <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
shows clearly
that “the faithful and discreet slave”

00:18:46.875 --> 00:18:50.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been, is, and will continue to give

00:18:50.879 --> 00:18:54.249 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
exactly what we need
at exactly the right time.

00:18:54.917 --> 00:18:57.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This publication has the potential

00:18:57.886 --> 00:19:00.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to help many more honesthearted ones

00:19:00.255 --> 00:19:04.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
come to know and love
our wonderful Father, Jehovah.

00:19:04.326 --> 00:19:07.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May he bless you and your Bible students

00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:10.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you put to use this new tool.

00:19:23.545 --> 00:19:26.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was very, very encouraging,

00:19:26.548 --> 00:19:31.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we apologize to all those
who work in the dental office.

00:19:31.186 --> 00:19:33.589 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We do appreciate your hard work.

00:19:34.356 --> 00:19:38.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, no doubt many of you
are experiencing similar blessings

00:19:38.727 --> 00:19:41.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as you are conducting Bible studies
in this wonderful new tool.

00:19:41.997 --> 00:19:45.868 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are not presently conducting
a Bible study,

00:19:45.868 --> 00:19:49.972 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why not make it a matter
of earnest prayer to Jehovah?

00:19:49.972 --> 00:19:52.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because there is no experience

00:19:52.074 --> 00:19:56.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
quite like having a Bible study
in this wonderful new publication.

00:19:57.579 --> 00:19:59.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for the past several years,

00:19:59.815 --> 00:20:02.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a unique feature
of our annual meeting program

00:20:02.851 --> 00:20:06.355 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has been a new so-called epic edition

00:20:06.355 --> 00:20:09.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>  series.

00:20:09.424 --> 00:20:14.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We call it an epic because it is longer
than the usual episodes.

00:20:14.429 --> 00:20:16.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are now pleased to present

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:21.069 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Become Jehovah’s Friend</i>
<i>—Does Jehovah Answer Prayers?</i>

00:20:24.373 --> 00:20:27.409 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Sophia, we know you’re in there.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, Jehovah, make it stop!

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:32.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Heh, heh, heh.

00:20:33.115 --> 00:20:34.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a loser!

00:20:34.182 --> 00:20:35.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Loser.

00:20:35.317 --> 00:20:36.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go.

00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:37.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yeah, let’s get out of here.

00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All right, class,

00:21:02.978 --> 00:21:05.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
today we’re going to discuss—

00:21:05.948 --> 00:21:08.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia? You’re late.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m sorry. Uh, I was—

00:21:11.353 --> 00:21:12.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Never mind.

00:21:12.421 --> 00:21:13.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll talk about this later.

00:21:14.022 --> 00:21:16.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oooooooooo.

00:21:16.224 --> 00:21:18.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, OK. That’s enough.

00:21:18.593 --> 00:21:20.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia, take your seat.

00:21:21.296 --> 00:21:23.932 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, we’re going to discuss the difference

00:21:23.932 --> 00:21:26.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between division and long division.

00:21:32.007 --> 00:21:33.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK, class.

00:21:33.342 --> 00:21:35.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here are the results from yesterday’s test.

00:21:35.777 --> 00:21:38.080 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Good work, Sophia.

00:21:42.951 --> 00:21:44.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, Angela.

00:21:44.186 --> 00:21:45.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did you get?

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t care.

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:48.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whoa!

00:21:48.824 --> 00:21:50.993 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
D plus?

00:21:50.993 --> 00:21:53.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, at least there’s a plus.

00:21:53.562 --> 00:21:55.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whatever.

00:21:56.565 --> 00:21:58.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you looking at?

00:22:00.035 --> 00:22:02.037 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uh, hehe.

00:22:15.017 --> 00:22:17.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sophia.

00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:32.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhhh!

00:22:33.235 --> 00:22:34.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Uhhh!

00:22:37.572 --> 00:22:40.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oops! I didn’t see you there.

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s like you’re invisible.

00:22:47.315 --> 00:22:49.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, what’s this?

00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you tomorrow.

00:22:58.693 --> 00:22:59.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Loser.

00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:14.843 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you OK?

00:23:15.911 --> 00:23:17.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let me help.

00:23:18.914 --> 00:23:21.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes they pick on me too.

00:23:31.259 --> 00:23:33.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing!

00:23:33.295 --> 00:23:35.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then Ms. Wilson said I could hold the bunny,

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but I had to be very gentle.

00:23:38.733 --> 00:23:39.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Really?

00:23:40.135 --> 00:23:42.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I named him Fred.

00:23:42.137 --> 00:23:44.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But I didn’t get to hold him for very long.

00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:48.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m pretty much a bunny expert now.

00:23:51.146 --> 00:23:53.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh! Is everything all right, Honey?

00:23:54.382 --> 00:23:55.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Um . . .

00:23:57.519 --> 00:23:59.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
See you tomorrow.

00:24:01.923 --> 00:24:03.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m fine.

00:24:11.433 --> 00:24:12.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
OK.

00:24:12.701 --> 00:24:15.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about something very important:

00:24:15.871 --> 00:24:17.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prayer.

00:24:17.973 --> 00:24:18.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Caleb,

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:21.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what are some things that you can pray for?

00:24:22.677 --> 00:24:24.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I can pray for things

00:24:24.679 --> 00:24:26.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that make me happy

00:24:28.283 --> 00:24:30.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like a helicopter

00:24:32.954 --> 00:24:35.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a mountain of ice cream

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:42.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—uh, without the bellyache—

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.035 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Fred!

00:24:47.469 --> 00:24:49.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I see.

00:24:49.471 --> 00:24:52.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But tell me: When we pray before bedtime,

00:24:52.707 --> 00:24:54.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what do we pray for?

00:24:55.677 --> 00:24:58.914 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank Jehovah for the good things he made

00:24:58.914 --> 00:25:01.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like, like, animals,

00:25:01.283 --> 00:25:03.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the stars, and the ocean

00:25:05.654 --> 00:25:07.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and God’s Kingdom

00:25:07.722 --> 00:25:10.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to help our brothers and sisters!

00:25:10.525 --> 00:25:11.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s right!

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can pray for your brothers and sisters.

00:25:14.262 --> 00:25:15.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And remember,

00:25:15.564 --> 00:25:17.866 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they are praying for you too.

00:25:17.866 --> 00:25:20.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know that when we pray for the right things,

00:25:20.635 --> 00:25:22.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah hears us!

00:25:22.604 --> 00:25:25.840 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why doesn’t he answer <i>my</i>  prayers?

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh! What’s wrong, Sophia?

00:25:28.543 --> 00:25:29.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can tell us.

00:25:31.813 --> 00:25:34.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s a girl at school.

00:25:34.216 --> 00:25:36.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She’s so mean to me.

00:25:37.385 --> 00:25:39.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!

00:25:41.189 --> 00:25:43.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, Honey, it’s OK.

00:25:44.893 --> 00:25:47.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for it to stop,

00:25:47.262 --> 00:25:49.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nothing’s happened.

00:25:50.332 --> 00:25:52.400 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is Jehovah mad at me?

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, my dear.

00:25:54.736 --> 00:25:57.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah isn’t mad at you.

00:25:57.939 --> 00:26:00.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Maybe Jehovah can’t see me!

00:26:01.243 --> 00:26:02.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No!

00:26:06.081 --> 00:26:08.049 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is someone in the Bible

00:26:08.049 --> 00:26:11.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who felt the same way you do.

00:26:11.019 --> 00:26:15.590 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Her name was Hannah.

00:26:18.827 --> 00:26:22.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah loved Jehovah very much.

00:26:22.397 --> 00:26:24.466 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hey, wait for me!

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But someone named Peninnah

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.805 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was very mean to her.

00:26:30.805 --> 00:26:33.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so nice to see the children play,

00:26:33.475 --> 00:26:35.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
isn’t it?

00:26:36.011 --> 00:26:38.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She had a bully too?

00:26:38.246 --> 00:26:39.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

00:26:43.852 --> 00:26:45.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re ready to eat.

00:26:45.954 --> 00:26:48.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here’s your portion, Hannah.

00:26:48.089 --> 00:26:50.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Peninnah, here’s yours.

00:26:51.526 --> 00:26:54.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She was very jealous of Hannah.

00:26:57.265 --> 00:27:00.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Ah, I’ll get some water.

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You think you’re so special, Hannah?

00:27:08.076 --> 00:27:10.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then why hasn’t Jehovah given <i>you </i>

00:27:10.912 --> 00:27:13.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
any children?

00:27:17.719 --> 00:27:19.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you OK, Hannah?

00:27:19.788 --> 00:27:21.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you so sad?

00:27:21.823 --> 00:27:23.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others could not understand

00:27:23.325 --> 00:27:25.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
why Hannah was so upset

00:27:25.593 --> 00:27:28.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because the pain was in her heart.

00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:32.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So she talked to the One

00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who <i>would</i>  understand.

00:27:48.016 --> 00:27:51.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
O Jehovah, please, see me.

00:27:52.454 --> 00:27:54.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember me.

00:27:54.489 --> 00:27:57.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And do not forget me.

00:27:57.325 --> 00:28:01.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please give me a child.

00:28:01.696 --> 00:28:03.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you do,

00:28:03.765 --> 00:28:06.835 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will give him to you all his life

00:28:06.835 --> 00:28:08.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve you.

00:28:14.843 --> 00:28:16.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What are you doing?

00:28:17.078 --> 00:28:19.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why are you drunk?

00:28:21.015 --> 00:28:22.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m not drunk.

00:28:22.684 --> 00:28:24.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m under great stress.

00:28:26.287 --> 00:28:27.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh.

00:28:28.156 --> 00:28:31.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’ve been praying for Jehovah to help me.

00:28:33.361 --> 00:28:35.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Go in peace,

00:28:35.397 --> 00:28:36.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may Jehovah give you

00:28:36.898 --> 00:28:39.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what you’ve asked for.

00:28:42.904 --> 00:28:44.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know why Hannah felt better

00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even though her prayer wasn’t answered yet?

00:28:48.443 --> 00:28:49.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why?

00:28:50.278 --> 00:28:52.947 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Hannah knew Jehovah heard her prayer.

00:28:54.883 --> 00:28:57.952 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jehovah listens to your prayers,

00:28:57.952 --> 00:29:00.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he really listens.

00:29:00.121 --> 00:29:02.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he knows just what we need

00:29:02.157 --> 00:29:04.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even better than we do.

00:29:05.226 --> 00:29:08.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But how does he answer them?

00:29:08.196 --> 00:29:10.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In lots of different ways.

00:29:10.265 --> 00:29:13.601 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometimes, we just have to wait and see.

00:29:13.601 --> 00:29:15.637 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he’s busy?

00:29:15.904 --> 00:29:16.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:18.706 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because it can be hard for us

00:29:18.706 --> 00:29:20.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see the answer.

00:29:20.575 --> 00:29:23.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s talk about what you can pray for . . .

00:29:24.345 --> 00:29:26.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
. . . and what you can do tomorrow at school

00:29:26.581 --> 00:29:28.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work along with those prayers.

00:29:33.788 --> 00:29:35.857 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I know that Angela and the other girls

00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:38.259 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are going to be mean to me.

00:29:38.893 --> 00:29:40.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But please help me

00:29:40.929 --> 00:29:42.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be like Hannah tomorrow.

00:29:44.365 --> 00:29:46.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help me to be strong like her.

00:29:53.575 --> 00:29:55.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then she went to the tabernacle,

00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:57.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Eli was there.

00:29:57.145 --> 00:29:58.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was the high priest.

00:30:18.933 --> 00:30:19.968 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, no!

00:30:19.968 --> 00:30:22.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s them! Run!

00:30:23.705 --> 00:30:25.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look who it is.

00:30:25.707 --> 00:30:27.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Look over there. It’s them!

00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:28.309 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you think she did?

00:30:28.309 --> 00:30:29.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did she say?

00:30:32.747 --> 00:30:34.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is there about to be a fight?

00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:36.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Angela would win.

00:30:36.951 --> 00:30:38.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do you want, Angela?

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:40.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Oh, I was just wondering

00:30:40.822 --> 00:30:42.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if you had a pen that I can borrow.

00:30:49.197 --> 00:30:50.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Agh!

00:30:50.231 --> 00:30:52.267 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What do I do?

00:30:53.368 --> 00:30:55.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah heard her prayer.

00:30:58.406 --> 00:31:01.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, it’s me, Caleb.

00:31:01.276 --> 00:31:03.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please help Sophia.

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please

00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:10.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
help Sophia be strong at school today.

00:31:10.318 --> 00:31:13.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Watch over the children in our congregation

00:31:13.154 --> 00:31:15.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like Caleb and Sophia.

00:31:15.156 --> 00:31:17.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please watch over our children.

00:31:17.592 --> 00:31:20.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help our children make you proud, Jehovah.

00:31:20.261 --> 00:31:22.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please, Jehovah, give our children

00:31:22.263 --> 00:31:23.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the strength they need to face pressures.

00:31:23.898 --> 00:31:26.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah, please!

00:31:26.067 --> 00:31:28.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I need your help!

00:31:30.238 --> 00:31:33.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We ask you this prayer in Jesus’ name.

00:31:33.408 --> 00:31:35.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen!

00:31:38.079 --> 00:31:40.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Amen.

00:31:40.515 --> 00:31:42.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What? Are you gonna cry?

00:31:43.818 --> 00:31:45.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Stop, Angela.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:47.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re being mean.

00:31:47.055 --> 00:31:48.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if you keep being mean,

00:31:48.823 --> 00:31:50.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to tell.

00:31:51.225 --> 00:31:52.794 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, you won’t.

00:31:52.794 --> 00:31:53.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, I will.

00:31:53.995 --> 00:31:56.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can’t tell me what to do.

00:31:56.464 --> 00:31:58.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s go, Zoe.

00:32:05.239 --> 00:32:07.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s my sister!

00:32:09.077 --> 00:32:11.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’re so brave.

00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:12.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did you do that?

00:32:12.614 --> 00:32:15.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I prayed for courage, and Jehovah helped me.

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Hannah gave birth to a son

00:32:27.595 --> 00:32:29.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and named him Samuel

00:32:29.397 --> 00:32:31.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because as she said, . . .

00:32:32.066 --> 00:32:35.470 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is from Jehovah that I have asked him.

00:32:38.406 --> 00:32:41.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no one holy like Jehovah.

00:32:41.943 --> 00:32:44.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is no one but you.

00:32:50.318 --> 00:32:52.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you, Jehovah.

00:32:59.961 --> 00:33:01.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, that was

00:33:01.963 --> 00:33:05.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
truly spiritual “food at the proper time.”

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:09.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And while it will touch the hearts
of all of our young ones,

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:11.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think that message is something

00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:14.142 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we all need to hear
and take to heart at this time.

00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:17.245 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now we have the privilege

00:33:17.245 --> 00:33:21.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to hear three Scriptural talks
by members of the Governing Body.

00:33:21.716 --> 00:33:26.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll first enjoy a talk
by our dear Brother David Splane entitled

00:33:26.654 --> 00:33:29.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Way of Holiness.”

00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Incredible!

00:33:36.431 --> 00:33:38.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s the only way to describe it.

00:33:40.001 --> 00:33:43.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The word had gone out that the Jews

00:33:43.738 --> 00:33:47.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had been captives
in Babylon were free to leave

00:33:47.275 --> 00:33:50.278 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to return to their homeland, Israel.

00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:55.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you all know why that was incredible:

00:33:55.717 --> 00:33:59.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Babylon never released its captives.

00:33:59.987 --> 00:34:02.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Babylon had been overthrown,

00:34:02.356 --> 00:34:05.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the new administration had said

00:34:05.393 --> 00:34:07.895 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Jews were free to go.

00:34:08.996 --> 00:34:13.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only Jehovah could have been
responsible for that.

00:34:14.068 --> 00:34:18.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So every family head had a decision to make:

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:23.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to leave Babylon or to stay behind.

00:34:24.912 --> 00:34:27.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, you might say:

00:34:27.648 --> 00:34:29.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“There was no decision to make at all.

00:34:29.984 --> 00:34:31.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not a hard decision.”

00:34:31.819 --> 00:34:33.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But wait.
Hold it.

00:34:34.856 --> 00:34:39.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Most of the Jews had been born in Babylon.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.796 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of their parents

00:34:41.796 --> 00:34:45.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had been born in Babylon.

00:34:45.366 --> 00:34:48.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was the only home they knew.

00:34:48.736 --> 00:34:51.906 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their roots were there.

00:34:51.906 --> 00:34:56.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And according to certain records,
some of them had gotten prosperous.

00:34:56.444 --> 00:34:58.479 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them had gotten wealthy.

00:34:58.479 --> 00:35:02.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are records of Jews
buying and selling precious gems

00:35:02.550 --> 00:35:05.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and other luxury items.

00:35:05.987 --> 00:35:10.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one says: “I can’t leave Babylon.

00:35:10.858 --> 00:35:13.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My business partner is a Babylonian,

00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:15.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and the business is doing really well,

00:35:15.763 --> 00:35:19.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and there would be no market
for the products we sell in Israel.”

00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:21.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Another would say:

00:35:21.102 --> 00:35:24.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“My son married a Babylonian woman,

00:35:24.472 --> 00:35:26.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and they just had a baby,

00:35:26.474 --> 00:35:28.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“our first grandchild.

00:35:28.176 --> 00:35:29.343 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“He’s so cute.

00:35:29.343 --> 00:35:31.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can’t leave now.”

00:35:31.712 --> 00:35:35.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So on the one hand,
you have these material benefits

00:35:35.817 --> 00:35:38.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from remaining in Babylon.

00:35:38.019 --> 00:35:40.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on the other hand,

00:35:40.021 --> 00:35:44.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the ability of the Jews
to worship Jehovah freely

00:35:44.091 --> 00:35:46.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was severely limited.

00:35:46.127 --> 00:35:50.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s said that there were 50 pagan temples

00:35:50.164 --> 00:35:52.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the capital alone.

00:35:52.733 --> 00:35:55.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there was no temple of Jehovah there.

00:35:55.937 --> 00:36:00.141 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the Levites weren’t able to follow
the Law of Moses properly.

00:36:00.141 --> 00:36:03.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could only do so to a limited degree.

00:36:03.044 --> 00:36:06.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you had material advantages to staying,

00:36:06.547 --> 00:36:11.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but the spiritual blessings
that awaited those who chose to leave

00:36:11.552 --> 00:36:14.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were going to be immense.

00:36:14.055 --> 00:36:16.858 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And for spiritually-minded Jews,

00:36:16.858 --> 00:36:18.893 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was no contest

00:36:18.893 --> 00:36:21.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they wanted to leave Babylon

00:36:21.529 --> 00:36:24.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and reestablish pure worship

00:36:24.098 --> 00:36:27.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Promised Land in Israel.

00:36:27.401 --> 00:36:31.038 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so if they were physically able to do so,

00:36:31.038 --> 00:36:34.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would leave Babylon

00:36:34.175 --> 00:36:36.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and travel to Jerusalem,

00:36:36.878 --> 00:36:40.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city most of them had never seen,

00:36:40.615 --> 00:36:43.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a city in ruins.

00:36:44.518 --> 00:36:49.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Jehovah promised to make
the trip from Babylon to Jerusalem

00:36:49.423 --> 00:36:51.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as easy as possible.

00:36:51.692 --> 00:36:54.695 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And to confirm that
and to get a little picture in our minds,

00:36:54.695 --> 00:36:59.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’re going to read a series
of four different scriptures.

00:36:59.033 --> 00:37:03.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And each scripture is going to add
a little detail to what Jehovah had in mind.

00:37:03.838 --> 00:37:08.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first one
is found at Isaiah chapter 40,

00:37:08.009 --> 00:37:10.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
verses 3 and 4.

00:37:10.678 --> 00:37:15.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And I’ll wait a moment because it’d be good
if we could read this together.

00:37:15.016 --> 00:37:17.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is Isaiah chapter 40,

00:37:17.885 --> 00:37:21.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the well-known words of verses 3, 4:

00:37:23.724 --> 00:37:27.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“A voice of one
calling out in the wilderness:

00:37:27.595 --> 00:37:30.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Clear up the way of Jehovah!

00:37:30.464 --> 00:37:35.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Make a straight highway through the desert

00:37:35.469 --> 00:37:39.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[a straight highway through the desert]
for our God.

00:37:39.707 --> 00:37:42.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Let every valley be raised up,

00:37:42.576 --> 00:37:45.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘and every mountain and hill be made low.

00:37:45.546 --> 00:37:48.015 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘The rough ground must become level,

00:37:48.015 --> 00:37:52.119 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the rugged ground, a valley plain.’”

00:37:52.119 --> 00:37:56.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, every time I read these words,
I think of Brother Carey Barber.

00:37:56.891 --> 00:38:01.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He must have loved this passage
because very often in his prayers

00:38:01.329 --> 00:38:04.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he would quote this passage word for word

00:38:04.198 --> 00:38:06.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—good memories of Brother Barber.

00:38:06.834 --> 00:38:11.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, it talks about making
“a straight highway through the desert.”

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If some of you have gone
to the Ramapo project,

00:38:16.577 --> 00:38:20.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know what site work is all about.

00:38:20.214 --> 00:38:24.552 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How would you like to have
the Construction Committee in Ramapo

00:38:24.552 --> 00:38:26.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
take that job on?

00:38:26.554 --> 00:38:29.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Make a straight highway through the desert.

00:38:29.056 --> 00:38:31.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“When you come to a mountain,
you’ve got to level it.

00:38:31.392 --> 00:38:33.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you come to a valley,
you’ve got to bring it up.”

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:35.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That would be quite a job.

00:38:35.229 --> 00:38:37.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I think they have enough on their plate.

00:38:37.064 --> 00:38:39.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They don’t need to worry
about this kind of site work.

00:38:39.967 --> 00:38:41.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this was going to be a big job.

00:38:41.969 --> 00:38:46.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the end, it would be a lot easier
to travel on a straight highway

00:38:46.974 --> 00:38:50.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than to go up and down
a mountain or down a valley.

00:38:50.978 --> 00:38:53.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it would be a lot faster too.

00:38:53.514 --> 00:38:57.118 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we know that there
was going to be a straight highway

00:38:57.118 --> 00:39:00.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between Babylon and Jerusalem.

00:39:00.221 --> 00:39:01.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What else can we learn?

00:39:01.555 --> 00:39:03.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 57,

00:39:04.759 --> 00:39:07.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 57:14

00:39:13.134 --> 00:39:15.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—verse 14 says: “It will be said:

00:39:15.970 --> 00:39:18.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Build up, build up a road!

00:39:18.305 --> 00:39:19.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘Prepare the way!

00:39:19.974 --> 00:39:23.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“‘[and here it comes]
Remove any obstacle

00:39:23.978 --> 00:39:26.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from the way of my people.’”

00:39:26.781 --> 00:39:28.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now we have two details:

00:39:28.849 --> 00:39:31.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s  going to be a straight highway
through the desert,

00:39:31.652 --> 00:39:36.557 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all of the obstacles
are going to be cleared away.

00:39:36.557 --> 00:39:39.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, most highways have a name.

00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:41.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of them are named after famous people;

00:39:41.295 --> 00:39:43.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others have a number.

00:39:43.297 --> 00:39:46.100 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Does this special highway have a name?

00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:47.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It does.

00:39:47.401 --> 00:39:52.406 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we go to Isaiah 35:8, 9
to find that name.

00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:57.845 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m giving you a real workout this morning,

00:39:57.845 --> 00:40:00.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but we have to do this
to put it all together.

00:40:00.448 --> 00:40:03.951 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 35:8, 9:

00:40:05.219 --> 00:40:07.755 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And a highway will be there, yes,

00:40:07.755 --> 00:40:10.791 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a way called [here it comes]

00:40:10.791 --> 00:40:13.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Way of Holiness.

00:40:13.727 --> 00:40:16.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The unclean one will not travel on it.

00:40:16.897 --> 00:40:19.900 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“It is reserved for the one
walking on the way;

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:23.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“no one foolish will stray onto it.

00:40:23.104 --> 00:40:25.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“No lion will be there,

00:40:25.873 --> 00:40:30.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and no vicious wild beasts will come on it.

00:40:30.211 --> 00:40:32.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“They will not be found there.

00:40:32.246 --> 00:40:35.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Only the repurchased ones will walk there.”

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what’s the name?

00:40:37.585 --> 00:40:40.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What’s the special name of this highway?

00:40:40.020 --> 00:40:42.022 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Way of Holiness.”

00:40:42.022 --> 00:40:44.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t that a nice name for a highway?

00:40:44.925 --> 00:40:48.596 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rattlesnakes, bears,

00:40:48.596 --> 00:40:53.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
foxes, and cougars are not allowed.

00:40:53.367 --> 00:40:55.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t care how cute you think they are.

00:40:55.769 --> 00:40:59.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re not allowed on this special highway.

00:40:59.039 --> 00:41:01.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now,

00:41:01.275 --> 00:41:04.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what else can we learn
about this special highway?

00:41:04.945 --> 00:41:09.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Today, you don’t know who is traveling
in the car next to yours.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:13.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It could be somebody
who has no business driving a car.

00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The driver could be drunk.

00:41:15.422 --> 00:41:17.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He could be on drugs.

00:41:17.424 --> 00:41:22.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But on this highway,
the unclean one is not permitted.

00:41:22.429 --> 00:41:27.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who would break God’s laws
are not permitted to travel on that highway.

00:41:27.434 --> 00:41:32.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we’re talking about the highway
between Babylon and Jerusalem.

00:41:32.439 --> 00:41:35.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And no doubt unclean ones among the Jews

00:41:35.042 --> 00:41:37.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t be interested
in going back to Israel anyway.

00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They were probably very much at home

00:41:40.147 --> 00:41:42.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the idolatry of Babylon.

00:41:42.883 --> 00:41:47.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, their forefathers
were no strangers to idolatry.

00:41:47.154 --> 00:41:50.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So only those who were
clean and acceptable in Jehovah’s eyes

00:41:50.824 --> 00:41:55.829 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were welcome to travel
from Babylon back to Jerusalem.

00:41:55.829 --> 00:41:57.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, let’s be clear.

00:41:57.965 --> 00:42:01.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We don’t know whether
there was any literal roadwork

00:42:01.702 --> 00:42:05.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
done on the road between Babylon and Israel.

00:42:05.739 --> 00:42:09.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It may be all figurative, but there
could have been some roadwork done.

00:42:09.543 --> 00:42:12.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice what Jehovah told the Jews to do

00:42:12.546 --> 00:42:16.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jeremiah 31:21.

00:42:19.086 --> 00:42:21.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you would ask,
‘Why would Jehovah

00:42:21.689 --> 00:42:25.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
say all of these things
if it was all to be ignored literally?’

00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:28.629 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Jeremiah 31:21,

00:42:29.964 --> 00:42:34.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he says:
“Set up road markers for yourself,

00:42:34.268 --> 00:42:36.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and put up signposts.

00:42:36.537 --> 00:42:40.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Pay attention to the highway,
the way that you have to go.

00:42:40.174 --> 00:42:42.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Return, O virgin of Israel,

00:42:42.810 --> 00:42:46.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
return to these cities of yours.”

00:42:46.847 --> 00:42:50.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So no doubt the first groups to use the road

00:42:50.851 --> 00:42:55.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would remove obstacles
and level things out the best they could

00:42:55.823 --> 00:42:59.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so that those who followed
would have an easier journey.

00:42:59.693 --> 00:43:01.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, now, what have we learned?

00:43:01.528 --> 00:43:04.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What have we gleaned
from this series of scriptures?

00:43:04.064 --> 00:43:08.502 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, there was a highway,
a highway through the desert.

00:43:08.502 --> 00:43:12.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve also learned
that it was to be cleared of obstacles.

00:43:12.773 --> 00:43:14.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has a special name,

00:43:14.875 --> 00:43:16.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the Way of Holiness.”

00:43:16.877 --> 00:43:21.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And there were to be signposts
so that those who traveled the road

00:43:21.515 --> 00:43:25.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
wouldn’t get lost
and maybe stray onto some other road.

00:43:25.653 --> 00:43:27.655 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what was the goal?

00:43:27.655 --> 00:43:31.992 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why did Jehovah want this road
to be prepared so nicely?

00:43:31.992 --> 00:43:34.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To make it as easy as possible

00:43:34.795 --> 00:43:38.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Jews to leave Babylon

00:43:38.999 --> 00:43:43.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and go back to Israel
and reestablish pure worship.

00:43:44.538 --> 00:43:46.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did it work?

00:43:46.573 --> 00:43:49.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tens of thousands of men, women,

00:43:49.943 --> 00:43:54.081 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and children responded
to the call (the invitation)

00:43:54.081 --> 00:43:58.919 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and with Jehovah’s help,
they arrived safely at their destination.

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:02.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, you might be thinking:
‘This is all very nice.

00:44:02.723 --> 00:44:05.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘But what does it have to do with me?

00:44:05.392 --> 00:44:08.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does it have to do with us today?’

00:44:08.595 --> 00:44:10.597 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Plenty.

00:44:10.597 --> 00:44:13.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because today, not tens of thousands

00:44:13.367 --> 00:44:16.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but millions of men, women, and children

00:44:16.937 --> 00:44:19.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are responding to the command,

00:44:19.306 --> 00:44:22.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the urgent command to “get out of her,”

00:44:22.676 --> 00:44:25.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
get out of “Babylon the Great.”

00:44:25.112 --> 00:44:27.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the situation
is different from the situation

00:44:27.915 --> 00:44:31.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the Jews in ancient times
because they had a choice.

00:44:31.185 --> 00:44:34.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could remain
in Babylon and still serve Jehovah.

00:44:35.756 --> 00:44:38.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But people today have no choice.

00:44:38.392 --> 00:44:41.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They must leave Babylon the Great.

00:44:41.528 --> 00:44:45.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their life depends on it.

00:44:45.132 --> 00:44:48.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, without looking for a type and antitype,

00:44:48.168 --> 00:44:53.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
trying to fit everything
in very neatly in this arrangement,

00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:56.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we can say that there are some similarities

00:44:56.043 --> 00:44:58.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
between what happened
to the Jews in ancient times

00:44:58.979 --> 00:45:01.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what is happening today,

00:45:01.348 --> 00:45:05.853 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because in a sense, when you start
to study the Bible with someone,

00:45:05.853 --> 00:45:10.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are pointing him
in the direction of “the Way of Holiness.”

00:45:10.357 --> 00:45:12.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, some start studying,

00:45:12.459 --> 00:45:15.262 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they start traveling on the road,
and then they turn back.

00:45:15.262 --> 00:45:17.297 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But others keep going,

00:45:17.297 --> 00:45:22.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they become dedicated,
baptized disciples of Christ.

00:45:22.302 --> 00:45:25.372 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some travel in the fast lane.

00:45:25.372 --> 00:45:27.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They make rapid progress.

00:45:27.608 --> 00:45:30.411 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Others sort of take the far right lane,

00:45:30.411 --> 00:45:33.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they poke along,
but they keep making progress.

00:45:33.814 --> 00:45:38.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as long as they keep making progress,
we’ll study with them.

00:45:38.352 --> 00:45:42.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some break down,
and that calls for roadside assistance.

00:45:44.558 --> 00:45:48.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But it’s easier to travel
on “the Way of Holiness” today

00:45:48.996 --> 00:45:51.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than it ever has been.

00:45:51.198 --> 00:45:52.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, friends,

00:45:52.566 --> 00:45:57.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is partly due to the spiritual site work

00:45:57.571 --> 00:46:01.074 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was started centuries ago.

00:46:01.074 --> 00:46:03.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I’m going to repeat that.

00:46:03.143 --> 00:46:07.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is easier to travel
‘the highway of holiness’ today

00:46:07.147 --> 00:46:09.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because of the spiritual site work

00:46:09.983 --> 00:46:13.387 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was started hundreds of years ago,

00:46:13.387 --> 00:46:17.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
long before Babylon the Great fell,

00:46:17.024 --> 00:46:21.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
long before the road
was opened for travelers.

00:46:21.395 --> 00:46:25.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, picture this: It’s the 16th century.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With shovel in hand,

00:46:28.602 --> 00:46:33.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you are about to start site work
on “the Way of Holiness.”

00:46:33.106 --> 00:46:35.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There is a mountain ahead of you

00:46:35.676 --> 00:46:38.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—a mountain of ignorance.

00:46:38.679 --> 00:46:42.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you realize that if you
are going to start to level that mountain,

00:46:42.216 --> 00:46:45.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the first thing you’re
going to have to do is get the Bible

00:46:45.052 --> 00:46:47.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the hands of the people.

00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:49.957 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For years, the Bible was just only in Latin,

00:46:49.957 --> 00:46:53.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and only mostly educated people
could read it.

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And even some of the clergy
only knew enough Latin

00:46:56.363 --> 00:47:00.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to conduct church services;
but otherwise, they couldn’t understand it.

00:47:01.635 --> 00:47:05.138 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, if you’ve been to our beautiful museum

00:47:05.138 --> 00:47:07.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(some of you have taken a tour recently),

00:47:07.708 --> 00:47:12.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you know that translators
in many countries risked their freedom

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:17.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even their lives to put the Bible
into the language of the common people.

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:21.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And then printers
produced those translations.

00:47:21.021 --> 00:47:23.023 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And some of them used an assumed name,

00:47:23.023 --> 00:47:26.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because if they got caught printing a Bible,

00:47:26.326 --> 00:47:30.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could be arrested and even worse.

00:47:30.197 --> 00:47:33.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the mountain had to be leveled

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a shovelful at a time

00:47:35.669 --> 00:47:38.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one Bible at a time—

00:47:38.605 --> 00:47:43.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to reduce that mountain
on “the Way of Holiness.”

00:47:43.210 --> 00:47:45.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To get the Bible
into the hands of the people,

00:47:45.579 --> 00:47:47.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
William Tyndale

00:47:47.781 --> 00:47:50.717 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
arranged to have thousands of copies

00:47:50.717 --> 00:47:53.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of his translation smuggled into England

00:47:53.186 --> 00:47:55.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in bales of cotton and other goods.

00:47:55.923 --> 00:47:58.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was dangerous.

00:47:58.158 --> 00:48:01.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Tyndale’s translation was banned in England,

00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:04.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you merely possessed
a copy of the Bible,

00:48:04.064 --> 00:48:08.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that could bring you a stint
in the Tower of London or worse.

00:48:08.068 --> 00:48:12.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But despite desperate attempts
to stop work on “the Way of Holiness,”

00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:16.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more copies of Tyndale’s Bible were printed

00:48:16.310 --> 00:48:19.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
than the clergy could ever destroy.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:23.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the way, you’d be interested
in a comment that Tyndale made

00:48:23.383 --> 00:48:26.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his comments on the book of Genesis

00:48:26.253 --> 00:48:29.323 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the 1530 translation
of the book of Genesis).

00:48:29.323 --> 00:48:32.726 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He wrote: “Jehovah is God’s name.

00:48:32.726 --> 00:48:35.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Neither is any creature so called.

00:48:35.696 --> 00:48:39.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“As oft as thou
seist LORD in capital letters,

00:48:39.633 --> 00:48:42.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it is in Hebrew Jehovah.”

00:48:43.337 --> 00:48:48.342 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Early on, the name Jehovah
was given some recognition.

00:48:48.342 --> 00:48:52.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with the Bible becoming
more available to the people,

00:48:52.980 --> 00:48:55.649 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’d expect that students of the Bible
would want to share

00:48:55.649 --> 00:48:58.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
their research with others.

00:48:58.051 --> 00:49:00.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was the case.

00:49:00.053 --> 00:49:04.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the years leading up to 1919
when Babylon the Great fell,

00:49:04.024 --> 00:49:06.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
more roadwork was done.

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:10.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so we had men
who shared the fruitage of their research

00:49:10.530 --> 00:49:13.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in tracts, in books
—publications of all kinds—

00:49:13.867 --> 00:49:15.936 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because they wanted the people to know.

00:49:15.936 --> 00:49:19.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They wanted to reduce
that mountain of ignorance.

00:49:19.506 --> 00:49:20.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example,

00:49:20.674 --> 00:49:22.542 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about 1835,

00:49:22.542 --> 00:49:25.479 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
a Bible student by the name of Henry Grew

00:49:25.479 --> 00:49:27.481 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
wrote a pamphlet

00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:30.050 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the immortality of the soul.

00:49:30.050 --> 00:49:33.553 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in that pamphlet,
Grew explained from the Bible

00:49:33.553 --> 00:49:36.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that immortality
is a reward for faithfulness.

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not born with it.

00:49:38.892 --> 00:49:41.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, he published the tract anonymously

00:49:41.495 --> 00:49:43.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he knew there would be trouble.

00:49:43.897 --> 00:49:47.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And later on,
there was trouble for Henry Grew.

00:49:47.668 --> 00:49:49.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he publishes a tract.

00:49:49.703 --> 00:49:51.705 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
But two years later,

00:49:51.705 --> 00:49:54.141 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
another Bible student, George Storrs,

00:49:54.141 --> 00:49:56.376 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is riding in a train,

00:49:56.376 --> 00:50:01.114 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and he looks down and he sees a tract there,

00:50:01.114 --> 00:50:03.283 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it’s Henry Grew’s tract

00:50:03.283 --> 00:50:05.318 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the immortality of the soul.

00:50:05.318 --> 00:50:06.653 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
He reads it.

00:50:06.653 --> 00:50:08.455 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And he becomes convinced that man

00:50:08.455 --> 00:50:09.923 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t have an immortal soul.

00:50:09.923 --> 00:50:11.458 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So, what does he do?

00:50:11.458 --> 00:50:13.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He picks up a shovel,

00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:15.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he starts working on the road,

00:50:15.762 --> 00:50:18.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the road “the Way of Holiness.”

00:50:18.198 --> 00:50:21.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1842, he gave a series of lectures

00:50:21.735 --> 00:50:26.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on the intriguing theme
“Are the Wicked Immortal?”

00:50:26.273 --> 00:50:28.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he later published those lectures.

00:50:28.275 --> 00:50:31.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you know how many copies were produced?

00:50:31.078 --> 00:50:34.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Two hundred thousand copies

00:50:34.681 --> 00:50:37.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that series of lectures.

00:50:37.084 --> 00:50:41.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that was decent roadwork
on that “Way of Holiness.”

00:50:41.254 --> 00:50:45.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Storrs knew that he didn’t have
the whole truth on every subject.

00:50:45.292 --> 00:50:48.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And in 1847,
he made quite an interesting statement;

00:50:48.662 --> 00:50:50.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be interesting for us.

00:50:50.363 --> 00:50:52.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He says: “We . . . do well to remember

00:50:52.766 --> 00:50:57.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that we have just emerged
from the dark ages of the church;

00:50:57.137 --> 00:51:00.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and [notice this]
it would not be . . . strange

00:51:00.307 --> 00:51:04.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“if we should find some ‘Babylonish garments’

00:51:04.377 --> 00:51:07.147 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
still worn by us.”

00:51:07.147 --> 00:51:09.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, he was right.

00:51:09.716 --> 00:51:13.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Babylon still had influence in those days.

00:51:13.887 --> 00:51:16.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we know
that George Storrs had an influence

00:51:16.790 --> 00:51:19.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on Charles Taze Russell.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, what do we know
about Brother Russell and his associates?

00:51:24.364 --> 00:51:27.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They weren’t the first
to discover that the Trinity

00:51:27.134 --> 00:51:30.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the immortality of the soul
are false doctrines,

00:51:30.403 --> 00:51:34.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or even that Christ’s presence
would be invisible to the human eye.

00:51:34.608 --> 00:51:38.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They benefited
from the careful preparatory work

00:51:38.545 --> 00:51:42.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that other road workers had done in the past.

00:51:42.616 --> 00:51:45.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So translators, printers,

00:51:45.986 --> 00:51:50.423 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Bible students
were doing spiritual site work.

00:51:50.423 --> 00:51:53.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we might say
that Brother Russell and his associates

00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:57.931 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
put the final touches
on that “Way of Holiness.”

00:51:57.931 --> 00:52:02.335 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Babylon the Great fell in 1919,

00:52:02.335 --> 00:52:06.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then “the Way of Holiness”
was open for travelers.

00:52:06.973 --> 00:52:10.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But Brother Russell died in 1916.

00:52:11.545 --> 00:52:13.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he miss it?

00:52:13.747 --> 00:52:16.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did he miss the inauguration of the road?

00:52:17.484 --> 00:52:19.519 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think so.

00:52:19.519 --> 00:52:23.256 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He didn’t have a bird’s-eye view
of the opening of the road;

00:52:23.256 --> 00:52:26.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he had a heaven’s-eye view,

00:52:26.092 --> 00:52:29.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Brother Russell and his associates

00:52:29.563 --> 00:52:31.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who had finished their earthly course

00:52:31.631 --> 00:52:33.867 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were able to look down from the heavens.

00:52:33.867 --> 00:52:36.636 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And can you imagine how excited they were

00:52:36.636 --> 00:52:39.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when they saw the first travelers

00:52:39.039 --> 00:52:41.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
set foot on “the Way of Holiness”?

00:52:41.942 --> 00:52:45.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It must have been
very exciting for them indeed.

00:52:45.846 --> 00:52:50.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it wouldn’t be surprising
if Brother Russell and his associates

00:52:50.851 --> 00:52:55.856 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were firmly involved
in the maintenance program

00:52:55.856 --> 00:52:58.358 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of that “Way of Holiness” today,

00:52:58.358 --> 00:53:03.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because every good road
needs ongoing maintenance.

00:53:03.296 --> 00:53:05.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The Way of Holiness” is open,

00:53:05.298 --> 00:53:08.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but maintenance
on that “Way of Holiness” goes on.

00:53:08.768 --> 00:53:10.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what’s the goal?

00:53:10.770 --> 00:53:13.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s to make it as easy as possible

00:53:13.473 --> 00:53:16.476 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for people to identify Babylon the Great

00:53:16.476 --> 00:53:20.180 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to leave Babylon the Great
—that is the goal.

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:22.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, take the Bible, for example.

00:53:22.482 --> 00:53:25.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There were Bible translations in 1919,

00:53:25.685 --> 00:53:27.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but some of them were

00:53:27.754 --> 00:53:31.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in archaic language
that was hard to understand.

00:53:31.825 --> 00:53:36.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And most of them didn’t give the divine name
the place of honor that it deserved.

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:39.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now we have the <i>New World Translation</i>.

00:53:39.266 --> 00:53:41.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a blessing that has proved to be!

00:53:41.301 --> 00:53:46.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s so clear, and you don’t have
to mortgage the house to buy a copy,

00:53:46.206 --> 00:53:49.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which was probably
the case in the 16th century.

00:53:49.576 --> 00:53:51.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And since 1919,

00:53:51.811 --> 00:53:54.748 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there has been an abundance of spiritual food

00:53:54.748 --> 00:53:57.817 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make it easier
for people to come into the truth.

00:53:57.817 --> 00:54:00.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, just think of this:

00:54:00.153 --> 00:54:03.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1919, Babylon the Great fell.

00:54:03.089 --> 00:54:06.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what else happened in 1919?

00:54:06.293 --> 00:54:09.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What provision did Jehovah
make for these people?

00:54:09.729 --> 00:54:14.167 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The faithful and discreet slave”
was appointed in that same year.

00:54:14.167 --> 00:54:17.504 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the slave didn’t waste any time

00:54:17.504 --> 00:54:19.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to start producing literature

00:54:19.839 --> 00:54:23.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that was going to make it easier
for people to come into the truth.

00:54:23.376 --> 00:54:25.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 1919, the slave is appointed.

00:54:25.545 --> 00:54:30.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By 1921, you have a brand new publication, 

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:32.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Harp of God</i>.

00:54:32.452 --> 00:54:35.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it was especially designed for beginners

00:54:35.021 --> 00:54:39.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and to make it easy for people to study
and read and come into the truth.

00:54:39.059 --> 00:54:42.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was necessary because in 1921

00:54:42.228 --> 00:54:45.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was a shortage
of teachers, or publishers,

00:54:45.332 --> 00:54:47.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who could conduct Bible studies with people.

00:54:47.934 --> 00:54:50.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you really needed something simple.

00:54:50.937 --> 00:54:55.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And comparatively speaking,
that <i>Harp of God</i>  was simple.

00:54:55.809 --> 00:55:00.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, there were very few publishers
in those days, just a few thousand.

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:03.483 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But they were workers;
they did a tremendous job!

00:55:03.483 --> 00:55:07.988 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Do you realize that before <i>The Harp of God </i>
 went out of print,

00:55:07.988 --> 00:55:11.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
almost six million copies

00:55:11.491 --> 00:55:15.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 22 languages had been circulated?

00:55:15.095 --> 00:55:18.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this is evidence

00:55:18.098 --> 00:55:20.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maintenance work
on “the Way of Holiness”

00:55:20.767 --> 00:55:25.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had begun right after the road opened.

00:55:25.171 --> 00:55:28.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, I doubt that very many in this audience

00:55:28.775 --> 00:55:31.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have come into the truth
through <i>The Harp of God.</i>

00:55:31.444 --> 00:55:32.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anybody here?

00:55:32.946 --> 00:55:34.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I don’t think so.

00:55:35.415 --> 00:55:38.585 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What publication brought you into the truth?

00:55:38.585 --> 00:55:42.622 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What publication helped you
to identify “the Way of Holiness”?

00:55:42.622 --> 00:55:45.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Was it <i>“The Truth Shall Make You Free</i>,”

00:55:46.426 --> 00:55:48.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>“Let God Be True,</i>”

00:55:48.595 --> 00:55:51.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life,</i>

00:55:51.798 --> 00:55:54.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>You Can Live Forever,</i>

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:57.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the <i>Knowledge</i> book, <i>Enjoy Life Forever!,</i>

00:55:58.638 --> 00:56:01.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Teach Us</i> (<i>What Can the Bible Teach Us?</i> ),

00:56:01.408 --> 00:56:06.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is it our fine,
new publication <i>Enjoy Life Forever!?</i>

00:56:06.379 --> 00:56:08.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these publications

00:56:08.515 --> 00:56:12.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been used to help people
to break free from Babylon the Great.

00:56:12.252 --> 00:56:14.521 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this is proof positive

00:56:14.521 --> 00:56:19.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that maintenance
on “the Way of Holiness” is ongoing.

00:56:19.392 --> 00:56:24.431 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This roadwork continues,
and it gets better and better.

00:56:25.565 --> 00:56:29.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you studying the Bible with someone
with the help of <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i> ?

00:56:29.736 --> 00:56:34.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you are, you’re pointing
that person to “the Way of Holiness.”

00:56:34.441 --> 00:56:38.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So don’t be afraid to offer studies,

00:56:38.044 --> 00:56:40.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Brother Sanderson mentioned,

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:45.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to business associates, relatives,
schoolmates—anybody you can think of.

00:56:45.085 --> 00:56:47.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Offer Bible studies,
and you’ll be surprised

00:56:47.987 --> 00:56:50.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at who will take you up on it.

00:56:50.090 --> 00:56:52.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as you do, keep in mind

00:56:52.325 --> 00:56:55.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that while the road
has been made easier for travelers,

00:56:55.562 --> 00:56:59.265 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
setting foot on that road
takes courage and effort.

00:56:59.265 --> 00:57:03.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s be ready to help
those who are willing to respond.

00:57:04.337 --> 00:57:07.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Millions have already taken that road,

00:57:07.674 --> 00:57:10.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s our hope
that millions more will do so

00:57:10.443 --> 00:57:13.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the end of this system of things.

00:57:13.079 --> 00:57:16.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we wish them all safe travels.

00:57:24.224 --> 00:57:26.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we sincerely thank you, Brother Splane,

00:57:26.426 --> 00:57:30.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that fascinating discussion
about “the Way of Holiness.”

00:57:30.263 --> 00:57:34.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, I once had the opportunity
to go to an auction house

00:57:34.901 --> 00:57:37.270 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and actually hold in my hands

00:57:37.270 --> 00:57:40.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Tyndale Pentateuch of 1530

00:57:40.707 --> 00:57:43.676 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of which there are
only a very few known copies.

00:57:43.676 --> 00:57:48.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But sadly,
I didn’t have $650,000

00:57:48.515 --> 00:57:50.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in my wallet on that day

00:57:50.683 --> 00:57:53.319 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a house to mortgage,

00:57:53.319 --> 00:57:55.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we had to pass.

00:57:55.321 --> 00:57:59.225 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in our museum, we do have a facsimile.

00:57:59.225 --> 00:58:02.462 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And won’t it be a wonderful day
when we can reopen our museums

00:58:02.462 --> 00:58:04.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to tours for all of our brothers outside

00:58:04.864 --> 00:58:07.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’ll be able to come back
and see those wonderful things?

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.969 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Thank you so much, Brother Splane.

00:58:09.969 --> 00:58:13.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now we have the pleasure to hear
from another member of our Governing Body,

00:58:13.773 --> 00:58:15.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brother Geoffrey Jackson.

00:58:15.775 --> 00:58:18.478 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He has a very intriguing theme:

00:58:18.478 --> 00:58:20.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You There?”

00:58:22.916 --> 00:58:24.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you there?

00:58:24.918 --> 00:58:27.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your name there?

00:58:27.287 --> 00:58:31.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your name “written in the book of life”?

00:58:31.424 --> 00:58:33.426 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What “book of life”?

00:58:33.426 --> 00:58:35.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, in Malachi chapter 3,

00:58:35.962 --> 00:58:40.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we notice that it refers
to “a book of remembrance.”

00:58:40.633 --> 00:58:44.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And this book has a record of all those

00:58:44.404 --> 00:58:48.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘who fear Jehovah and treasure his name.’

00:58:48.942 --> 00:58:52.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, this “book of remembrance”
is a record of all those

00:58:52.979 --> 00:58:56.382 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are in line to receive everlasting life.

00:58:56.382 --> 00:59:01.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of us want to have our names
written in that book, don’t we?

00:59:02.188 --> 00:59:06.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if we do have our name in that book,

00:59:06.559 --> 00:59:11.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
does that mean that we
automatically will receive everlasting life?

00:59:11.564 --> 00:59:13.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

00:59:13.132 --> 00:59:15.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We remember what Jehovah said to Moses,

00:59:15.602 --> 00:59:18.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as recorded in Exodus chapter 32.

00:59:18.371 --> 00:59:21.941 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There he said: ‘Anyone who sins against me,

00:59:21.941 --> 00:59:25.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I will wipe out from my book.’

00:59:25.178 --> 00:59:28.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So names can be erased

00:59:28.181 --> 00:59:30.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from this book of life.

00:59:30.850 --> 00:59:34.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s as if our names are written
in this book of life

00:59:34.153 --> 00:59:36.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in pencil.

00:59:36.322 --> 00:59:39.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So all of us surely want to make sure

00:59:39.359 --> 00:59:42.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that our names remain in this book of life

00:59:42.595 --> 00:59:46.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
right through to the time
that they are written permanently in the book

00:59:46.966 --> 00:59:49.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in pen, as it were.

00:59:49.769 --> 00:59:54.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whose names are in this book of life?

00:59:54.107 --> 00:59:59.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re going to consider together
five different groups of persons,

00:59:59.112 --> 01:00:04.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of whom have their names
in the book of life and others who don’t.

01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:08.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So let’s watch this presentation
that discusses these five groups.

01:00:18.298 --> 01:00:20.300 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The first group:

01:00:20.300 --> 01:00:24.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have been selected
to rule with Jesus in heaven.

01:00:24.570 --> 01:00:28.107 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are their names written in this book of life?

01:00:28.107 --> 01:00:31.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
According to Philippians 4:3,

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:33.913 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the answer is yes.

01:00:33.913 --> 01:00:37.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But even though they’ve been anointed
with holy spirit,

01:00:37.617 --> 01:00:40.186 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they still need to remain faithful

01:00:40.186 --> 01:00:44.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to have their names
written permanently in this book.

01:00:44.991 --> 01:00:46.826 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The second group:

01:00:46.826 --> 01:00:50.163 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great crowd of Armageddon survivors.

01:00:50.163 --> 01:00:54.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are the names of these faithful ones
now written in the book of life?

01:00:54.934 --> 01:00:57.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:00:59.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What about after they survive Armageddon?

01:00:59.806 --> 01:01:02.742 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will their names still be
in the book of life?

01:01:02.742 --> 01:01:04.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:01:04.110 --> 01:01:06.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do we know?

01:01:06.112 --> 01:01:10.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 25:46, Jesus says

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:12.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that these sheeplike ones depart

01:01:12.285 --> 01:01:15.488 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“into everlasting life.”

01:01:15.488 --> 01:01:18.691 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But does that mean they are granted
everlasting life

01:01:18.691 --> 01:01:21.361 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the beginning of the Thousand Year Reign?

01:01:21.361 --> 01:01:22.929 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 7:17 tells us

01:01:25.998 --> 01:01:30.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus “will guide them
to springs of waters of life.”

01:01:31.571 --> 01:01:35.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they don’t immediately receive
everlasting life.

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:38.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, their names are written
in the book of life

01:01:38.544 --> 01:01:41.247 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in pencil, as it were.

01:01:41.247 --> 01:01:42.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The third group:

01:01:42.849 --> 01:01:46.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the goats who will be destroyed
at Armageddon.

01:01:46.819 --> 01:01:50.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their names are not in the book of life.

01:01:50.823 --> 01:01:54.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
2 Thessalonians 1:9 tells us:

01:01:54.227 --> 01:01:58.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These very ones will undergo
the judicial punishment

01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:02.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of everlasting destruction.”

01:02:02.168 --> 01:02:04.303 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same could be said of those

01:02:04.303 --> 01:02:07.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who have deliberately sinned
against the holy spirit.

01:02:07.874 --> 01:02:11.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They too receive everlasting destruction,

01:02:11.811 --> 01:02:15.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not everlasting life.

01:02:15.047 --> 01:02:17.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the first three groups are

01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:19.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the anointed,

01:02:19.051 --> 01:02:20.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the great crowd,

01:02:20.620 --> 01:02:22.422 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the goats.

01:02:22.422 --> 01:02:24.123 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Of these three,

01:02:24.123 --> 01:02:26.793 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only two are found in the book of life.

01:02:27.693 --> 01:02:30.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s talk about two more groups:

01:02:30.696 --> 01:02:32.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who will be resurrected

01:02:32.965 --> 01:02:35.334 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the new world.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:37.603 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, though, let’s read together

01:02:37.603 --> 01:02:40.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Acts 24:15.

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:42.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There the apostle Paul says:

01:02:42.909 --> 01:02:45.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I have hope toward God,

01:02:45.111 --> 01:02:48.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“which hope these men also look forward to,

01:02:48.214 --> 01:02:50.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“that there is going to be a resurrection

01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:52.852 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“of both the righteous

01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:55.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the unrighteous.”

01:02:56.689 --> 01:03:00.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the fourth group are
the righteous who have died.

01:03:00.526 --> 01:03:03.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These include some of our loved ones.

01:03:03.463 --> 01:03:06.199 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are their names written in the book of life?

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:08.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:03:08.301 --> 01:03:11.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Revelation 17:8 tells us

01:03:11.170 --> 01:03:15.942 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this book has been in existence
since “the founding of the world.”

01:03:15.942 --> 01:03:20.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus referred to Abel as living
“from the founding of the world,”

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.882 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so we can assume that his name

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:26.052 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was the first name written in that book.

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:29.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since that time,
millions of other righteous ones

01:03:29.822 --> 01:03:33.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have had their names added to this book.

01:03:33.326 --> 01:03:36.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, here’s an important question:

01:03:36.329 --> 01:03:39.432 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When these righteous ones died,

01:03:39.432 --> 01:03:42.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were their names
taken out of the book of life?

01:03:42.602 --> 01:03:44.203 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:03:44.203 --> 01:03:47.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re still living in Jehovah’s memory.

01:03:47.206 --> 01:03:49.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, Jesus said that Jehovah

01:03:49.842 --> 01:03:53.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“is a God, not of the dead,
but of the living,

01:03:53.312 --> 01:03:56.082 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for they are all living to him.”

01:03:56.082 --> 01:03:59.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The righteous will be restored to life
here on earth

01:03:59.385 --> 01:04:03.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with their names still written
in the book of life.

01:04:03.723 --> 01:04:06.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did good things before they died.

01:04:06.659 --> 01:04:08.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that is why they will be part

01:04:08.995 --> 01:04:13.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the resurrection of the righteous ones.

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:16.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt some of them
will receive privileges,

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:20.339 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such as serving
“as princes in all the earth.”

01:04:20.339 --> 01:04:25.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, let’s talk about the resurrection
of “the unrighteous.”

01:04:25.344 --> 01:04:29.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For the most part, the unrighteous
didn’t have an opportunity

01:04:29.749 --> 01:04:32.785 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to develop a relationship with Jehovah.

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:35.621 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They did not live righteous lives.

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:39.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that’s why they are called unrighteous.

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:42.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When these unrighteous ones are resurrected,

01:04:42.795 --> 01:04:45.865 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are their names written in the book of life?

01:04:45.865 --> 01:04:47.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:04:47.533 --> 01:04:51.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But their being resurrected
gives them an opportunity

01:04:51.237 --> 01:04:56.242 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to have their names eventually written
in the book of life.

01:04:56.242 --> 01:05:00.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These unrighteous ones
will need a lot of help.

01:05:00.813 --> 01:05:03.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In their former life, some of them practiced

01:05:03.616 --> 01:05:06.485 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
horrible, vile things.

01:05:06.485 --> 01:05:10.690 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they’ll need to learn
to live by Jehovah’s standards.

01:05:10.690 --> 01:05:12.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To accomplish this,

01:05:12.792 --> 01:05:17.797 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Kingdom will sponsor
the greatest educational program

01:05:17.797 --> 01:05:20.132 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in all human history.

01:05:21.734 --> 01:05:25.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Who will teach these unrighteous persons?

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:28.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who have their names written
in pencil in the book of life

01:05:28.441 --> 01:05:33.446 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the great crowd
and the resurrected righteous ones.

01:05:33.446 --> 01:05:36.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How can these unrighteous ones

01:05:36.048 --> 01:05:38.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have their names written in the book of life?

01:05:40.252 --> 01:05:42.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will need to develop
a relationship with Jehovah

01:05:42.989 --> 01:05:46.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and dedicate their lives to him.

01:05:46.425 --> 01:05:50.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But will all the unrighteous
accept that opportunity?

01:05:50.463 --> 01:05:52.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:05:52.064 --> 01:05:55.067 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, all these unrighteous ones

01:05:55.067 --> 01:05:57.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be under the careful watch of Jesus

01:05:57.903 --> 01:06:00.272 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and his fellow judges.

01:06:00.272 --> 01:06:03.042 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isaiah 65:20 tells us

01:06:03.042 --> 01:06:05.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that those who refuse to accept this help

01:06:05.344 --> 01:06:08.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be removed.

01:06:08.114 --> 01:06:12.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one will be allowed to cause
any ruin in the new world.

01:06:12.652 --> 01:06:17.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So any who display a wicked attitude
during the thousand years

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:19.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be removed.

01:06:19.659 --> 01:06:24.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With all these facts in mind then,
let’s now read together

01:06:24.263 --> 01:06:27.033 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
John 5:28, 29.

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:32.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said: “Do not be amazed at this,

01:06:32.638 --> 01:06:36.809 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“for the hour is coming
in which all those in the memorial tombs

01:06:36.809 --> 01:06:39.979 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will hear his voice and come out,

01:06:39.979 --> 01:06:42.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“those who did good things

01:06:42.181 --> 01:06:44.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“to a resurrection of life,

01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:47.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and those who practiced vile things

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:50.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to a resurrection of judgment.”

01:06:52.425 --> 01:06:56.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, for a few moments,
let’s think about those verses

01:06:56.362 --> 01:07:00.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 5:28, 29.

01:07:00.066 --> 01:07:04.804 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Up to now, we have understood
Jesus’ words to mean

01:07:04.804 --> 01:07:09.375 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the resurrected ones
will do “good things”

01:07:09.375 --> 01:07:14.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that some will do “vile things”
after their resurrection.

01:07:14.246 --> 01:07:17.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice there in verse 29,
Jesus didn’t say

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:21.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they <i>will</i>  do these good things

01:07:21.587 --> 01:07:24.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or they <i>will</i>  practice vile things.

01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:26.892 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He used the past tense, didn’t he?

01:07:26.892 --> 01:07:30.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because he said that they “did good things”

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:33.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that they “practiced vile things.”

01:07:33.099 --> 01:07:37.737 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this would indicate to us
that these deeds, or actions,

01:07:37.737 --> 01:07:40.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were committed by these ones

01:07:40.506 --> 01:07:43.109 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
prior to their death

01:07:43.109 --> 01:07:46.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and before they would be resurrected.

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:48.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that makes sense
—doesn’t it?—

01:07:48.681 --> 01:07:53.419 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because no one is going to be allowed
to practice vile things in the new world.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:57.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what did Jesus mean when he mentioned

01:07:57.356 --> 01:08:00.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
these two factors?

01:08:00.192 --> 01:08:02.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, for a start, we could say

01:08:02.194 --> 01:08:07.166 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the righteous ones still
—when they’re resurrected—

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:11.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have their names written in the book of life.

01:08:11.237 --> 01:08:16.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that Romans 6:7 says
that when someone dies,

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:18.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
his sins are canceled

01:08:18.177 --> 01:08:23.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but (take note of this)
not their record of faithfulness.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:24.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not canceled.

01:08:24.984 --> 01:08:29.889 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the righteous ones are resurrected
into the new world,

01:08:29.889 --> 01:08:34.026 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their names are still
in the book of life.

01:08:34.026 --> 01:08:37.730 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, they need to remain faithful
during the thousand years

01:08:37.730 --> 01:08:40.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep their names in that book of life.

01:08:40.933 --> 01:08:43.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the unrighteous ones?

01:08:43.569 --> 01:08:46.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, these are the ones who did vile things

01:08:46.472 --> 01:08:48.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they died.

01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:51.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So when they are resurrected,

01:08:51.043 --> 01:08:53.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they don’t have their names
in the book of life.

01:08:53.946 --> 01:08:55.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not a resurrection to life;

01:08:55.948 --> 01:09:00.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s a resurrection to judgment.

01:09:00.019 --> 01:09:02.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, why do we say that?

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:07.560 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because there we could say
that the word “judgment”

01:09:07.560 --> 01:09:11.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is not referring to a condemnation.

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:15.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s not referring to something
that is totally negative.

01:09:15.367 --> 01:09:19.705 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s true that at times the word “judgment”
can have that meaning.

01:09:19.705 --> 01:09:22.808 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in the context of these verses,

01:09:22.808 --> 01:09:26.212 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems that Jesus
is using the word “judgment”

01:09:26.212 --> 01:09:29.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a more neutral sense.

01:09:29.348 --> 01:09:32.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So it means more of an evaluation

01:09:32.451 --> 01:09:35.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or a probation period.

01:09:35.554 --> 01:09:38.490 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the unrighteous ones

01:09:38.490 --> 01:09:43.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have an opportunity to accept
this wonderful educational work

01:09:43.329 --> 01:09:45.898 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s going to be done in the new world.

01:09:45.898 --> 01:09:50.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during that time, they will be evaluated.

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:53.672 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And if they dedicate their lives to Jehovah,

01:09:53.672 --> 01:09:58.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
then their names will be written
into the book of life.

01:09:58.544 --> 01:10:01.413 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now at this point, you’re probably thinking,

01:10:01.413 --> 01:10:06.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Hmm, is this an adjustment
to our understanding?’

01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:08.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, it is.

01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:12.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now you’re thinking,
‘Now, can you just run that past me again?’

01:10:14.026 --> 01:10:17.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, let’s look at this little summary
that will help us.

01:10:18.464 --> 01:10:21.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When Jesus spoke at John 5:29

01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:26.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those who would receive
a resurrection of life,

01:10:26.071 --> 01:10:29.875 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he was referring to those
who did good things

01:10:29.875 --> 01:10:31.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they died

01:10:31.911 --> 01:10:36.348 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—those whose names are written
in the book of life.

01:10:36.348 --> 01:10:38.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The resurrection of judgment

01:10:38.584 --> 01:10:40.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at John 5:29

01:10:40.753 --> 01:10:42.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
involves the resurrection of those

01:10:42.788 --> 01:10:44.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who practice vile things

01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:46.825 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before they die

01:10:46.825 --> 01:10:49.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whose names are not yet written

01:10:49.628 --> 01:10:52.264 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of life.

01:10:52.264 --> 01:10:55.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But whether previously righteous
or unrighteous,

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:58.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all these resurrected ones will need to obey

01:10:58.871 --> 01:11:00.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the laws in the new scrolls

01:11:00.873 --> 01:11:03.642 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
referred to at Revelation 20:12.

01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:07.646 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says: “I saw the dead,

01:11:07.646 --> 01:11:11.050 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the great and the small,
standing before the throne,

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:13.252 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and scrolls were opened.

01:11:13.252 --> 01:11:15.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“But another scroll was opened;

01:11:15.587 --> 01:11:18.157 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“it is the scroll of life.

01:11:18.157 --> 01:11:22.027 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The dead were judged out of those things
written in the scrolls

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:25.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
according to their deeds.”

01:11:25.564 --> 01:11:29.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, they will be judged individually

01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:31.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“according to their deeds.”

01:11:31.837 --> 01:11:33.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what deeds?

01:11:34.473 --> 01:11:37.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will it be their deeds committed
before they die?

01:11:37.609 --> 01:11:39.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No.

01:11:39.011 --> 01:11:41.981 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Otherwise, the resurrection
of the unrighteous

01:11:41.981 --> 01:11:44.683 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would have been a pointless waste.

01:11:44.683 --> 01:11:49.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, then, their deeds
cannot be deeds from their former life.

01:11:49.688 --> 01:11:53.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Rather, this verse must refer to their deeds

01:11:53.525 --> 01:11:58.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in response to their training
in the new world.

01:11:58.030 --> 01:12:02.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even such faithful men
as Noah, Samuel, David, and Daniel

01:12:02.735 --> 01:12:05.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have to learn
about the sacrifice of Christ

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:07.940 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and exercise faith in it.

01:12:08.974 --> 01:12:12.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of this also helps us to understand

01:12:12.578 --> 01:12:16.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an amazing prophecy in the book of Daniel.

01:12:16.148 --> 01:12:18.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s turn there.

01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:21.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s Daniel 12:1-3.

01:12:22.955 --> 01:12:25.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There it says: “During that time

01:12:25.924 --> 01:12:28.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Michael [who is Jesus Christ]

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:32.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will stand up [that is, at Armageddon],

01:12:32.331 --> 01:12:35.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“the great prince who is standing

01:12:35.701 --> 01:12:37.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[since 1914]

01:12:37.903 --> 01:12:40.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in behalf of your people.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:43.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And there will occur a time of distress

01:12:43.509 --> 01:12:45.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“[that is, the great tribulation]

01:12:45.677 --> 01:12:47.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“such as has not occurred

01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:51.450 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“since there came to be a nation
until that time.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:55.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And during that time
your people will escape,

01:12:55.554 --> 01:12:59.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“everyone who is found
written down in the book

01:12:59.258 --> 01:13:02.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
[and this refers to the great crowd].”

01:13:02.394 --> 01:13:06.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But notice what follows:

01:13:06.398 --> 01:13:10.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And many of those asleep
in the dust of the earth will wake up,

01:13:10.569 --> 01:13:13.338 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“some to everlasting life

01:13:13.338 --> 01:13:18.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others to reproach
and to everlasting contempt.”

01:13:20.112 --> 01:13:23.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So looking at Daniel 12:2,

01:13:23.849 --> 01:13:26.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it seems appropriate, too, that we adjust

01:13:26.452 --> 01:13:29.354 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
our understanding of this verse.

01:13:29.354 --> 01:13:32.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice that there it speaks
about people waking up

01:13:32.658 --> 01:13:34.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the form of a resurrection,

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.696 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and this occurs
after what’s mentioned in verse 1

01:13:37.696 --> 01:13:42.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—after the great crowd survives
the great tribulation.

01:13:42.101 --> 01:13:47.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So this obviously is talking
about a literal resurrection

01:13:47.106 --> 01:13:50.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the righteous and unrighteous.

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:54.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what does it mean
when it mentions there, in verse 2,

01:13:54.179 --> 01:13:58.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that some will be raised to everlasting life

01:13:58.784 --> 01:14:02.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and others to everlasting contempt?

01:14:02.754 --> 01:14:05.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What does that really mean?

01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:09.261 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, when we notice that,
we notice that this is a little different

01:14:09.261 --> 01:14:13.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
from what Jesus said in John chapter 5
when he spoke about life and judgment.

01:14:13.532 --> 01:14:17.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But now, here he is talking
about <i>everlasting</i>  life

01:14:17.903 --> 01:14:21.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and <i>everlasting</i>  contempt.

01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:24.710 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So that term “everlasting”
helps us to realize

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:29.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that this is talking about the final outcome,

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:32.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after these ones have had an opportunity

01:14:32.618 --> 01:14:34.753 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to accept the education.

01:14:34.753 --> 01:14:38.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So those who are resurrected
who make good use

01:14:38.056 --> 01:14:40.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of this education,

01:14:40.492 --> 01:14:43.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
well, they will continue on
and ultimately receive

01:14:43.862 --> 01:14:46.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
everlasting life.

01:14:46.131 --> 01:14:49.768 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But then on the other hand,
any who refuse to accept

01:14:49.768 --> 01:14:52.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the benefits of that education

01:14:52.304 --> 01:14:56.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will be judged
as worthy of eternal destruction.

01:14:56.775 --> 01:15:00.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now let’s finally read verse 3:

01:15:02.014 --> 01:15:04.216 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And those having insight

01:15:04.216 --> 01:15:07.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“will shine as brightly
as the expanse of heaven,

01:15:07.953 --> 01:15:10.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and those bringing the many to righteousness

01:15:10.689 --> 01:15:13.759 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
like the stars, forever and ever.”

01:15:15.027 --> 01:15:18.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is speaking
about the massive educational work

01:15:18.463 --> 01:15:21.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will be done in the new world.

01:15:21.366 --> 01:15:24.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The glorified anointed ones
will shine brightly

01:15:24.970 --> 01:15:29.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they work closely with Jesus
to direct the education work

01:15:29.041 --> 01:15:32.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that will bring the many to righteousness.

01:15:32.744 --> 01:15:35.948 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a joy it will be for them to take part

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:39.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this amazing work
in their role as priests.

01:15:39.851 --> 01:15:43.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will assist
with “the healing of the nations.”

01:15:43.522 --> 01:15:47.392 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a privilege it will be
to see obedient humans

01:15:47.392 --> 01:15:52.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
become free from the burden of sin and death
and gain perfection!

01:15:58.670 --> 01:16:02.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we have to realize
that at that time on earth,

01:16:02.774 --> 01:16:05.978 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there won’t be
just the resurrected ones, will there?

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:08.213 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There will be the survivors of Armageddon

01:16:08.213 --> 01:16:11.783 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and any children that are born
in the new world.

01:16:11.783 --> 01:16:16.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These ones will ultimately attain
to perfection.

01:16:16.788 --> 01:16:19.725 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So is that when they get their names written,

01:16:19.725 --> 01:16:22.127 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as it were, in ink in the book?

01:16:22.127 --> 01:16:24.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Not quite yet.

01:16:24.930 --> 01:16:26.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why not?

01:16:26.398 --> 01:16:30.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, because perfection
doesn’t automatically mean

01:16:30.369 --> 01:16:32.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that someone would get everlasting life.

01:16:32.671 --> 01:16:35.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember the case of Adam and Eve:
They were perfect.

01:16:35.907 --> 01:16:38.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before they could attain
to everlasting life,

01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:42.281 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they had to prove their obedience to Jehovah.

01:16:42.281 --> 01:16:43.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes.

01:16:43.415 --> 01:16:45.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So we realize, then,

01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:48.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that in the case of Adam and Eve,
they failed.

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.123 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So questions are raised

01:16:51.123 --> 01:16:54.860 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with regard to all these perfect ones
on the earth at that time

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
(the resurrected ones,
the survivors of the great tribulation,

01:16:58.563 --> 01:17:01.433 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as any children
that will have been born):

01:17:01.433 --> 01:17:04.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they stand faithful?

01:17:04.736 --> 01:17:08.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Will they continue to support
Jehovah’s sovereignty?

01:17:08.807 --> 01:17:11.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Or will some of them be like Adam and Eve

01:17:11.977 --> 01:17:15.714 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—be perfect but then unfaithful?

01:17:15.714 --> 01:17:18.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the book of Revelation
helps us to understand

01:17:18.950 --> 01:17:23.955 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that to answer that question
Satan is released from the symbolic prison,

01:17:23.955 --> 01:17:25.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he has an opportunity

01:17:25.991 --> 01:17:29.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to test the integrity of Jehovah’s servants.

01:17:29.428 --> 01:17:31.763 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So each person on earth

01:17:31.763 --> 01:17:34.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will have a personal opportunity

01:17:34.766 --> 01:17:39.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to show where they stand
on the issue of universal sovereignty.

01:17:39.304 --> 01:17:42.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And their individual response

01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:46.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will show whether or not their names
should be written permanently

01:17:46.011 --> 01:17:48.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of life.

01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:51.583 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some, an unspecified number,

01:17:51.583 --> 01:17:55.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will turn their backs on Jehovah
and will not support his sovereignty.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What will happen to those ones?

01:17:57.322 --> 01:18:00.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, Revelation 20:15 tells us, doesn’t it?

01:18:00.692 --> 01:18:05.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Anyone who isn’t “found written
in the book of life”

01:18:05.097 --> 01:18:08.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will receive everlasting destruction.

01:18:08.734 --> 01:18:11.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But this is the good news:

01:18:11.002 --> 01:18:14.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The majority of perfect mankind

01:18:14.072 --> 01:18:18.110 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will find themselves passing the final test.

01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:21.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, and their names
will be written permanently

01:18:21.813 --> 01:18:23.815 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the book of life.

01:18:23.815 --> 01:18:26.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Isn’t it exciting to think

01:18:26.051 --> 01:18:28.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what’s going to happen in the future?

01:18:28.887 --> 01:18:32.724 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, now is the time
that Jehovah is preparing his people

01:18:32.724 --> 01:18:35.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for this massive educational work

01:18:35.427 --> 01:18:38.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is going to take place in the new world.

01:18:38.697 --> 01:18:42.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So now is the time for each one of us
to think about that question:

01:18:42.901 --> 01:18:44.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Are you there?

01:18:44.903 --> 01:18:48.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is your name in the book of life?

01:18:48.173 --> 01:18:51.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yes, may your name be found written

01:18:51.410 --> 01:18:53.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Jehovah’s book of life,

01:18:53.412 --> 01:18:56.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and may it remain there forever!

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we sincerely thank you,
Brother Jackson,

01:19:05.624 --> 01:19:08.460 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that very upbuilding
and strengthening talk.

01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have to say that when the Governing Body

01:19:11.563 --> 01:19:14.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
discussed that information,

01:19:14.299 --> 01:19:19.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of us felt that it was so heartwarming

01:19:19.304 --> 01:19:22.774 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to think of the time
when the anointed will really be able

01:19:22.774 --> 01:19:27.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to work with people on the earth
and help them come to perfection.

01:19:27.078 --> 01:19:30.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a wonderful, wonderful moment
that will be!

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:33.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, now we’re primed

01:19:33.018 --> 01:19:35.754 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for an interesting discussion presented

01:19:35.754 --> 01:19:38.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by another member of the Governing Body,
Brother Kenneth Cook.

01:19:38.924 --> 01:19:40.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
His theme is

01:19:40.926 --> 01:19:43.328 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Are You Heeding the Warnings?”

01:19:46.164 --> 01:19:51.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We live in a time
that will end in final judgment

01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:53.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by means of God’s Kingdom.

01:19:53.305 --> 01:19:55.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus described this time

01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:58.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he gave his disciples a prophetic sign

01:19:58.510 --> 01:20:00.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regarding his invisible presence

01:20:00.712 --> 01:20:03.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at “the conclusion of the system of things.”

01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:07.185 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since his prophecy applies to our day,

01:20:07.185 --> 01:20:11.556 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should be very interested in its details.

01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:14.292 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It also points to a bright future

01:20:14.292 --> 01:20:17.195 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who heed its warnings.

01:20:17.195 --> 01:20:19.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the prophecy

01:20:19.197 --> 01:20:22.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Matthew chapters 24 and 25,

01:20:22.367 --> 01:20:24.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mark chapter 13,

01:20:24.402 --> 01:20:27.205 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Luke chapter 21.

01:20:27.205 --> 01:20:29.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After revealing many of the things

01:20:29.574 --> 01:20:32.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would occur, Jesus provided warnings

01:20:32.544 --> 01:20:36.014 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for his disciples by means of three parables.

01:20:36.648 --> 01:20:40.886 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, he gave the parable of the virgins,

01:20:40.886 --> 01:20:44.155 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
then the parable of the talents,

01:20:44.155 --> 01:20:46.591 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and finally the parable

01:20:46.591 --> 01:20:49.594 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the sheep and the goats.

01:20:49.594 --> 01:20:52.964 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The parables show how a person’s behavior

01:20:52.964 --> 01:20:56.501 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
will affect his or her final judgment.

01:20:56.501 --> 01:20:59.371 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The two parables apply to those

01:20:59.371 --> 01:21:02.040 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
(the first two) with the heavenly hope,

01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:04.376 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and the third parable applies

01:21:04.376 --> 01:21:07.045 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to those with an earthly hope.

01:21:07.045 --> 01:21:10.081 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Yet no matter what our hope may be,

01:21:10.081 --> 01:21:12.717 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
all of us can learn from the warnings

01:21:12.717 --> 01:21:15.120 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
found in Jesus’ parables.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.023 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Let’s start with the third parable.

01:21:19.057 --> 01:21:22.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the parable of the sheep and the goats,

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:24.963 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus described the final judgment

01:21:24.963 --> 01:21:27.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for sheeplike ones and goatlike ones

01:21:27.299 --> 01:21:29.534 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during the great tribulation.

01:21:29.534 --> 01:21:32.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As Jehovah’s appointed Judge and King,

01:21:32.437 --> 01:21:35.040 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will be completely righteous

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:37.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the judgment that he gives.

01:21:37.542 --> 01:21:39.744 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a thorough Judge,

01:21:39.744 --> 01:21:43.481 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he is already observing
the actions, attitudes,

01:21:43.481 --> 01:21:45.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and speech of all people,

01:21:45.684 --> 01:21:50.689 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including how they treat
his anointed brothers.

01:21:50.689 --> 01:21:53.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By the start of the great tribulation,

01:21:53.258 --> 01:21:55.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus will have identified those

01:21:55.727 --> 01:22:00.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are sheeplike or goatlike
in their conduct and attitude.

01:22:00.231 --> 01:22:02.233 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From that time onward,

01:22:02.233 --> 01:22:05.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those who are goatlike
will not seek to change.

01:22:05.670 --> 01:22:08.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, those who are sheeplike

01:22:08.073 --> 01:22:11.576 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and who have the hope
of living forever on earth

01:22:11.576 --> 01:22:15.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will need to remain faithful
in order for Jehovah

01:22:15.013 --> 01:22:19.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep their names “in the book of life.”

01:22:19.484 --> 01:22:22.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Then, just before Armageddon,

01:22:22.053 --> 01:22:24.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
God’s Son will pass final judgment

01:22:24.723 --> 01:22:27.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on all of those then living here on earth.

01:22:27.859 --> 01:22:30.428 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Persons who are judged to be righteous

01:22:30.428 --> 01:22:34.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will enter into everlasting life on earth.

01:22:34.099 --> 01:22:36.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a marvelous reward

01:22:36.101 --> 01:22:39.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those who keep their integrity!

01:22:39.604 --> 01:22:41.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Jesus’ third parable

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:44.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
applies to those
who hope to live on the earth,

01:22:44.175 --> 01:22:46.578 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anointed ones too must listen

01:22:46.578 --> 01:22:49.447 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the warning message found in that parable.

01:22:49.447 --> 01:22:51.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

01:22:51.616 --> 01:22:54.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because Jesus is observing their actions,

01:22:54.986 --> 01:22:57.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attitudes, and speech as well.

01:22:57.489 --> 01:23:02.193 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They too must prove
to be righteous and faithful.

01:23:02.193 --> 01:23:05.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Still, a few questions remain.

01:23:05.697 --> 01:23:08.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, how are anointed Christians

01:23:08.266 --> 01:23:11.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
undergoing a period of judgment today?

01:23:11.202 --> 01:23:15.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what warnings did Jesus provide for them?

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.842 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We find the answers to both questions

01:23:17.842 --> 01:23:22.847 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the first two parables
of Matthew chapter 25.

01:23:22.847 --> 01:23:25.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To prepare us for this review,

01:23:25.517 --> 01:23:30.321 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
let’s briefly consider
how anointed Christians are chosen.

01:23:30.321 --> 01:23:35.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll start by looking
at a lesson from ancient times.

01:23:35.326 --> 01:23:39.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the priesthood
was established in ancient Israel,

01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:42.701 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah decided
who would serve as high priest

01:23:42.701 --> 01:23:46.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as the underpriests
at the tabernacle.

01:23:46.304 --> 01:23:48.506 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Exodus 28:1 tells us

01:23:48.506 --> 01:23:52.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he selected
“Aaron, along with his sons.”

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:56.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No one could rightly question
Jehovah’s choice,

01:23:56.648 --> 01:24:01.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and those chosen
had to prove worthy of their calling.

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:04.055 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Similar to what he did back then,

01:24:04.055 --> 01:24:08.526 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah chooses those
who will serve as priests in heaven.

01:24:08.526 --> 01:24:11.830 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He began by selecting Jesus

01:24:11.830 --> 01:24:14.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to serve as High Priest.

01:24:14.032 --> 01:24:17.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although Jesus was a perfect man,

01:24:17.001 --> 01:24:20.472 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he did not choose that role for himself.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:24.008 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We read at Hebrews 5:5

01:24:24.008 --> 01:24:27.312 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that “the Christ did not glorify himself

01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:30.381 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
by becoming a high priest.”

01:24:30.381 --> 01:24:34.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, those who will serve
as priests in heaven

01:24:34.652 --> 01:24:38.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not choose themselves for this assignment.

01:24:38.289 --> 01:24:40.658 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They are selected by Jehovah

01:24:40.658 --> 01:24:43.728 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and anointed with his holy spirit.

01:24:43.728 --> 01:24:48.266 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows each one
whom he has anointed for this service.

01:24:48.266 --> 01:24:52.403 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How do faithful anointed ones
view their heavenly calling?

01:24:53.972 --> 01:24:57.108 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When a person is anointed by God,

01:24:57.108 --> 01:25:01.279 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
he or she knows without a doubt
that it is from Jehovah

01:25:01.279 --> 01:25:06.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and that one accepts
Jehovah’s choice with gratitude.

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:08.653 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Instead of feeling proud or haughty,

01:25:08.653 --> 01:25:10.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
anointed ones strive

01:25:10.588 --> 01:25:14.559 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to imitate Jesus’ example of humility.

01:25:14.559 --> 01:25:18.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re helped to do so
by keeping in mind

01:25:18.062 --> 01:25:20.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the lessons and warnings

01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:24.068 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that are found in Jesus’ parables for them.

01:25:24.068 --> 01:25:29.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s noteworthy
that just before relating his parables,

01:25:29.073 --> 01:25:32.844 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus spoke
about a “faithful and discreet slave”

01:25:32.844 --> 01:25:34.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would distribute spiritual food

01:25:34.846 --> 01:25:38.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the proper time during the last days.

01:25:38.449 --> 01:25:41.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That slave pictures a small group

01:25:41.486 --> 01:25:45.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of anointed Christian men today,
the Governing Body.

01:25:45.990 --> 01:25:48.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For their faithful service, Jesus said

01:25:48.359 --> 01:25:53.097 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be a reward,
but he also provided a warning.

01:25:53.865 --> 01:25:55.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He spoke about what would happen

01:25:55.633 --> 01:25:59.437 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if that slave ever lost sight
of Jesus’ future return

01:25:59.437 --> 01:26:02.440 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and started to mistreat his fellow slaves.

01:26:02.440 --> 01:26:05.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If that were to happen,

01:26:05.043 --> 01:26:09.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that slave would be viewed as evil and would,

01:26:09.047 --> 01:26:11.716 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Matthew 24:51 states,

01:26:11.716 --> 01:26:15.854 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be ‘punished with the greatest severity.’

01:26:15.854 --> 01:26:20.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please note that Jesus was not prophesying

01:26:20.391 --> 01:26:23.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be an evil slave.

01:26:23.161 --> 01:26:27.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This is a warning, not a prophecy.

01:26:27.665 --> 01:26:29.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What was the warning?

01:26:29.667 --> 01:26:33.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That the faithful slave
needs to remain watchful.

01:26:33.872 --> 01:26:36.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Yet, it is not just
“the faithful and discreet slave”

01:26:36.841 --> 01:26:39.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who must remain watchful.

01:26:39.210 --> 01:26:42.013 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
By means of his parables, Jesus warned

01:26:42.013 --> 01:26:45.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that all anointed ones must likewise prove

01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:50.021 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be discreet, faithful, and watchful.

01:26:50.021 --> 01:26:52.523 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, how did Jesus make his point?

01:26:53.992 --> 01:26:57.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the parable of the virgins, Jesus spoke

01:26:57.562 --> 01:27:00.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of ten virgins who went out
to meet a bridegroom.

01:27:00.965 --> 01:27:04.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They hoped to accompany
the bridegroom into his marriage feast.

01:27:04.836 --> 01:27:07.739 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus described five of the virgins

01:27:07.739 --> 01:27:11.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as discreet and five as foolish.

01:27:12.277 --> 01:27:14.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Greek word used for “discreet”

01:27:14.879 --> 01:27:17.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
conveys the idea of understanding,

01:27:17.749 --> 01:27:21.352 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
forethought, discernment, and wisdom

01:27:21.352 --> 01:27:23.821 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in a practical sense.

01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:27.525 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the discreet virgins were wise,

01:27:27.525 --> 01:27:29.761 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they showed this by being ready

01:27:29.761 --> 01:27:33.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the bridegroom arrived
in the middle of the night.

01:27:33.364 --> 01:27:35.934 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They had lamps to light their way.

01:27:35.934 --> 01:27:40.939 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And Matthew 25:4 adds
that “the discreet [virgins]

01:27:40.939 --> 01:27:45.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
took oil in their flasks
along with their lamps.”

01:27:45.276 --> 01:27:48.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they had the means
to keep their lamps burning.

01:27:50.114 --> 01:27:52.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because they proved to be ready,

01:27:52.650 --> 01:27:56.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could follow the bridegroom
into his marriage feast.

01:27:56.921 --> 01:28:00.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This action depicts genuine anointed ones

01:28:00.325 --> 01:28:02.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
entering into their heavenly reward.

01:28:02.994 --> 01:28:04.996 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They will be judged as worthy

01:28:04.996 --> 01:28:09.500 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to join the Bridegroom, Jesus,
in his heavenly Kingdom.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the foolish virgins?

01:28:13.004 --> 01:28:15.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, unlike the discreet virgins,

01:28:15.573 --> 01:28:19.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the foolish ones were not ready
when the bridegroom arrived.

01:28:19.143 --> 01:28:21.179 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their lamps died out.

01:28:21.179 --> 01:28:24.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, they
could not follow the bridegroom

01:28:24.148 --> 01:28:27.251 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and enter into his marriage feast.

01:28:27.251 --> 01:28:29.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When they later tried to do so,

01:28:29.887 --> 01:28:32.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they heard the bridegroom tell them:

01:28:32.657 --> 01:28:34.692 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not know you.”

01:28:35.693 --> 01:28:38.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What is the lesson and warning

01:28:38.429 --> 01:28:41.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that Jesus was illustrating?

01:28:41.399 --> 01:28:44.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He was showing that only anointed Christians

01:28:44.202 --> 01:28:46.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who “keep on the watch” and prove to be ready

01:28:46.671 --> 01:28:50.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will follow him into the reward.

01:28:50.041 --> 01:28:52.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice, though, that Jesus did not say

01:28:52.810 --> 01:28:55.513 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that there would be
a large number of foolish ones

01:28:55.513 --> 01:28:58.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who would be unprepared
when he comes in this way

01:28:58.383 --> 01:29:00.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the great tribulation.

01:29:00.685 --> 01:29:04.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here, too, this is a warning, not a prophecy.

01:29:04.822 --> 01:29:07.959 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not focused
on five of them being discreet

01:29:07.959 --> 01:29:11.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and five of them being foolish.

01:29:11.029 --> 01:29:13.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was simply letting anointed ones know

01:29:13.731 --> 01:29:18.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what would happen
if they failed to “keep on the watch.”

01:29:18.669 --> 01:29:22.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is a sobering thought.

01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:25.143 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,

01:29:25.143 --> 01:29:28.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all true Christians
should listen to the warning

01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:31.883 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found in the parable of the virgins.

01:29:31.883 --> 01:29:33.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We must “keep on the watch”

01:29:33.885 --> 01:29:36.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and always be ready

01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to carry out our service to God.

01:29:40.525 --> 01:29:43.194 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, after using the parable of the virgins

01:29:43.194 --> 01:29:46.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to emphasize the need to be discreet,

01:29:46.230 --> 01:29:51.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus related a parable
that highlights the need to be faithful.

01:29:51.235 --> 01:29:55.273 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is the parable of the talents, or money.

01:29:55.273 --> 01:29:59.043 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this parable, Jesus tells about two slaves

01:29:59.043 --> 01:30:01.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were faithful to their master

01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:03.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and one slave who was not.

01:30:04.382 --> 01:30:07.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How did the two slaves prove to be faithful?

01:30:07.452 --> 01:30:09.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the faithful slaves worked hard

01:30:09.454 --> 01:30:13.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to increase the money
that their master entrusted to their care

01:30:13.024 --> 01:30:15.593 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just before he traveled abroad.

01:30:15.593 --> 01:30:19.197 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When he returned, the faithful slaves

01:30:19.197 --> 01:30:22.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
had more to give back
than what they had received

01:30:22.567 --> 01:30:25.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they were blessed for doing so.

01:30:25.002 --> 01:30:29.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But what about the third slave,
the sluggish one?

01:30:29.207 --> 01:30:32.677 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did he do with what he had received?

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:35.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the sluggish slave
buried what he had been given

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.183 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and failed to increase his master’s talents.

01:30:39.183 --> 01:30:42.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the master returned,
that slave had nothing additional

01:30:42.453 --> 01:30:44.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give to his master.

01:30:44.455 --> 01:30:46.491 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He even tried to blame the master,

01:30:46.491 --> 01:30:49.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
calling him “a demanding man.”

01:30:49.393 --> 01:30:54.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, that slave
did not receive greater blessings.

01:30:54.198 --> 01:30:58.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More than that, what he had been given

01:30:58.202 --> 01:31:00.204 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was taken away from him,

01:31:00.204 --> 01:31:04.408 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he was cast out
of the master’s household.

01:31:04.408 --> 01:31:08.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What did the master’s response mean
for each of his slaves,

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:11.482 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and whom do they picture today?

01:31:12.984 --> 01:31:16.454 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The two faithful slaves
depict anointed Christians

01:31:16.454 --> 01:31:20.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who proved to be valued members
of the master’s household.

01:31:20.424 --> 01:31:24.295 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Master, Jesus, invites them

01:31:24.295 --> 01:31:27.131 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “enter into the joy of [their] master.”

01:31:27.131 --> 01:31:31.202 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That joy pictures their heavenly reward.

01:31:31.202 --> 01:31:35.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On the other hand,
the bad example of the sluggish slave

01:31:35.473 --> 01:31:38.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
provides a warning for anointed ones.

01:31:38.376 --> 01:31:40.711 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How so?

01:31:40.711 --> 01:31:44.682 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If anointed ones
do not remain alert and watchful,

01:31:44.682 --> 01:31:48.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they could become self-satisfied
with what they have received.

01:31:48.619 --> 01:31:52.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They might not extend themselves
in Kingdom service.

01:31:52.823 --> 01:31:55.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They could lose sight
of their responsibilities

01:31:55.693 --> 01:31:59.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and fail to do as 2 Peter 1:10 urges,

01:31:59.897 --> 01:32:02.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where they are told “to make the calling

01:32:02.099 --> 01:32:06.003 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and choosing sure for themselves.”

01:32:06.003 --> 01:32:09.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If any of them
become like the sluggish slave,

01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:12.577 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
they would not be approved
to enter into the heavenly Kingdom

01:32:12.577 --> 01:32:15.980 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and share in the joy of the Master.

01:32:15.980 --> 01:32:17.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once again,

01:32:17.982 --> 01:32:22.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus was providing
a warning, not a prophecy.

01:32:22.286 --> 01:32:24.855 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, all anointed Christians

01:32:24.855 --> 01:32:29.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
must strive to be both discreet and faithful.

01:32:30.494 --> 01:32:33.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Whether our hope is heavenly or earthly,

01:32:33.698 --> 01:32:38.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all true Christians are determined
to remain faithful to Jehovah.

01:32:38.703 --> 01:32:42.573 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We are secure in our relationship with him.

01:32:42.573 --> 01:32:44.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re not concerned if Jehovah

01:32:44.575 --> 01:32:48.846 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
chooses to anoint
some faithful ones in more recent years.

01:32:48.846 --> 01:32:53.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We recall what Jesus said
regarding the “11th-hour” workers

01:32:53.651 --> 01:32:56.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in his illustration about the vineyard.

01:32:56.220 --> 01:33:00.524 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You can read about it in Matthew chapter 20.

01:33:00.524 --> 01:33:04.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those who were invited
to work in the vineyard later in the day

01:33:04.795 --> 01:33:08.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
received the same reward
from the master of the vineyard

01:33:08.232 --> 01:33:12.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as those who were invited
to work in it earlier in the day.

01:33:12.336 --> 01:33:17.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Likewise, Jehovah and his Son
know how many anointed ones to call

01:33:17.041 --> 01:33:21.178 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in order to complete
the number of 144,000

01:33:21.178 --> 01:33:23.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
before the end comes.

01:33:23.814 --> 01:33:26.317 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But no matter when they are selected,

01:33:26.317 --> 01:33:29.720 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
each anointed one
who is judged to be faithful

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:32.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will receive their heavenly reward.

01:33:32.823 --> 01:33:34.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now with that in mind, let’s consider

01:33:34.859 --> 01:33:39.864 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Matthew 24:40, 41.

01:33:40.798 --> 01:33:43.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And as we do, we’ll see how these verses

01:33:43.401 --> 01:33:47.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
connect to Jesus’ parables for the anointed.

01:33:47.271 --> 01:33:50.908 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
At Matthew 24:40, it reads:

01:33:50.908 --> 01:33:53.644 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Then two men will be in the field;

01:33:53.644 --> 01:33:57.715 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“one will be taken along
and the other abandoned.

01:33:57.715 --> 01:34:00.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Two women will be grinding at the hand mill;

01:34:00.651 --> 01:34:05.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
one will be taken along
and the other abandoned.”

01:34:07.091 --> 01:34:10.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Did you notice
some similarities to the parables?

01:34:10.928 --> 01:34:13.964 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus spoke of two men working in a field

01:34:13.964 --> 01:34:17.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and of two women working at a hand mill.

01:34:17.268 --> 01:34:20.938 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Outwardly, they appear to be the same.

01:34:20.938 --> 01:34:25.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But in each case, Jesus said
that “one [would] be taken along

01:34:25.943 --> 01:34:28.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the other abandoned.”

01:34:28.112 --> 01:34:32.550 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He then urged his followers
to “keep on the watch, therefore,

01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:36.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because you do not know
on what day your Lord is coming.”

01:34:37.555 --> 01:34:40.458 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus said something very similar

01:34:40.458 --> 01:34:43.461 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
after relating the parable of the virgins.

01:34:43.461 --> 01:34:48.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In both examples, he provided a warning.

01:34:48.032 --> 01:34:52.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since the parable of the virgins
applies to anointed Christians,

01:34:52.436 --> 01:34:55.606 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do Jesus’ comments
about those who are taken along

01:34:55.606 --> 01:34:57.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
also apply to the anointed?

01:34:57.608 --> 01:34:59.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It appears that they do.

01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:04.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here again,
Jesus was providing a warning.

01:35:04.448 --> 01:35:08.819 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In his great prophecy regarding
“the conclusion of the system of things,”

01:35:08.819 --> 01:35:12.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we find that Jesus lovingly highlights

01:35:12.056 --> 01:35:14.859 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
both the good news of the Kingdom,

01:35:14.859 --> 01:35:17.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as well as warning messages for all people,

01:35:17.862 --> 01:35:20.164 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including his followers.

01:35:20.164 --> 01:35:24.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Down to this day,
our message follows the same pattern.

01:35:24.802 --> 01:35:29.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It is both one of salvation
as well as one of warning.

01:35:29.507 --> 01:35:32.209 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we must continue to do all that we can

01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:34.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to deliver Jesus’ twofold message

01:35:34.912 --> 01:35:38.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and help others to act on it
while there is still time.

01:35:38.849 --> 01:35:42.286 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, Jehovah and his Son want us

01:35:42.286 --> 01:35:46.924 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain discreet,
faithful, and on the watch.

01:35:47.892 --> 01:35:49.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So, what have we considered?

01:35:50.661 --> 01:35:53.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some of the virgins in Jesus’ illustration

01:35:53.464 --> 01:35:55.533 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
found out that the door was shut,

01:35:55.533 --> 01:35:57.635 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they heard the bridegroom tell them:

01:35:57.635 --> 01:36:00.237 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“I do not know you.”

01:36:00.237 --> 01:36:03.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the slaves
in Jesus’ illustration of the talents

01:36:03.307 --> 01:36:05.609 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
did not enter into his master’s joy

01:36:05.609 --> 01:36:09.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but was thrown outside into the darkness.

01:36:09.079 --> 01:36:11.782 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus also indicated

01:36:11.782 --> 01:36:16.020 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that not all would be taken along
into the heavenly reward.

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:20.090 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What a serious warning
for those who have the heavenly hope!

01:36:20.090 --> 01:36:22.927 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Even so, we are confident

01:36:22.927 --> 01:36:26.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the full number of them will be filled.

01:36:26.997 --> 01:36:31.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Truly, this is a time of judgment
for all of God’s people,

01:36:31.769 --> 01:36:36.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the righteous sheep
who yearn to live forever on earth.

01:36:36.173 --> 01:36:38.876 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But there is no reason for any of us

01:36:38.876 --> 01:36:42.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to fear the final judgment that is yet ahead.

01:36:42.713 --> 01:36:45.950 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our loving heavenly Father
promises to give us

01:36:45.950 --> 01:36:50.187 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“power beyond what is normal” so that we may,

01:36:50.187 --> 01:36:53.424 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as Luke 21:36 says,

01:36:53.424 --> 01:36:57.928 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“succeed in . . .
standing before the Son of man.”

01:36:57.928 --> 01:37:02.933 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So then, whether our hope
is heavenly or earthly,

01:37:02.933 --> 01:37:07.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we must heed the warnings
found in Jesus’ parables

01:37:07.104 --> 01:37:11.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and thereby keep our names
“written in the book of life.”

01:37:18.215 --> 01:37:20.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We thank you so much, Brother Cook,

01:37:20.217 --> 01:37:23.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for that excellent review of warnings

01:37:23.587 --> 01:37:25.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we need to keep in our minds.

01:37:25.789 --> 01:37:29.493 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, did you capture all of the fine points

01:37:29.493 --> 01:37:31.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of those three talks?

01:37:31.495 --> 01:37:34.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’re now going to pass out
the exam sheets.

01:37:35.633 --> 01:37:37.268 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No, just kidding.

01:37:37.268 --> 01:37:39.336 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you would like to review

01:37:39.336 --> 01:37:42.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
those talks carefully,
and we know you will,

01:37:42.473 --> 01:37:44.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
guess what?

01:37:44.475 --> 01:37:47.678 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They’re going to be presented
to the worldwide brotherhood

01:37:47.678 --> 01:37:52.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the January monthly edition
of JW Broadcasting.

01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:56.587 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So you all will have the opportunity
to carefully review your notes

01:37:56.587 --> 01:38:01.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make sure you got all the fine points
in those wonderful, wonderful talks.

01:38:01.992 --> 01:38:05.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, the Governing Body
has asked that a brief update

01:38:05.095 --> 01:38:08.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the construction
of the Ramapo headquarters facility

01:38:08.766 --> 01:38:10.834 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be shared with you at this time.

01:38:10.834 --> 01:38:12.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now, despite the pandemic,

01:38:12.903 --> 01:38:17.841 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have clearly seen Jehovah’s hand
on the Ramapo project this year,

01:38:17.841 --> 01:38:21.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so please enjoy the following visual update.

01:38:25.282 --> 01:38:27.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Before the main project begins,

01:38:27.451 --> 01:38:31.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contractors have already
been assisting to repair and strengthen

01:38:31.455 --> 01:38:36.126 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
an existing stone-faced bridge
on the road into the site.

01:38:36.126 --> 01:38:37.861 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When completed,

01:38:37.861 --> 01:38:39.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the restoration of this structure

01:38:39.997 --> 01:38:43.434 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will serve as a beautiful feature
of the property.

01:38:43.434 --> 01:38:45.269 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More important,

01:38:45.269 --> 01:38:49.974 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has greatly blessed the efforts
to work through the planning process

01:38:49.974 --> 01:38:51.976 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the town of Ramapo.

01:38:52.910 --> 01:38:56.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That process is now
in the final stages of obtaining

01:38:56.347 --> 01:39:01.285 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the necessary permits to start the large,
new construction project.

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:06.991 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the first quarter of 2022,
Jehovah willing,

01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:09.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
contractors will start clearing the site

01:39:09.693 --> 01:39:12.229 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in preparation for earth-moving

01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:15.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and installation of underground utilities

01:39:15.032 --> 01:39:17.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and for readying the locations

01:39:17.134 --> 01:39:20.371 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
where the first buildings 
will be constructed.

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:23.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This in itself will take many months,

01:39:23.674 --> 01:39:28.679 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we look to Jehovah to bless
this key phase that, when concluded,

01:39:28.679 --> 01:39:30.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
will open up the project

01:39:30.814 --> 01:39:34.985 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many volunteers
to come and share in the work.

01:39:35.886 --> 01:39:40.591 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Much forethought and work has gone
into the arrangements needed for feeding,

01:39:40.591 --> 01:39:44.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
housing, and providing
temporary office spaces

01:39:44.395 --> 01:39:47.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all such willing brothers and sisters.

01:39:49.266 --> 01:39:53.904 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The design team is fully engaged
in preparing the construction documents.

01:39:53.904 --> 01:39:56.874 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The drawings for some buildings
are well-advanced;

01:39:56.874 --> 01:39:59.943 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
others are in the concept stage.

01:39:59.943 --> 01:40:02.780 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
No doubt, seeing these concept images

01:40:02.780 --> 01:40:05.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the future Ramapo facility

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:09.420 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is exciting and encouraging to all of you.

01:40:15.726 --> 01:40:20.698 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, with all of you,
we continue to pray that Jehovah will bless

01:40:20.698 --> 01:40:24.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this very exciting theocratic project.

01:40:25.335 --> 01:40:28.005 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,

01:40:28.005 --> 01:40:30.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we have felt Jehovah’s loving care

01:40:30.574 --> 01:40:33.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as we’ve received helpful direction

01:40:33.477 --> 01:40:35.512 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
just at the right time.

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:38.549 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Please listen and watch

01:40:38.549 --> 01:40:41.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as those who work
in the Coordinators’ Committee Office

01:40:41.752 --> 01:40:45.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
recount how events unfolded
with the pandemic

01:40:45.389 --> 01:40:49.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how Jehovah has guided matters
throughout this time.

01:40:52.963 --> 01:40:54.965 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In January of 2020,

01:40:54.965 --> 01:40:56.633 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we started seeing news reports

01:40:56.633 --> 01:41:00.003 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about a disease outbreak in Wuhan, China.

01:41:00.003 --> 01:41:03.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now at the time, it seemed localized
and was not of global concern.

01:41:04.575 --> 01:41:06.176 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But a short time later,

01:41:06.176 --> 01:41:07.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the numbers were going up

01:41:07.811 --> 01:41:10.347 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as the virus began to spread.

01:41:10.347 --> 01:41:13.484 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Borders were closing,
and airports were shutting down.

01:41:19.089 --> 01:41:21.725 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On January 22, the Coordinators’ Committee

01:41:21.725 --> 01:41:23.861 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
received their first letter from a branch

01:41:23.861 --> 01:41:25.229 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
about the coronavirus.

01:41:25.229 --> 01:41:27.231 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The letter was from the Korea branch.

01:41:27.231 --> 01:41:28.766 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Soon after that,

01:41:28.766 --> 01:41:31.368 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we wrote to all branches in and around Asia

01:41:31.368 --> 01:41:33.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and included guidelines on what to do

01:41:33.370 --> 01:41:35.773 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if they had an outbreak in their territory.

01:41:35.773 --> 01:41:38.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had dealt with local epidemics before

01:41:38.041 --> 01:41:41.078 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but nothing like this on a worldwide scale.

01:41:41.078 --> 01:41:45.182 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was clear that the virus
was going to affect almost every aspect

01:41:45.182 --> 01:41:47.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of our theocratic operations.

01:41:47.384 --> 01:41:49.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And during those first few months of 2020,

01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:53.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the organization would be faced
with a huge amount of decisions.

01:41:53.290 --> 01:41:56.860 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You have to realize that this was catching us

01:41:56.860 --> 01:41:59.196 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
right in the middle of our activities.

01:41:59.196 --> 01:42:03.300 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our schedule for the whole year
had already been planned.

01:42:03.300 --> 01:42:07.638 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had shepherding visits to branches,
regional conventions,

01:42:07.638 --> 01:42:09.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even special conventions.

01:42:09.873 --> 01:42:12.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And now we had Gilead graduation

01:42:12.910 --> 01:42:15.879 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and Memorial coming up right in front of us.

01:42:15.879 --> 01:42:17.781 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What were we going to do?

01:42:17.781 --> 01:42:19.483 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
One of the first things

01:42:19.483 --> 01:42:21.718 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body decided

01:42:21.718 --> 01:42:23.720 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was that the Coordinators’ Committee

01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:25.722 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
would become the central channel

01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:29.827 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of communication regarding COVID-19.

01:42:31.094 --> 01:42:33.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Meanwhile, the graduation

01:42:33.564 --> 01:42:36.400 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
of the 148th class of Gilead

01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:38.669 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
was in two weeks.

01:42:38.669 --> 01:42:40.771 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should we have guests come?

01:42:40.771 --> 01:42:43.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Should there be a live audience?

01:42:43.106 --> 01:42:47.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was not much time
to make these decisions.

01:42:47.344 --> 01:42:51.148 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, after prayer and discussion,

01:42:51.148 --> 01:42:54.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire Governing Body decided

01:42:54.351 --> 01:42:56.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
not to have a live audience

01:42:56.987 --> 01:43:00.624 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the Gilead graduation that weekend.

01:43:00.624 --> 01:43:03.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That was unheard of!

01:43:03.093 --> 01:43:05.529 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The next thing we needed to figure out

01:43:05.529 --> 01:43:08.665 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was whether to lock down
headquarters at Bethel.

01:43:08.665 --> 01:43:11.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I clearly remember it was a Friday night,

01:43:11.602 --> 01:43:13.170 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
March 13.

01:43:13.170 --> 01:43:15.172 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were getting reports of COVID cases

01:43:15.172 --> 01:43:17.341 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the congregations around Bethel.

01:43:17.341 --> 01:43:19.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we also knew that the Bethelites

01:43:19.376 --> 01:43:23.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be going out to their congregation
and other activities over the weekend.

01:43:23.113 --> 01:43:27.184 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we were going to do something,
we needed to do it quickly.

01:43:27.184 --> 01:43:30.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We called each member of the Governing Body

01:43:30.654 --> 01:43:32.890 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and explained the situation.

01:43:32.890 --> 01:43:35.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And all were unanimous

01:43:35.492 --> 01:43:39.162 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we should lock down Bethel immediately.

01:43:39.162 --> 01:43:42.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So within the hour, a message went
to the entire headquarters

01:43:42.566 --> 01:43:45.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and United States Bethel family to stay in,

01:43:45.702 --> 01:43:49.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and if you were out,
to return to Bethel immediately.

01:43:49.306 --> 01:43:51.508 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Sometime later,

01:43:51.508 --> 01:43:56.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we learned that there were
some COVID cases at Patterson.

01:43:56.246 --> 01:44:00.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If we had moved ahead,
potentially we could have spread COVID

01:44:00.684 --> 01:44:03.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
through the whole Bethel family!

01:44:03.887 --> 01:44:08.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We really felt Jehovah’s protective hand.

01:44:08.492 --> 01:44:11.862 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same weekend as the Gilead graduation,

01:44:11.862 --> 01:44:13.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Memorial invitation campaign

01:44:13.196 --> 01:44:14.831 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was scheduled to begin.

01:44:14.831 --> 01:44:17.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so branches were asking:

01:44:17.401 --> 01:44:20.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Is it safe to go door to door
and to distribute invitations?

01:44:20.837 --> 01:44:23.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What if we can’t meet at our Kingdom Halls?

01:44:23.073 --> 01:44:26.610 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the virus had spread in many countries,

01:44:26.610 --> 01:44:28.612 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it became evident

01:44:28.612 --> 01:44:33.016 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that we needed to suspend
the public ministry.

01:44:33.016 --> 01:44:36.887 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This was a very serious decision.

01:44:37.788 --> 01:44:42.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when we prayerfully analyzed
the situation,

01:44:42.025 --> 01:44:45.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we realized we would not be showing respect

01:44:45.762 --> 01:44:49.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the sanctity of life or love of neighbor

01:44:49.299 --> 01:44:52.769 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we continued house to house.

01:44:52.769 --> 01:44:55.872 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our preaching work shifted to letter writing

01:44:55.872 --> 01:44:58.542 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and telephone witnessing.

01:44:58.542 --> 01:45:02.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And what a huge witness
has been given in this way!

01:45:02.546 --> 01:45:06.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was amazing to me personally
when I saw how quickly

01:45:06.283 --> 01:45:08.385 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the brothers could adapt to using

01:45:08.385 --> 01:45:11.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<i>Zoom, </i>phone witnessing, letter writing.

01:45:11.088 --> 01:45:14.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And instead of it being
a huge setback for the work,

01:45:14.391 --> 01:45:18.095 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was almost as though
the work even moved ahead.

01:45:18.095 --> 01:45:20.130 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were also having to deal

01:45:20.130 --> 01:45:23.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with what to do about our Kingdom Halls
and our meetings.

01:45:23.633 --> 01:45:26.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Initially, some of the brothers
were thinking,

01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:29.673 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
‘Maybe we could just simply watch
the prerecorded meetings

01:45:29.673 --> 01:45:31.675 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on <i>JW Stream</i> ®.’

01:45:31.675 --> 01:45:35.112 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, while that’s an excellent provision,

01:45:35.112 --> 01:45:38.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
if we were going to do this for a long time,

01:45:38.749 --> 01:45:42.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it would be wonderful to use a tool

01:45:42.019 --> 01:45:45.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that would allow the brothers and sisters
to come together virtually,

01:45:45.789 --> 01:45:49.960 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to be able to interact and have
that “interchange of encouragement.”

01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:54.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We knew that a few branches
had already started using <i>Zoom </i>

01:45:54.765 --> 01:45:56.767 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for congregation meetings,

01:45:56.767 --> 01:46:00.370 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we wondered, ‘Could this tool be used

01:46:00.370 --> 01:46:03.173 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for congregation meetings globally?’

01:46:03.173 --> 01:46:04.708 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we asked those branches

01:46:04.708 --> 01:46:05.976 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for their recommendations

01:46:05.976 --> 01:46:08.612 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on how we could use this tool further.

01:46:08.612 --> 01:46:11.181 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We got their comments, we did some testing,

01:46:11.181 --> 01:46:15.452 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then the Governing Body approved
the global use of <i>Zoom </i> for meetings.

01:46:15.452 --> 01:46:16.720 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
At the same time, though,

01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:18.388 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
the Coordinators’ Committee urgently wanted

01:46:18.388 --> 01:46:20.323 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to help those congregations to arrange

01:46:20.323 --> 01:46:21.858 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
dignified <i>Zoom</i>  meetings.

01:46:21.858 --> 01:46:25.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And so within a week,
technical and theocratic guidelines

01:46:25.362 --> 01:46:27.397 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were released to all congregations.

01:46:27.397 --> 01:46:29.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And shortly after that,

01:46:29.032 --> 01:46:32.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tens of thousands of <i>Zoom</i>  licenses
were purchased

01:46:32.903 --> 01:46:36.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then provided to many congregations
as part of the disaster relief arrangement.

01:46:36.807 --> 01:46:41.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
However, not all publishers
could use <i>Zoom</i>  because of lack of Internet.

01:46:41.378 --> 01:46:43.647 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in the days leading up to the campaign,

01:46:43.647 --> 01:46:46.850 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the Governing Body provided direction
to all branches

01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:49.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on how to handle those exact situations.

01:46:49.719 --> 01:46:52.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They also announced
that the Memorial talk itself

01:46:52.656 --> 01:46:55.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be made available on jw.org.

01:46:55.092 --> 01:46:58.161 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So one branch wrote in
and asked if they could use

01:46:58.161 --> 01:47:01.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
television and radio broadcasting.

01:47:01.031 --> 01:47:03.667 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we thought: ‘That’s a good idea.

01:47:03.667 --> 01:47:05.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s try it.’

01:47:05.001 --> 01:47:07.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Once we saw
how well it worked in that country,

01:47:07.838 --> 01:47:10.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
television and radio were approved

01:47:10.507 --> 01:47:12.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for all branches in Africa

01:47:12.509 --> 01:47:14.911 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
only two days before the Memorial.

01:47:14.911 --> 01:47:18.115 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
How thrilling it was
for many friends in Africa

01:47:18.115 --> 01:47:21.084 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to find out, even moments
before the broadcast began,

01:47:21.084 --> 01:47:24.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they would be able
to commemorate the Memorial

01:47:24.121 --> 01:47:28.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
simultaneously with their brothers
and sisters throughout the country!

01:47:28.525 --> 01:47:31.128 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
To have the Memorial
without being able to meet together

01:47:31.128 --> 01:47:34.965 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was so different for all of us.

01:47:34.965 --> 01:47:38.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Can you imagine that for the 2021 Memorial

01:47:38.735 --> 01:47:40.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there was an all-time peak

01:47:40.871 --> 01:47:47.444 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of 21,367,603?

01:47:48.778 --> 01:47:52.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Clearly, we have seen Jehovah’s blessing

01:47:52.415 --> 01:47:54.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on these arrangements.

01:47:55.619 --> 01:47:57.888 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
While all these new arrangements

01:47:57.888 --> 01:48:00.624 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
were being made at a rapid pace,

01:48:00.624 --> 01:48:02.492 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the usual work
of the Coordinators’ Committee Office

01:48:02.492 --> 01:48:05.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
didn’t stop because of the pandemic.

01:48:05.228 --> 01:48:07.430 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still had to deal
with the king of the north

01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:09.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
persecuting our brothers.

01:48:09.566 --> 01:48:13.670 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We still had disasters
and many other things to contend with.

01:48:13.670 --> 01:48:17.073 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
In fact, we handled twice as many disasters

01:48:17.073 --> 01:48:19.075 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
in the 2020 service year

01:48:19.075 --> 01:48:20.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the middle of the pandemic

01:48:20.977 --> 01:48:23.113 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
than we did in 2018.

01:48:23.113 --> 01:48:26.016 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
On a daily basis, we saw clear evidence

01:48:26.016 --> 01:48:28.752 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that we are living in the last days.

01:48:28.752 --> 01:48:30.420 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We had to come up with guidelines

01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.655 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to help branches determine

01:48:31.655 --> 01:48:32.956 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
what aspects of relief work

01:48:32.956 --> 01:48:34.157 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
could be postponed

01:48:34.157 --> 01:48:38.595 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and at the same time ensure that urgent
or necessary work went ahead safely.

01:48:38.595 --> 01:48:40.997 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While there’s no doubt that the pandemic

01:48:40.997 --> 01:48:42.966 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
complicated disaster relief efforts
considerably,

01:48:42.966 --> 01:48:45.001 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was so faith-strengthening to see

01:48:45.001 --> 01:48:46.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the Governing Body refused

01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:50.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to allow those complications
to prevent them from caring for our brothers.

01:48:50.707 --> 01:48:54.311 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In addition to the impact
these disasters had on our brothers,

01:48:54.311 --> 01:48:56.313 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in some countries our brothers

01:48:56.313 --> 01:48:59.616 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
couldn’t even get enough food
for their daily needs.

01:48:59.616 --> 01:49:03.486 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could have been because of
government restrictions, supply issues,

01:49:03.486 --> 01:49:08.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or other circumstances
that wouldn’t allow the brothers to work.

01:49:08.391 --> 01:49:13.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Literally, the branches had to arrange
to provide their “daily bread.”

01:49:13.396 --> 01:49:17.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Branches were encouraged to establish
disaster relief committees

01:49:17.567 --> 01:49:20.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to care for the needs on a local level.

01:49:20.537 --> 01:49:23.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Reminders were provided to help families

01:49:23.373 --> 01:49:26.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to prepare a reserve of food,
if at all possible,

01:49:26.977 --> 01:49:29.045 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in case the situation became worse.

01:49:29.045 --> 01:49:33.917 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, the virus affected
not only our meetings at the Kingdom Hall

01:49:33.917 --> 01:49:35.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but also our circuit assemblies,

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:39.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
regional conventions,
and special conventions.

01:49:39.656 --> 01:49:43.059 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the Governing Body decided to cancel

01:49:43.059 --> 01:49:46.930 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all live regional and special conventions

01:49:46.930 --> 01:49:49.332 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for 2020.

01:49:50.233 --> 01:49:53.036 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That lead to a landmark convention program

01:49:53.036 --> 01:49:56.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
on jw.org

01:49:56.039 --> 01:49:59.009 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the entire brotherhood enjoyed.

01:50:00.877 --> 01:50:03.113 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That same week in March,

01:50:03.113 --> 01:50:07.350 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we approved
that a JW Broadcasting® news release

01:50:07.350 --> 01:50:09.719 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the coronavirus outbreak

01:50:09.719 --> 01:50:11.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
be developed.

01:50:11.721 --> 01:50:15.058 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So interviews and scripts were prepared

01:50:15.058 --> 01:50:18.528 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during that Gilead graduation weekend,

01:50:18.528 --> 01:50:22.565 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the program was recorded and released

01:50:22.565 --> 01:50:24.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the following week.

01:50:25.769 --> 01:50:27.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Governing Body updates

01:50:27.937 --> 01:50:31.207 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have been an important way for us to shepherd

01:50:31.207 --> 01:50:35.145 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the entire organization during the pandemic.

01:50:35.945 --> 01:50:38.415 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, once vaccinations
became more prevalent,

01:50:38.415 --> 01:50:40.417 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we faced another challenge.

01:50:40.417 --> 01:50:43.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The United States branch
was struggling to get vaccines

01:50:43.787 --> 01:50:46.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for those in the Bethel family
who wanted them.

01:50:46.222 --> 01:50:50.660 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So in early April 2021,
we called together a meeting.

01:50:50.660 --> 01:50:54.464 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We had all the key individuals there
from the various departments,

01:50:54.464 --> 01:50:57.467 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and everyone was given an assignment.

01:50:57.467 --> 01:51:02.072 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And within two weeks, we had enough vaccines

01:51:02.072 --> 01:51:05.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to vaccinate everyone
in the U.S. Bethel family

01:51:05.442 --> 01:51:07.510 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who chose to be vaccinated.

01:51:07.510 --> 01:51:10.246 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, about a week later,
we sent a letter to all branches,

01:51:10.246 --> 01:51:13.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
encouraging them to investigate
the availability of vaccines

01:51:13.416 --> 01:51:14.918 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for special full-time servants.

01:51:14.918 --> 01:51:18.455 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We were especially concerned
about special full-time servants

01:51:18.455 --> 01:51:21.925 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
serving in lands where the government
was not yet making vaccines available.

01:51:21.925 --> 01:51:24.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After that direction went out,

01:51:24.294 --> 01:51:28.365 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we had a tremendous response
from a number of branches

01:51:28.365 --> 01:51:32.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who were able to obtain vaccines
for special full-time servants

01:51:32.102 --> 01:51:34.104 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who wanted to receive them.

01:51:34.104 --> 01:51:38.041 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Several branches said
that it had seemed impossible

01:51:38.041 --> 01:51:41.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get vaccines in their country
at that moment,

01:51:41.177 --> 01:51:45.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they prayed about it,
they followed the direction,

01:51:45.048 --> 01:51:49.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and then either that same day
or the very next day

01:51:49.652 --> 01:51:54.224 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah opened the doors
and suddenly they had the vaccine.

01:51:54.224 --> 01:51:56.192 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All of these events occurred rapidly,

01:51:56.192 --> 01:51:59.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and even though it was difficult

01:51:59.028 --> 01:52:01.064 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make so many adjustments

01:52:01.064 --> 01:52:03.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in such a short period of time,

01:52:03.733 --> 01:52:05.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we could see Jehovah’s hand

01:52:05.735 --> 01:52:08.238 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Governing Body’s decisions.

01:52:08.238 --> 01:52:11.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Television, radio, videoconferencing

01:52:11.241 --> 01:52:13.910 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
have all served our brothers well,

01:52:13.910 --> 01:52:17.547 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
which just goes to show
that Jehovah was guiding the Governing Body

01:52:17.547 --> 01:52:20.750 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
as they made these decisions
so early in the pandemic.

01:52:20.750 --> 01:52:23.019 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You know, we’ve always appreciated

01:52:23.019 --> 01:52:25.555 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the direction we receive
from the faithful slave.

01:52:25.555 --> 01:52:28.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But at that unique time especially,

01:52:28.391 --> 01:52:31.561 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was so encouraging to see Jehovah use them

01:52:31.561 --> 01:52:33.563 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make these major decisions.

01:52:33.563 --> 01:52:36.499 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they made many that one week in March.

01:52:36.499 --> 01:52:39.002 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although there have been many challenges

01:52:39.002 --> 01:52:41.671 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and sad times during the pandemic,

01:52:41.671 --> 01:52:43.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it’s been amazing

01:52:43.873 --> 01:52:47.010 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to see many positive developments.

01:52:48.511 --> 01:52:50.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many inactive ones have returned.

01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:55.518 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So many Bible studies have been started.

01:52:55.518 --> 01:52:58.788 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We saw how Jehovah guided us through

01:52:58.788 --> 01:53:02.091 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—decision by decision, step-by-step.

01:53:02.091 --> 01:53:06.296 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And seeing how Jehovah
led us through this situation

01:53:06.296 --> 01:53:10.633 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
has helped me to see that regardless
of what is going to come up in the future,

01:53:10.633 --> 01:53:12.802 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah is going to do the same thing.

01:53:12.802 --> 01:53:15.738 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Like the Scriptures say, we get our plagues.

01:53:15.738 --> 01:53:16.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We have those times.

01:53:16.973 --> 01:53:20.376 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But overall, when you’re in Jehovah’s arms,

01:53:20.376 --> 01:53:22.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
what’s the worry?

01:53:22.378 --> 01:53:24.581 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could say that every one
of the Governing Body’s faith

01:53:24.581 --> 01:53:28.451 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
was strengthened
as we got through this trial,

01:53:28.451 --> 01:53:32.322 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it’s just a continuous thing
of our faith being built up.

01:53:32.322 --> 01:53:35.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And how Jehovah is directing us!

01:53:35.258 --> 01:53:37.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And he’s preparing his people

01:53:37.427 --> 01:53:39.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for life in that new world

01:53:39.562 --> 01:53:41.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—the real life that’s coming.

01:53:42.599 --> 01:53:45.935 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s been a real privilege
to see Jehovah’s spirit in action

01:53:45.935 --> 01:53:47.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during this pandemic.

01:53:47.937 --> 01:53:51.474 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s strengthened our faith
to see him use the Governing Body

01:53:51.474 --> 01:53:55.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to provide Scripturally based direction
and keep the Kingdom work going,

01:53:55.745 --> 01:53:59.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all the while showing respect for life.

01:53:59.449 --> 01:54:02.752 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As a result, our trust
in Jehovah’s organization

01:54:02.752 --> 01:54:05.688 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is stronger than ever before.

01:54:05.688 --> 01:54:08.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And building this trust now is vital

01:54:08.191 --> 01:54:12.795 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because Jehovah is preparing us
for future events,

01:54:12.795 --> 01:54:15.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the great tribulation.

01:54:22.438 --> 01:54:25.208 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Well, we take this opportunity to thank

01:54:25.208 --> 01:54:28.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
all of the brothers who work
in the Coordinators’ Committee Office

01:54:28.211 --> 01:54:31.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for the hard work that they put forward
during the pandemic.

01:54:31.648 --> 01:54:35.618 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It was just amazing to see how many ways

01:54:35.618 --> 01:54:39.722 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah has directed matters
during these challenging times.

01:54:40.456 --> 01:54:43.293 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
What an encouraging program!

01:54:43.293 --> 01:54:45.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And that was just the first half.

01:54:45.395 --> 01:54:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There’s so much more to enjoy.

01:54:48.398 --> 01:54:51.901 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ll see you here next month
for the rest of the program.

01:54:51.901 --> 01:54:53.703 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But before we go,

01:54:53.703 --> 01:54:57.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’d like to meet
our brothers and sisters in the Philippines

01:54:57.507 --> 01:55:00.243 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in this month’s video postcard.

01:55:00.243 --> 01:55:05.214 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Philippines is a tropical country
in the western Pacific Ocean

01:55:05.214 --> 01:55:10.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that’s made up of more than 7,100 islands.

01:55:10.653 --> 01:55:12.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Across those islands,

01:55:12.522 --> 01:55:16.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you’ll find an astonishing diversity
of landscapes

01:55:16.326 --> 01:55:18.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—from pristine beaches

01:55:18.995 --> 01:55:20.897 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and lush farmlands

01:55:20.897 --> 01:55:23.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to dramatic mountain ranges.

01:55:23.566 --> 01:55:26.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are also bustling cities,

01:55:26.469 --> 01:55:28.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
including the capital, Manila

01:55:28.304 --> 01:55:32.442 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—one of the most densely populated cities
in the world.

01:55:32.442 --> 01:55:36.079 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The over 230,000 publishers

01:55:36.079 --> 01:55:37.747 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
living in the Philippines

01:55:37.747 --> 01:55:39.749 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
preach to a population

01:55:39.749 --> 01:55:43.953 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of more than 109 million people.

01:55:43.953 --> 01:55:46.255 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In 2021,

01:55:46.255 --> 01:55:50.360 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
739,439

01:55:50.360 --> 01:55:52.362 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
attended the Memorial.

01:55:52.362 --> 01:55:56.566 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s more than three times
the number of publishers.

01:55:56.566 --> 01:55:59.669 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s travel to the southern part
of the country

01:55:59.669 --> 01:56:01.537 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to one of the largest islands,

01:56:01.537 --> 01:56:03.539 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Mindanao.

01:56:04.674 --> 01:56:07.443 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here farmers grow staples like corn and rice

01:56:08.244 --> 01:56:10.880 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
along with cacao, pomelo,

01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:14.283 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and durian
—a popular Asian fruit

01:56:14.283 --> 01:56:17.654 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
famous for its unusual, pungent smell.

01:56:18.421 --> 01:56:21.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The southern tip of Mindanao is home

01:56:21.891 --> 01:56:25.662 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the 97 publishers
in the Margus Congregation.

01:56:25.662 --> 01:56:28.798 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this remote part of the country,

01:56:28.798 --> 01:56:32.735 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the pandemic posed some unique challenges.

01:56:32.735 --> 01:56:35.605 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Because of unreliable Internet service,

01:56:35.605 --> 01:56:39.509 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation chose
to schedule its meetings on <i>Zoom </i>

01:56:39.509 --> 01:56:42.211 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at 3:30 a.m.

01:56:42.211 --> 01:56:43.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Why so early?

01:56:43.813 --> 01:56:47.316 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The Internet signal is more stable

01:56:47.316 --> 01:56:50.620 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during those early hours of the morning.

01:56:50.620 --> 01:56:54.223 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The publishers may have missed out
on a few hours of sleep,

01:56:54.223 --> 01:56:57.827 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
but they didn’t miss
any of the spiritual food

01:56:57.827 --> 01:57:00.630 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
being provided through the meetings.

01:57:00.630 --> 01:57:03.599 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In other areas served by the congregation,

01:57:03.599 --> 01:57:06.803 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there’s no Internet or cell service at all,

01:57:07.737 --> 01:57:11.541 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
so the brothers listen
to meetings broadcast over radio.

01:57:12.442 --> 01:57:15.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But those challenges
haven’t dampened their zeal,

01:57:15.712 --> 01:57:19.449 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
especially when it comes
to sharing the good news

01:57:19.449 --> 01:57:22.051 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the indigenous population.

01:57:22.051 --> 01:57:24.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Since 2019,

01:57:24.153 --> 01:57:26.456 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
the congregation has been hosting

01:57:26.456 --> 01:57:29.025 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a B’laan-language group.

01:57:29.025 --> 01:57:31.594 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
B’laan is an indigenous language

01:57:31.594 --> 01:57:35.598 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
spoken by about 125,000 people.

01:57:35.598 --> 01:57:37.600 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The B’laan people

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:39.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are famous for their handicrafts

01:57:39.869 --> 01:57:42.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and colorful native costumes.

01:57:42.905 --> 01:57:45.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With several publications and videos

01:57:45.575 --> 01:57:47.877 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
now available in B’laan,

01:57:47.877 --> 01:57:50.480 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
native speakers can hear the truth

01:57:50.480 --> 01:57:52.849 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in their own language.

01:57:52.849 --> 01:57:55.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The 28 brothers and sisters

01:57:55.384 --> 01:57:57.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of the B’laan group

01:57:57.153 --> 01:57:59.155 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in the Margus Congregation

01:57:59.155 --> 01:58:02.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would like to send you
their warm love and greetings.

01:58:03.593 --> 01:58:07.196 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And please remember,
dear brothers and sisters,

01:58:07.196 --> 01:58:11.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we love you all very much.
