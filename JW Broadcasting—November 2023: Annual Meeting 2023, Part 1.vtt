Welcome to JW Broadcasting®
for November 2023!

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:26.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
On October 7,

00:00:26.923 --> 00:00:29.217 line:10% position:50% align:center
the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society

00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:30.468 line:10% position:50% align:center
of Pennsylvania

00:00:30.468 --> 00:00:32.470 line:10% position:50% align:center
held its annual meeting.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.721 line:10% position:50% align:center
Usually, you would be viewing

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.056 line:10% position:50% align:center
this portion of the program

00:00:35.056 --> 00:00:37.099 line:10% position:50% align:center
in January 2024.

00:00:37.642 --> 00:00:42.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, you are now able
to enjoy four talks this month,

00:00:42.313 --> 00:00:45.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
November 2023.

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:49.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
These talks have been especially prepared
at the direction of the Governing Body.

00:00:49.904 --> 00:00:52.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want the worldwide brotherhood

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:55.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be aware of the content
as soon as possible.

00:00:55.702 --> 00:01:00.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention
and enjoy the program!

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:04.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s an absolute delight
to be here today, isn’t it?

00:01:16.347 --> 00:01:19.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re going to get happier
as the morning goes along.

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:24.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
The annual meeting

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:28.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
—as an example,
I’m going to pick the year of 2013.

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:33.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that annual meeting
has been called landmark.

00:01:34.032 --> 00:01:38.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve even stated that;
we called it a landmark annual meeting.

00:01:38.203 --> 00:01:40.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might think
that all annual meetings are landmark,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many of us here would agree with that.

00:01:42.582 --> 00:01:44.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that one was very special.

00:01:44.584 --> 00:01:46.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that meeting,
the revised edition

00:01:46.586 --> 00:01:50.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the <i>New World Translation</i> 
in English was released

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a very special annual meeting.

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:56.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that landmark Bible release
continues to be a blessing

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:58.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
for many people around the earth

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:00.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
as more languages are added.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, ten years later,

00:02:04.438 --> 00:02:06.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
exactly ten years later,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have arrived
at another truly landmark annual meeting.

00:02:10.527 --> 00:02:14.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time, Jehovah has helped
“the faithful and discreet slave”

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:18.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discern deeper principles

00:02:18.452 --> 00:02:20.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
and understanding

00:02:20.537 --> 00:02:25.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
from that very same Word of truth.

00:02:25.125 --> 00:02:29.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this understanding
is now going to be passed on to you.

00:02:30.297 --> 00:02:31.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you ready?

00:02:37.179 --> 00:02:39.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you excited to hear it?

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:52.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s listen very carefully
to this next symposium.

00:02:52.862 --> 00:02:56.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
And again,
each speaker will introduce

00:02:56.073 --> 00:02:58.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
the next one on the program.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please pay close attention
to Brother Gage Fleegle

00:03:03.372 --> 00:03:05.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he begins with the talk entitled

00:03:05.625 --> 00:03:09.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love Jehovah—Praise Jehovah.”

00:03:10.421 --> 00:03:14.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
The day was Nisan 11, 33 C.E.

00:03:14.842 --> 00:03:16.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was busy in the temple

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
teaching just a few days prior to his death.

00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:25.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
He silenced the scribes and the Pharisees

00:03:25.228 --> 00:03:27.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his irrefutable logic,

00:03:27.563 --> 00:03:32.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the same time
sharing some of the most profound teachings

00:03:32.151 --> 00:03:34.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his earthly ministry

00:03:34.153 --> 00:03:37.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
 —for instance, “pay back . . .
Caesar’s things to Caesar,

00:03:37.657 --> 00:03:39.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
but God’s things to God.”

00:03:41.244 --> 00:03:43.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then one of the scribes came forward

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
and asked Jesus,

00:03:46.374 --> 00:03:49.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is “the greatest commandment”?

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:53.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jesus respond?

00:03:53.173 --> 00:03:56.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
His response
would have far-reaching implications

00:03:56.092 --> 00:03:58.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
even down to our day

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:01.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
for anyone claiming to be a Christian.

00:04:01.765 --> 00:04:04.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
We find his response in Mark chapter 12.

00:04:04.142 --> 00:04:06.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
I invite you to turn there.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:11.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark chapter 12—and notice, please,
with me verses 29 and 30,

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark 12:29, 30:

00:04:13.235 --> 00:04:15.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jesus answered:

00:04:15.237 --> 00:04:20.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The first
[or the most important commandment

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:22.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘—the greatest commandment] is,

00:04:22.452 --> 00:04:27.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“Hear, O Israel,
Jehovah our God is one Jehovah,

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“and you must love Jehovah your God

00:04:30.752 --> 00:04:35.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“with your whole heart
and with your whole soul

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with your whole mind
and with your whole strength.”’”

00:04:40.053 --> 00:04:43.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah.”

00:04:43.056 --> 00:04:44.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love God.

00:04:44.558 --> 00:04:46.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
It sounds simple, right?

00:04:46.727 --> 00:04:49.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, billions of people claim to love God,

00:04:49.104 --> 00:04:52.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they love pleasures more,

00:04:52.691 --> 00:04:55.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
or they’re willing to fight
and kill their fellow man,

00:04:55.986 --> 00:04:59.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
or they refuse to live
by God’s moral standards.

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:04.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
All such things
contradict their claim to love God.

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus demonstrated
that love of God requires

00:05:07.748 --> 00:05:10.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than a feeling of affection.

00:05:10.668 --> 00:05:13.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus stressed
how completely we must love God

00:05:13.546 --> 00:05:15.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
—with our whole heart,
with our whole soul,

00:05:15.631 --> 00:05:18.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our whole mind,
with our whole strength.

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that leave anything out?

00:05:20.803 --> 00:05:22.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
our eyes?

00:05:22.805 --> 00:05:25.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
our ears? our hands?

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:28.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the study notes on verse 30
help us to understand

00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:33.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this includes
our emotions, desires, and feelings.

00:05:33.441 --> 00:05:37.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes our intellectual faculties
and power of reason.

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:39.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
It includes our physical and mental strength.

00:05:39.322 --> 00:05:42.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, our whole being
—all that we are—

00:05:42.366 --> 00:05:44.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must devote to our love to Jehovah.

00:05:44.911 --> 00:05:48.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love for God must govern
a person’s entire life.

00:05:48.331 --> 00:05:50.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing is left out.

00:05:51.334 --> 00:05:55.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, shortly after emphasizing
the greatest commandment

00:05:55.338 --> 00:05:57.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and again we’re thinking of Jesus—
he’s there in the temple.

00:05:57.673 --> 00:06:00.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
Shortly after emphasizing
the greatest commandment,

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:05.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus shines a light
on both bad and good examples

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:07.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
of love for God.

00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:12.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he sharply condemned
the scribes and the Pharisees

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
for their pretense of love for God.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:19.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you want the full condemnation,
it’s found in Matthew chapter 23.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those hypocrites

00:06:23.032 --> 00:06:27.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they even gave the tenth, or a tithe,
of small, tiny herbs,

00:06:27.871 --> 00:06:29.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they ignored
“the weightier matters of . . .

00:06:29.873 --> 00:06:32.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
justice and mercy and faithfulness.”

00:06:34.002 --> 00:06:35.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was the bad example.

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:38.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then Jesus gave his attention

00:06:38.173 --> 00:06:41.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
to an outstanding example of love for God.

00:06:41.551 --> 00:06:43.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re still there in Mark chapter 12,

00:06:43.553 --> 00:06:46.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice starting in verse 41:

00:06:48.892 --> 00:06:52.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And [Jesus] sat down
with the treasury chests in view

00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:57.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and began observing how the crowd
was dropping money into the treasury chests,

00:06:57.567 --> 00:07:01.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and many rich people
were dropping in many coins.

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:03.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now a poor widow came and dropped in

00:07:03.323 --> 00:07:07.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
“two small coins of very little value.

00:07:07.244 --> 00:07:10.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he called his disciples to him
and said to them:

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:14.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Truly I say to you that this poor widow
put in more than all the others

00:07:14.418 --> 00:07:17.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘who put money into the treasury chests.

00:07:17.546 --> 00:07:20.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘For they all put in out of their surplus,

00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:24.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but she, out of her want,
put in everything she had,

00:07:24.094 --> 00:07:26.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
all she had to live on.’”

00:07:28.057 --> 00:07:32.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
The coins of the needy widow
were worth about 15 minutes of wages.

00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:36.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, Jesus expressed
his Father’s view of her worship.

00:07:36.649 --> 00:07:40.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
He commended her whole-souled sacrifice.

00:07:40.611 --> 00:07:42.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we learn?

00:07:42.613 --> 00:07:46.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, clearly,
the lessons go far beyond material giving.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:51.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
Motive in our worship of Jehovah
is important to him.

00:07:51.914 --> 00:07:55.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah doesn’t compare us with others

00:07:55.459 --> 00:08:00.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even previous versions of ourselves
—younger versions of ourselves.

00:08:01.048 --> 00:08:04.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah simply wants love for him

00:08:04.218 --> 00:08:07.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our whole heart, soul,
mind, and strength,

00:08:07.263 --> 00:08:10.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
not as they were 10 or 20 years ago,

00:08:10.641 --> 00:08:12.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as they currently are now.

00:08:14.478 --> 00:08:18.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, a question
in reference to love for Jehovah,

00:08:18.065 --> 00:08:22.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it reasonable for Jehovah
to expect us to love him

00:08:22.528 --> 00:08:25.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
with our whole heart, soul,
mind, and strength?

00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:27.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it reasonable?

00:08:28.868 --> 00:08:30.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, absolutely.

00:08:30.828 --> 00:08:32.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why can we say that?

00:08:32.955 --> 00:08:36.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah loves us

00:08:36.417 --> 00:08:40.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his whole heart, soul,
mind, and strength.

00:08:40.546 --> 00:08:42.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:08:42.048 --> 00:08:46.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s turn
to Isaiah chapters 40 through 44,

00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there we’ll consider

00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:52.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
a few of the many reasons
we have to love Jehovah.

00:08:52.225 --> 00:08:54.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at the same time,
we’ll consider some examples

00:08:54.686 --> 00:08:58.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the depth of Jehovah’s love for us.

00:08:58.148 --> 00:09:02.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
So our first example is in Isaiah chapter 40,
and notice, please, verse 11.

00:09:04.654 --> 00:09:07.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 40:11—there it says:

00:09:07.324 --> 00:09:12.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Like a shepherd he will care for his flock.

00:09:12.329 --> 00:09:14.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With his arm
he will gather together the lambs,

00:09:14.706 --> 00:09:16.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and in his bosom he will carry them.

00:09:16.416 --> 00:09:19.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
He will gently lead
those nursing their young.”

00:09:19.336 --> 00:09:21.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we find
a beautiful word picture of Jehovah.

00:09:21.796 --> 00:09:24.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is a tender Shepherd.

00:09:26.593 --> 00:09:31.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ezekiel 34:15, 16, Jehovah says:

00:09:31.598 --> 00:09:33.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I myself will feed my sheep . . .

00:09:33.683 --> 00:09:36.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The lost one I will search for,
the stray I will bring back,

00:09:36.395 --> 00:09:39.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the injured I will bandage
[as we notice in the illustration],

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the weak I will strengthen.”

00:09:42.776 --> 00:09:46.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a touching picture
of compassion and tender care!

00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:50.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we fall and hurt ourselves

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:54.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if we stumble in the briar patch,
so to speak,

00:09:54.538 --> 00:09:56.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah bandages us.

00:09:56.999 --> 00:09:59.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helps us to heal.

00:09:59.168 --> 00:10:01.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we seek his help,
he doesn’t reproach us:

00:10:01.712 --> 00:10:03.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You should have known better.”

00:10:03.714 --> 00:10:05.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:10:05.424 --> 00:10:08.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he does try to help us
not to stray in the future

00:10:08.177 --> 00:10:10.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
with reminders from his Word.

00:10:10.179 --> 00:10:12.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what is the effect on the sheep?

00:10:12.181 --> 00:10:15.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as we saw in the illustration,
he feels secure in Jehovah’s care.

00:10:15.893 --> 00:10:19.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we feel in Jehovah’s care,
his compassionate care?

00:10:20.272 --> 00:10:21.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
We too feel secure.

00:10:21.649 --> 00:10:25.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might say that Jehovah loves us

00:10:25.861 --> 00:10:29.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all his heart—his compassion.

00:10:29.281 --> 00:10:32.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t that increase your love for him?

00:10:33.994 --> 00:10:37.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a second reason
that we have to love Jehovah.

00:10:37.498 --> 00:10:41.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah chapter 40
—notice verses 28 and 29.

00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:44.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 28 says:

00:10:44.714 --> 00:10:47.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do you not know?
Have you not heard?

00:10:47.049 --> 00:10:49.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah,
the Creator of the ends of the earth,

00:10:49.844 --> 00:10:52.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is a God for all eternity.

00:10:52.346 --> 00:10:55.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He never tires out or grows weary.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“His understanding is unsearchable.

00:10:57.852 --> 00:11:00.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He gives power to the tired one

00:11:00.229 --> 00:11:03.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and full might to those lacking strength.”

00:11:05.818 --> 00:11:08.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah’s mighty holy spirit,

00:11:08.613 --> 00:11:12.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
he created everything

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
—beginning with his firstborn Son

00:11:17.538 --> 00:11:20.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
to myriads of mighty spirit creatures

00:11:20.917 --> 00:11:22.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the vast universe

00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:24.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its trillions upon trillions of stars

00:11:24.754 --> 00:11:26.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
to this beautiful earth

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:29.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its endless variety
of plant and animal life

00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:31.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the human body

00:11:31.469 --> 00:11:35.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its awe-inspiring ability
and versatility.

00:11:35.056 --> 00:11:39.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is truly the Almighty Creator.

00:11:40.729 --> 00:11:43.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, think about this:

00:11:43.106 --> 00:11:45.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happens when you or I

00:11:45.608 --> 00:11:48.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
become completely exhausted,
completely tired?

00:11:48.945 --> 00:11:52.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe at the end of a long day
when a human becomes physically tired,

00:11:52.407 --> 00:11:54.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
how does he recharge?

00:11:54.034 --> 00:11:58.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we plug into a charging station
like an electric car?

00:11:58.622 --> 00:12:00.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:12:00.248 --> 00:12:04.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re marvelously designed
to recharge through rest

00:12:04.377 --> 00:12:07.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the food
that we take into our bodies, our fuel.

00:12:07.422 --> 00:12:10.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
The calories, the energy in food
are evidence of Jehovah’s love.

00:12:10.342 --> 00:12:13.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only does it recharge us

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:15.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it brings us delight too.

00:12:16.848 --> 00:12:21.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did you have for breakfast,
maybe here at the Assembly Hall?

00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:26.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
The average glazed doughnut
contains about 190 to 300 calories.

00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you’re not counting calories
during this annual meeting season.

00:12:34.575 --> 00:12:37.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever your choice,

00:12:37.161 --> 00:12:40.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
the energy and food is a gift of Almighty God

00:12:40.873 --> 00:12:43.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help sustain us, to recharge us.

00:12:45.878 --> 00:12:47.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now a question that we ask, though,

00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happens when we become tired

00:12:49.965 --> 00:12:53.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
of dealing with life’s trials,

00:12:53.552 --> 00:12:56.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe with problems
that don’t have a solution

00:12:56.013 --> 00:12:58.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this system of things?

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when we maintain
a good spiritual routine,

00:13:01.602 --> 00:13:06.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Jehovah gives us power
—“power to the tired one.”

00:13:06.565 --> 00:13:08.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
His holy spirit strengthens us,

00:13:08.609 --> 00:13:12.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
enables us to go forward
in the battle yet another day.

00:13:12.321 --> 00:13:16.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
The “power beyond what is normal”
strengthens us.

00:13:16.283 --> 00:13:19.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah gives power to the tired one.

00:13:19.078 --> 00:13:23.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might say that Jehovah loves us
with all his strength.

00:13:25.042 --> 00:13:27.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Doesn’t that draw you to him as a Person?

00:13:28.963 --> 00:13:31.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider another reason
we have to love Jehovah,

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:35.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
this time at Isaiah 41:10, 13.

00:13:38.806 --> 00:13:41.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
There our God says:

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:45.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:13:46.773 --> 00:13:50.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:13:50.026 --> 00:13:52.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:57.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will really hold on to you
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:13:58.451 --> 00:14:02.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 13:
“For I, Jehovah your God,

00:14:02.038 --> 00:14:05.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
“am grasping your right hand,

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the One saying to you,
‘Do not be afraid.

00:14:09.421 --> 00:14:11.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will help you.’”

00:14:12.799 --> 00:14:14.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is our Helper.

00:14:16.428 --> 00:14:19.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah grasps our right hand

00:14:19.723 --> 00:14:22.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
with his “right hand of righteousness.”

00:14:22.058 --> 00:14:27.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, he at times pulls us out
of distressing circumstances in life.

00:14:28.398 --> 00:14:31.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah rescued his people
from slavery in Egypt.

00:14:31.401 --> 00:14:33.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 63:9 says:

00:14:33.403 --> 00:14:36.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During all their distress
it was distressing to him. . . .

00:14:36.865 --> 00:14:40.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he lifted them up
and carried them all the days of old.”

00:14:43.163 --> 00:14:47.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
When was the last time
that Jehovah rescued you from a trial?

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:54.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Psalm 18,
David used very poetic language

00:14:54.299 --> 00:14:58.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
to describe Jehovah’s remarkable ability
to rescue us

00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:01.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Psalm 18:8-10:

00:15:01.181 --> 00:15:03.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Smoke ascended from his nostrils,

00:15:03.308 --> 00:15:05.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and a consuming fire
came from his mouth . . .

00:15:05.686 --> 00:15:07.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He made the heavens bend
as he descended,

00:15:07.729 --> 00:15:10.357 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and thick gloom was beneath his feet.

00:15:10.357 --> 00:15:12.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He rode on a cherub and came flying.

00:15:12.609 --> 00:15:14.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
He swooped down on the wings of a spirit.”

00:15:14.737 --> 00:15:18.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 16 says:
“He reached down from on high;

00:15:20.075 --> 00:15:24.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
he took hold of me
and pulled me from deep waters.”

00:15:25.581 --> 00:15:29.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 19:
“He brought me out into a place of safety;

00:15:29.043 --> 00:15:33.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
he rescued me
because he was pleased with me.”

00:15:36.425 --> 00:15:40.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine Jehovah reaching down
with his right hand of righteousness

00:15:40.304 --> 00:15:42.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rescuing you from a trial?

00:15:44.016 --> 00:15:46.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:15:46.185 --> 00:15:51.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah loves us
with all his soul, his whole being.

00:15:54.527 --> 00:15:56.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does that make you feel?

00:15:56.821 --> 00:15:59.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does it draw you closer
to your heavenly Father?

00:16:02.827 --> 00:16:06.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider a fourth reason
we have to love Jehovah.

00:16:06.706 --> 00:16:09.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 42:8, 9

00:16:12.044 --> 00:16:14.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
—it says:
“I am Jehovah.

00:16:14.505 --> 00:16:18.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is my name;
I give my glory to no one else,

00:16:18.134 --> 00:16:20.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor my praise to graven images.

00:16:20.887 --> 00:16:23.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“See, the first things have come to pass;

00:16:23.556 --> 00:16:25.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
“now I am declaring new things.

00:16:25.558 --> 00:16:28.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before they spring up,
I tell you about them.”

00:16:31.022 --> 00:16:33.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is this a reason to love Jehovah?

00:16:33.566 --> 00:16:35.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a God of prophecy.

00:16:35.568 --> 00:16:37.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean in simple terms?

00:16:37.278 --> 00:16:38.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah keeps his promises.

00:16:38.905 --> 00:16:41.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s linked to his name, Jehovah,

00:16:41.115 --> 00:16:45.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we understand to mean
“He Causes to Become.”

00:16:45.453 --> 00:16:47.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not one word of all his good promise

00:16:47.747 --> 00:16:51.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he made through Moses his servant
has failed.”

00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:54.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who said it?

00:16:56.256 --> 00:17:01.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Joshua and Solomon
both expressed similar thoughts.

00:17:01.261 --> 00:17:05.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now here we are,
3,000 years after Solomon.

00:17:07.184 --> 00:17:10.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have more reasons to say that;

00:17:10.187 --> 00:17:12.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
more prophecies
have been fulfilled since then.

00:17:12.564 --> 00:17:15.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s Kingdom rules.

00:17:15.275 --> 00:17:17.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pure worship has been restored.

00:17:17.527 --> 00:17:19.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can emphatically say:

00:17:19.529 --> 00:17:23.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Not one word of all Jehovah’s good promises
has failed.’

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:28.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does that make us love him more?

00:17:29.414 --> 00:17:33.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, prophecy is the basis for hope.

00:17:33.210 --> 00:17:35.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we hear Isaiah 33:24

00:17:35.796 --> 00:17:38.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
or John 5:28, 29

00:17:38.423 --> 00:17:41.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
or Revelation 21:3, 4,

00:17:41.468 --> 00:17:42.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
we think about the effect

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:47.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the disappearance
of sickness, pain, and death

00:17:47.266 --> 00:17:51.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
will have for us and for our loved ones.

00:17:54.148 --> 00:17:57.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
The resurrection

00:17:57.568 --> 00:18:00.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
—do you long to welcome back loved ones?

00:18:02.281 --> 00:18:04.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s as good as done.

00:18:05.784 --> 00:18:08.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s personal name is a guarantee.

00:18:08.579 --> 00:18:11.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah “makes the dead alive

00:18:11.957 --> 00:18:14.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and calls the things that are not
as though they are.”

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:15.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:18:15.753 --> 00:18:20.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because his promises
are absolutely certain (a fulfillment).

00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:27.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Jeremiah 29:11,
there Jehovah says:

00:18:27.181 --> 00:18:31.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I well know the thoughts
that I am thinking toward you, . . .

00:18:31.435 --> 00:18:35.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
thoughts of peace, and not of calamity,
to give you a future and a hope.”

00:18:35.982 --> 00:18:39.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might say Jehovah loves us
with all his mind.

00:18:39.986 --> 00:18:44.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will make
his very own thoughts toward you a reality.

00:18:45.783 --> 00:18:48.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does that make you feel?

00:18:48.494 --> 00:18:50.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, from Isaiah’s prophecy,

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:53.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve considered just four reasons
to love Jehovah.

00:18:53.332 --> 00:18:55.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, he’s our Shepherd;

00:18:55.334 --> 00:18:57.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
second, he’s our Creator;

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:01.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
third, he’s our Helper;
and finally, he’s a God of prophecy.

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:03.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, you can think of other reasons
to love Jehovah.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note what a few individuals said

00:19:05.303 --> 00:19:08.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
when asked why they
particularly loved Jehovah.

00:19:08.056 --> 00:19:12.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother said, “I love Jehovah
because he listens to my prayers.”

00:19:12.977 --> 00:19:15.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister said:
“Jehovah is approachable.

00:19:15.772 --> 00:19:20.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s a privilege to have a friend
whom I can talk to at any moment of the day

00:19:20.026 --> 00:19:22.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
and know that he will understand me.”

00:19:22.904 --> 00:19:26.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another sister said:
“Because of all the things he made

00:19:26.324 --> 00:19:30.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for absolutely no reason
except that he loves us.

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We don’t need to taste food to survive.

00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:36.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The sunset doesn’t need to be beautiful.

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:38.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Music doesn’t have to exist.

00:19:38.878 --> 00:19:40.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But it does.

00:19:40.881 --> 00:19:42.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“One reason I love Jehovah is

00:19:42.883 --> 00:19:47.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he goes above and beyond
in his love for us.”

00:19:48.972 --> 00:19:53.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another brother said this,
“I love Jehovah for his forgiveness.”

00:19:54.853 --> 00:19:58.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, really, doesn’t that bring to our minds
Jehovah’s greatest expression of love,

00:19:58.774 --> 00:20:02.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
the ransom sacrifice of his Son, Jesus?

00:20:02.694 --> 00:20:06.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question for each of us is,
‘Why do I love Jehovah?’

00:20:06.406 --> 00:20:08.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do you love Jehovah?

00:20:09.868 --> 00:20:13.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what does our love motivate us to do?

00:20:13.121 --> 00:20:17.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s linked with the words of Isaiah 43:10.

00:20:19.878 --> 00:20:22.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 43:10, Jehovah says:

00:20:22.047 --> 00:20:25.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are my witnesses, . . .

00:20:25.175 --> 00:20:28.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, my servant whom I have chosen.”

00:20:28.262 --> 00:20:30.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
How thrilling it must have been in 1931

00:20:30.848 --> 00:20:35.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
to hear Brother Rutherford
express the new name

00:20:35.561 --> 00:20:40.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve come to cherish (1931),
Jehovah’s Witnesses!

00:20:40.608 --> 00:20:43.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for what purpose
has Jehovah chosen us as his Witnesses?

00:20:43.527 --> 00:20:47.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
There, in Isaiah chapter 43,
notice verse 21—it says:

00:20:47.198 --> 00:20:49.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The people whom I formed for myself

00:20:49.533 --> 00:20:52.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they might declare my praise.”

00:20:52.453 --> 00:20:55.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has chosen us to declare his praise.

00:20:55.456 --> 00:20:59.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love Jehovah; praise Jehovah.

00:20:59.835 --> 00:21:01.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a privilege!

00:21:03.047 --> 00:21:05.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could use rocks;
he could use trees;

00:21:05.341 --> 00:21:07.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could use birds;
he could use beasts of the field.

00:21:07.677 --> 00:21:10.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no, he’s chosen his faithful servants.

00:21:10.513 --> 00:21:15.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s chosen you and me to declare his praise.

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:17.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently on a trip
to the western United States,

00:21:17.478 --> 00:21:20.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
my wife and I were able to observe

00:21:20.148 --> 00:21:23.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
bison, elk, and moose

00:21:23.401 --> 00:21:25.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
—from a safe distance, of course.

00:21:27.071 --> 00:21:31.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re humongous, very powerful animals.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what if Jehovah had chosen one of them
to declare his praise?

00:21:34.287 --> 00:21:37.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every time you would approach they would say,
“Praise Jah.”

00:21:41.586 --> 00:21:43.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he hasn’t.

00:21:47.008 --> 00:21:49.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
They just eat grass.

00:21:49.385 --> 00:21:51.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
They praise Jehovah in a different way.

00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the fact of the matter is
that Jehovah has chosen us

00:21:57.936 --> 00:22:00.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
to declare his praise,

00:22:00.146 --> 00:22:03.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
to extol his virtues.

00:22:03.358 --> 00:22:07.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah isn’t looking for programmed praise
or forced or coerced praise

00:22:07.904 --> 00:22:11.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
but praise that comes
from a heart full of love.

00:22:11.408 --> 00:22:15.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love for God’s remarkable qualities
motivates us

00:22:15.161 --> 00:22:18.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
to tell the whole world
about our great God.

00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:20.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
But many don’t want to listen.

00:22:20.208 --> 00:22:23.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if we face opposition
even from governments?

00:22:23.170 --> 00:22:25.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isaiah 44:8

00:22:27.299 --> 00:22:29.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
is what we need to keep in mind

00:22:29.384 --> 00:22:34.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
because, as we’ve considered
already during this program,

00:22:34.222 --> 00:22:39.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
the time will come when we’re going
to face opposition (Isaiah 44:8);

00:22:39.019 --> 00:22:42.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of our brothers in many places
are already facing opposition.

00:22:42.105 --> 00:22:44.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what it says
 “Do not be in dread,

00:22:44.483 --> 00:22:46.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and do not become paralyzed
with fear.

00:22:46.985 --> 00:22:49.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have I not told each of you beforehand
and declared it?

00:22:49.655 --> 00:22:51.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You are my witnesses.

00:22:51.657 --> 00:22:53.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is there any God but me?

00:22:53.659 --> 00:22:56.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, there is no other Rock; I know of none.”

00:22:57.913 --> 00:22:59.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah says:

00:22:59.915 --> 00:23:03.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be in dread . . .
Do not become paralyzed with fear.”

00:23:05.087 --> 00:23:09.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Pay back . . . Caesar’s things to Caesar,
but God’s things to God.”

00:23:09.341 --> 00:23:11.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
Caesar is on shaky ground

00:23:11.343 --> 00:23:15.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he interferes with what God requires.

00:23:15.014 --> 00:23:17.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
So rather than being paralyzed with fear,

00:23:17.224 --> 00:23:21.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
love for Jehovah conquers fear
and moves us to continue praising him.

00:23:22.855 --> 00:23:26.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ve seen such determination
in our international family of Witnesses.

00:23:26.775 --> 00:23:29.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
A faithful sister named Tatyana

00:23:29.695 --> 00:23:32.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
—her criminal case for praising Jehovah
is pending.

00:23:32.948 --> 00:23:36.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
And her husband
is currently in pretrial detention.

00:23:36.452 --> 00:23:39.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she says:
“During the most difficult moments,

00:23:39.163 --> 00:23:41.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I continue to sense that Jehovah is with me

00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:44.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I feel confident that with his help

00:23:44.377 --> 00:23:47.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can endure whatever trials may yet come.

00:23:47.755 --> 00:23:52.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
“My heart is filled with peace and calmness.

00:23:52.385 --> 00:23:56.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I am more determined than ever
to tell others about Jehovah.

00:23:56.097 --> 00:24:00.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am proud to be one of Jehovah’s Witnesses!”

00:24:00.435 --> 00:24:03.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Tatyana’s love for Jehovah

00:24:03.104 --> 00:24:06.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
moves her to continue praising him.

00:24:08.276 --> 00:24:10.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible doesn’t tell us

00:24:10.403 --> 00:24:14.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
how many hours we have to share
in the ministry each month,

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:17.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it does tell us that love for God

00:24:17.577 --> 00:24:19.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be our motivation.

00:24:19.621 --> 00:24:22.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greater our love,
the fuller our share will be

00:24:22.081 --> 00:24:24.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
in accord with our personal circumstances.

00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:27.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prove that we are Jehovah’s Witnesses
by our conduct

00:24:27.587 --> 00:24:31.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by our zeal
in praising him formally and informally.

00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
May our deep love for Jehovah

00:24:33.093 --> 00:24:36.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
move us to tell as many people as possible

00:24:36.054 --> 00:24:38.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
about our great God, Jehovah.

00:24:39.849 --> 00:24:41.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for the next three talks
of this symposium,

00:24:41.851 --> 00:24:46.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first will discuss how love for Jehovah
motivated his people in ancient times.

00:24:46.773 --> 00:24:48.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second and the third talk will discuss

00:24:48.900 --> 00:24:52.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
how love for Jehovah
motivates his people in modern times

00:24:52.654 --> 00:24:54.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, finally,

00:24:54.281 --> 00:24:57.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the second greatest commandment
should motivate us.

00:24:58.451 --> 00:25:01.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we hear some adjustments?

00:25:01.413 --> 00:25:04.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we consider
a fresh approach to our ministry?

00:25:05.709 --> 00:25:07.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Stay tuned!

00:25:07.753 --> 00:25:10.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we’ll give our attention
to Brother Gerrit Lösch,

00:25:10.047 --> 00:25:12.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,
who will discuss the theme

00:25:12.632 --> 00:25:15.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Love for Jehovah—In Ancient Times.”

00:25:27.439 --> 00:25:32.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us appreciate and enjoy
receiving a gift,

00:25:32.444 --> 00:25:37.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to be able to give a gift to others
brings us even more joy.

00:25:38.659 --> 00:25:41.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
As the Great Giver of all good things,

00:25:41.495 --> 00:25:46.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah rejoices in giving
and wants humans to enjoy giving.

00:25:47.334 --> 00:25:49.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is the first Giver.

00:25:49.336 --> 00:25:51.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is the greatest Giver.

00:25:51.589 --> 00:25:55.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave life to spirit sons and to humans.

00:25:55.217 --> 00:25:57.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave Adam a lovely wife.

00:25:57.636 --> 00:26:00.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave them a paradise to live in.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
In turn, Adam and Eve
were given the opportunity

00:26:04.185 --> 00:26:09.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give of their time and energy
to take care of their earthly home

00:26:09.023 --> 00:26:11.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to spread the garden of Eden

00:26:11.525 --> 00:26:16.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a global paradise
inhabited by righteous humans.

00:26:17.990 --> 00:26:22.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later in human history,
Jehovah created the nation of Israel

00:26:22.203 --> 00:26:27.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
and gave them a beautiful land
full of good things.

00:26:27.041 --> 00:26:30.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
How could the Israelites
show their appreciation?

00:26:30.795 --> 00:26:35.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah again provided
an opportunity for his people to give;

00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:40.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this case,
he gave them a command to tithe.

00:26:41.389 --> 00:26:42.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is that?

00:26:42.849 --> 00:26:46.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
To tithe means
to give a tenth of something.

00:26:46.561 --> 00:26:48.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Israelites were to give Jehovah

00:26:48.688 --> 00:26:52.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
a tenth of all their produce and animals.

00:26:52.942 --> 00:26:54.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can read that account

00:26:54.944 --> 00:26:59.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Leviticus 27:30, 32.

00:27:00.783 --> 00:27:04.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
Follow me as I read from the screen.

00:27:04.287 --> 00:27:06.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 30 says:

00:27:06.956 --> 00:27:09.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Every tenth part of the land,

00:27:09.459 --> 00:27:13.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
“whether from the produce of the field
or the fruit of the trees,

00:27:13.797 --> 00:27:15.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
“belongs to Jehovah.

00:27:15.924 --> 00:27:18.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is something holy to Jehovah.”

00:27:19.594 --> 00:27:21.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 32 says:

00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:25.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As for every tenth part
of the herd and flock,

00:27:25.350 --> 00:27:28.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
“everything that passes
under the shepherd’s staff,

00:27:28.562 --> 00:27:33.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tenth animal should become
something holy to Jehovah.”

00:27:34.818 --> 00:27:36.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice that Jehovah said

00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:41.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tithe was a holy gift
that belonged to him?

00:27:41.783 --> 00:27:45.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet,
what did Jehovah do with that tithe?

00:27:45.579 --> 00:27:48.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
He generously gave it,
or passed it on,

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:50.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the tribe of the Levites,

00:27:50.542 --> 00:27:53.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had no land inheritance.

00:27:53.629 --> 00:27:57.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, follow along on the screen

00:27:57.090 --> 00:28:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
as I read Numbers 18:21:

00:28:01.803 --> 00:28:04.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now see that I have given
to the sons of Levi

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:08.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“every tenth part in Israel
as an inheritance

00:28:08.393 --> 00:28:11.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in return for the service
they are carrying out,

00:28:11.939 --> 00:28:14.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
the service of the tent of meeting.”

00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:17.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 24 says:

00:28:17.361 --> 00:28:20.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For I have given to the Levites
as an inheritance

00:28:20.364 --> 00:28:24.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the tenth part contributed
by the people of Israel,

00:28:24.118 --> 00:28:27.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“which they will contribute to Jehovah.

00:28:27.162 --> 00:28:31.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That is why I have said to them,
‘In the midst of the Israelites,

00:28:31.876 --> 00:28:35.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
they should not take possession
of an inheritance.’”

00:28:36.338 --> 00:28:38.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think how this arrangement

00:28:38.591 --> 00:28:41.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
proved to be a blessing to the Levites,

00:28:41.552 --> 00:28:44.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
who devoted their time and attention

00:28:44.054 --> 00:28:46.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s service at the tabernacle.

00:28:48.225 --> 00:28:52.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
The arrangement also proved
to be a blessing to all Israel,

00:28:52.647 --> 00:28:56.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have one tribe completely devoted

00:28:56.567 --> 00:29:00.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
to caring for the tabernacle
and, later, the temple of Jehovah.

00:29:02.448 --> 00:29:04.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how would the Levites show

00:29:04.450 --> 00:29:08.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
their appreciation and love to Jehovah?

00:29:08.704 --> 00:29:12.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
They also were commanded to tithe.

00:29:12.250 --> 00:29:16.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to verses 26-29,

00:29:16.212 --> 00:29:20.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
they would contribute a tenth
of their contributions,

00:29:20.258 --> 00:29:25.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
which they received,
to the Aaronic priests for their support.

00:29:26.931 --> 00:29:29.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems the Israelites were also required

00:29:29.183 --> 00:29:33.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
to set aside an additional tenth
to cover the expense

00:29:33.146 --> 00:29:37.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
of attending
the three national festivals to Jehovah.

00:29:38.359 --> 00:29:43.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Every third and sixth year
these funds were given to the Levites,

00:29:43.114 --> 00:29:47.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
alien residents, widows,
and fatherless boys

00:29:47.368 --> 00:29:49.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the local community.

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:55.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned
about giving and tithing?

00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:58.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have seen,
the tithing arrangement

00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:02.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
provided a wonderful way for God’s people

00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:06.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show their love
and appreciation for Jehovah

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:08.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to support pure worship.

00:30:09.933 --> 00:30:13.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine also how those who were disadvantaged

00:30:13.645 --> 00:30:18.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the alien residents, widows,
and fatherless boys—

00:30:18.108 --> 00:30:22.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
also appreciated this loving provision!

00:30:22.029 --> 00:30:26.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you know
there was something else very interesting

00:30:26.199 --> 00:30:28.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the tithing arrangement?

00:30:28.535 --> 00:30:30.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nowhere in the Scriptures did Jehovah arrange

00:30:30.996 --> 00:30:33.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
for any human to monitor

00:30:33.373 --> 00:30:37.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
whether each person
was really giving the entire tenth

00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:41.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his produce and his animals.

00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:44.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no one was assigned to enforce

00:30:44.051 --> 00:30:46.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
compliance with the tithing arrangement.

00:30:48.388 --> 00:30:51.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
So although it was required by law,

00:30:51.141 --> 00:30:53.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
tithing was entirely

00:30:53.185 --> 00:30:56.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
between the individual Israelite and Jehovah.

00:30:58.607 --> 00:31:01.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, the arrangement
allowed each Israelite

00:31:01.277 --> 00:31:05.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
to demonstrate his personal love for Jehovah.

00:31:07.199 --> 00:31:10.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if somebody secretly held back

00:31:10.411 --> 00:31:13.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and did not give Jehovah the whole tithe,

00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:15.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps giving less than a tenth?

00:31:16.709 --> 00:31:18.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would Jehovah feel about that?

00:31:19.795 --> 00:31:24.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would he be inclined
to bless those who were stingy?

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:27.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not likely.

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:30.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,
how would Jehovah feel about those

00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:35.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
who generously gave
even more than a tenth?

00:31:35.186 --> 00:31:38.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we don’t have to guess.

00:31:38.314 --> 00:31:42.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember when faithful King Hezekiah
promoted pure worship

00:31:42.818 --> 00:31:45.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encouraged tithing?

00:31:45.196 --> 00:31:46.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
What happened?

00:31:46.823 --> 00:31:51.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see at 2 Chronicles 31:4-6:

00:31:52.745 --> 00:31:54.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Furthermore,

00:31:54.038 --> 00:31:56.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he commanded the people living in Jerusalem

00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:58.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to give the portion due

00:31:58.793 --> 00:32:00.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the priests and the Levites,

00:32:00.878 --> 00:32:02.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that they might adhere strictly

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the law of Jehovah.

00:32:05.967 --> 00:32:09.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As soon as the order was issued,

00:32:09.095 --> 00:32:12.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the Israelites gave in great quantities

00:32:12.056 --> 00:32:14.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the firstfruits of the grain, new wine,

00:32:14.976 --> 00:32:16.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
“oil, and honey,

00:32:16.978 --> 00:32:20.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and of all the produce of the field;

00:32:20.064 --> 00:32:22.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
“they brought in abundantly

00:32:22.066 --> 00:32:24.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the tenth of everything.

00:32:24.778 --> 00:32:26.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the people of Israel and of Judah

00:32:26.780 --> 00:32:28.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“living in the cities of Judah

00:32:28.782 --> 00:32:31.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
“also brought in
the tenth of cattle and sheep

00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:34.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the tenth of the holy things

00:32:34.287 --> 00:32:37.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that were sanctified to Jehovah their God.

00:32:37.332 --> 00:32:41.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
They brought it in and put it in many heaps.”

00:32:41.753 --> 00:32:46.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how did Jehovah feel
about the generosity of his people?

00:32:46.174 --> 00:32:49.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s note verses 9 and 10:

00:32:49.636 --> 00:32:54.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hezekiah asked the priests and the Levites
about the heaps,

00:32:54.015 --> 00:32:57.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Azariah the chief priest
of the house of Zadok

00:32:57.227 --> 00:32:59.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“said to him:

00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:02.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘From the time
they started bringing the contributions

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘into the house of Jehovah,

00:33:04.359 --> 00:33:07.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the people have been eating to satisfaction

00:33:07.613 --> 00:33:10.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and there is still an abundant surplus,

00:33:10.532 --> 00:33:13.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘for Jehovah has blessed his people,

00:33:13.076 --> 00:33:16.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this great plenty is left over.’”

00:33:17.289 --> 00:33:20.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah richly blessed faithful ones

00:33:20.375 --> 00:33:23.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
who generously supported
the tithing arrangement.

00:33:24.838 --> 00:33:27.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sadly,
Israel eventually lost their generous spirit

00:33:27.841 --> 00:33:30.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
and neglected the tithe.

00:33:30.427 --> 00:33:33.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
So some years later,

00:33:33.263 --> 00:33:35.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah inspired the prophet Malachi

00:33:35.975 --> 00:33:38.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remind the nation

00:33:38.185 --> 00:33:41.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
of their privilege of giving.

00:33:41.313 --> 00:33:43.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah say?

00:33:43.899 --> 00:33:47.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see at Malachi 3:10:

00:33:48.821 --> 00:33:52.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Bring the entire tithe into the storehouse,

00:33:52.074 --> 00:33:54.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that there may be food in my house;

00:33:54.785 --> 00:33:58.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and test me out, please, in this regard,’

00:33:58.456 --> 00:34:00.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah of armies says,

00:34:00.708 --> 00:34:02.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘to see whether I will not open to you

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:05.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the floodgates of the heavens

00:34:05.046 --> 00:34:07.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and pour out on you a blessing

00:34:07.423 --> 00:34:09.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
until there is nothing lacking.’”

00:34:10.843 --> 00:34:12.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine that?

00:34:12.303 --> 00:34:17.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was as if Jehovah
was challenging each Israelite to test him.

00:34:17.892 --> 00:34:22.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Jehovah really bless those
who gave him the full tithe,

00:34:22.605 --> 00:34:25.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they lacked nothing?

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:28.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, absolutely!

00:34:28.778 --> 00:34:31.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, of course,
we are no longer under the Mosaic Law,

00:34:31.989 --> 00:34:34.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its tithing requirement.

00:34:34.158 --> 00:34:38.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than being commanded
to give a tenth of our income,

00:34:38.705 --> 00:34:42.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
2 Corinthians 9:7 says:

00:34:43.334 --> 00:34:45.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Let each one do

00:34:45.503 --> 00:34:48.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as he has resolved in his heart,

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not grudgingly or under compulsion,

00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:54.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God loves a cheerful giver.”

00:34:55.805 --> 00:35:00.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned
from our brief discussion of tithing?

00:35:00.393 --> 00:35:04.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Jehovah created us
to find joy in giving.

00:35:04.773 --> 00:35:08.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we give generously
of our time and resources

00:35:08.276 --> 00:35:11.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we love Jehovah,

00:35:11.071 --> 00:35:15.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because someone is observing
and keeping track of what we do.

00:35:17.202 --> 00:35:20.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also learned
that Jehovah richly blesses obedience

00:35:20.205 --> 00:35:24.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
that comes from hearts full of love for him.

00:35:24.292 --> 00:35:27.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is there more we can learn

00:35:27.504 --> 00:35:31.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s dealings with ancient Israel?

00:35:31.466 --> 00:35:35.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we can learn
from the Nazirite arrangement.

00:35:36.346 --> 00:35:38.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:43.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Nazirite arrangement
is described in Numbers chapter 6.

00:35:43.145 --> 00:35:47.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read chapter 6, verses 1 and 2.

00:35:48.442 --> 00:35:49.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:35:50.694 --> 00:35:54.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah spoke further to Moses and said:

00:35:54.323 --> 00:35:57.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Speak to the Israelites and tell them,

00:35:57.159 --> 00:35:59.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“If a man or a woman takes a special vow

00:35:59.953 --> 00:36:02.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live as a Nazirite to Jehovah, . . .”’”

00:36:03.707 --> 00:36:06.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that Israelites,
both men and women,

00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:09.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
could volunteer to become a Nazirite.

00:36:09.588 --> 00:36:12.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
This meant that they had to meet
certain requirements

00:36:12.883 --> 00:36:16.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were not imposed
on Israelites in general.

00:36:17.096 --> 00:36:20.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were those requirements?

00:36:20.057 --> 00:36:24.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Numbers 6:3-7 explains

00:36:24.144 --> 00:36:26.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Nazirites had to

00:36:26.313 --> 00:36:31.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) avoid alcohol
and “anything made from the grapevine,”

00:36:32.027 --> 00:36:34.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
(2) avoid cutting their hair,

00:36:35.406 --> 00:36:38.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (3) avoid touching a dead body.

00:36:38.909 --> 00:36:42.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
By voluntarily submitting
to these additional requirements,

00:36:42.622 --> 00:36:47.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nazirites demonstrated
their love for Jehovah in a special way.

00:36:47.501 --> 00:36:49.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:54.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine that you hire someone
to perform repair work on your house.

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:56.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
After performing the repair,

00:36:56.636 --> 00:36:59.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
the worker notices
other repairs that are needed,

00:36:59.931 --> 00:37:03.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he tells you he will do those as well

00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:06.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and at no additional charge.

00:37:06.062 --> 00:37:09.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel about this worker?

00:37:09.065 --> 00:37:12.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you not appreciate his extra efforts

00:37:12.610 --> 00:37:15.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
to go beyond what he was asked to do?

00:37:16.823 --> 00:37:20.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might even give him extra pay.

00:37:20.034 --> 00:37:23.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how would the worker feel?

00:37:23.454 --> 00:37:26.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he is a generous person,

00:37:26.124 --> 00:37:31.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will experience the joy
of giving more than what was asked.

00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:34.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same was true of the Nazirites.

00:37:34.758 --> 00:37:38.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not require anyone
to become a Nazirite.

00:37:38.762 --> 00:37:41.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
But he created this arrangement.

00:37:41.014 --> 00:37:42.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently,
he knew that some faithful Israelites

00:37:45.393 --> 00:37:49.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
would voluntarily submit
to extra requirements

00:37:49.773 --> 00:37:53.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
out of their great love for him.

00:37:53.109 --> 00:37:55.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And their appreciation for Jehovah

00:37:55.195 --> 00:37:58.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
would prompt them
to do even more for him.

00:38:00.075 --> 00:38:03.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt
this brought joy to Jehovah’s heart,

00:38:03.328 --> 00:38:08.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see his people manifest
a generous, appreciative spirit in this way.

00:38:09.376 --> 00:38:12.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what can we learn
from the Nazirite arrangement?

00:38:13.422 --> 00:38:16.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
That Jehovah
deeply appreciates and favors those

00:38:16.842 --> 00:38:19.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
who show their love for him

00:38:19.386 --> 00:38:23.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
by going beyond what is required.

00:38:23.307 --> 00:38:25.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, this is true of ones

00:38:25.392 --> 00:38:30.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
who have the circumstances to pioneer

00:38:30.272 --> 00:38:34.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who are able to serve
as volunteers at branch offices

00:38:34.610 --> 00:38:37.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in other theocratic assignments.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we know,
Jehovah discontinued the Mosaic Law,

00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:45.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
with its provisions
for tithing, for Nazirites,

00:38:45.663 --> 00:38:48.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for the many animal sacrifices.

00:38:48.624 --> 00:38:53.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 2:14 says that Jehovah

00:38:53.128 --> 00:38:57.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
“erased the handwritten document,”
that is, the Law covenant.

00:38:57.883 --> 00:39:01.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, are there lessons we can learn

00:39:01.178 --> 00:39:03.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
from these past arrangements

00:39:03.347 --> 00:39:06.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
for supporting pure worship?

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:07.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:39:07.518 --> 00:39:10.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
Romans 15:4 reminds us

00:39:10.896 --> 00:39:13.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “all the things
that were written beforehand

00:39:13.941 --> 00:39:16.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
were written for our instruction.”

00:39:18.362 --> 00:39:21.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
So does Jehovah’s organization today

00:39:21.032 --> 00:39:23.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
benefit from the principles

00:39:23.075 --> 00:39:26.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
behind the tithing and Nazirite arrangements?

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:29.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do we as individuals

00:39:29.999 --> 00:39:34.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
support modern-day arrangements
for pure worship?

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:36.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
And does a closer examination

00:39:36.172 --> 00:39:39.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the arrangements
for pure worship in ancient Israel

00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:43.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicate a need
for further adjustments today?

00:39:44.639 --> 00:39:47.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the answers to these questions,

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us give our attention
to Brother Samuel Herd,

00:39:49.769 --> 00:39:51.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

00:39:51.813 --> 00:39:54.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will share the next talk
in this symposium,

00:39:54.440 --> 00:39:59.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled
“Love for Jehovah—In Modern Times.”

00:40:12.751 --> 00:40:15.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you listened to Brother Lösch
discuss the arrangements

00:40:15.754 --> 00:40:18.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
for tithing and Naziriteship,

00:40:18.673 --> 00:40:21.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
did you try to make
a connection with arrangements

00:40:21.384 --> 00:40:23.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have for modern-day worship?

00:40:25.055 --> 00:40:30.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you were wondering,
‘What corresponds to tithing today?’

00:40:30.018 --> 00:40:31.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Brother Lösch mentioned,

00:40:31.978 --> 00:40:35.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
although tithing
was a requirement for the Israelites,

00:40:35.524 --> 00:40:39.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
it also provided Jehovah’s people
with regular opportunities

00:40:39.778 --> 00:40:43.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
to demonstrate their love for Jehovah

00:40:43.115 --> 00:40:46.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
by giving him their best.

00:40:46.702 --> 00:40:50.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we no longer
have a fixed amount of our income

00:40:50.831 --> 00:40:53.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we are commanded to give to Jehovah.

00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:57.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
The tithing arrangement
ended with the Mosaic Law,

00:40:57.129 --> 00:41:00.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Galatians 6:2

00:41:00.257 --> 00:41:04.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
says we are now
under “the law of the Christ.”

00:41:04.136 --> 00:41:06.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
True Christians today give Jehovah

00:41:06.388 --> 00:41:11.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘just as they have resolved in their hearts.’

00:41:12.686 --> 00:41:15.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the tithing arrangement
illustrates something

00:41:15.355 --> 00:41:19.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah still expects
of his people today.

00:41:19.068 --> 00:41:22.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, the tithe was to be,
not just a tenth,

00:41:22.905 --> 00:41:26.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the best tenth of a person’s produce

00:41:26.325 --> 00:41:28.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his animals.

00:41:28.369 --> 00:41:33.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah deserves nothing less
than our very best.

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:37.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
With that in mind,
how can we give Jehovah our very best?

00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:42.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we try hard
to obey all of Jehovah’s commands.

00:41:42.466 --> 00:41:44.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is one command

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:48.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
that stands out as an identifying mark

00:41:48.222 --> 00:41:50.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
of true Christians today.

00:41:50.641 --> 00:41:52.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:41:52.268 --> 00:41:54.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read it together on the screen

00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:59.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 28:19, 20.

00:41:59.901 --> 00:42:01.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:42:01.944 --> 00:42:03.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go, therefore,

00:42:03.779 --> 00:42:07.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and make disciples of people
of all the nations,

00:42:07.909 --> 00:42:11.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
“baptizing them in the name of the Father

00:42:11.037 --> 00:42:14.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and of the Son and of the holy spirit,

00:42:14.624 --> 00:42:17.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
“teaching them to observe all the things

00:42:17.668 --> 00:42:19.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have commanded you.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And look!
I am with you all the days

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:27.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
until the conclusion
of the system of things.”

00:42:28.721 --> 00:42:32.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Were you surprised that we read that verse?

00:42:32.809 --> 00:42:34.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:38.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see from these verses
that the disciple-making work

00:42:38.022 --> 00:42:41.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a requirement for all Christians.

00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:46.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you dear brothers and sisters
have built your lives around that scripture.

00:42:47.115 --> 00:42:50.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have given and continue to give

00:42:50.535 --> 00:42:53.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
your very best to obey

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
this lifesaving command.

00:42:56.374 --> 00:42:58.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we commend you for that.

00:43:00.462 --> 00:43:04.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization
has always been interested

00:43:04.466 --> 00:43:07.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
in seeing how this great worldwide work

00:43:07.719 --> 00:43:10.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been progressing.

00:43:10.263 --> 00:43:14.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
We enjoy seeing
our annual report published each year

00:43:14.976 --> 00:43:19.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we see the number
of Kingdom publishers increasing.

00:43:19.773 --> 00:43:23.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
The worldwide report helps the Governing Body

00:43:23.068 --> 00:43:26.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see where to send missionaries,

00:43:26.196 --> 00:43:29.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
special pioneers, and pioneers.

00:43:29.616 --> 00:43:33.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s watch a video
that highlights how Jehovah’s people

00:43:33.203 --> 00:43:37.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
have taken this commission
seriously over the years.

00:43:40.294 --> 00:43:44.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
When did we begin reporting
field service activity?

00:43:53.599 --> 00:43:55.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prior to 1920,

00:43:55.351 --> 00:43:58.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
only colporteurs,
as pioneers were then called,

00:43:58.604 --> 00:44:00.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
were asked to submit reports.

00:44:03.067 --> 00:44:05.194 line:10% position:50% align:center
But beginning in 1920,

00:44:05.194 --> 00:44:08.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
everyone in the congregation
who participated in the witness work

00:44:08.364 --> 00:44:11.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
was asked to turn in a weekly report.

00:44:13.536 --> 00:44:17.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 1920 annual service report
for the United States

00:44:17.289 --> 00:44:19.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the first to include the activity

00:44:19.333 --> 00:44:21.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
of congregation publishers.

00:44:21.377 --> 00:44:23.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
That report revealed

00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:28.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there were 8,052 class workers, or publishers,

00:44:28.175 --> 00:44:32.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 350 pioneers active in the preaching work.

00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:35.558 line:10% position:50% align:center
Twice a year during the late 1920’s,

00:44:35.558 --> 00:44:37.059 line:10% position:50% align:center
one week was designated

00:44:37.059 --> 00:44:40.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a special worldwide witnessing campaign.

00:44:40.354 --> 00:44:44.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pioneers had a goal of 40 hours
for that special week.

00:44:47.361 --> 00:44:49.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
In January 1939,

00:44:49.947 --> 00:44:53.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
a suggestion was placed
before congregation publishers:

00:44:53.868 --> 00:44:57.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
a goal of 60 hours per month.

00:44:57.664 --> 00:44:59.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Early on,

00:44:59.707 --> 00:45:02.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
congregation field service reports were

00:45:02.877 --> 00:45:04.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
thorough.

00:45:04.462 --> 00:45:06.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the years, the forms used

00:45:06.631 --> 00:45:08.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to report publisher’s field service activity

00:45:08.883 --> 00:45:10.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been simplified.

00:45:10.510 --> 00:45:12.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reports have consistently included

00:45:12.554 --> 00:45:14.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
back calls, or return visits;

00:45:14.639 --> 00:45:16.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Bible studies;

00:45:16.099 --> 00:45:17.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
publication placements;

00:45:17.642 --> 00:45:20.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hours spent in the disciple-making work.

00:45:20.854 --> 00:45:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
As was the case back then,

00:45:23.273 --> 00:45:25.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s always a story

00:45:25.358 --> 00:45:27.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
behind a field service report.

00:45:27.652 --> 00:45:30.363 line:10% position:50% align:center
The first time I walked into a Kingdom Hall

00:45:30.363 --> 00:45:31.906 line:10% position:50% align:center
when I was 16,

00:45:31.906 --> 00:45:34.367 line:10% position:50% align:center
I saw this chart on the stage

00:45:34.367 --> 00:45:36.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I realized

00:45:36.244 --> 00:45:38.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
this organization is concerned

00:45:38.246 --> 00:45:40.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what we do,

00:45:40.332 --> 00:45:41.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we say,

00:45:41.917 --> 00:45:44.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how much we say about Jehovah.

00:45:44.669 --> 00:45:47.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized that from the start.

00:45:47.255 --> 00:45:49.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
So after the third month of studying,

00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:51.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I started going out in field service,

00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to turn my time in too.

00:45:53.804 --> 00:45:55.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they showed me how to do it,

00:45:55.305 --> 00:45:57.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’ve been turning it in ever since.

00:45:58.892 --> 00:46:00.894 line:10% position:50% align:center
Alan and I were invited

00:46:00.894 --> 00:46:02.938 line:10% position:50% align:center
into the special pioneer service

00:46:02.938 --> 00:46:04.982 line:10% position:50% align:center
in 1966.

00:46:04.982 --> 00:46:07.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
The monthly requirement was 150 hours

00:46:07.526 --> 00:46:09.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 50 return visits.

00:46:09.278 --> 00:46:11.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a good incentive.

00:46:11.154 --> 00:46:12.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we had a quota back then

00:46:12.573 --> 00:46:15.826 line:10% position:50% align:center
of 150 magazines, one for every hour,

00:46:15.826 --> 00:46:18.120 line:10% position:50% align:center
as special pioneers or missionaries.

00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:22.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one day we ran
into our fellow missionary and his wife

00:46:22.541 --> 00:46:23.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the way to the movies.

00:46:23.959 --> 00:46:26.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
They went every Saturday, every Saturday.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:27.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this particular Saturday he said:

00:46:27.963 --> 00:46:32.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Ugh! I can’t go to the movies
because I don’t have my 150 magazines!

00:46:32.217 --> 00:46:35.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I’ve got five more to go,
and then we can go to the movies.”

00:46:35.304 --> 00:46:38.223 line:10% position:50% align:center
This started in 1961

00:46:38.223 --> 00:46:41.393 line:10% position:50% align:center
when we were sent as special pioneers.

00:46:41.393 --> 00:46:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
We started pioneering in a trailer

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:49.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
and five hours of service every day,
every day.

00:46:49.693 --> 00:46:52.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
And getting our time was no problem.

00:46:53.781 --> 00:46:56.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Living for a month on $100,

00:46:56.992 --> 00:46:59.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
that was a problem.

00:46:59.662 --> 00:47:01.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Dave said,

00:47:01.330 --> 00:47:03.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m going to go out and get a job.”

00:47:03.749 --> 00:47:06.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
About that time,
they had put a new store in town.

00:47:06.877 --> 00:47:07.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful!

00:47:07.878 --> 00:47:10.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went down to that store and told him,

00:47:10.089 --> 00:47:12.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I’m going to work one day a week.”

00:47:12.717 --> 00:47:15.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What are you going to do
the rest of the time?”

00:47:16.929 --> 00:47:20.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he said, “Well, I knock on doors

00:47:20.433 --> 00:47:22.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
and tell them about God’s Kingdom.”

00:47:23.686 --> 00:47:26.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “Really?

00:47:26.147 --> 00:47:28.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is my door.

00:47:28.316 --> 00:47:29.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knock on it.”

00:47:29.901 --> 00:47:32.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
He came in the truth,
his wife came in the truth,

00:47:32.904 --> 00:47:34.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the children are in the truth.

00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:38.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they had a secretary, didn’t they?

00:47:38.159 --> 00:47:39.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:47:39.035 --> 00:47:41.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had seven children.

00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she said,

00:47:42.288 --> 00:47:46.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, I’d like to study the Bible too.”

00:47:46.334 --> 00:47:50.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we would study with the seven
after they had supper.

00:47:50.004 --> 00:47:52.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
The beauty of it was that they did so well.

00:47:52.966 --> 00:47:53.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah.

00:47:53.633 --> 00:47:57.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
After that, we studied with the parents.

00:47:57.887 --> 00:48:02.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by the time we got through,
it was probably almost midnight.

00:48:02.726 --> 00:48:05.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we took our circuit overseer there.

00:48:05.311 --> 00:48:08.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said,
“I’m too old for this midnight shift.”

00:48:09.941 --> 00:48:13.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never felt that it was a question
of getting the hours in.

00:48:13.194 --> 00:48:15.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d always try to make them quality calls,
you know.

00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:18.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d try to say something to the people

00:48:18.533 --> 00:48:21.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not just go there
and get the magazines placed.

00:48:21.328 --> 00:48:23.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or my Bible studies,

00:48:23.330 --> 00:48:26.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would try so hard
to really get to know the people.

00:48:26.249 --> 00:48:29.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was never just a question
of getting in hours.

00:48:29.044 --> 00:48:31.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re trying to save lives!

00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:39.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that wonderful,
to hear from those dear faithful ones?

00:48:39.846 --> 00:48:43.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Buettell is now 100 years of age,

00:48:43.642 --> 00:48:46.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Sister Buettell is 98.

00:48:46.311 --> 00:48:50.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a good start on living forever!

00:48:52.484 --> 00:48:56.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we’ve seen, the arrangement
for reporting our field activity

00:48:56.572 --> 00:49:01.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
has served a valuable purpose for many years.

00:49:01.452 --> 00:49:06.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as Brother Fleegle mentioned
in the opening talk of this symposium,

00:49:06.415 --> 00:49:08.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s people are motivated

00:49:08.709 --> 00:49:13.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
to praise Jehovah
because of our great love for him.

00:49:13.005 --> 00:49:15.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing in the ministry also reflects

00:49:15.716 --> 00:49:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
our sincere love for our neighbors

00:49:18.469 --> 00:49:22.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our love for the good news.

00:49:22.139 --> 00:49:23.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we engage in our ministry,

00:49:23.807 --> 00:49:27.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because we fill out a report each month,

00:49:27.937 --> 00:49:30.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we might say
that it’s because our ministry

00:49:30.147 --> 00:49:35.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
is our personal gift to Jehovah
and to our neighbors.

00:49:36.612 --> 00:49:39.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah is realistic.

00:49:39.156 --> 00:49:42.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knows that many
of our brothers and sisters

00:49:42.201 --> 00:49:45.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
are limited by circumstances

00:49:45.079 --> 00:49:49.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as advancing age
or serious health issues.

00:49:50.293 --> 00:49:53.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others cope with the rising cost of living,

00:49:53.588 --> 00:49:56.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
civil strife, war,

00:49:56.757 --> 00:49:59.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
or opposition to our work.

00:49:59.427 --> 00:50:02.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
The recent COVID-19 pandemic

00:50:02.597 --> 00:50:07.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
greatly limited what many
of us were able to do in the ministry.

00:50:08.102 --> 00:50:11.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some who have preached faithfully for decades

00:50:11.522 --> 00:50:13.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be embarrassed to report

00:50:13.816 --> 00:50:16.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
little time in the ministry.

00:50:16.903 --> 00:50:19.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that is true of you,

00:50:19.030 --> 00:50:22.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
should you feel
that you have failed in some way?

00:50:22.575 --> 00:50:24.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not at all!

00:50:24.828 --> 00:50:26.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note the principle

00:50:26.579 --> 00:50:30.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Corinthians 8:12:

00:50:31.709 --> 00:50:34.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For if the readiness is there first,

00:50:34.921 --> 00:50:37.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it is especially acceptable

00:50:37.424 --> 00:50:39.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to what a person has,

00:50:39.926 --> 00:50:44.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
not according
to what a person does not have.”

00:50:45.223 --> 00:50:47.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we are giving Jehovah our best,

00:50:47.726 --> 00:50:51.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wants us to rejoice in what we do,

00:50:51.021 --> 00:50:54.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to feel guilty about what we cannot do.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Scriptures associate

00:50:57.486 --> 00:51:00.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
sacrifices to Jehovah with joy.

00:51:00.697 --> 00:51:02.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:51:02.324 --> 00:51:06.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah 12:43 says:

00:51:07.287 --> 00:51:09.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On that day they offered

00:51:09.498 --> 00:51:12.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“great sacrifices and rejoiced,

00:51:12.501 --> 00:51:15.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the true God made them rejoice

00:51:15.837 --> 00:51:18.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
with great joy.”

00:51:19.299 --> 00:51:23.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine Jehovah
judging an Israelite unfaithful

00:51:23.220 --> 00:51:28.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
because his tenth was less
than another person’s tenth?

00:51:28.225 --> 00:51:30.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course not.

00:51:30.727 --> 00:51:34.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone’s circumstances
and abilities are different.

00:51:34.481 --> 00:51:37.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Lösch explained that although tithing

00:51:37.985 --> 00:51:40.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a requirement in ancient Israel,

00:51:40.404 --> 00:51:43.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah did not require others

00:51:43.073 --> 00:51:46.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
to monitor, or keep track of,

00:51:46.035 --> 00:51:48.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
each person’s tithe.

00:51:48.287 --> 00:51:53.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Tithing was entirely between
the individual Israelite and Jehovah.

00:51:55.377 --> 00:51:59.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body believes
this same principle can be applied

00:51:59.381 --> 00:52:03.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to reporting our time
spent in the ministry.

00:52:03.844 --> 00:52:06.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our ministry involves much more

00:52:06.639 --> 00:52:08.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
than counting time.

00:52:11.102 --> 00:52:13.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this reason,

00:52:13.104 --> 00:52:15.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are pleased to announce that beginning

00:52:15.356 --> 00:52:18.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
November 1, 2023,

00:52:18.818 --> 00:52:22.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
congregation publishers will no longer

00:52:22.446 --> 00:52:27.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
be asked to report the amount of time

00:52:27.076 --> 00:52:29.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
they spend in the ministry.

00:52:30.246 --> 00:52:34.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nor will publishers be asked
to report their placements,

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:38.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
the videos they show, or their return visits.

00:52:39.422 --> 00:52:44.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, the field service report
will simply have a box

00:52:44.427 --> 00:52:46.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will allow each publisher

00:52:46.929 --> 00:52:50.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
to indicate that he or she shared

00:52:50.767 --> 00:52:54.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
in any form of the ministry during the month.

00:52:55.813 --> 00:52:58.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be one more box where publishers

00:52:58.525 --> 00:53:02.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
report the number
of different Bible studies they conduct.

00:53:04.781 --> 00:53:09.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
This simplified report
serves a valuable purpose.

00:53:09.327 --> 00:53:11.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will allow us to know the number

00:53:11.746 --> 00:53:15.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
of active publishers in each land.

00:53:15.667 --> 00:53:20.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will also help us to know
whether certain territories

00:53:20.338 --> 00:53:22.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
are producing Bible studies

00:53:22.591 --> 00:53:25.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
and where there
is a greater need for pioneers,

00:53:25.594 --> 00:53:30.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
special pioneers,
missionaries, and Kingdom Halls.

00:53:32.058 --> 00:53:36.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although publishers will no longer
report their time in the ministry,

00:53:36.104 --> 00:53:39.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
we all want to follow faithfully the words

00:53:39.524 --> 00:53:42.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Colossians chapter 3,

00:53:42.277 --> 00:53:45.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 23 and 24:

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:49.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whatever you are doing,

00:53:49.618 --> 00:53:52.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
“work at it whole-souled

00:53:52.746 --> 00:53:55.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as for Jehovah,

00:53:55.082 --> 00:53:57.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and not for men,

00:53:57.417 --> 00:54:00.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for you know that it is from Jehovah

00:54:00.963 --> 00:54:05.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will receive
the inheritance as a reward.

00:54:05.759 --> 00:54:08.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Slave for the Master, Christ.”

00:54:09.096 --> 00:54:11.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body is confident
that you dear ones

00:54:11.849 --> 00:54:15.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue to render
whole-souled service to Jehovah

00:54:15.519 --> 00:54:19.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
by doing all that you can in his service.

00:54:20.274 --> 00:54:24.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
And just as Jehovah
richly blessed faithful Israelites

00:54:24.194 --> 00:54:27.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
who generously supported
the tithing arrangement,

00:54:27.781 --> 00:54:32.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will richly bless
your “sacrifice of praise.”

00:54:34.371 --> 00:54:36.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
But wait!

00:54:36.123 --> 00:54:38.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the Nazirite arrangement?

00:54:38.751 --> 00:54:42.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there a similar provision
in the modern-day organization?

00:54:42.755 --> 00:54:44.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly!

00:54:44.215 --> 00:54:48.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all do well
to imitate the Nazirites’ example

00:54:48.219 --> 00:54:51.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
of self-sacrifice and courage.

00:54:51.973 --> 00:54:55.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, as Brother Lösch explained,

00:54:55.059 --> 00:54:58.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Nazirites
had to meet certain requirements

00:54:58.354 --> 00:55:03.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were not expected
of Israelites in general.

00:55:03.025 --> 00:55:05.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same is true of modern-day pioneers.

00:55:06.988 --> 00:55:10.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have volunteered
to devote a certain number of hours

00:55:10.450 --> 00:55:12.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
to spend in the ministry.

00:55:13.536 --> 00:55:17.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, auxiliary and regular pioneers,

00:55:17.415 --> 00:55:20.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
special pioneers, missionaries,

00:55:20.335 --> 00:55:23.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
and circuit overseers and their wives

00:55:23.755 --> 00:55:27.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
will continue to report the number of hours

00:55:27.091 --> 00:55:29.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
they spend in the ministry,

00:55:29.260 --> 00:55:34.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with the number
of different Bible studies they conduct.

00:55:35.808 --> 00:55:40.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you know, the Governing Body
recently reduced the hour requirements

00:55:40.647 --> 00:55:44.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
for auxiliary pioneers, regular pioneers,

00:55:44.734 --> 00:55:48.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
special pioneers, field missionaries,

00:55:48.238 --> 00:55:50.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
and circuit overseers and their wives.

00:55:52.117 --> 00:55:54.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gave us great joy to do that,

00:55:54.369 --> 00:55:57.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we are convinced that as a result,

00:55:57.497 --> 00:56:02.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
even more will be able
to join the ranks of the pioneers.

00:56:02.210 --> 00:56:04.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why are we so confident of that?

00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:09.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of what it says at Psalm 110:3:

00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:15.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your people will offer themselves willingly

00:56:15.515 --> 00:56:18.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the day of your military force.”

00:56:19.895 --> 00:56:23.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah promises that his people,

00:56:23.273 --> 00:56:25.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
and young ones in particular,

00:56:25.692 --> 00:56:29.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
will reach out to do more
in this time of the end.

00:56:29.863 --> 00:56:34.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many pioneers eventually attend
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers;

00:56:34.868 --> 00:56:38.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
they become special pioneers,
field missionaries,

00:56:38.914 --> 00:56:42.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even circuit overseers
who serve with their wives.

00:56:42.417 --> 00:56:45.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thank Jehovah for those who reach out

00:56:45.587 --> 00:56:48.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve as pioneers.

00:56:49.925 --> 00:56:52.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s think for a moment

00:56:52.344 --> 00:56:56.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
what this adjustment will mean for all of us.

00:56:56.223 --> 00:57:00.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it true that reporting
our field service activity each month

00:57:00.644 --> 00:57:02.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
has served as a reminder?

00:57:03.647 --> 00:57:08.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our monthly report reminded us
to be regular in the ministry,

00:57:08.110 --> 00:57:11.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use our various publications and videos,

00:57:11.363 --> 00:57:13.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to make return visits.

00:57:13.991 --> 00:57:15.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what about now?

00:57:17.369 --> 00:57:20.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
Will we still be conscientious

00:57:20.081 --> 00:57:23.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
about having an active share
in the ministry each month?

00:57:24.585 --> 00:57:27.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember that with the tithing arrangement,

00:57:27.922 --> 00:57:32.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
each individual was responsible
to give their full tithe to Jehovah.

00:57:33.803 --> 00:57:38.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, each of us
will want to set personal goals

00:57:38.808 --> 00:57:42.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure we have a zealous share
in the ministry.

00:57:42.478 --> 00:57:47.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love for Jehovah will move us
to have a schedule

00:57:47.316 --> 00:57:49.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure the ministry

00:57:49.777 --> 00:57:53.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
continues to take priority in our lives.

00:57:55.950 --> 00:57:59.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will these adjustments
in reporting our ministry

00:57:59.412 --> 00:58:03.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
mean for you elders and circuit overseers?

00:58:04.667 --> 00:58:07.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will be even more important

00:58:07.503 --> 00:58:10.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you brothers be discerning shepherds.

00:58:11.758 --> 00:58:14.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
You will have to know the flock well.

00:58:14.677 --> 00:58:16.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example,

00:58:16.304 --> 00:58:20.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
evaluating a congregation’s spiritual health

00:58:20.016 --> 00:58:24.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a brother’s qualifications
to serve as an elder or ministerial servant

00:58:24.979 --> 00:58:29.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
will not simply be
a matter of computing averages

00:58:29.442 --> 00:58:34.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
—time spent in the ministry,
literature placements, and so forth.

00:58:34.322 --> 00:58:38.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, you will have to know the brothers.

00:58:39.619 --> 00:58:43.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is their attitude toward the ministry?

00:58:43.331 --> 00:58:46.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are they zealous for pure worship?

00:58:47.794 --> 00:58:52.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is their reputation
in regard to the ministry?

00:58:52.174 --> 00:58:56.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do they take advantage
of opportunities to give a witness?

00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:01.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do they help others to do so,
including the members of their family?

00:59:03.143 --> 00:59:05.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we have discussed,

00:59:05.145 --> 00:59:08.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah clearly deserves our best,

00:59:08.732 --> 00:59:11.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we demonstrate our love for him

00:59:11.235 --> 00:59:14.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
by exerting ourselves in the ministry

00:59:14.112 --> 00:59:18.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in all other aspects of our worship.

00:59:18.742 --> 00:59:21.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves you for that.

00:59:21.078 --> 00:59:23.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we love you for that.

00:59:24.915 --> 00:59:27.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know you will continue to manifest

00:59:27.793 --> 00:59:32.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spirit expressed at Psalm 54:6.

00:59:33.299 --> 00:59:34.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:59:34.925 --> 00:59:37.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will sacrifice to you willingly.

00:59:37.886 --> 00:59:41.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will praise your name, O Jehovah,

00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:43.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
for it is good.”

00:59:45.227 --> 00:59:49.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have no doubt
that you will continue to give Jehovah

00:59:49.523 --> 00:59:53.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
your very best in the disciple-making work.

00:59:54.653 --> 00:59:58.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is there still more
we can learn from the Scriptures

00:59:58.616 --> 01:00:02.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the way we conduct our ministry?

01:00:02.119 --> 01:00:05.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
If so, are additional adjustments

01:00:05.414 --> 01:00:07.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
appropriate at this time?

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:12.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
To find out, let us give our attention
to Brother Mark Sanderson,

01:00:12.255 --> 01:00:14.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
a member of the Governing Body,

01:00:14.340 --> 01:00:18.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will share the final talk
in this symposium,

01:00:18.010 --> 01:00:23.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled
“Love People—Make Disciples.”

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:42.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, brothers and sisters,
hasn’t this been an amazing program?

01:00:52.253 --> 01:00:55.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is truly a historic day

01:00:55.465 --> 01:00:58.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the history of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:03.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe our hearts right now
are more full of love and appreciation

01:01:03.556 --> 01:01:08.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our wonderful God, Jehovah,
than ever before.

01:01:08.311 --> 01:01:12.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve deepened our understanding
of Jehovah’s mercy,

01:01:12.232 --> 01:01:15.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
his compassion, and his patience.

01:01:15.986 --> 01:01:19.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about that announcement
about our field service reporting?

01:01:20.949 --> 01:01:24.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is dignifying us.

01:01:24.786 --> 01:01:27.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has confidence in us.

01:01:27.873 --> 01:01:30.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,
why do we go from house to house?

01:01:30.834 --> 01:01:32.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we do cart work?

01:01:32.836 --> 01:01:35.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we make
telephone calls and write letters

01:01:35.964 --> 01:01:39.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make return visits
and start Bible studies?

01:01:39.259 --> 01:01:41.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we do all of these things?

01:01:42.471 --> 01:01:46.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because we truly love

01:01:46.558 --> 01:01:50.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
our amazing and wonderful God, Jehovah.

01:01:50.437 --> 01:01:54.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Brother Fleegle emphasized in his talk,

01:01:54.024 --> 01:01:56.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Matthew 22:37,

01:01:56.902 --> 01:02:01.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus identified
the greatest and first commandment.

01:02:01.323 --> 01:02:03.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember what he said?

01:02:03.325 --> 01:02:08.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must love Jehovah your God
with your whole heart

01:02:08.038 --> 01:02:12.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
and with your whole soul
and with your whole mind.”

01:02:14.169 --> 01:02:16.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is there something else

01:02:16.755 --> 01:02:19.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
that moves us to make disciples?

01:02:19.049 --> 01:02:20.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

01:02:21.218 --> 01:02:25.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s what Jesus said
was the second greatest commandment.

01:02:25.764 --> 01:02:29.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said:
“You must love your neighbor

01:02:29.727 --> 01:02:31.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
as yourself.”

01:02:31.812 --> 01:02:34.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we must love God,

01:02:34.732 --> 01:02:37.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we must also love people.

01:02:38.527 --> 01:02:42.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why is love for people so important?

01:02:42.114 --> 01:02:44.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, because when we see

01:02:44.659 --> 01:02:48.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
that someone cares about us,

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:52.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are moved even
if we don’t know that person.

01:02:52.875 --> 01:02:57.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, maybe someone you’ve
never met before does a kind deed for you.

01:02:57.130 --> 01:02:59.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe they open a door for you,

01:02:59.132 --> 01:03:01.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
they pick something up that you’ve dropped,

01:03:01.634 --> 01:03:04.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
or they help you carry a heavy load.

01:03:04.554 --> 01:03:06.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you feel?

01:03:06.681 --> 01:03:09.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you appreciate  their kindness,
don’t you?

01:03:09.892 --> 01:03:14.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as a result,
you’re more inclined to want to listen

01:03:14.480 --> 01:03:17.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what that person might want to say to you.

01:03:17.984 --> 01:03:22.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, when we sense
that someone has love for us,

01:03:22.989 --> 01:03:26.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
we open up our hearts.

01:03:26.659 --> 01:03:30.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, unselfish love is so powerful.

01:03:30.997 --> 01:03:32.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
It touches the hearts

01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:37.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
of those who are
“rightly disposed for everlasting life.”

01:03:37.962 --> 01:03:39.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus said

01:03:39.673 --> 01:03:42.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
that his true disciples would be identified

01:03:42.926 --> 01:03:45.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they’d be recognized—

01:03:45.136 --> 01:03:49.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the love that they had in their midst.

01:03:49.182 --> 01:03:52.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, isn’t it true
that so often brothers and sisters

01:03:52.936 --> 01:03:56.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
say that what it was
that drew them to the truth

01:03:56.731 --> 01:04:00.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the love
they felt from their Bible teacher

01:04:00.026 --> 01:04:02.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
or from the congregation

01:04:02.154 --> 01:04:04.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they began to attend meetings?

01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:07.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, very likely that same love

01:04:07.909 --> 01:04:10.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
was what drew you

01:04:10.620 --> 01:04:14.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
to want to become a disciple of Christ Jesus.

01:04:14.625 --> 01:04:18.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for that reason,
at the 2017 annual meeting,

01:04:18.754 --> 01:04:22.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body
encouraged us to begin to think more

01:04:22.674 --> 01:04:26.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
about conversing with people.

01:04:26.011 --> 01:04:29.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at that same meeting,
you’ll remember that we simplified

01:04:29.515 --> 01:04:34.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
our Teaching Toolbox
so that we could become more familiar

01:04:34.311 --> 01:04:37.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the various tools
that we use in the ministry.

01:04:37.731 --> 01:04:41.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,
we want to carefully consider

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:45.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
each individual’s personal situation

01:04:45.572 --> 01:04:49.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the concerns that they have,
the interests that they have—

01:04:49.535 --> 01:04:53.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then be flexible in choosing a topic

01:04:53.414 --> 01:04:56.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we want to discuss with them.

01:04:56.333 --> 01:04:58.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for several years now,

01:04:58.419 --> 01:05:02.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
our midweek meetings have provided us
with sample conversations,

01:05:02.923 --> 01:05:05.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
with suggested scriptures,

01:05:05.384 --> 01:05:08.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even with a suggested link

01:05:08.262 --> 01:05:12.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us to continue
the conversation at a later time.

01:05:13.351 --> 01:05:18.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is there a challenge sometimes
with a memorized presentation?

01:05:19.482 --> 01:05:22.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, I think back
to when I was a brand-new pioneer.

01:05:22.610 --> 01:05:25.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day,
I was out with this sister in the ministry.

01:05:25.238 --> 01:05:29.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we were going to the door, you know,
she was actually mouthing her presentation.

01:05:29.075 --> 01:05:32.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had it perfectly memorized.

01:05:32.161 --> 01:05:34.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
And suddenly,
this woman came to the door.

01:05:34.205 --> 01:05:36.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
She opened the door,
and here she was

01:05:36.207 --> 01:05:39.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a beautiful older lady with her hair done,
makeup on, beautifully dressed—

01:05:39.877 --> 01:05:41.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking like she was just going out.

01:05:41.879 --> 01:05:43.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the sister
was so flustered that she said:

01:05:43.965 --> 01:05:46.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Oh, I’m sorry.
Did we get you out of bed?”

01:05:55.435 --> 01:06:00.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, memorized presentations
are not always good.

01:06:01.608 --> 01:06:04.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, maybe we’ve memorized presentations,

01:06:04.152 --> 01:06:08.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes we feel like we’re
giving a talk when we’re at the door.

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:12.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if the person
has a very specific interest?

01:06:12.077 --> 01:06:14.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if they have some special need

01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:18.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
or they’re facing some terrible challenge
just at the time when we’re calling?

01:06:19.626 --> 01:06:24.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we want to look
to the example of our Lord Jesus Christ.

01:06:24.130 --> 01:06:27.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
He set the perfect example for us.

01:06:27.092 --> 01:06:29.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
He showed love for people

01:06:29.219 --> 01:06:32.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
by choosing subjects that were appropriate

01:06:32.597 --> 01:06:35.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
for each individual.

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:38.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his personal interest in individuals

01:06:38.019 --> 01:06:41.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
attracted people to the message.

01:06:41.398 --> 01:06:45.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for example, do you remember
the time when Jesus had a conversation

01:06:45.235 --> 01:06:47.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Pharisee Nicodemus?

01:06:48.488 --> 01:06:52.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Nicodemus was impressed
by Jesus’ miracles,

01:06:52.075 --> 01:06:54.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he approached Jesus at night

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:58.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
probably because he was afraid of the Jews.

01:06:58.290 --> 01:07:00.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as a Pharisee and a teacher,

01:07:00.542 --> 01:07:02.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nicodemus evidently must have had

01:07:02.753 --> 01:07:05.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
a very great knowledge
of the Hebrew Scriptures.

01:07:05.506 --> 01:07:08.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did Jesus do?

01:07:08.383 --> 01:07:12.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he shared something
with Nicodemus that was completely new.

01:07:12.888 --> 01:07:15.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,
he talked about new truths

01:07:15.057 --> 01:07:19.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
—about being “born again”
and about seeing “the Kingdom of God.”

01:07:19.979 --> 01:07:24.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
He explained to Nicodemus
that he had ‘descended from the heavens’

01:07:24.817 --> 01:07:28.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he was
the “only-begotten Son” of God

01:07:28.195 --> 01:07:32.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he was the way to everlasting life.

01:07:32.908 --> 01:07:37.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m sure you’d agree
that even though Nicodemus was a teacher,

01:07:37.538 --> 01:07:42.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
he received quite an education
from Jesus on that night.

01:07:42.501 --> 01:07:44.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, does that mean

01:07:44.336 --> 01:07:47.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus took exactly that same approach

01:07:47.548 --> 01:07:49.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
with everyone that he met?

01:07:49.717 --> 01:07:51.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, no, not at all.

01:07:51.552 --> 01:07:55.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, on another occasion,
when Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman,

01:07:56.641 --> 01:07:59.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
his approach was completely different.

01:07:59.101 --> 01:08:01.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Evidently, the Samaritan woman

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:05.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a very basic knowledge
of the Hebrew Scriptures.

01:08:05.066 --> 01:08:07.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did Jesus do?

01:08:07.318 --> 01:08:09.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he noted
the things she was interested in,

01:08:09.821 --> 01:08:14.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
like obtaining water and why Jesus as a Jew

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:16.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
would speak with a Samaritan.

01:08:17.161 --> 01:08:21.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus also took
an interest in her family situation.

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:25.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
He noted that she was
very concerned about why Jews

01:08:25.461 --> 01:08:30.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
worship in one location
and Samaritans in a different location.

01:08:30.466 --> 01:08:32.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jesus do?

01:08:32.135 --> 01:08:34.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, he talked with her

01:08:34.137 --> 01:08:37.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the things that interested her
and that were of concern to her.

01:08:37.849 --> 01:08:41.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped her to see
that worshipping with “spirit and truth”

01:08:41.853 --> 01:08:46.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
was more important than the location
where individuals would worship.

01:08:47.442 --> 01:08:50.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how did that woman respond?

01:08:50.195 --> 01:08:53.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible says
she “left her water jar” there at the well,

01:08:53.865 --> 01:08:55.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
she “went off into the city,”

01:08:55.784 --> 01:08:59.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she gave a powerful witness about Jesus.

01:08:59.246 --> 01:09:01.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was so effective

01:09:01.248 --> 01:09:05.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Samaritans invited Jesus to stay

01:09:05.001 --> 01:09:08.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
and many put faith in him.

01:09:08.046 --> 01:09:12.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, now, what do we learn
from these two simple accounts?

01:09:12.634 --> 01:09:17.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus did not use
a memorized presentation.

01:09:17.055 --> 01:09:19.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just talked with people,

01:09:19.349 --> 01:09:21.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he shared with them the truths

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:24.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he knew would touch their hearts.

01:09:24.604 --> 01:09:28.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was very quick to choose topics and words

01:09:28.775 --> 01:09:32.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on the interests and the concerns

01:09:32.237 --> 01:09:35.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the person whom he was speaking to.

01:09:36.241 --> 01:09:39.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, with all of this in mind,

01:09:40.329 --> 01:09:42.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
you may be wondering

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
(well, you’re supposed to be wondering):

01:09:46.919 --> 01:09:51.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How can I display that same love
for the people whom I meet?’

01:09:51.548 --> 01:09:54.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t it be wonderful
to have a little bit more help

01:09:54.802 --> 01:09:59.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how we can show love
for people and make disciples?

01:09:59.181 --> 01:10:03.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wouldn’t it be wonderful
to have a publication

01:10:03.394 --> 01:10:08.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would help us
to be more flexible and more responsive

01:10:08.107 --> 01:10:12.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the different needs and interests
of the people whom we meet?

01:10:12.486 --> 01:10:14.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what if that publication

01:10:14.905 --> 01:10:18.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
highlighted specific ways that Jesus

01:10:18.951 --> 01:10:22.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other first-century evangelizers

01:10:22.038 --> 01:10:25.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
showed their love as they made disciples?

01:10:25.666 --> 01:10:30.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you will be happy to know

01:10:30.671 --> 01:10:32.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s organization

01:10:32.882 --> 01:10:36.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
has produced just such a publication.

01:10:36.427 --> 01:10:39.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a 32-page brochure entitled

01:10:39.972 --> 01:10:43.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Love People—Make Disciples.</i>

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, would you
like to see a little preview

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what this brochure contains?

01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:18.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please watch the following video.

01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:24.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
This new publication,
<i>Love People—Make Disciples,</i>

01:11:24.476 --> 01:11:26.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
is being made available in both print

01:11:26.853 --> 01:11:30.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and digital formats in over 400 languages.

01:11:30.690 --> 01:11:32.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
How is the brochure designed

01:11:32.734 --> 01:11:35.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help us show love for people we meet?

01:11:37.239 --> 01:11:40.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unlike the tools we’ve used in the past,

01:11:40.033 --> 01:11:44.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
this new brochure does not give us
expressions to memorize;

01:11:44.079 --> 01:11:47.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
nor does it put the emphasis
on leaving literature.

01:11:49.251 --> 01:11:51.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, it features 12 lessons

01:11:51.878 --> 01:11:54.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
that focus on qualities we need to cultivate

01:11:54.548 --> 01:11:56.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make disciples.

01:11:56.717 --> 01:11:59.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
All the lessons are based on Bible accounts

01:11:59.886 --> 01:12:03.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
in which Jesus
or another first-century evangelizer

01:12:03.265 --> 01:12:06.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
displayed a specific quality in the ministry.

01:12:07.185 --> 01:12:10.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lessons will help us see
how we can imitate the qualities

01:12:10.564 --> 01:12:13.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
they demonstrated as we make disciples.

01:12:14.276 --> 01:12:16.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each lesson contains a video

01:12:16.361 --> 01:12:18.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
that brings the account to life.

01:12:20.532 --> 01:12:23.077 line:10% position:50% align:center
A woman of Samaria came to draw water.

01:12:32.586 --> 01:12:34.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Give me a drink.

01:12:38.008 --> 01:12:40.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
By cultivating an interest in people,

01:12:40.386 --> 01:12:43.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can talk about things
that are on their minds.

01:12:45.182 --> 01:12:49.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
What truths might we share with people
once a conversation is started?

01:12:49.937 --> 01:12:54.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appendix A highlights basic Bible truths
that we love to teach.

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:59.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Make it your goal to learn these basic truths

01:12:59.238 --> 01:13:01.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the scriptures that support them.

01:13:01.949 --> 01:13:03.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you do,

01:13:03.284 --> 01:13:06.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
you will be more effective
in starting conversations

01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:08.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in making disciples.

01:13:08.372 --> 01:13:11.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, a conversation can be started

01:13:11.584 --> 01:13:14.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
by asking a simple question, such as:

01:13:14.253 --> 01:13:18.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you heard that God
will soon end all suffering?”

01:13:19.091 --> 01:13:23.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
or “Did you know that the earth’s environment
will be restored?”

01:13:26.766 --> 01:13:31.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sharing a simple truth
at the right time is powerful.

01:13:32.814 --> 01:13:36.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said his sheep
would listen to his voice.

01:13:36.401 --> 01:13:39.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, “rightly disposed” ones

01:13:39.070 --> 01:13:43.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
will recognize the truth
when they hear it expressed simply.

01:13:44.284 --> 01:13:48.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appendix B helps us to determine
whether to continue a conversation.

01:13:49.622 --> 01:13:52.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Appendix C provides practical suggestions

01:13:52.876 --> 01:13:56.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how to conduct Bible studies
in <i>Enjoy Life Forever!</i>

01:13:57.839 --> 01:14:01.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if you don’t feel comfortable
starting conversations?

01:14:01.134 --> 01:14:02.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t worry!

01:14:02.552 --> 01:14:05.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beginning in January 2024,

01:14:05.597 --> 01:14:08.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
the “Apply Yourself” portion
of each midweek meeting

01:14:08.475 --> 01:14:12.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us to practice the points
we are learning in this new brochure.

01:14:13.855 --> 01:14:16.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
The meeting
will no longer focus on presenting

01:14:16.316 --> 01:14:19.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
a predetermined topic and scripture.

01:14:19.236 --> 01:14:22.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, students will select topics
for their assignments

01:14:22.614 --> 01:14:25.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they know are on the minds
of those in their community.

01:14:26.535 --> 01:14:29.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
By means of realistic demonstrations,

01:14:30.664 --> 01:14:32.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
audience discussions,

01:14:35.669 --> 01:14:37.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talks,

01:14:37.129 --> 01:14:39.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
our meetings will assist us to develop skills

01:14:39.756 --> 01:14:42.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us
start conversations naturally

01:14:42.634 --> 01:14:46.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
and adapt
to each person’s concerns and needs.

01:14:47.598 --> 01:14:50.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
By focusing on people,

01:14:50.225 --> 01:14:52.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will become more comfortable

01:14:52.269 --> 01:14:55.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more effective as we make disciples.

01:14:56.982 --> 01:14:59.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you consider each lesson,

01:14:59.234 --> 01:15:01.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
think carefully about how you can demonstrate

01:15:01.904 --> 01:15:05.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
the highlighted qualities when conversing
with people in your community.

01:15:06.825 --> 01:15:10.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ask yourself,
‘What are their concerns and needs?’

01:15:11.956 --> 01:15:15.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you go about your activities,
be observant.

01:15:15.751 --> 01:15:20.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look for appropriate opportunities
to help people in practical ways.

01:15:21.298 --> 01:15:25.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
Acts of kindness can open the door
to share Kingdom truth.

01:15:26.804 --> 01:15:31.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
Show that you care by listening to others
when they express themselves.

01:15:32.643 --> 01:15:36.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Share a simple truth at the right time.

01:15:37.189 --> 01:15:41.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember,
our goal is not to memorize a presentation

01:15:41.235 --> 01:15:45.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to demonstrate
Christlike love to everyone we meet.

01:15:46.032 --> 01:15:48.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will require patience,

01:15:50.411 --> 01:15:52.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
perseverance,

01:15:53.873 --> 01:15:55.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
and commitment.

01:15:57.210 --> 01:15:59.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter where we live

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:02.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
or under what circumstances we are preaching,

01:16:03.716 --> 01:16:08.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
simply showing love will help us
to find joy in our ministry.

01:16:12.266 --> 01:16:14.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than any specific technique,

01:16:14.894 --> 01:16:18.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
actively expressing our love for others

01:16:18.356 --> 01:16:21.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
will help us make disciples.

01:16:45.091 --> 01:16:48.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we indeed thank Jehovah
for this wonderful new tool

01:16:48.553 --> 01:16:51.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make us more effective in our ministry.

01:16:51.556 --> 01:16:55.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the question
you may be wondering is,

01:16:55.101 --> 01:16:59.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
When will you receive your copy
of this new brochure?

01:16:59.898 --> 01:17:03.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you’ll be pleased to know
that it’s going to be made available

01:17:03.276 --> 01:17:07.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
to all congregations in electronic format

01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:12.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in most places in printed format

01:17:12.035 --> 01:17:14.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
by November 6.

01:17:14.538 --> 01:17:18.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition,
this entire four-part symposium

01:17:18.709 --> 01:17:22.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be posted on jw.org on November 6

01:17:22.963 --> 01:17:25.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that all of our brothers and sisters

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:30.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
will hear the information
in the symposium at the same time.

01:17:30.262 --> 01:17:31.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that great?

01:17:36.143 --> 01:17:38.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we’re all going to want
to read the brochure.

01:17:38.771 --> 01:17:40.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to want to watch the videos.

01:17:40.939 --> 01:17:43.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
But wasn’t it wonderful to hear in this video

01:17:43.734 --> 01:17:48.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Governing Body has arranged
to make use of this new publication

01:17:48.447 --> 01:17:51.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning in the month of January
during our midweek meeting?

01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:56.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re going to get the opportunity
to put this into practice right away.

01:17:56.789 --> 01:18:01.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what have we learned
in this four-part symposium?

01:18:01.335 --> 01:18:06.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Part One, Brother Fleegle
reminded us why we love Jehovah

01:18:06.048 --> 01:18:09.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how our love motivates us
to want to praise him.

01:18:09.802 --> 01:18:12.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Part Two,
Brother Lösch explained the differences

01:18:12.888 --> 01:18:15.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
between most Israelites

01:18:15.016 --> 01:18:18.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
and those who volunteered to be Nazirites.

01:18:18.311 --> 01:18:20.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Part Three,
Brother Herd helped us to see

01:18:20.938 --> 01:18:23.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
that although congregation publishers

01:18:23.858 --> 01:18:26.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
will no longer report
their time in the ministry,

01:18:26.903 --> 01:18:28.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
this in no way

01:18:28.988 --> 01:18:33.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
diminishes our individual responsibility
to make disciples.

01:18:33.993 --> 01:18:37.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
And finally, in this part,
we received a new tool

01:18:37.914 --> 01:18:42.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will help us to show our love for people

01:18:42.126 --> 01:18:44.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to make disciples.

01:18:44.462 --> 01:18:48.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s really amazing to witness
as Jehovah’s people

01:18:48.675 --> 01:18:53.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
the fulfillment of Isaiah 60:17.

01:18:54.847 --> 01:18:56.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll remember the prophecy there.

01:18:57.934 --> 01:18:59.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

01:18:59.143 --> 01:19:03.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Instead of the copper I will bring in gold,

01:19:03.356 --> 01:19:07.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and instead of the iron
I will bring in silver,

01:19:07.193 --> 01:19:09.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
“instead of the wood, copper,

01:19:09.696 --> 01:19:12.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and instead of the stones, iron;

01:19:12.991 --> 01:19:16.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will appoint peace as your overseers

01:19:16.369 --> 01:19:20.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
and righteousness as your task assigners.”

01:19:20.582 --> 01:19:23.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what’s the point of the prophecy?

01:19:23.501 --> 01:19:27.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,
it outlines that good materials

01:19:27.631 --> 01:19:32.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
would gradually be replaced
by even better ones.

01:19:32.427 --> 01:19:35.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s exactly what we have seen.

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:38.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
You think back to the 1930’s
when our brothers

01:19:38.892 --> 01:19:41.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
became so zealous in the ministry

01:19:41.061 --> 01:19:45.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they went out with phonographs
and testimony cards.

01:19:45.691 --> 01:19:48.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, of course,
at that time, they didn’t speak.

01:19:48.610 --> 01:19:52.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Either the record did the speaking
or people read the card.

01:19:52.197 --> 01:19:54.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mother loved to tell the story

01:19:54.199 --> 01:19:57.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
about being in the service
with her pioneer partner.

01:19:57.578 --> 01:20:00.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
The door opened,
she handed the man the testimony card

01:20:00.581 --> 01:20:02.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course, didn’t say anything.

01:20:02.583 --> 01:20:04.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man started to read it.

01:20:04.293 --> 01:20:08.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suddenly, his wife called out,
“Who’s at the door?”

01:20:08.172 --> 01:20:10.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
The man said:
“I don’t know.

01:20:10.174 --> 01:20:13.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are two deaf women here,
and I’m trying to figure out what they want.”

01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:23.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was the reality.

01:20:23.145 --> 01:20:25.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
We weren’t speaking.

01:20:26.398 --> 01:20:29.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how Jehovah improved the situation!

01:20:29.485 --> 01:20:34.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
He trained his people
how to give an effective witness.

01:20:34.198 --> 01:20:37.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we had publications,
like <i>Reasoning From the Scriptures,</i>

01:20:37.493 --> 01:20:42.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helped us to learn how to use
the Bible to reason with people.

01:20:42.123 --> 01:20:44.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more recently,
Jehovah has given us

01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:47.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
this marvelous tool <i>Enjoy Life Forever! </i>

01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:52.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we can conduct
much more quality Bible studies.

01:20:52.425 --> 01:20:55.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now,
with the release of this brochure,

01:20:55.595 --> 01:20:58.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to focus on people

01:20:58.848 --> 01:21:03.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
and talk about the things
that are of interest to them

01:21:03.144 --> 01:21:05.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, in that way,
endeavor to reach their heart

01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:08.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they can become disciples.

01:21:08.816 --> 01:21:10.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s true

01:21:10.818 --> 01:21:13.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
that with each
of these organizational adjustments,

01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:17.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
we went from something good
to something better.

01:21:17.700 --> 01:21:20.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think with the things
that were announced today,

01:21:20.787 --> 01:21:23.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
isn’t it true that we’re seeing that again?

01:21:23.623 --> 01:21:28.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going from something
that was good to something even better.

01:21:28.127 --> 01:21:30.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think we’d agree, too,

01:21:30.171 --> 01:21:34.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is helping us
to mature as a people.

01:21:34.884 --> 01:21:37.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
He has confidence in us

01:21:37.512 --> 01:21:41.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our concern is not merely
the number of hours

01:21:41.266 --> 01:21:45.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the publications that we place
that we’re going to put on a report.

01:21:45.395 --> 01:21:48.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love Jehovah, we love people,

01:21:48.982 --> 01:21:51.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we want to make disciples.

01:21:51.776 --> 01:21:55.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does all of this mean,

01:21:55.322 --> 01:21:57.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what does it not mean?

01:21:57.949 --> 01:21:59.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first,

01:21:59.659 --> 01:22:02.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
these adjustments do not

01:22:02.078 --> 01:22:03.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they do not—

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:08.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
mean that we are in any way slacking off
in our ministry.

01:22:08.585 --> 01:22:12.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
It does not mean that we are slowing down

01:22:12.756 --> 01:22:14.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we approach the great tribulation.

01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:18.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing could be further from the truth.

01:22:18.261 --> 01:22:22.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right now we have more
than 50,000 applications

01:22:22.224 --> 01:22:26.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
from students who want to attend
the School for Kingdom Evangelizers.

01:22:26.853 --> 01:22:30.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re appointing new missionaries,
new special pioneers,

01:22:30.691 --> 01:22:32.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
temporary special pioneers,

01:22:32.943 --> 01:22:37.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
and an army of new regular pioneers.

01:22:37.739 --> 01:22:40.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in some lands,
like the Philippines

01:22:40.868 --> 01:22:42.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
(sorry, I have to mention the Philippines),

01:22:44.246 --> 01:22:46.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are experiencing record growth.

01:22:46.915 --> 01:22:51.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine
a 9 percent increase this year

01:22:51.420 --> 01:22:58.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a new peak of 253,876 publishers

01:22:58.177 --> 01:23:03.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 12,954 baptized

01:23:03.182 --> 01:23:04.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
just in this last year?

01:23:04.892 --> 01:23:06.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

01:23:18.697 --> 01:23:21.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
So please know
—please know—

01:23:21.909 --> 01:23:25.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in no way is the work slowing down.

01:23:25.830 --> 01:23:28.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our ministry has never

01:23:28.291 --> 01:23:31.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
been more important than it is now.

01:23:31.794 --> 01:23:35.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what, then, do these adjustments mean?

01:23:36.299 --> 01:23:39.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, they do mean that our motivation

01:23:39.510 --> 01:23:41.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
for carrying out the ministry

01:23:41.596 --> 01:23:44.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been even more clarified.

01:23:44.265 --> 01:23:46.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see,
we share in the ministry

01:23:46.309 --> 01:23:50.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we love Jehovah
and because we love people.

01:23:50.605 --> 01:23:54.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is the time when we want to be busy

01:23:54.484 --> 01:23:56.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s work.

01:23:56.486 --> 01:24:01.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you remember Jesus’ parable
of the master and the three slaves?

01:24:01.282 --> 01:24:04.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
That parable was designed to teach us

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:08.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we need to be doing
while we’re waiting for the end to come.

01:24:08.331 --> 01:24:11.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two of those slaves were industrious,

01:24:11.626 --> 01:24:14.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they doubled the master’s money

01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:18.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, as a result, they were blessed.

01:24:18.299 --> 01:24:20.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to have that same

01:24:20.593 --> 01:24:24.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
industrious, diligent spirit.

01:24:24.139 --> 01:24:27.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want elders
and ministerial servants and pioneers

01:24:27.851 --> 01:24:30.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the lead in the ministry.

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
But all of us

01:24:32.105 --> 01:24:37.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our personal ministry
want to be even more zealous

01:24:37.110 --> 01:24:41.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what we want
to accomplish in our ministry.

01:24:42.365 --> 01:24:46.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
What an exciting time this is!

01:24:46.536 --> 01:24:49.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body sincerely hopes

01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:51.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
that many more will come to join us

01:24:51.917 --> 01:24:55.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
in serving Jehovah before the end comes.

01:24:55.379 --> 01:24:57.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
And remember:

01:24:57.214 --> 01:25:00.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah delights in rewarding his people

01:25:00.509 --> 01:25:04.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
for their faithfulness
and for their generosity.

01:25:04.596 --> 01:25:07.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
So with the great tribulation
fast approaching,

01:25:07.975 --> 01:25:12.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
have no doubt that Jehovah
will soon richly reward you

01:25:12.980 --> 01:25:17.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we all give generously
of our time and our effort

01:25:17.693 --> 01:25:21.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love our amazing God, Jehovah,

01:25:21.613 --> 01:25:23.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to make disciples!

01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you were able to see,

01:25:26.702 --> 01:25:31.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part 1 is of historical proportions
and most exciting!

01:25:31.290 --> 01:25:35.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
Part 2 will be available
on jw.org in January.

01:25:36.795 --> 01:25:39.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our postcard for this month is from Albania,

01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:42.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
a small country on the Adriatic Sea.

01:25:43.093 --> 01:25:45.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
For much of its tumultuous past,

01:25:45.095 --> 01:25:48.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
foreign powers have come and gone,

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
each bringing with it
a different mix of peoples,

01:25:50.434 --> 01:25:53.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
cultures, and religions.

01:25:53.145 --> 01:25:57.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Albania is a beautiful land,
scattered with lakes

01:25:57.274 --> 01:25:59.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
and crisscrossed by rivers.

01:25:59.944 --> 01:26:02.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
Idyllic beaches dot the coastline,

01:26:02.071 --> 01:26:05.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the aptly named Aquarium Beach,

01:26:05.032 --> 01:26:07.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
a beautiful spot for snorkeling.

01:26:08.286 --> 01:26:11.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Karavasta Lagoon,
the largest in the country,

01:26:11.706 --> 01:26:14.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the home
of the Dalmatian pelican,

01:26:14.292 --> 01:26:16.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
the largest of its kind,

01:26:16.294 --> 01:26:19.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
measuring up to 1.8 meters (6 ft) long.

01:26:20.631 --> 01:26:24.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Romans chapter 15,
the apostle Paul reported

01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:28.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he and his companions
had “thoroughly preached the good news.”

01:26:28.514 --> 01:26:31.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had traveled “as far as Illyricum,”

01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:34.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Roman province
that included part of what is today Albania.

01:26:35.647 --> 01:26:39.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is likely that some in the region
became Christians at that time,

01:26:39.817 --> 01:26:42.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
for secular history reports that Christianity

01:26:42.570 --> 01:26:44.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
took root in Albania in the first century.

01:26:45.240 --> 01:26:47.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1920’s,

01:26:47.242 --> 01:26:49.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
some Albanians learned Bible truth

01:26:49.327 --> 01:26:51.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
while living in the United States.

01:26:51.913 --> 01:26:55.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
After getting baptized,
some returned to Albania,

01:26:55.083 --> 01:26:57.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
eager to share these precious truths

01:26:57.168 --> 01:26:59.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
with family and friends.

01:26:59.671 --> 01:27:03.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1928,
Lazar Nasson and Petro Stavro

01:27:03.758 --> 01:27:06.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
traveled from the United States
back to Albania

01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:09.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show the “Photo-Drama of Creation.”

01:27:09.514 --> 01:27:11.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many responded,

01:27:11.141 --> 01:27:14.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and despite political turmoil,
economic reversal

01:27:14.561 --> 01:27:17.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, at times, vigorous opposition,

01:27:17.022 --> 01:27:21.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of Kingdom proclaimers
has grown steadily.

01:27:21.151 --> 01:27:25.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, there are more than 5,400 publishers

01:27:25.739 --> 01:27:28.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving in 89 congregations.

01:27:28.617 --> 01:27:30.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
From Tirana, the capital,

01:27:30.827 --> 01:27:33.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
the branch office
cares for the work in Albania

01:27:33.330 --> 01:27:38.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the 228 publishers
in its northeast neighbor, Kosovo.

01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:43.799 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s visit the city of Lushnjë,
located in west-central Albania.

01:27:45.217 --> 01:27:48.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Lushnjë Veriu Congregation
preaches in a territory

01:27:48.011 --> 01:27:50.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
that covers around one third of the city

01:27:50.806 --> 01:27:54.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well as 21 villages in the Myzeqe Valley.

01:27:54.643 --> 01:27:58.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
The preaching work in the villages
yields good results,

01:27:58.731 --> 01:28:03.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
and meeting attendance
regularly averages over 130 percent.

01:28:03.402 --> 01:28:07.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are happy to host 
a Romany-language group.

01:28:07.156 --> 01:28:10.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though some publishers
live in villages outside the city,

01:28:10.409 --> 01:28:13.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
they are happy
to attend the meetings in person,

01:28:13.787 --> 01:28:17.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
some walking one hour
from their home to the Kingdom Hall.

01:28:18.459 --> 01:28:22.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 77 publishers
of the Lushnjë Veriu Congregation

01:28:22.296 --> 01:28:25.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you
their Christian affection and greetings!

01:28:26.425 --> 01:28:29.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:28:29.553 --> 01:28:32.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
