00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:25.034 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Our theme</b>
<b>for this month’s broadcast</b>

00:01:25.034 --> 00:01:29.906 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<b>is “Sincere Commendation</b>
<b>Is Always Appropriate!”</b>

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.277 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
<b>One definition of “commendation” is:</b>

00:01:34.277 --> 00:01:38.515 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“The act of praising</b>
<b>or approving of someone.”</b>

00:01:38.515 --> 00:01:42.652 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And when it is given</b>
<b>in a sincere, genuine way,</b>

00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:47.657 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>how encouraging it can be</b>
<b>to the one receiving it!</b>

00:01:47.657 --> 00:01:51.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>That makes us think</b>
<b>of Proverbs 15:23,</b>

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:55.999 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>which says:</b>
<b>“A word spoken at the right time</b>

<b>—how good it is!”</b>

00:01:58.768 --> 00:02:02.071 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Similarly, Proverbs 12:25</b>

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:04.674 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>talks about how anxiety</b>

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>can weigh a person’s heart down,</b>

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.412 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>but then says:</b>

00:02:09.412 --> 00:02:13.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“But a good word cheers it up.”</b>

00:02:13.116 --> 00:02:17.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>A 19th century author jested:</b>

00:02:17.153 --> 00:02:22.158 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“I can live for two months</b>
<b>on a good compliment.”</b>

00:02:22.158 --> 00:02:25.495 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>But now,</b>
<b>keeping our theme in mind,</b>

00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:28.765 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>let us talk</b>
<b>about Jehovah and Jesus.</b>

00:02:28.765 --> 00:02:33.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Can you imagine how much</b>
<b>Jehovah must have appreciated</b>

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:38.174 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>his only-begotten Son,</b>
<b>whom we have come to know as Jesus?</b>

00:02:38.174 --> 00:02:42.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Jesus had faithfully</b>
<b>supported his Father</b>

00:02:42.378 --> 00:02:45.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>for eons of time.</b>

00:02:45.048 --> 00:02:48.318 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>But then when he learned</b>
<b>of Jehovah’s purpose</b>

00:02:48.318 --> 00:02:51.287 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>to buy back the hope</b>
<b>of everlasting life</b>

00:02:51.287 --> 00:02:55.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>for imperfect humans,</b>
<b>what did Jesus do?</b>

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:57.894 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Did he make excuses</b>

00:02:57.894 --> 00:03:02.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>as to why he could not leave heaven</b>

<b>‘Father,</b>

<b>No!</b>

00:03:30.994 --> 00:03:34.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Jesus did not</b>
<b>even slightly reason this way.</b>

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:39.736 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>He willingly made sacrifices</b>
<b>that cost him dearly.</b>

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:42.171 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>He changed life forms</b>

00:03:42.171 --> 00:03:45.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>—going from a majestic spirit creature</b>

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>to a little baby</b>

00:03:51.681 --> 00:03:54.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Later, as a perfect child, </b>

00:03:54.851 --> 00:03:59.522 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

<b>to imperfect parents.</b>

00:03:59.522 --> 00:04:04.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Then, as an adult,</b>

00:04:19.008 --> 00:04:24.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Then, he died</b>
<b>an agonizing death on a torture stake</b>

<b>according to Jehovah’s purpose.</b>

00:04:41.464 --> 00:04:45.501 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

<b>By his selfless act,</b>

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:08.124 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>But now, the question is,</b>

00:05:08.124 --> 00:05:12.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Did Jehovah appreciate</b>

<b>Absolutely,</b>

<b>from his baptism.</b>

00:05:32.515 --> 00:05:37.520 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:05:43.926 --> 00:05:48.331 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:16:18.127 --> 00:16:22.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>In fact, as announced</b>

00:16:22.998 --> 00:16:26.168 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:16:31.974 --> 00:16:35.878 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:16:41.817 --> 00:16:46.822 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:16:52.194 --> 00:16:56.198 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:28.697 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:18:43.238 --> 00:18:45.407 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This past summer,

00:18:45.407 --> 00:18:47.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it was my privilege to attend

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
a large regional convention

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:52.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in Stockholm, Sweden.

00:18:52.681 --> 00:18:55.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Brothers and sisters 
from Sweden, Denmark,

00:18:55.784 --> 00:18:59.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Norway, Iceland,
Greenland, the Faeroe Islands,

00:18:59.721 --> 00:19:02.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and also the Swedish circuit in Finland

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:06.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
were present at this historic convention.

00:19:07.029 --> 00:19:11.800 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
While this event was
a great spiritual boost  for the Witnesses,

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.869 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
some of you may know

00:19:13.869 --> 00:19:17.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that the majority of the local residents

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:19.608 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
do not believe in God.

00:19:19.608 --> 00:19:23.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many consider themselves atheists.

00:19:23.378 --> 00:19:25.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But the conduct

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:29.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and professionalism of Jehovah’s people

00:19:29.284 --> 00:19:31.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
made a great impact.

00:19:44.399 --> 00:19:47.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
First, the branch offices were merged.

00:19:48.737 --> 00:19:50.739 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And the result was a new branch office

00:19:50.739 --> 00:19:52.641 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
—Scandinavia branch.

00:19:54.943 --> 00:19:57.980 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We thought
that if all the brothers in Scandinavia

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.982 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
should benefit from this unity,

00:19:59.982 --> 00:20:01.984 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
then we had to have
a convention in Stockholm.

00:20:07.656 --> 00:20:09.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Here we were allowed
to arrange a regional convention,

00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:11.693 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
but one of enormous size.

00:20:12.694 --> 00:20:16.465 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Having 50,000 brothers
gathered together for three days

00:20:16.465 --> 00:20:20.102 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is the largest theocratic event
ever in Scandinavia.

00:20:21.370 --> 00:20:24.006 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
So we began to look for a facility,

00:20:24.006 --> 00:20:27.042 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we found Friends Arena.

00:20:33.916 --> 00:20:37.719 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
I think we have had
a very good collaboration.

00:20:37.719 --> 00:20:39.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many times I have thought:

00:20:39.554 --> 00:20:41.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Wow, these people working for you

00:20:41.790 --> 00:20:45.327 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“as the organizers
of infrastructure, logistics, and so on,

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:48.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we should work with them more often.”

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:54.136 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
The use of technology
has been the greatest challenge.

00:20:54.636 --> 00:20:58.106 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously, with such a large project,
many details have to come together.

00:21:00.208 --> 00:21:02.377 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are four languages
and three sign languages,

00:21:02.377 --> 00:21:05.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all these have to be tied together
and work at the same time.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.983 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It has been a challenge, but we made it work.

00:21:07.983 --> 00:21:10.552 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
All the experts argued

00:21:10.552 --> 00:21:12.554 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
that it would be impossible

00:21:12.554 --> 00:21:15.958 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to have four languages at one arena.

00:21:48.857 --> 00:21:53.028 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Early in the morning,
families with children and strollers arrive.

00:21:53.862 --> 00:21:58.200 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Some elderly publishers
get up at 5:30 a.m. or 6:00 a.m.,

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.103 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
getting on the bus
to be here in good time.

00:22:01.103 --> 00:22:04.306 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah must be joyful
seeing all the people

00:22:04.306 --> 00:22:06.475 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
appreciating the spiritual program

00:22:06.475 --> 00:22:08.477 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and all their efforts.

00:22:17.119 --> 00:22:19.121 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When the song started,

00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:21.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
50,000 were in place here,

00:22:21.156 --> 00:22:25.227 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and it was our proof that all the hard work
in preparation was successful.

00:22:25.227 --> 00:22:27.562 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And actually,
I shed a tear of joy.

00:22:27.562 --> 00:22:29.364 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I did.

00:22:30.065 --> 00:22:33.235 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the managers at the arena said:

00:22:33.235 --> 00:22:35.570 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“You have to stand and listen to the song

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:38.073 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“because you will never again hear

00:22:38.073 --> 00:22:42.244 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“a choir of 50,000 singing at the same time.

00:22:42.244 --> 00:22:44.579 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You just have to listen to it.”

00:22:53.055 --> 00:22:54.756 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
First, I want to thank you

00:22:54.758 --> 00:22:56.892 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for how well it worked out.

00:22:56.892 --> 00:23:00.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Normally, at arrangements of this size,

00:23:00.028 --> 00:23:03.732 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we are using an event agency,
but you have done this for many years,

00:23:03.732 --> 00:23:07.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and you have done a fantastic job,
so it was not needed.

00:23:08.203 --> 00:23:12.507 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have been very professional
and have knowledge of the business industry.

00:23:13.175 --> 00:23:16.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I have told the contact persons
I have been involved with

00:23:16.378 --> 00:23:20.982 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they should start up an event agency
because it has worked out so smoothly.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:25.053 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I can warmly recommend
other cities to welcome you.

00:23:27.355 --> 00:23:29.491 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
You have been very well-organized,

00:23:29.491 --> 00:23:31.193 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and we have not had to put

00:23:31.193 --> 00:23:34.029 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much effort into the arrangement.

00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:37.032 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It requires good organization

00:23:37.032 --> 00:23:39.367 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to get all things to fall into place.

00:23:40.902 --> 00:23:44.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Obviously,
having so many tourists in Stockholm

00:23:44.039 --> 00:23:48.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
at the same time benefits the whole city.

00:23:48.276 --> 00:23:52.814 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I looked at the number of hotel bookings,
and there are not many rooms available.

00:23:52.814 --> 00:23:55.584 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There are many who can learn
from the work of the logistics,

00:23:55.584 --> 00:23:57.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of how to get 50,000 people

00:23:57.886 --> 00:24:00.422 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
into the area at the same time.

00:24:00.422 --> 00:24:03.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That is something we can learn a lot from.

00:24:03.558 --> 00:24:07.329 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We met with the police this afternoon,

00:24:07.329 --> 00:24:09.564 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they said that they have never seen

00:24:09.564 --> 00:24:13.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
such a well-organized event, ever.

00:24:14.136 --> 00:24:18.373 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Seeing how everything has been successful,

00:24:23.011 --> 00:24:26.448 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that is a clear evidence of Jehovah’s help.

00:24:27.349 --> 00:24:30.352 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It is a great confirmation of one’s faith.

00:24:31.119 --> 00:24:33.421 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you really see faith in action.

00:24:33.421 --> 00:24:37.325 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Here you see the foundation
for a new and better world.

00:24:50.805 --> 00:24:55.544 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

<b>Our assignment</b>

00:34:57.879 --> 00:35:00.414 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:35:00.414 --> 00:35:03.818 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>We care for all the islands</b><b> </b><b>of Micronesia.</b>

00:35:03.818 --> 00:35:07.221 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>It covers the same distance</b>

00:35:07.221 --> 00:35:10.024 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>But if you took all those islands</b>
<b>and put them together,</b>

00:35:10.024 --> 00:35:12.326 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

00:35:12.326 --> 00:35:14.962 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So it’s very vast and spread out.</b>

00:35:17.231 --> 00:35:19.801 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>We’ve seen Jehovah’s hand</b>

00:35:19.801 --> 00:35:23.404 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

<b>throughout the years on our projects. </b>

00:35:23.404 --> 00:35:26.574 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>One in particular</b><b> </b><b>that stands out to us</b>

00:35:26.574 --> 00:35:29.410 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>is the Rairok Congregation.</b>

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:33.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>This congregation had been meeting</b>
<b>in a house for a number of years.</b>

00:35:33.648 --> 00:35:37.718 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And they would have</b>
<b>70, 80, 90 in attendance at times,</b>

00:35:37.718 --> 00:35:40.721 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

<b>because they couldn’t fit in the house.</b>

00:35:40.721 --> 00:35:42.790 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And many of them</b>
<b>would listen through the window</b>

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:44.792 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>or observe through the door</b>

00:35:44.792 --> 00:35:49.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>through the rain, and they would have</b>
<b>a tarp set up just to try to keep dry.</b>

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.333 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So we found this piece of property,</b>
<b>but the problem was</b>

00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:54.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that the government</b><b> </b><b>had just placed a ban</b>

00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:59.140 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>on dredging sand and coral</b>

00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:02.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center

<b>to accomplish our project.</b>

00:36:04.378 --> 00:36:06.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So there was</b><b> </b><b>one company on the island</b>

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:09.650 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that had stockpiled sand and aggregate.</b>

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:13.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>We had gone to them a number of times,</b>
<b>telling them, asking them,</b>

00:36:13.554 --> 00:36:17.191 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>if we could purchase</b>
<b>just eight yards of cement</b>

00:36:17.191 --> 00:36:20.294 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>for our footings,</b>
<b>so we could at least get started.</b>

00:36:20.294 --> 00:36:23.664 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And they kept denying our request.</b>

00:36:23.664 --> 00:36:28.236 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>The construction overseer and myself</b>
<b>decided we’d go one more time</b>

00:36:28.236 --> 00:36:32.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>to that cement company</b>
<b>and plead our case with them.</b>

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:35.810 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>When we pulled </b>
<b>into the parking lot of the company, </b>

00:36:35.810 --> 00:36:40.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>we discussed what we could say </b>

00:36:40.514 --> 00:36:44.886 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>to convince them to at least sell us </b>
<b>the eight yards that we needed. </b>

00:36:44.886 --> 00:36:49.357 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>We made it a matter of prayer again, </b>
<b>we both exited the vehicle, </b>

00:36:49.357 --> 00:36:53.527 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and as we were approaching</b>
<b>the doors of the company,</b>

00:36:53.527 --> 00:36:57.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>this blue pickup pulled in</b>
<b>and kind of intercepted us.</b>

00:36:57.098 --> 00:37:01.602 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>The gentleman, a local man, hopped out</b>
<b>of his truck and said, “Can I help you?”</b>

00:37:01.602 --> 00:37:05.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>He was the man who was in charge.</b>

00:37:05.039 --> 00:37:07.708 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Well, we explained our situation,</b>

00:37:07.708 --> 00:37:10.912 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and he said, “Well, you’ll have</b>
<b>your concrete the next morning.”</b>

00:37:10.912 --> 00:37:13.681 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>What was interesting about that</b>
<b>and what really made us feel</b>

00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:16.784 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>like Jehovah had a hand in the matter</b>

00:37:16.784 --> 00:37:20.922 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>was that this gentleman</b>
<b>had just flown in the night before</b>

00:37:20.922 --> 00:37:24.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>from another island</b>
<b>—he had been gone for quite some time.</b>

00:37:24.258 --> 00:37:27.995 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>He had pulled in,</b>
<b>talked to us,</b>

00:37:27.995 --> 00:37:30.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and then hopped back</b>
<b>in his truck and drove away.</b>

00:37:30.731 --> 00:37:34.402 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So we wondered,</b>
<b>‘Why did he pull in in the first place?’</b>

00:37:34.402 --> 00:37:36.871 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>We didn’t want to argue with it;</b>

00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:39.740 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>we just took advantage of the situation. </b>

00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.745 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And the next morning</b>
<b>—seven o’clock—</b>

00:37:41.745 --> 00:37:45.146 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>the truck rolled in, </b>
<b>and we poured our footings.</b>

00:37:45.146 --> 00:37:49.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So we kept moving forward </b>
<b>with the project </b><b>until we got to that stage</b>

00:37:49.150 --> 00:37:53.254 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>where we would need to fill </b>
<b>the block work with 80 yards of sand</b>

00:37:53.254 --> 00:37:55.823 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>—on an island with no sand. </b>

00:37:55.823 --> 00:37:59.160 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So again we made it</b>
<b>a matter of prayer</b>

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.497 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and knew that if again Jehovah</b>
<b>wanted it built, it would be built.</b>

00:38:03.497 --> 00:38:06.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So we scoured the island again</b>
<b>to see if there was anybody willing,</b>

00:38:06.734 --> 00:38:09.070 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and we were unsuccessful.</b>

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:13.441 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So on our way back</b>
<b>to the construction site,</b>

00:38:13.441 --> 00:38:17.511 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>the construction overseer</b>
<b>and I stopped at a store</b>

00:38:17.511 --> 00:38:21.615 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>to purchase something, and we were talking</b>
<b>to the gentleman behind the counter.</b>

00:38:21.615 --> 00:38:23.617 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>We explained the situation to him,</b>
<b>and the man asked,</b>

00:38:23.617 --> 00:38:26.120 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>“Well, how much sand do you need?”</b>

00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:29.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And we told him 80 yards,</b>
<b>which is quite a bit,</b>

00:38:29.457 --> 00:38:32.994 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and the man said,</b>

00:38:32.994 --> 00:38:36.530 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>I don’t have anything to do with it,</b>
<b>so you are more than welcome to it.”</b>

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>He said,</b>
<b>“When do you need it?”</b>

00:38:38.532 --> 00:38:40.668 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>We said,</b>
<b>“Well, we need it</b><b> </b><b>tomorrow morning.”</b>

00:38:40.668 --> 00:38:43.137 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>The man said,</b>

00:38:43.137 --> 00:38:45.139 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>so I’ll see you in the morning.”</b>

00:38:45.139 --> 00:38:47.308 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Well, the next morning,</b>
<b>he showed up,</b>

00:38:47.308 --> 00:38:50.111 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and we were able to fill that area</b>
<b>and move on with the project.</b>

00:38:51.879 --> 00:38:55.516 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Another experience</b>
<b>that really stands out to me</b>

00:38:55.516 --> 00:38:58.619 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>is an experience</b>
<b>we had on the island of Yap.</b>

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:03.391 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>We were doing a renovation</b>
<b>of a remote translation office</b>

00:39:03.391 --> 00:39:05.760 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>and an extension of the Kingdom Hall</b>
<b>because of the growth</b>

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:07.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that they’ve had in the congregation.</b>

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:10.031 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>They’ve outgrown their Kingdom Hall.</b>

00:39:10.031 --> 00:39:12.299 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So for that extension we would need</b>

00:39:12.299 --> 00:39:15.302 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>cement and sand for backfill.</b>

00:39:15.302 --> 00:39:18.839 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>And again this is an island,</b>
<b>which is ironic</b>

00:39:18.839 --> 00:39:23.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>that you really can’t get sand</b>
<b>because there are no companies that sell it.</b>

00:39:23.044 --> 00:39:27.915 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So, what you do is you go from village</b>
<b>to village asking the village chief</b>

00:39:27.915 --> 00:39:31.986 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>if he would be willing</b>
<b>to sell sand off of his beach.</b>

00:39:31.986 --> 00:39:34.789 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Well, after visiting all the villages,</b>

00:39:34.789 --> 00:39:38.659 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>no one was willing to sell</b>
<b>any of their sand that we needed</b>

00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:43.631 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>until we reached the last village,</b>
<b>who was willing to sell the sand.</b>

00:39:43.631 --> 00:39:45.733 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>But the problem was</b>
<b>that there was a dispute</b>

00:39:45.733 --> 00:39:48.903 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>between two chiefs</b>
<b>that bordered that beach.</b>

00:39:48.903 --> 00:39:50.905 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>The one chief said,</b>
<b>“No, that’s my sand.”</b>

00:39:50.905 --> 00:39:52.973 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>The other one said that was his sand.</b>

00:39:52.973 --> 00:39:54.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>Well, they couldn’t come to an agreement,</b>

00:39:54.975 --> 00:39:57.545 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>so they weren’t willing</b>
<b>to sell the sand to us.</b>

00:39:57.545 --> 00:39:59.680 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>So we were</b><b> </b><b>at the stage</b>

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.349 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>where</b><b> </b><b>we were getting ready</b>

<b>with the extension of the Kingdom Hall.</b>

00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:08.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
<b>At that point,</b><b> </b><b>things got worse</b>

<b>approaching the island.</b>

00:40:10.891 --> 00:40:14.395 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
