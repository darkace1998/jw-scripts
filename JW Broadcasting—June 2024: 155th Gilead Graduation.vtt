00:00:01.522 --> 00:00:03.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are happy to welcome you

00:00:03.566 --> 00:00:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
to JW Broadcasting® for June 2024!

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
On March 9, 2024,

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:29.216 line:10% position:50% align:center
students from around the world

00:00:29.216 --> 00:00:30.634 line:10% position:50% align:center
were delighted to graduate

00:00:30.634 --> 00:00:33.137 line:10% position:50% align:center
from the 155th class of Gilead.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:36.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
The students came from 5 continents,

00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:38.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
represented more than 20 countries,

00:00:38.142 --> 00:00:41.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
and spoke over 35 languages.

00:00:41.228 --> 00:00:44.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
What parting encouragement
did members of the Governing Body,

00:00:44.481 --> 00:00:47.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Gilead instructors,
and others give to the graduates?

00:00:47.985 --> 00:00:50.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
What intriguing talk themes were developed?

00:00:50.738 --> 00:00:54.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Which countries were featured
in the latest edition of <i>The Inside Story?</i>

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:56.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out.

00:00:56.744 --> 00:00:58.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy Part 1!

00:00:59.455 --> 00:01:02.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you seem excited.
And you should be.

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re happy for you.

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:08.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
The graduation program today
will benefit every listener,

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:11.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
but even so, please know that this program

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:15.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
has been prepared with your class in mind.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:19.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the day is over, you’ll look back
and recall a program that honored Jehovah

00:01:19.975 --> 00:01:24.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that confirmed his love for you
as well as our love for you.

00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:28.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the past five months
of your schooling,

00:01:28.108 --> 00:01:31.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
you were asked to draw out
important Bible principles

00:01:31.362 --> 00:01:33.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
from many different accounts, true?

00:01:33.822 --> 00:01:35.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so many of those accounts

00:01:35.866 --> 00:01:39.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
focused on servants of God who with his help,

00:01:39.495 --> 00:01:43.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
well, succeeded in doing his will.

00:01:43.248 --> 00:01:46.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you no doubt agree more than ever before
with what the apostle Paul wrote

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:51.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 4:13, where he said:
“For all things I have the strength

00:01:51.215 --> 00:01:53.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the one who gives me power.”

00:01:53.884 --> 00:01:56.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you know who that “one” is—Jehovah.

00:01:56.387 --> 00:01:59.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he provides that power for us
by means of his Son.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he gave you the power
to succeed in this school, and you did.

00:02:04.812 --> 00:02:07.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s a blessing you must never forget.

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:10.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
He helped you, and he will always help you.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, in the future
when you face a task or challenge

00:02:13.946 --> 00:02:17.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seems very large, very daunting,

00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:21.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can remember
how he helped you at this time.

00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:24.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Keep in mind Scriptural examples like David.

00:02:24.832 --> 00:02:29.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
From his youth, David remembered his need
for Jehovah’s help, didn’t he?

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Psalm 71:5, 17, he said:

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:37.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For you are my hope,
O Sovereign Lord Jehovah;

00:02:37.928 --> 00:02:40.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have trusted in you since my youth.”

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:42.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have taught me from my youth,

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:46.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
and until now I keep declaring
your wonderful works.”

00:02:47.271 --> 00:02:51.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, isn’t that how you feel as Jehovah
has helped you along through the years

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:55.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
and now as he has helped you
through this schooling?

00:02:55.487 --> 00:02:57.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you’re at the point of graduation.

00:02:57.823 --> 00:03:01.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what a thrilling day it is for you
—one that you will never forget!

00:03:02.745 --> 00:03:07.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
So like David—he had the gratitude
to remember Jehovah’s help; so do we.

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:13.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
David had the faith to trust
in Jehovah’s help, and so do we.

00:03:13.088 --> 00:03:17.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we see those good qualities in you,
and we love you for it.

00:03:17.176 --> 00:03:19.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why you’re confident to face

00:03:19.845 --> 00:03:23.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
whatever things are ahead of you as well.

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:27.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
So use your Gilead training
in the branches where you will serve.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will love you for it.

00:03:29.646 --> 00:03:34.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
The dear brothers and sisters
will absolutely love you for it.

00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:37.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now we’re going to enjoy
a series of encouraging talks

00:03:37.905 --> 00:03:42.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
that for all of us, as mentioned earlier,
will strengthen our faith,

00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:44.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
build up our trust in God,

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:47.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
and highlight the wonderful purpose

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:50.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
(his wonderful purpose) that we support.

00:03:50.876 --> 00:03:53.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
So first of all in the program,

00:03:53.003 --> 00:03:56.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s give our attention
to Brother Jonathan Smith

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
—he serves as a helper
to the Service Committee—

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will discuss the theme
“What Do I Need To Do?”

00:04:06.225 --> 00:04:08.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What do I need to do?’

00:04:08.977 --> 00:04:11.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever asked yourself
that question?

00:04:11.688 --> 00:04:13.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if you’re like me,

00:04:13.732 --> 00:04:16.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
you ask yourself
that question every day,

00:04:16.151 --> 00:04:18.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes several times a day.

00:04:18.153 --> 00:04:20.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What do I need to do next?’

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there’s a little bit more
to that question,

00:04:22.991 --> 00:04:26.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe you
haven’t asked yourself this in a while,

00:04:26.203 --> 00:04:31.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What do I need to do
to inherit everlasting life?’

00:04:32.584 --> 00:04:36.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe that’s a question you asked
when you were first studying the Bible,

00:04:36.588 --> 00:04:38.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rightly so.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or maybe during your course
of your Gilead training,

00:04:41.385 --> 00:04:44.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
you asked yourself
that question a number of times.

00:04:45.514 --> 00:04:48.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in the Bible, there were two men

00:04:48.684 --> 00:04:52.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
who asked Jesus that same exact question.

00:04:52.396 --> 00:04:54.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of them asked Jesus the question

00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:57.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the last six months

00:04:57.234 --> 00:04:59.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jesus’ earthly ministry.

00:04:59.987 --> 00:05:03.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though it was the same question,
the answers were different.

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at the first one

00:05:07.202 --> 00:05:11.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Luke 10:25:

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:18.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now look! a man versed in the Law
stood up to test him and said:

00:05:18.005 --> 00:05:20.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Teacher, what do I need to do

00:05:20.716 --> 00:05:23.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
to inherit everlasting life?’”

00:05:23.427 --> 00:05:26.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus very astutely understands

00:05:26.013 --> 00:05:28.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
that this man is already versed in the Law.

00:05:28.473 --> 00:05:31.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
He probably already has an idea,

00:05:31.143 --> 00:05:33.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it seems his motive

00:05:33.228 --> 00:05:37.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be more to test Jesus 
than get an answer.

00:05:37.065 --> 00:05:39.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does Jesus do?

00:05:39.359 --> 00:05:43.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus lets him answer his own question

00:05:43.197 --> 00:05:46.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 26: “What is written in the Law?

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:48.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
How do you read?”

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:53.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 27, the man gives
an amazing answer.

00:05:53.498 --> 00:05:55.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
In one sentence,

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:57.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
this man sums up

00:05:57.544 --> 00:06:01.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
the entire Mosaic Law.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
He does it exactly the same way

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jesus had done so
on two different occasions.

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus is no doubt impressed.

00:06:12.601 --> 00:06:15.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to him in verse 28:
“You answered correctly;

00:06:15.145 --> 00:06:18.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
keep doing this and you will get life.”

00:06:19.107 --> 00:06:21.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are good lessons here for us:

00:06:21.151 --> 00:06:24.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we’re talking with people
about the Bible in our ministry,

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:27.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes we may detect
they have a little knowledge.

00:06:27.783 --> 00:06:30.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
Flip the question back to them,
“What do you think?”

00:06:30.077 --> 00:06:33.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
or better yet, “What do you read?”

00:06:33.121 --> 00:06:36.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing we can do is found in verse 28.

00:06:36.124 --> 00:06:39.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Commend a person
if they give a correct response.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:44.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let them know that you think
everlasting life is within their reach.

00:06:44.049 --> 00:06:47.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this man has another motive surface now.

00:06:47.803 --> 00:06:50.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
He moves from testing Jesus

00:06:50.222 --> 00:06:52.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
to wanting to prove himself righteous.

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:56.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 29, he says:
“Who really is my neighbor?”

00:06:56.436 --> 00:06:58.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, being Jewish and versed in the Law,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s already got an idea
on this one too, doesn’t he?

00:07:01.358 --> 00:07:02.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s probably thinking,

00:07:02.818 --> 00:07:05.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Is Jesus going to tell me
what I want to hear

00:07:05.821 --> 00:07:09.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘—that my neighbors are my Jewish friends,
perhaps in my village,

00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:12.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially those who follow the Law?’

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:17.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if so, that question
would be a little limiting—wouldn’t it?

00:07:17.291 --> 00:07:22.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Who really is my neighbor?”
isn’t really the best question.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:26.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how does Jesus
get around this motive that he’s got

00:07:26.508 --> 00:07:28.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
of proving himself righteous

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet correct his viewpoint on a neighbor?

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as you know, there’s a beautiful
parable here of the neighborly Samaritan,

00:07:35.892 --> 00:07:40.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jesus describes
a situation here in verses 30, 31, 32.

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
A man is going down from Jerusalem
to Jericho and falls victim to robbers.

00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:47.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
They strip him, beat him,
and leave him half-dead.

00:07:47.988 --> 00:07:52.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
But by coincidence,
a priest goes down that road

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:54.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
but passes by on the opposite side.

00:07:54.995 --> 00:07:58.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same thing happens with a Levite.

00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:00.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
He passes by on the opposite side.

00:08:00.167 --> 00:08:02.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are men
who have responsible positions

00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:04.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
in God’s organization.

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
How callous!
How insensitive!

00:08:08.425 --> 00:08:10.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a good lesson here for us.

00:08:10.552 --> 00:08:14.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may have responsible assignments
in Jehovah’s organization.

00:08:14.723 --> 00:08:18.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never allow that to cause us
to become callous

00:08:18.226 --> 00:08:20.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
to another person’s needs,

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:23.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
even putting our downtime, so to speak,

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
ahead of caring for someone.

00:08:26.985 --> 00:08:29.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you’ll notice
the Samaritan is very different.

00:08:29.154 --> 00:08:31.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verses 33 and 34,

00:08:31.406 --> 00:08:33.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s traveling this road
and he’s moved with pity.

00:08:33.867 --> 00:08:38.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
He approaches him, bandages the wounds,
pours oil and wine on them,

00:08:38.038 --> 00:08:40.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
mounts the poor man on his own animal,
brings him to an inn,

00:08:40.916 --> 00:08:44.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
and takes care of him,
evidently all that day.

00:08:44.544 --> 00:08:47.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
The next day (in verse 35),

00:08:47.672 --> 00:08:51.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
he takes out two denarii (two days’ wages),

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:53.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives them to the innkeeper and says:

00:08:53.053 --> 00:08:56.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take care of him,
and whatever you spend besides this,

00:08:56.348 --> 00:08:59.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I will repay you when I return.”

00:09:00.477 --> 00:09:04.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two days’ wages
—evidently he spent everything that he had

00:09:04.106 --> 00:09:06.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he was going to have to come back

00:09:06.983 --> 00:09:09.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
to give the innkeeper more—

00:09:09.444 --> 00:09:13.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
all for a man who was a Jew

00:09:13.448 --> 00:09:17.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
who would likely under normal circumstances
not even greet him.

00:09:18.954 --> 00:09:22.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus then asked another question,

00:09:22.541 --> 00:09:26.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
but this time Jesus
changes the man’s question,

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:29.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to “Who really is my neighbor?”,

00:09:29.464 --> 00:09:34.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
but to “Who of these three
seems to you to have made himself neighbor

00:09:34.469 --> 00:09:38.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the man who fell victim to the robbers?”

00:09:38.223 --> 00:09:41.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a better question?

00:09:41.143 --> 00:09:43.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
It isn’t ‘Who is my neighbor?’

00:09:43.145 --> 00:09:46.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
but ‘How can I make myself a neighbor?’

00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:51.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the man gets the point,
and he answers correctly again.

00:09:51.111 --> 00:09:52.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t say Samaritan.

00:09:52.863 --> 00:09:57.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe he can’t go that far, but he says:
“The one who acted mercifully.”

00:09:58.785 --> 00:10:01.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now Jesus says:

00:10:01.496 --> 00:10:04.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go and do the same yourself.”

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:08.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the account ends there
on a positive note.

00:10:08.962 --> 00:10:11.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we learn a lot
—don’t we?—

00:10:11.047 --> 00:10:14.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
about talking with people in our ministry

00:10:14.259 --> 00:10:17.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even
in our day-to-day conversations at work

00:10:17.846 --> 00:10:20.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
or with our brothers and sisters.

00:10:20.474 --> 00:10:24.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
When others have a question,
never belittle the question, right?

00:10:24.769 --> 00:10:28.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply help them
to come to the right conclusion.

00:10:28.773 --> 00:10:33.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never want to criticize someone
for a motive that may not be the best.

00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just kindly respond.

00:10:35.322 --> 00:10:39.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe a parable, an illustration,
will help them get the point.

00:10:40.577 --> 00:10:42.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, this isn’t the only time

00:10:42.787 --> 00:10:45.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus had to deal with that question,
as I mentioned.

00:10:45.582 --> 00:10:47.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go to another occasion.

00:10:47.876 --> 00:10:52.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this time we’re going to go
to Luke 18:18.

00:10:53.632 --> 00:10:56.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here we find that this man

00:10:56.885 --> 00:10:58.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not well-versed in the Law,

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he’s a ruler, and the Bible says
that he’s “very rich.”

00:11:03.767 --> 00:11:08.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in another Gospel,
it also says that he’s young.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:12.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rich and young and a ruler
—not always the best combination.

00:11:14.569 --> 00:11:16.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice here in verse 18,

00:11:16.738 --> 00:11:21.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
the conversation starts with him
running up to Jesus on bended knee:

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Good Teacher, what must I do
to inherit everlasting life?”

00:11:24.955 --> 00:11:27.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jesus can’t let this one go.

00:11:27.207 --> 00:11:31.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
You don’t want to call Jesus something
that should be only true of Jehovah,

00:11:31.795 --> 00:11:35.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is, a title of being a Good Teacher.

00:11:35.048 --> 00:11:37.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he gives him
a gentle correction there in verse 19.

00:11:37.926 --> 00:11:42.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 20, Jesus, of course,
explains some of the Ten Commandments.

00:11:44.224 --> 00:11:46.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the man in verse 21 says:

00:11:46.726 --> 00:11:49.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All of these I have kept from youth on.”

00:11:49.771 --> 00:11:54.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, ‘What else am I lacking?’

00:11:56.069 --> 00:11:59.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, after hearing this, Jesus acknowledges

00:11:59.739 --> 00:12:03.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
there actually is something lacking.

00:12:03.076 --> 00:12:05.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 22, one thing:

00:12:05.203 --> 00:12:08.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sell all the things you have
and distribute the proceeds to the poor,

00:12:08.999 --> 00:12:11.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you will have treasure in the heavens;

00:12:11.376 --> 00:12:14.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and come be my follower.”

00:12:15.672 --> 00:12:19.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s almost too much for him to take.

00:12:19.217 --> 00:12:21.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Mark’s account,

00:12:21.636 --> 00:12:26.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
it tells us at this point
Jesus “felt love” for the man

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:29.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he clearly saw
that he was sincere.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
But although
he was sincere in his question

00:12:34.149 --> 00:12:36.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
he couldn’t do it, could he?

00:12:36.526 --> 00:12:39.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When he heard this, he became
deeply grieved,

00:12:39.154 --> 00:12:41.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
for he was very rich.”

00:12:41.156 --> 00:12:45.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark says that “he had many possessions.”

00:12:45.118 --> 00:12:47.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we learned a few things
from this parable, didn’t we?

00:12:47.996 --> 00:12:51.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned that sometimes
people that have good motives

00:12:51.499 --> 00:12:54.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
don’t always have good qualities.

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:59.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this case, he was simply
too attached to his things,

00:12:59.299 --> 00:13:02.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that prevented him
from gaining one of the best privileges

00:13:02.719 --> 00:13:06.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
he could have possibly had
in following Jesus.

00:13:06.931 --> 00:13:10.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
So from these two accounts,
we learned some things.

00:13:10.685 --> 00:13:15.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
First of all, we learned
that we can learn from a “Samaritan.”

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:19.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever learned from a “Samaritan”?

00:13:19.027 --> 00:13:20.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know I have.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day many years ago, I was driving
down the road and I had a flat tire.

00:13:24.282 --> 00:13:28.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a spare tire,
but the tools I didn’t have.

00:13:28.912 --> 00:13:31.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this is before the days of cell phones.

00:13:31.122 --> 00:13:33.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
I walked up to the nearest house.

00:13:33.124 --> 00:13:37.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Can I use your phone, please,
to call a tow truck?”

00:13:37.128 --> 00:13:38.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the man said, “Well, why?”

00:13:38.630 --> 00:13:40.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “I need to change my tire.”

00:13:40.382 --> 00:13:42.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, “I’ll help you.”

00:13:42.425 --> 00:13:44.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
He comes out of his house,
gets his tools,

00:13:44.803 --> 00:13:48.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in no time changes my tire.

00:13:48.473 --> 00:13:50.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he’s doing so, I’m thinking to myself,

00:13:50.975 --> 00:13:53.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘He’s of another religion,
he’s of another culture,

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:57.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
another racial background,
and he’s changing my tire.’

00:13:57.607 --> 00:13:59.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
As I’m driving away, I’m thinking,

00:13:59.609 --> 00:14:03.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah taught me something today
from a “Samaritan.”’

00:14:04.197 --> 00:14:06.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do we learn?

00:14:06.574 --> 00:14:11.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not such a bad idea
occasionally to ask this question, is it?

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:14.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two men were wise to do so.

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:18.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, at least one of them
didn’t follow through.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
But occasionally, if we say to Jehovah,

00:14:21.589 --> 00:14:26.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please, what do I need to do
to inherit everlasting life?”,

00:14:26.010 --> 00:14:28.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can be sure that Jehovah
will answer that prayer,

00:14:28.972 --> 00:14:31.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe through personal study
or Bible reading,

00:14:31.641 --> 00:14:35.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
or it might even be through a “Samaritan.”

00:14:47.991 --> 00:14:50.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we thank you very much, Brother Smith,

00:14:50.535 --> 00:14:54.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
for that warm and practical talk.

00:14:54.122 --> 00:14:57.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now give our attention
to Brother Paul Gillies,

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
who serves as a helper
to the Coordinators’ Committee,

00:15:00.545 --> 00:15:04.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will discuss the theme “The Gift of God.”

00:15:07.469 --> 00:15:12.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the most generous Person
in the universe.

00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:17.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is the Giver of “every good gift
and every perfect present.”

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt you Gilead students
have thanked Jehovah many times

00:15:21.983 --> 00:15:25.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the numerous spiritual gifts
that you have received

00:15:25.779 --> 00:15:28.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the past five months.

00:15:29.199 --> 00:15:32.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
I recall what one of you said
in your introduction,

00:15:32.327 --> 00:15:35.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Gilead is an undeserved gift.”

00:15:36.247 --> 00:15:38.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
What I would like to ask you now is,

00:15:38.249 --> 00:15:40.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Have you experienced over these five months

00:15:40.794 --> 00:15:43.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the gift of God’ that’s mentioned

00:15:43.338 --> 00:15:48.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13?”

00:15:49.135 --> 00:15:51.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s have a look at these verses together.

00:15:51.137 --> 00:15:54.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 3:12, 13:

00:15:56.392 --> 00:15:59.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I have concluded
that there is nothing better for them

00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:04.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
“than to rejoice
and to do good during their life,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
“also that everyone should eat and drink

00:16:06.861 --> 00:16:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and find enjoyment for all his hard work.

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:13.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the gift of God.”

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:18.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this verse offers
a very simple formula for enjoying life

00:16:18.998 --> 00:16:21.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re blessed with good health.

00:16:21.209 --> 00:16:24.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is nothing better than to eat and drink

00:16:24.879 --> 00:16:28.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
and find enjoyment for hard work.

00:16:28.091 --> 00:16:29.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is that?

00:16:29.551 --> 00:16:33.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because it is “the gift of God.”

00:16:34.138 --> 00:16:36.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as explained in verse 12,

00:16:36.224 --> 00:16:40.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
the work which produces feelings
of enjoyment and satisfaction

00:16:40.436 --> 00:16:43.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
is, you’ll note, “to do good,”

00:16:43.606 --> 00:16:48.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is,
good deeds on behalf of others.

00:16:48.278 --> 00:16:52.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jesus said:
“There is more happiness in giving

00:16:52.407 --> 00:16:54.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
than there is in receiving.”

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:58.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 8:30 also tells us

00:16:58.872 --> 00:17:03.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
that as “a master worker,”
Jesus rejoiced,

00:17:03.418 --> 00:17:06.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
or as the Hebrew word for rejoice implies,

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had a good time.

00:17:08.965 --> 00:17:10.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, he had a good time

00:17:10.967 --> 00:17:14.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
working with his Father
over billions of years,

00:17:14.012 --> 00:17:16.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
creating the universe.

00:17:17.098 --> 00:17:19.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we may be a long way

00:17:19.142 --> 00:17:22.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
from being classed as a master worker,

00:17:22.604 --> 00:17:25.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
but all can enjoy the satisfaction that comes

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:29.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
from doing good work in Jehovah’s service.

00:17:29.235 --> 00:17:32.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
And don’t you find
that it’s this feeling itself

00:17:32.071 --> 00:17:34.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
that is a gift from God?

00:17:35.783 --> 00:17:39.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you’ll turn with me
to Ecclesiastes chapter 5,

00:17:39.579 --> 00:17:44.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 18 and 19 expand on this thought.

00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:48.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 5:18, 19:

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what I have seen
to be good and proper:

00:17:52.175 --> 00:17:54.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that one should eat and drink

00:17:54.177 --> 00:17:57.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and find enjoyment for all the hard work

00:17:57.472 --> 00:17:59.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at which he toils under the sun

00:17:59.515 --> 00:18:04.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“during the few days of life
that the true God has given him,

00:18:04.479 --> 00:18:07.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for that is his reward.

00:18:07.607 --> 00:18:10.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Also, when the true God gives a man

00:18:10.443 --> 00:18:12.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“riches and material possessions

00:18:12.946 --> 00:18:16.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“along with the ability to enjoy them,

00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:18.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he should take his reward

00:18:18.284 --> 00:18:21.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and rejoice in his hard work.

00:18:21.204 --> 00:18:24.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the gift of God.”

00:18:25.375 --> 00:18:27.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in effect, the Bible writer

00:18:27.627 --> 00:18:31.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
wisely recommends two things here:

00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:35.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
(1) Work diligently from day to day

00:18:35.677 --> 00:18:40.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (2) enjoy what you have right now.

00:18:41.683 --> 00:18:46.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when we recognize
that our prosperity is a gift from God,

00:18:46.062 --> 00:18:50.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
we get a lot of personal enjoyment
from what we possess.

00:18:50.984 --> 00:18:53.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice
that twice in these verses,

00:18:53.736 --> 00:18:56.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
this “gift of God” is described

00:18:56.155 --> 00:18:59.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a “reward” from Jehovah to us?

00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:04.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that a beautiful thought
that Jehovah chooses to reward us

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our hard work?

00:19:06.082 --> 00:19:08.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m sure you agree
that Gilead has added

00:19:08.543 --> 00:19:12.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
an abundance of spiritual treasures
to your possessions.

00:19:13.297 --> 00:19:18.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the coming years,
you will find enjoyment again and again

00:19:18.261 --> 00:19:21.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you recall an explanation of a verse

00:19:21.305 --> 00:19:24.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you discovered
during your personal study

00:19:24.517 --> 00:19:27.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that you gleaned
from one of your instructors

00:19:27.478 --> 00:19:29.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
during a class lesson.

00:19:30.356 --> 00:19:32.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like travelers abroad,

00:19:32.358 --> 00:19:36.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have collected priceless souvenirs.

00:19:37.155 --> 00:19:39.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you’re still
in Ecclesiastes chapter 5,

00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s have a look at verse 20

00:19:41.993 --> 00:19:45.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
because this verse explains how
“the gift of God”

00:19:45.288 --> 00:19:48.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
can affect our outlook on life.

00:19:48.750 --> 00:19:51.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “For he will hardly notice

00:19:51.586 --> 00:19:54.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[or as the footnote says, ‘remember,’

00:19:54.255 --> 00:19:58.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he will hardly notice]
the passing days of his life,

00:19:58.176 --> 00:20:01.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the true God keeps him preoccupied

00:20:01.721 --> 00:20:04.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the rejoicing of his heart.”

00:20:06.184 --> 00:20:10.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Time flies” is a very common refrain
here at Bethel.

00:20:10.688 --> 00:20:12.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t that so true?

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:15.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we enjoy our work,

00:20:15.234 --> 00:20:19.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
we hardly notice that our days, weeks, years,

00:20:19.197 --> 00:20:23.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
even life itself seems to fly by.

00:20:23.326 --> 00:20:27.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, the advice is to savor the moment.

00:20:27.872 --> 00:20:30.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
As one famous quote says,

00:20:30.249 --> 00:20:32.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yesterday is the past;

00:20:32.418 --> 00:20:34.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
“tomorrow is the future;

00:20:34.545 --> 00:20:36.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but today is a gift,

00:20:36.714 --> 00:20:39.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is why they call it the present.”

00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:49.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there are benefits to being busy.

00:20:49.143 --> 00:20:53.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The gift of God” can help us
to protect our mental well-being.

00:20:53.981 --> 00:20:56.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are preoccupied
with interesting work,

00:20:56.984 --> 00:21:01.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t become unduly concerned
with the brevity of life

00:21:01.114 --> 00:21:04.367 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its problems and uncertainties.

00:21:04.367 --> 00:21:08.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, we get so much enjoyment
from doing good

00:21:08.246 --> 00:21:10.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
—like Jesus having a good time—

00:21:10.706 --> 00:21:13.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the negative aspects of life

00:21:13.584 --> 00:21:16.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
tend not to dominate our thinking.

00:21:16.796 --> 00:21:20.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, we become joyful at heart.

00:21:20.133 --> 00:21:22.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
So enjoy that feeling.

00:21:22.301 --> 00:21:24.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is a gift from God.

00:21:25.721 --> 00:21:30.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the past 20 weeks of schooling
was hard work, wasn’t it?

00:21:30.726 --> 00:21:33.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your minds were stretched.

00:21:33.312 --> 00:21:37.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, hasn’t time flown by
since you introduced yourselves to us

00:21:37.733 --> 00:21:41.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
on November 6 of last year?

00:21:41.112 --> 00:21:44.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now it’s time to relax

00:21:44.073 --> 00:21:47.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to eat and drink
(in moderation, of course)

00:21:47.118 --> 00:21:49.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
with your family and friends

00:21:49.162 --> 00:21:52.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you reflect on your Gilead experience.

00:21:52.874 --> 00:21:56.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now is the time
to savor the reward from Jehovah.

00:21:58.504 --> 00:22:03.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same wise writer also suggested
a good balance between work and rest

00:22:03.342 --> 00:22:06.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he wrote at Ecclesiastes 4:6:

00:22:06.679 --> 00:22:08.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Better is a handful of rest

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:11.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
than two handfuls of hard work.”

00:22:11.976 --> 00:22:13.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now think about that.

00:22:13.978 --> 00:22:17.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
A workaholic has no time or energy left

00:22:17.356 --> 00:22:20.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
to participate in restful activities

00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:24.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
that are designed
to refresh and rejuvenate us.

00:22:24.238 --> 00:22:26.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to be modest about work,

00:22:26.824 --> 00:22:30.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we really love
our assignments.

00:22:30.912 --> 00:22:34.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible encourages a balanced view.

00:22:34.081 --> 00:22:37.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work hard and enjoy the rewards.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:42.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
We may thoroughly enjoy our work,

00:22:42.006 --> 00:22:45.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we must remember
that work is even more enjoyable

00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:47.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we take time to relax

00:22:47.678 --> 00:22:50.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reflect with pleasure on that work.

00:22:52.225 --> 00:22:57.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, since it’s likely that many of you
will receive new and enjoyable privileges,

00:22:57.063 --> 00:22:59.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will increase your workload,

00:22:59.774 --> 00:23:03.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is good and timely advice
from the Scriptures, is it not?

00:23:04.779 --> 00:23:06.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, may I invite you to turn

00:23:06.405 --> 00:23:10.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
to 2 Timothy 1:6.

00:23:12.245 --> 00:23:15.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because this verse conveys
another positive dimension

00:23:15.831 --> 00:23:19.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the expression
“the gift of God”

00:23:19.043 --> 00:23:22.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you look to future assignments.

00:23:22.546 --> 00:23:24.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:

00:23:24.173 --> 00:23:28.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For this reason I remind you
to stir up like a fire

00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:30.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the gift of God that is in you

00:23:30.554 --> 00:23:33.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the laying of my hands on you.”

00:23:34.976 --> 00:23:39.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now if you look at the study note,
it says this:

00:23:39.105 --> 00:23:41.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The gift that Paul here mentions

00:23:41.607 --> 00:23:45.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“seems to involve a gift of holy spirit

00:23:45.569 --> 00:23:49.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the imparting to Timothy
of some special ability

00:23:49.782 --> 00:23:52.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helped him to fulfill his assignment.”

00:23:53.744 --> 00:23:57.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, of course, Gilead students
do not have scholastic abilities

00:23:57.623 --> 00:24:00.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
conferred upon them by God, do they?

00:24:01.919 --> 00:24:04.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of you even said in your introduction,

00:24:04.964 --> 00:24:09.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We’re just ordinary Bethelites
living extraordinary lives.”

00:24:10.970 --> 00:24:13.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while that may be true,

00:24:13.389 --> 00:24:17.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
nevertheless,
Gilead training has perhaps helped you

00:24:17.685 --> 00:24:20.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discover and nurture hidden talents

00:24:20.813 --> 00:24:24.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you never knew you had, true?

00:24:24.358 --> 00:24:27.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your instructors may have noticed
if you didn’t.

00:24:30.156 --> 00:24:34.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of us who enjoy service privileges
like Timothy

00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:37.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
need to treasure our “gift of God.”

00:24:37.371 --> 00:24:39.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
Service privileges are expressions

00:24:39.957 --> 00:24:43.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s undeserved kindness,

00:24:43.002 --> 00:24:45.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
not a reward for months of study.

00:24:46.339 --> 00:24:50.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, all of our energies,
our abilities, our talents

00:24:50.468 --> 00:24:54.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
may be viewed as gifts from Jehovah.

00:24:54.096 --> 00:24:59.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they have the purpose
of doing good toward other people.

00:24:59.018 --> 00:25:02.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if that’s our outlook
and that’s our motive,

00:25:02.313 --> 00:25:06.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
we will thoroughly enjoy our assignments.

00:25:06.901 --> 00:25:09.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
You notice too in this verse
that Paul reminded Timothy

00:25:09.945 --> 00:25:14.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to stir up like a fire the gift of God”
that was in him.

00:25:15.951 --> 00:25:19.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
No doubt you are fired up and you are ready

00:25:19.789 --> 00:25:22.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
to work hard in your assignments.

00:25:22.833 --> 00:25:25.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
But again, as explained in the study note,

00:25:25.378 --> 00:25:30.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘stirring up like a fire’
implies continuous action;

00:25:30.257 --> 00:25:32.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“one scholar suggests . . .

00:25:32.593 --> 00:25:36.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘to keep the fire burning at full flame.’”

00:25:37.264 --> 00:25:40.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’re encouraged
to put our heart and energy

00:25:40.393 --> 00:25:42.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
into our assignments.

00:25:42.686 --> 00:25:46.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be fired up, but don’t burn out.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:50.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
The fire will continue to burn at full flame

00:25:50.861 --> 00:25:54.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we always remember
to balance work and rest.

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:59.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
So yes, the days of our life quickly pass.

00:25:59.412 --> 00:26:04.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a fact of life now, but only for now.

00:26:04.208 --> 00:26:08.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the new world,
we will enjoy work to the full.

00:26:08.212 --> 00:26:11.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
The joy of living will get better and better,

00:26:11.882 --> 00:26:15.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we’re in perfect health.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will enjoy the pleasure also

00:26:17.012 --> 00:26:20.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
of consuming unpolluted food and drink.

00:26:20.933 --> 00:26:22.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
So enjoy life.

00:26:22.935 --> 00:26:25.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy life with your family and friends.

00:26:25.813 --> 00:26:28.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy all that you have now.

00:26:28.482 --> 00:26:30.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Enjoy your assignments.

00:26:30.192 --> 00:26:32.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Put your heart into them,

00:26:32.194 --> 00:26:34.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
but be balanced.

00:26:34.196 --> 00:26:37.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
The simple formula from Ecclesiastes

00:26:37.366 --> 00:26:40.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
will carry on
for billions and billions of years,

00:26:40.453 --> 00:26:42.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
even forever.

00:26:42.455 --> 00:26:47.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Eat and drink and find enjoyment”
for all your hard work

00:26:47.209 --> 00:26:50.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it is “the gift of God.”

00:27:02.725 --> 00:27:05.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, thank you very much, Brother Gillies.

00:27:05.102 --> 00:27:09.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
We certainly view that talk
as a gift, or present.

00:27:09.565 --> 00:27:11.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciated it.

00:27:11.775 --> 00:27:16.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now Brother Edward Aljian,
who works in the Writing Department,

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:21.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
will present the next part entitled
“A Problem and a Solution.”

00:27:24.788 --> 00:27:28.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you brothers and sisters
from the 155th class of Gilead

00:27:28.584 --> 00:27:30.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not only about to graduate

00:27:30.669 --> 00:27:32.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
but will soon be heading
toward your assignments,

00:27:32.838 --> 00:27:34.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we know you’ll enjoy.

00:27:34.882 --> 00:27:37.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
But life being what it is,

00:27:37.676 --> 00:27:41.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know that problems occasionally arise.

00:27:41.722 --> 00:27:44.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one problem
you might personally encounter

00:27:44.934 --> 00:27:49.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
somewhere down the road
is difficulty understanding an adjustment

00:27:49.939 --> 00:27:54.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
to an organizational
or theocratic arrangement.

00:27:54.193 --> 00:27:57.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be a change
in our preaching methods,

00:27:57.363 --> 00:28:00.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in congregation operations,

00:28:00.407 --> 00:28:04.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
or in branch procedures,
or something like that.

00:28:04.286 --> 00:28:07.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, normally we appreciate
these organizational refinements

00:28:07.915 --> 00:28:11.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
in harmony with Isaiah 60:17.

00:28:11.085 --> 00:28:16.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet our publications
and even the Bible itself acknowledge

00:28:16.006 --> 00:28:19.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
that at some point
any one of us might find it hard

00:28:19.718 --> 00:28:21.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make that transition

00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the way we had been doing something

00:28:25.307 --> 00:28:28.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the way we’re now instructed to do it.

00:28:28.811 --> 00:28:30.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, why would we find it difficult?

00:28:30.813 --> 00:28:32.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because it affects us personally?

00:28:32.898 --> 00:28:35.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
It changes where we serve or what we do?

00:28:35.859 --> 00:28:37.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe that.

00:28:37.653 --> 00:28:39.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe not that.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe it’s just that mentally

00:28:42.616 --> 00:28:47.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re finding it hard
to grasp the sense behind the change.

00:28:47.162 --> 00:28:50.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re loyal; we’re going to cooperate.

00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:52.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our brain keeps saying:

00:28:52.126 --> 00:28:54.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why are we going in this direction?

00:28:54.712 --> 00:28:59.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seems to me we should be going
in that direction instead.’

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:05.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, if we have been given new direction

00:29:05.097 --> 00:29:09.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
and mentally
we’re strongly inclined otherwise,

00:29:09.935 --> 00:29:14.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we have a problem,
but we also have a solution.

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s in Philippians chapter 3.

00:29:17.276 --> 00:29:19.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we go there?

00:29:20.112 --> 00:29:22.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here Paul discusses a problem

00:29:22.656 --> 00:29:25.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
that existed back there
in some congregations.

00:29:25.743 --> 00:29:28.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, was it a big problem in Philippi?

00:29:28.037 --> 00:29:29.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apparently not.

00:29:29.538 --> 00:29:32.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
But anticipating that it might be a problem

00:29:32.666 --> 00:29:34.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some individuals there,

00:29:34.918 --> 00:29:39.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul addresses it right here
at Philippians 3:15, 16.

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:44.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Therefore, let those of us
who are mature be of this mental attitude,

00:29:44.511 --> 00:29:49.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and if you are mentally inclined otherwise

00:29:49.058 --> 00:29:50.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in any respect,

00:29:50.768 --> 00:29:53.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God will reveal the above attitude to you.

00:29:53.646 --> 00:29:57.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At any rate,
to the extent we’ve made progress,

00:29:57.399 --> 00:30:02.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
let us go on walking orderly
in this same course.”

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:04.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is Paul talking about?

00:30:04.948 --> 00:30:08.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
A major organizational adjustment

00:30:08.577 --> 00:30:13.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the shift from the Mosaic Law
to Christianity.

00:30:13.707 --> 00:30:16.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Paul, for one, understood it.

00:30:16.835 --> 00:30:20.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was not mentally inclined otherwise.

00:30:20.214 --> 00:30:22.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
He left behind

00:30:22.216 --> 00:30:25.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
his attachment to the Law;

00:30:25.719 --> 00:30:28.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
any personal advantages
that it was bringing him,

00:30:28.138 --> 00:30:31.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe along the lines
of prominence, prestige among the Jews.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
He left it all behind.
That was Paul.

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it took some Jewish Christians years

00:30:38.399 --> 00:30:42.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
to grow to the point
where they could leave that Law behind

00:30:42.528 --> 00:30:46.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fully adopt

00:30:46.281 --> 00:30:49.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
all aspects of Christianity.

00:30:49.201 --> 00:30:51.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did it take them so long?

00:30:51.286 --> 00:30:55.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s easy for us to say:
“Well they were stubborn.

00:30:55.916 --> 00:30:58.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had a bad attitude.”

00:30:58.085 --> 00:31:00.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
And some of them did.

00:31:00.129 --> 00:31:02.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were some, for example,

00:31:02.172 --> 00:31:06.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
who wanted to hold on to parts of the Law

00:31:06.343 --> 00:31:08.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to avoid persecution.

00:31:08.345 --> 00:31:10.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
So you had things like that going on.

00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:13.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
But think also of this:

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Prior to Christianity,

00:31:16.145 --> 00:31:19.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Mosaic Law
was Jehovah’s arrangement for worship.

00:31:19.273 --> 00:31:21.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there must have been
some Jewish worshippers

00:31:21.942 --> 00:31:24.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
who before becoming Christian

00:31:24.445 --> 00:31:27.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
were very loyal to the Mosaic Law.

00:31:27.239 --> 00:31:30.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
And being of the loyal sort,
what do you think they did?

00:31:30.826 --> 00:31:32.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just obey the Law?

00:31:32.828 --> 00:31:35.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.
They’d have taken it further.

00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’d have worked hard to cultivate

00:31:37.374 --> 00:31:40.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
a strong appreciation for the Law

00:31:40.544 --> 00:31:43.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a deep love
for the way different features of the Law

00:31:43.505 --> 00:31:47.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflected Jehovah’s personality,
his ways, his thinking.

00:31:47.926 --> 00:31:49.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps some invested years

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
bringing their appreciation up
to that high level.

00:31:52.347 --> 00:31:56.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now that they had,
the Law suddenly goes out of effect.

00:31:57.269 --> 00:32:02.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you can appreciate why
it might have been hard for some loyal ones

00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:05.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
to process this change mentally.

00:32:05.235 --> 00:32:08.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could something like that happen today?
Yes it could.

00:32:08.530 --> 00:32:10.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe you’re taught years ago,

00:32:10.532 --> 00:32:14.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is how we preach,
and this is why,” right?

00:32:14.036 --> 00:32:18.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or “This is how the congregation
handles certain situations, and this is why.”

00:32:19.333 --> 00:32:22.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or “This is how we view
certain branch procedures,

00:32:22.419 --> 00:32:25.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is why it is the very best way.”

00:32:25.005 --> 00:32:27.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, being of the loyal sort,
what did you do?

00:32:28.509 --> 00:32:30.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
You made it all your own

00:32:30.719 --> 00:32:34.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not just the arrangement itself
but the reasoning behind the arrangement.

00:32:34.723 --> 00:32:39.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
If somebody came along and challenged it,
you loyally defended it.

00:32:39.478 --> 00:32:42.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
And maybe it took you years

00:32:42.439 --> 00:32:45.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring your appreciation up
to that high level,

00:32:45.567 --> 00:32:48.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
but loyally you did.

00:32:48.487 --> 00:32:52.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now that you did,
the arrangement changes

00:32:52.449 --> 00:32:56.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
and maybe even
the reasoning behind the arrangement.

00:32:56.954 --> 00:33:00.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, like some of those
early Jewish Christians,

00:33:00.082 --> 00:33:04.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
your very loyalty
to a previous theocratic arrangement

00:33:04.503 --> 00:33:07.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
might make it hard to grasp immediately

00:33:07.422 --> 00:33:11.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
the wisdom behind the new adjustment.

00:33:11.176 --> 00:33:13.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, like we said, that’s the problem.

00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:16.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the solution?
What can we actually do about it?

00:33:16.807 --> 00:33:19.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, three things,

00:33:19.351 --> 00:33:22.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all three are right there
in the verses we just read.

00:33:24.064 --> 00:33:27.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, be patient.

00:33:27.276 --> 00:33:29.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Paul say there in verse 15?

00:33:29.361 --> 00:33:32.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, let those of us
who are mature be of this mental attitude,

00:33:32.614 --> 00:33:35.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and if you
are mentally inclined otherwise . . . ,

00:33:35.409 --> 00:33:38.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
God will reveal the above attitude to you.”

00:33:38.412 --> 00:33:42.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you’ve made an earnest endeavor,
a prayerful endeavor,

00:33:42.416 --> 00:33:46.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get the sense behind the change
and for now you just can’t,

00:33:46.628 --> 00:33:48.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
set it aside.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:52.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be patient because the day will come

00:33:52.009 --> 00:33:56.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
(maybe sooner but maybe later),

00:33:56.221 --> 00:34:00.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the pieces
finally fall into place for you

00:34:00.309 --> 00:34:04.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you grasp the wisdom
behind the adjustment.

00:34:05.105 --> 00:34:08.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now number two: Walk orderly.

00:34:08.859 --> 00:34:10.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that mean?

00:34:10.652 --> 00:34:14.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study note for verse 16
explains that walking orderly

00:34:14.323 --> 00:34:17.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
has to do with moving forward unitedly
as Christians.

00:34:17.993 --> 00:34:20.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in the context
of what we’re talking about right now,

00:34:20.787 --> 00:34:24.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
walking orderly means supporting
the new arrangement

00:34:24.541 --> 00:34:27.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
without resisting,
without complaining,

00:34:27.711 --> 00:34:29.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
because what does complaining
and resisting do?

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:32.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s walking disorderly.

00:34:32.382 --> 00:34:35.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s promoting disunity.

00:34:35.385 --> 00:34:39.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
So no, we walk orderly;
we support the arrangement.

00:34:39.806 --> 00:34:44.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, number three:
Stay busy in your theocratic routine,

00:34:44.144 --> 00:34:45.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
because there in verse 16,

00:34:45.896 --> 00:34:50.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul encourages all of the Philippians
to keep making “progress.”

00:34:50.359 --> 00:34:52.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the same is true of all of us.

00:34:54.029 --> 00:34:56.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Certainly, there are
many aspects of the truth

00:34:56.907 --> 00:35:01.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we do appreciate, we do understand,
and we’re making progress.

00:35:01.119 --> 00:35:02.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good.

00:35:02.162 --> 00:35:05.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Put your mind and heart there, right?

00:35:05.165 --> 00:35:07.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather than continuing to obsess
over something

00:35:07.793 --> 00:35:11.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you just can’t understand for now,

00:35:11.546 --> 00:35:14.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
stay busy in your assignment

00:35:14.508 --> 00:35:18.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stay absorbed
in your weekly spiritual routine.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:21.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
It brings immediate contentment.

00:35:21.515 --> 00:35:23.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s review.

00:35:24.226 --> 00:35:27.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we ever have a problem

00:35:27.771 --> 00:35:31.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
understanding an adjustment
to a theocratic arrangement,

00:35:31.984 --> 00:35:33.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
we also have a solution:

00:35:33.986 --> 00:35:36.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Philippians 3:15, 16.

00:35:36.488 --> 00:35:39.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be patient, walk orderly,

00:35:39.408 --> 00:35:43.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
and stay busy in our theocratic routine.

00:35:44.663 --> 00:35:48.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I would like to conclude

00:35:48.208 --> 00:35:51.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
by illustrating that last point

00:35:51.211 --> 00:35:55.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the value of staying busy
in our theocratic routine

00:35:55.382 --> 00:35:58.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it is the solution not just
to what we’re talking about right now

00:35:58.844 --> 00:36:02.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it is the solution
to several situations in life.

00:36:02.055 --> 00:36:06.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the illustration
is one that I heard several years ago

00:36:06.435 --> 00:36:08.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
at a Gilead graduation program.

00:36:08.729 --> 00:36:10.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about that?

00:36:10.731 --> 00:36:12.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of your instructors told us

00:36:12.774 --> 00:36:16.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
about the old steamboats
that used coal for fuel, right?

00:36:16.319 --> 00:36:18.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
So upstairs you had the captain and the crew.

00:36:18.447 --> 00:36:20.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Downstairs you have these men
busy shoveling coal

00:36:20.949 --> 00:36:24.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
into the ship’s boiler, right?

00:36:24.286 --> 00:36:26.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, imagine one of these workers
puts his shovel down

00:36:26.872 --> 00:36:28.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he approaches a coworker and says:

00:36:28.707 --> 00:36:33.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hey, did I just detect the ship
starting to make a left turn?

00:36:33.378 --> 00:36:35.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That does not seem right to me.

00:36:35.714 --> 00:36:39.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It seems that at this point of the trip,
we should be moving straight forward,

00:36:39.593 --> 00:36:41.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not changing direction.

00:36:41.636 --> 00:36:44.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I wonder if the captain
really knows what he’s doing.

00:36:44.306 --> 00:36:47.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know what? I’m going to go upstairs
and have a word with the captain.”

00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:52.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, at this point,
the speaker stopped describing the scene.

00:36:52.022 --> 00:36:55.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just leaned forward
close to the microphone,

00:36:55.108 --> 00:36:58.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he simply said, “Shovel the coal.”

00:37:01.615 --> 00:37:03.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s you and me, right?

00:37:03.909 --> 00:37:06.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s you and me—we are shoveling the coal.

00:37:06.453 --> 00:37:09.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re busy doing the work
Jehovah assigned us to do.

00:37:09.998 --> 00:37:11.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we’re absorbed in.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:16.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
We let Jehovah take care of Isaiah 60:17
—‘the copper, the gold, the silver.’

00:37:16.088 --> 00:37:20.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
We take care of the coal
by staying absorbed and busy

00:37:20.759 --> 00:37:23.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our theocratic routine.

00:37:23.678 --> 00:37:27.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then as Jehovah
navigates his organization,

00:37:27.891 --> 00:37:31.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll also navigate us
to the right attitude

00:37:31.144 --> 00:37:34.314 line:90% position:50% align:center
to contentment

00:37:34.314 --> 00:37:38.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to that most wonderful adjustment of all

00:37:38.944 --> 00:37:42.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
—from this system to life in the new world.

00:37:54.501 --> 00:37:57.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we thank you very much, Brother Aljian,

00:37:57.629 --> 00:38:02.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
for that three-part solution
to a very realistic problem.

00:38:02.801 --> 00:38:06.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now one of your instructors,
Brother Richard Chilton,

00:38:06.304 --> 00:38:10.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
will talk about the subject entitled
“Have You Ever Been Fooled?”

00:38:14.312 --> 00:38:19.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this day has finally arrived,
and you’ve made it.

00:38:20.902 --> 00:38:25.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now for some of you,
it is a return trip home.

00:38:25.198 --> 00:38:29.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
For others, you’re off to a new home.

00:38:29.703 --> 00:38:32.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
But no matter where you’re going,

00:38:32.122 --> 00:38:34.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
one thing is for sure,

00:38:34.499 --> 00:38:37.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is all of you
—all of you—

00:38:37.586 --> 00:38:42.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
are about to begin
a new chapter in your life.

00:38:42.174 --> 00:38:44.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while that realization

00:38:44.426 --> 00:38:46.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
can spark feelings of excitement,

00:38:46.761 --> 00:38:50.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can also spark a little anxiety as well.

00:38:50.974 --> 00:38:54.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Questions may be swirling in your mind:

00:38:54.895 --> 00:38:57.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Who really am I now?

00:38:57.772 --> 00:39:00.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Will I be able to fulfill

00:39:00.442 --> 00:39:03.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘all that will be expected of me?

00:39:03.528 --> 00:39:06.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I really do this?’

00:39:06.907 --> 00:39:11.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you find any of these feelings
bubbling up inside of you,

00:39:11.703 --> 00:39:13.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
then remember this:

00:39:13.788 --> 00:39:15.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are not alone.

00:39:16.917 --> 00:39:20.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Throughout time, faithful servants of God

00:39:20.503 --> 00:39:23.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
have had those same feelings.

00:39:23.465 --> 00:39:26.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s take a closer look at one of them

00:39:26.051 --> 00:39:30.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
by turning to the Bible book
that bears his name, Jeremiah.

00:39:32.599 --> 00:39:35.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Jeremiah chapter 1,

00:39:35.769 --> 00:39:38.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what he says beginning in verse 4.

00:39:40.565 --> 00:39:44.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “The word of Jehovah
came to me, saying:

00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:49.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Before I formed you in the womb I knew you,

00:39:49.574 --> 00:39:53.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and before you were born I sanctified you.

00:39:53.745 --> 00:39:58.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made you a prophet to the nations.’”

00:39:59.626 --> 00:40:02.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, was Jeremiah flattered

00:40:02.545 --> 00:40:05.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the fact that Jehovah
saw such potential in him?

00:40:06.633 --> 00:40:08.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Quite the opposite.

00:40:08.969 --> 00:40:12.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice his response in verse 6:

00:40:12.389 --> 00:40:17.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I said: ‘Alas, O Sovereign Lord Jehovah!

00:40:17.394 --> 00:40:22.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
I do not know how to speak,
for I am just a boy.’”

00:40:22.399 --> 00:40:26.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, ‘I don’t think I’m qualified

00:40:26.653 --> 00:40:29.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
for what you’re asking me to do.’

00:40:30.073 --> 00:40:33.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what Jehovah does in verse 9:

00:40:34.494 --> 00:40:37.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then Jehovah stretched out his hand

00:40:37.455 --> 00:40:39.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and touched my mouth.

00:40:39.749 --> 00:40:41.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And Jehovah said to me:

00:40:41.751 --> 00:40:46.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I have put my words in your mouth.’”

00:40:47.590 --> 00:40:50.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah was reassuring Jeremiah:

00:40:50.677 --> 00:40:55.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Don’t worry.
I’ve got this and you.’

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the nervous prophet
accepted his assignment

00:41:00.437 --> 00:41:04.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, admittedly, it was not always easy.

00:41:04.274 --> 00:41:07.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times he met with fierce opposition.

00:41:07.402 --> 00:41:10.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was mobbed, imprisoned,

00:41:10.488 --> 00:41:14.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
left to die in the mud
at the bottom of an empty cistern.

00:41:14.534 --> 00:41:17.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, he went through a lot,

00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:21.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
and at one point,
he even thought about quitting.

00:41:23.668 --> 00:41:25.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what he says in chapter 20,

00:41:27.088 --> 00:41:30.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
chapter 20, the middle of verse 8.

00:41:32.552 --> 00:41:36.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “For me the word of Jehovah

00:41:36.222 --> 00:41:39.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
“has been the cause
of insults and jeering all day long.

00:41:39.642 --> 00:41:43.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So I said:
‘I am not going to make mention of him,

00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:46.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I will speak no more in his name.’”

00:41:46.358 --> 00:41:48.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Jeremiah,

00:41:48.401 --> 00:41:53.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
we too may have our moments

00:41:53.114 --> 00:41:55.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we feel like giving up is the answer.

00:41:58.036 --> 00:42:00.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
But let’s read on in the middle of verse 9:

00:42:01.915 --> 00:42:05.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But in my heart

00:42:05.251 --> 00:42:09.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it
[the message that he had been proclaiming]

00:42:09.923 --> 00:42:14.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“became like a burning fire
shut up in my bones,

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:16.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I was tired of holding it in;

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:20.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could no longer endure it.”

00:42:20.266 --> 00:42:22.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what happened here?

00:42:22.811 --> 00:42:25.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the hardships,

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
clearly the boy

00:42:27.816 --> 00:42:32.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
had become the bold prophet of Jehovah.

00:42:32.237 --> 00:42:35.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
But my question to you is,
How did that happen?

00:42:35.865 --> 00:42:39.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah himself tells us in verse 11.

00:42:39.577 --> 00:42:44.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “Jehovah was with me

00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:47.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
like a fearsome warrior.”

00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the fearsome Warrior at his side,

00:42:50.422 --> 00:42:54.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jeremiah went from being unable to speak

00:42:54.384 --> 00:42:57.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
to being unable to hold it in.

00:42:58.638 --> 00:43:03.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
He experienced
a one-hundred-and-eighty-degree change,

00:43:03.601 --> 00:43:07.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he knew exactly
who was responsible for it.

00:43:07.021 --> 00:43:10.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
He tells us in our theme scripture text
for this talk

00:43:10.692 --> 00:43:14.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the same chapter, chapter 20, verse 7.

00:43:14.362 --> 00:43:18.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “You have fooled me,

00:43:18.867 --> 00:43:23.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, and I was fooled.

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:28.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
You used your strength against me,
and you prevailed.”

00:43:28.084 --> 00:43:31.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah had fooled Jeremiah

00:43:31.713 --> 00:43:33.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a positive way.

00:43:34.466 --> 00:43:38.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Jeremiah reached
what he thought was his limit,

00:43:38.845 --> 00:43:42.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah proved stronger
than Jeremiah’s weaknesses

00:43:42.515 --> 00:43:44.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
and empowered him to continue.

00:43:46.895 --> 00:43:49.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was able to make the one-eighty

00:43:49.564 --> 00:43:53.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he, first of all,
accepted the assignment.

00:43:53.401 --> 00:43:56.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, he trusted in Jehovah.

00:43:56.446 --> 00:43:59.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, he allowed time

00:43:59.282 --> 00:44:01.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
for God’s spirit to work on him.

00:44:02.744 --> 00:44:06.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you think 
Jeremiah was an isolated case, think again.

00:44:08.082 --> 00:44:10.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Moses did the one-eighty.

00:44:10.627 --> 00:44:13.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went from a man “slow of speech”

00:44:13.338 --> 00:44:16.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
to becoming a mighty leader
of an entire nation.

00:44:18.343 --> 00:44:20.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jonah did the one-eighty.

00:44:20.887 --> 00:44:23.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went from a man

00:44:23.056 --> 00:44:26.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
running away from his assignment
in the opposite direction

00:44:26.809 --> 00:44:31.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
to becoming a bold preacher to the Ninevites.

00:44:31.105 --> 00:44:33.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter did the one-eighty.

00:44:33.816 --> 00:44:36.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
He went from denying the Christ three times

00:44:36.778 --> 00:44:40.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
to becoming the rock
that Jesus always knew he could be.

00:44:41.783 --> 00:44:43.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what about you?

00:44:43.785 --> 00:44:47.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever been fooled by Jehovah?

00:44:49.374 --> 00:44:52.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to read to you a few words

00:44:52.126 --> 00:44:55.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I recently received
from a Gilead graduate.

00:44:55.255 --> 00:44:57.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said this:

00:44:58.383 --> 00:45:02.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When we heard the news
that we were being assigned to a country

00:45:02.262 --> 00:45:06.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that had its fair share
of poverty, instability, and sickness,

00:45:06.975 --> 00:45:10.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I felt like saying to Jehovah:

00:45:10.186 --> 00:45:13.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Are you sure

00:45:13.064 --> 00:45:17.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you want to send me there?

00:45:17.068 --> 00:45:20.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I don’t like bugs,

00:45:20.113 --> 00:45:22.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I’m scared of being sick.’

00:45:23.658 --> 00:45:25.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When the date of our departure came,

00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I still remember all the tears I shed

00:45:28.371 --> 00:45:31.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
when saying goodbye to my home and friends.”

00:45:32.375 --> 00:45:34.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she accepted their assignment.

00:45:34.711 --> 00:45:36.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time went by.

00:45:36.754 --> 00:45:40.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several years later, she and her husband
received a new assignment

00:45:40.967 --> 00:45:43.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve in a different country.

00:45:43.094 --> 00:45:46.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what she says next:

00:45:46.097 --> 00:45:50.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If I thought leaving the United States
was the hardest thing I would ever do,

00:45:50.935 --> 00:45:55.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was completely fooled

00:45:55.064 --> 00:45:58.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the sadness I felt

00:45:58.151 --> 00:46:01.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“when I had to leave those new friends

00:46:01.029 --> 00:46:04.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
“was indescribable.

00:46:04.032 --> 00:46:07.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had never cried so much in my life.”

00:46:07.702 --> 00:46:10.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
She goes on to sum up
her experience this way.

00:46:10.747 --> 00:46:15.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
She said: “Jehovah taught me a lesson
in the most loving way.

00:46:15.752 --> 00:46:20.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Before Gilead, I was putting myself in a box

00:46:20.298 --> 00:46:24.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the what-I-can-do box.

00:46:24.302 --> 00:46:26.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But I wasn’t thinking that the Person

00:46:26.638 --> 00:46:30.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who knows best where I fit is Jehovah.

00:46:32.018 --> 00:46:34.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It’s as if he said,

00:46:34.062 --> 00:46:37.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘You’re not only going to adapt
to your new assignment,

00:46:37.273 --> 00:46:39.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘you’re going to love it so much

00:46:39.901 --> 00:46:42.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
“you will never want to leave.’

00:46:42.445 --> 00:46:44.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And that’s exactly what happened.

00:46:44.447 --> 00:46:48.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I came to truly love
the people in our assignment,

00:46:48.159 --> 00:46:50.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I can honestly say
that these past few years

00:46:50.995 --> 00:46:53.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have been some of my happiest.

00:46:53.122 --> 00:46:57.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now I’m not so afraid of change

00:46:57.126 --> 00:46:59.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
“as before.

00:47:00.254 --> 00:47:03.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I just trust in Jehovah

00:47:03.466 --> 00:47:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
—trusting in the process.”

00:47:06.135 --> 00:47:08.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazing, isn’t it?

00:47:08.471 --> 00:47:12.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
She too made the one-eighty.

00:47:12.183 --> 00:47:17.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had been fooled by Jehovah
just like Jeremiah.

00:47:17.146 --> 00:47:19.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she came out stronger

00:47:19.148 --> 00:47:22.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
and happier as a result.

00:47:22.026 --> 00:47:24.070 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did that happen?

00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:26.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because when we are fooled by Jehovah,

00:47:26.698 --> 00:47:29.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
three significant things happen.

00:47:29.325 --> 00:47:32.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, we draw closer to him.

00:47:32.370 --> 00:47:35.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second, we discover new joys

00:47:35.164 --> 00:47:37.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
that perhaps we never saw coming.

00:47:37.792 --> 00:47:41.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
And third, we open the door

00:47:41.129 --> 00:47:44.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
to receiving additional training
from Jehovah.

00:47:46.092 --> 00:47:49.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
In conclusion, just love the people.

00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then they will love you.

00:47:53.224 --> 00:47:56.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you will love your assignment.

00:47:57.812 --> 00:48:00.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be willing to walk

00:48:00.064 --> 00:48:03.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the doors wherever they take you.

00:48:04.235 --> 00:48:07.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the fearsome Warrior by your side,

00:48:07.321 --> 00:48:10.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
you cannot fail.

00:48:10.032 --> 00:48:14.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Always welcome the chance
to be fooled by Jehovah

00:48:14.871 --> 00:48:17.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it means
that you’re about to experience

00:48:17.373 --> 00:48:19.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
something pretty magnificent.

00:48:19.667 --> 00:48:21.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
And guess what?

00:48:21.127 --> 00:48:24.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has been tailor-made just for you.

00:48:38.227 --> 00:48:41.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we thank you too, Brother Chilton.

00:48:41.189 --> 00:48:46.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really appreciated
how you highlighted aspects about Jeremiah

00:48:46.152 --> 00:48:49.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a very real and human example for us.

00:48:49.989 --> 00:48:54.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now we have one of your instructors

00:48:54.452 --> 00:48:56.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
(another one), Brother Trent Lippold,

00:48:56.662 --> 00:49:01.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
who will talk on the interesting subject
entitled “Oil to Machinery.”

00:49:10.343 --> 00:49:14.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wrote about one quarter
of the Christian Greek Scriptures.

00:49:14.472 --> 00:49:16.599 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s almost as much as the apostle Paul.

00:49:18.267 --> 00:49:21.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
His name is only mentioned three times,

00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:25.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there are scarcely four words
that are used to describe him.

00:49:27.026 --> 00:49:31.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
The physician Luke
is one of the most familiar names

00:49:31.072 --> 00:49:34.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
of whom we know almost nothing about.

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:38.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a world of people
trying to look important,

00:49:38.996 --> 00:49:43.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke shows us what is important.

00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:46.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see what we can learn
from the physician Luke.

00:49:46.921 --> 00:49:50.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first mention of him,
the first description of Luke,

00:49:50.299 --> 00:49:53.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
is found in the book of Colossians
at chapter 4, verse 14.

00:49:53.594 --> 00:49:55.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the apostle Paul describes him there

00:49:55.596 --> 00:49:59.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
as “the beloved physician.”

00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:04.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Physician—we focused on that
when we considered the Gospel of Luke.

00:50:04.105 --> 00:50:08.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke uses medical terms as he writes,

00:50:09.694 --> 00:50:13.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Luke was more than just a physician
by occupation.

00:50:13.322 --> 00:50:15.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke was a physician in spirit.

00:50:15.199 --> 00:50:18.369 line:90% position:50% align:center
He had the heart of a physician,
the heart of a healer.

00:50:20.288 --> 00:50:21.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look at an example.

00:50:21.873 --> 00:50:25.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn with me, please,
to the book of Luke chapter 4

00:50:28.004 --> 00:50:31.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke 4:38, 39.

00:50:34.635 --> 00:50:38.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 38 says: “After leaving the synagogue,
he [that’s Jesus]

00:50:38.598 --> 00:50:40.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
“entered into Simon’s home.

00:50:40.683 --> 00:50:44.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Simon’s mother-in-law
was suffering with a high fever,

00:50:44.812 --> 00:50:47.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they asked him to help her.

00:50:47.481 --> 00:50:51.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So he stood over her
and rebuked the fever, and it left her.

00:50:51.027 --> 00:50:54.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instantly she got up
and began ministering to them.”

00:50:54.655 --> 00:50:57.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we have a mention in verse 38

00:50:57.033 --> 00:51:00.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Luke noted that she had “a high fever.”

00:51:00.077 --> 00:51:02.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look a little closer.

00:51:02.288 --> 00:51:04.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
What made an impression on Luke?

00:51:04.582 --> 00:51:07.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it just the high fever?

00:51:07.001 --> 00:51:09.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
The verse says: “Simon’s mother-in-law 

00:51:09.629 --> 00:51:13.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
was<i> suffering </i> with a high fever.”

00:51:13.758 --> 00:51:15.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew didn’t say that.

00:51:15.468 --> 00:51:17.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mark didn’t say that.

00:51:17.303 --> 00:51:19.764 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke noticed.

00:51:19.764 --> 00:51:24.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at another example at Luke 22:44,

00:51:27.104 --> 00:51:29.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 22:44.

00:51:29.148 --> 00:51:31.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
The account is in the garden of Gethsemane,

00:51:31.484 --> 00:51:33.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jesus was there praying.

00:51:33.986 --> 00:51:36.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice what Luke wrote,

00:51:36.155 --> 00:51:39.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
what caught his attention in verse 44:

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But he was in such agony
that he kept praying more earnestly;

00:51:41.953 --> 00:51:45.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and his sweat became as drops of blood

00:51:45.122 --> 00:51:47.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
falling to the ground.”

00:51:47.124 --> 00:51:50.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
The physician Luke noticed the condition

00:51:50.836 --> 00:51:53.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that “his sweat became as drops of blood.”

00:51:53.506 --> 00:51:55.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look again.

00:51:55.967 --> 00:52:00.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says that “he was in such <i>agony</i> 

00:52:00.304 --> 00:52:02.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
that . . . his sweat
became as drops of blood.”

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:07.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ condition, his agony,
is what caught Luke’s attention,

00:52:07.895 --> 00:52:12.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
not just the physical condition,
the medical condition.

00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Luke records Jesus

00:52:14.485 --> 00:52:18.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
as someone who saw men as they were.

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw men without distinction.

00:52:20.324 --> 00:52:23.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw men, and he loved them all.

00:52:23.035 --> 00:52:26.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke shows Jesus as someone
whose heart goes out to everyone

00:52:26.497 --> 00:52:29.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
for whom life is an unequal struggle.

00:52:29.583 --> 00:52:32.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
That made an impression on Luke.

00:52:32.545 --> 00:52:36.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of Luke’s Gospel—the things
that are uniquely recorded in Luke.

00:52:36.924 --> 00:52:41.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s only Luke who tells us
about the aged Elizabeth and Zechariah.

00:52:41.345 --> 00:52:44.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke tells us about Anna and Simeon.

00:52:44.598 --> 00:52:49.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke tells us about the widow of Nain,
the woman bent over for 18 years,

00:52:49.228 --> 00:52:54.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
the woman who anointed
the feet of Jesus with her tears,

00:52:54.025 --> 00:52:57.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Samaritan leper,
the rich tax collector Zacchaeus,

00:52:57.903 --> 00:53:01.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
the condemned thief who hung beside Jesus.

00:53:01.991 --> 00:53:06.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus’ attitude toward these people
appealed to Luke.

00:53:07.955 --> 00:53:11.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Luke shared Jesus’ view.

00:53:11.167 --> 00:53:14.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
For Luke, too, men of all sorts

00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:18.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in the embrace of God’s mercy.

00:53:18.132 --> 00:53:20.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this attitude of heart and mind

00:53:20.509 --> 00:53:23.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
made Luke beloved,

00:53:23.637 --> 00:53:26.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the beloved physician.”

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:30.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
And no doubt that spirit reduced the friction

00:53:30.061 --> 00:53:34.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
among those who were traveling with Paul
and preaching in the first century.

00:53:36.025 --> 00:53:40.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the second description of Luke
is found at Philemon 24.

00:53:41.489 --> 00:53:45.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there Luke is described
as a ‘fellow worker.’

00:53:47.119 --> 00:53:51.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
Open with me to the book of Acts,
Acts chapter 16.

00:53:51.707 --> 00:53:53.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll read beginning in verse 8

00:53:56.253 --> 00:53:59.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Acts 16:8.

00:53:59.131 --> 00:54:01.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “So they

00:54:01.342 --> 00:54:04.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[this is Paul, Timothy, Silas,
and his traveling companions]

00:54:04.678 --> 00:54:07.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
passed by Mysia and came down to Troas.”

00:54:07.598 --> 00:54:09.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s where Paul had the vision,

00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he was told
to “step over into Macedonia.”

00:54:12.478 --> 00:54:14.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at verse 10:

00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As soon as he [that’s Paul]
had seen the vision, 

00:54:17.191 --> 00:54:20.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
we tried to go into Macedonia.”

00:54:20.653 --> 00:54:25.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 11 says:
“So we put out to sea from Troas.”

00:54:25.449 --> 00:54:28.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s our introduction to Luke.

00:54:28.786 --> 00:54:30.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke never praises himself.

00:54:30.454 --> 00:54:32.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
He never writes about himself.

00:54:32.498 --> 00:54:37.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
We only trace Luke’s travels with Paul
by the change of a pronoun

00:54:37.253 --> 00:54:39.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
from “they” to “we.”

00:54:40.714 --> 00:54:42.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, this was on the second missionary tour,

00:54:42.925 --> 00:54:46.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
on which Luke joined Paul here at Troas.

00:54:46.053 --> 00:54:48.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he traveled on to Philippi with him.

00:54:50.057 --> 00:54:54.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
And look at what made Luke a fellow worker;
look at what we can learn from him.

00:54:54.145 --> 00:54:56.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is in verse 13,
when they arrived in Philippi.

00:54:58.023 --> 00:55:00.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 13 says: “On the Sabbath day

00:55:00.484 --> 00:55:02.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we went outside the gate beside a river,

00:55:02.862 --> 00:55:06.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“where we thought
there was a place of prayer,

00:55:06.073 --> 00:55:10.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we sat down and began speaking
to the women who had assembled.”

00:55:11.871 --> 00:55:16.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this now is the account of Lydia,
where Lydia embraces the truth,

00:55:16.041 --> 00:55:18.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Kingdom message.

00:55:18.085 --> 00:55:22.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you notice
it said “<i>we </i> went outside”?

00:55:22.214 --> 00:55:23.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke went with them.

00:55:23.883 --> 00:55:27.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said
“<i>we </i> thought there was a place of prayer.”

00:55:27.595 --> 00:55:30.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke was involved in the thinking process,
in the discussion,

00:55:30.681 --> 00:55:35.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the decision about where to go,
and Luke was involved in speaking to them.

00:55:36.187 --> 00:55:38.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke was a participant

00:55:38.272 --> 00:55:42.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not simply along for the ride,
not a fellow traveler, not just a chronicler.

00:55:42.693 --> 00:55:46.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke was a fellow worker.

00:55:46.530 --> 00:55:49.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there’s a beautiful lesson
for us and for you:

00:55:49.992 --> 00:55:52.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be a participant.

00:55:52.161 --> 00:55:53.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be an example.

00:55:53.621 --> 00:55:57.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get involved in the assignments
you are given.

00:55:58.751 --> 00:56:02.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it may be that Luke stayed
in Philippi from 50 to 56 C.E.

00:56:02.880 --> 00:56:06.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know,
but perhaps he did because he joined Paul

00:56:06.926 --> 00:56:11.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
again in 56 C.E.
on the third missionary tour from Philippi.

00:56:11.138 --> 00:56:12.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he do in Philippi?

00:56:12.932 --> 00:56:14.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t really know.

00:56:14.558 --> 00:56:17.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
Typically, it’s quiet about Luke,

00:56:17.478 --> 00:56:22.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we can assume he must have just been
a busy fellow worker there in Philippi

00:56:22.274 --> 00:56:26.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
—no sparks flying, just a busy fellow worker.

00:56:27.488 --> 00:56:30.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
He joined Paul again in 56 C.E.

00:56:30.157 --> 00:56:33.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
From Philippi,
he traveled with him to Jerusalem.

00:56:33.077 --> 00:56:35.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was in Jerusalem
for the trouble in the temple.

00:56:35.663 --> 00:56:39.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
He traveled with him to Caesarea,
where Paul was a prisoner,

00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:43.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
and continued on with Paul to Rome,
where Paul was a prisoner.

00:56:43.879 --> 00:56:48.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke, however, was not a prisoner,
but he accompanied Paul.

00:56:50.010 --> 00:56:52.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
How comforting that must have been for Paul

00:56:52.054 --> 00:56:55.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have his fellow worker with him!

00:56:55.808 --> 00:56:58.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you think about Paul
and his countless beatings,

00:56:58.769 --> 00:57:01.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
the scourging, the stoning, the shipwrecks,

00:57:01.605 --> 00:57:04.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
they must have
all taken a toll on him physically,

00:57:04.483 --> 00:57:07.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to mention the “thorn in the flesh”
he had to deal with.

00:57:07.486 --> 00:57:11.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of his traveling companions was Timothy,
with “frequent cases of sickness.”

00:57:11.782 --> 00:57:14.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
How relieved they must have been to have Luke

00:57:14.952 --> 00:57:17.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
the physician with them!

00:57:17.871 --> 00:57:19.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Luke is an example

00:57:19.623 --> 00:57:24.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
of long-continued devotion
to the Kingdom work

00:57:24.211 --> 00:57:29.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
and of unshaken constancy
to Paul and his associates.

00:57:29.133 --> 00:57:32.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, in fact,
this warm feeling of a fellow worker

00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
(Luke being a fellow worker)
is perhaps best summed up

00:57:35.848 --> 00:57:38.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the final mention of Luke,

00:57:38.142 --> 00:57:40.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s at 2 Timothy 4:11.

00:57:40.769 --> 00:57:43.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Among Paul’s final words, he says:

00:57:43.981 --> 00:57:47.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Luke alone is with me.”

00:57:47.234 --> 00:57:49.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of all his fellow workers, perhaps

00:57:49.778 --> 00:57:53.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
there were none dearer
or few dearer than Luke.

00:57:54.992 --> 00:57:59.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, Luke’s writing contained
the least possible mention of himself.

00:57:59.705 --> 00:58:02.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, we do not doubt
that he was eminently useful

00:58:02.499 --> 00:58:05.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Paul and to all those around him.

00:58:05.044 --> 00:58:07.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be sure, he enabled Paul to do much more

00:58:07.755 --> 00:58:10.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
than would have otherwise
been possible for him.

00:58:10.716 --> 00:58:14.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
He kept himself out of sight.

00:58:14.011 --> 00:58:17.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his Gospel, it is Christ who shines.

00:58:17.306 --> 00:58:21.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the book of Acts,
it’s the Kingdom preaching work that shines.

00:58:21.769 --> 00:58:24.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I wonder if the silence in the Scriptures

00:58:24.396 --> 00:58:28.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
in direct reference to Luke is intentional.

00:58:28.108 --> 00:58:30.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
It certainly teaches us something.

00:58:30.903 --> 00:58:33.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Few other so prominent servants

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:36.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
have so little mention.

00:58:36.075 --> 00:58:40.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
And therein lies the lesson
from the life of Luke:

00:58:40.496 --> 00:58:43.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be an example of a servant

00:58:43.665 --> 00:58:46.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
who with lowliness of mind

00:58:46.043 --> 00:58:50.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
finds your service in serving others.

00:58:50.923 --> 00:58:53.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was already one Paul.

00:58:53.634 --> 00:58:55.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke stays in the background.

00:58:55.844 --> 00:59:00.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
With the spirit of a true servant,
he did not need the light of publicity

00:59:00.057 --> 00:59:02.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stimulate him.

00:59:02.101 --> 00:59:05.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was not the machine; he was the oil.

00:59:07.231 --> 00:59:08.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally,

00:59:08.899 --> 00:59:13.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
if the only three words
used to describe you

00:59:13.237 --> 00:59:16.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
are “beloved fellow worker,”

00:59:16.281 --> 00:59:19.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
your training here at Gilead
will have been a success.

00:59:19.451 --> 00:59:23.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you, like Luke, will be oil to machinery.

00:59:33.424 --> 00:59:36.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we thank you very,
very much, Brother Lippold.

00:59:36.635 --> 00:59:41.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciated how you highlighted
the example of Luke

00:59:41.056 --> 00:59:44.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how you applied
that interesting theme

00:59:44.268 --> 00:59:46.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
to his example
—“Oil to Machinery.”

00:59:47.438 --> 00:59:51.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such thought-provoking and encouraging talks!

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:53.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you enjoyed Part 1.

00:59:53.861 --> 00:59:56.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be on the lookout for Parts 2 and 3,

00:59:56.238 --> 01:00:00.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will be available
on jw.org later this month.

01:00:00.826 --> 01:00:02.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our program would not be complete

01:00:02.953 --> 01:00:06.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
without visiting our brothers and sisters
in another beautiful country.

01:00:07.374 --> 01:00:10.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month, we visit Haiti,

01:00:10.002 --> 01:00:12.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means “Land of Mountains.”

01:00:13.422 --> 01:00:17.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haiti is a tropical island
located in the Caribbean Sea

01:00:17.134 --> 01:00:20.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has beautiful white sand beaches,

01:00:20.387 --> 01:00:22.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
rivers, waterfalls

01:00:22.264 --> 01:00:25.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, yes, majestic mountains.

01:00:27.352 --> 01:00:30.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haiti’s culture and language
are unique in character.

01:00:31.356 --> 01:00:35.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many speak French, but the mother tongue
of most people is Haitian Creole

01:00:35.777 --> 01:00:38.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
—an expressive language
that combines French words

01:00:38.697 --> 01:00:41.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
with West African grammar.

01:00:41.783 --> 01:00:45.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
The population reflects
a colorful blend of African

01:00:45.329 --> 01:00:47.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
and European traits and cultures.

01:00:48.123 --> 01:00:50.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haitians love to dance,

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:53.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
sing, laugh and, of course, 

01:00:54.421 --> 01:00:56.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
they enjoy tasty foods such as <i>tonmtonm.</i>

01:00:57.633 --> 01:01:01.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Tonmtonm</i>  is breadfruit mashed very fine

01:01:01.011 --> 01:01:03.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and often eaten with an okra sauce.

01:01:05.182 --> 01:01:07.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haiti has a rich theocratic history.

01:01:09.186 --> 01:01:12.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Records don’t show exactly
when the good news first reached Haiti.

01:01:12.189 --> 01:01:15.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as early as February 1887,

01:01:15.192 --> 01:01:19.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Zion’s Watch Tower </i> listed Haiti
among the places from where people

01:01:19.112 --> 01:01:21.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
sent in letters of interest
about the good news.

01:01:22.699 --> 01:01:27.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first Watch Tower missionaries
arrived in Haiti in 1945.

01:01:27.704 --> 01:01:30.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of them was Roland Fredette,

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:32.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
who later became the first branch overseer.

01:01:33.168 --> 01:01:36.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hardworking and adventurous
missionary sisters,

01:01:36.004 --> 01:01:39.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Gloria Hill, Naomi Adams,

01:01:39.007 --> 01:01:41.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
Helen D’Amico, and Frances Bailey,

01:01:41.677 --> 01:01:46.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
made valuable contributions
to the preaching activity in the 1950’s.

01:01:47.766 --> 01:01:51.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Haitian people
show a keen interest in the Word of God.

01:01:51.687 --> 01:01:56.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today there are
over 17,000 active publishers.

01:01:56.066 --> 01:01:58.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
These zealous and happy publishers

01:01:58.402 --> 01:02:03.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
preach in Haitian Creole,
American Sign Language, or Spanish.

01:02:03.115 --> 01:02:07.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
And thanks to the availability
of braille publications in Haitian Creole,

01:02:07.286 --> 01:02:10.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
those who are blind
are also learning the truth.

01:02:11.164 --> 01:02:14.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
This mountainous country
does not intimidate

01:02:14.334 --> 01:02:16.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
our loyal preachers of the good news.

01:02:16.461 --> 01:02:18.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
During the summer season,

01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:21.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers and sisters of all ages

01:02:21.258 --> 01:02:23.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
head into seldom-worked territories.

01:02:23.427 --> 01:02:26.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
And although Haiti
has faced economic challenges

01:02:26.888 --> 01:02:29.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suffered recent natural disasters,

01:02:29.766 --> 01:02:32.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers and sisters are positive

01:02:32.185 --> 01:02:34.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and focus their attention
on encouraging others

01:02:34.938 --> 01:02:37.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
to look to the future without fear.

01:02:39.067 --> 01:02:42.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
The city of Cap-Haïtien
is in the northern part of the island,

01:02:42.863 --> 01:02:47.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that is where you’ll find
the 113 publishers

01:02:47.242 --> 01:02:49.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Morne-Rouge Congregation.

01:02:49.494 --> 01:02:51.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would like to send you their greetings.

01:02:51.455 --> 01:02:53.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
They want you all to know

01:02:53.123 --> 01:02:56.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they love you very much.

01:02:56.168 --> 01:02:58.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we say in Haitian Creole:

01:02:58.712 --> 01:03:00.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>“Nou renmen nou tou,”</i>

01:03:00.464 --> 01:03:03.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means “We love you too.”

01:03:03.508 --> 01:03:07.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:03:07.346 --> 01:03:10.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
