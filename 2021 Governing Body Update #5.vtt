Greetings, brothers and sisters!

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.922 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
And welcome to this update

00:00:05.922 --> 00:00:08.458 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
on the global COVID-19 pandemic.

00:00:09.793 --> 00:00:11.828 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
On behalf of the Governing Body,

00:00:11.828 --> 00:00:14.531 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I want to tell you how encouraged we are

00:00:14.531 --> 00:00:18.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we hear about your endurance
through these difficult times.

00:00:18.902 --> 00:00:23.006 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In this update, I’d like
to speak to you parents

00:00:23.006 --> 00:00:25.075 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are raising children.

00:00:25.075 --> 00:00:27.777 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Although all of us have had to stay vigilant

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:29.813 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to protect ourselves and others,

00:00:29.813 --> 00:00:34.150 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you dear parents have carried
a particularly heavy load.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.088 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We can only imagine
the deep concern you’ve had

00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:41.891 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for your young children
and teens during the pandemic.

00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:45.228 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You worry about their physical safety

00:00:45.228 --> 00:00:47.230 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and their education.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You’ve also been concerned

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:52.469 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about the emotional impact
of physical distancing

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for many months from other children,

00:00:54.971 --> 00:00:58.274 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
grandparents, relatives,
and the congregation.

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:01.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And you’ve handled all of this

00:01:01.177 --> 00:01:03.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
while you work to provide for them

00:01:03.613 --> 00:01:07.217 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and keep up your family’s spiritual routine.

00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:10.920 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s a lot on your shoulders.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.389 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember that the prophecy

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:15.558 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in 2 Timothy chapter 3 tells us

00:01:15.558 --> 00:01:18.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
tells us that “in the last days”

00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:22.298 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
there would be
“critical times hard to deal with.”

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:26.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So the fact that Satan
is attacking the family unit

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.838 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
is no surprise to you parents.

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:31.641 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The surprise, however, may be

00:01:31.641 --> 00:01:34.811 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when the attack takes an unexpected form

00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:39.048 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or perhaps feels like many attacks
coming all at once.

00:01:39.048 --> 00:01:43.820 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s what the pandemic
has been for many of you.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.057 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now I’m going to say something
that you already know:

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:53.062 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah God and Jesus know how you feel.

00:01:53.062 --> 00:01:56.399 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Their own example leaves no doubt.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.304 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For instance, there were times
when Jehovah stepped in to protect his Son

00:02:01.304 --> 00:02:03.039 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when he was on the earth.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.276 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He first carefully entrusted Jesus

00:02:06.276 --> 00:02:08.344 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to the care of loving parents.

00:02:08.344 --> 00:02:11.614 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And when Herod
wanted to kill Jesus as a child,

00:02:11.614 --> 00:02:15.351 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah told Joseph and Mary
to “flee to Egypt”

00:02:15.351 --> 00:02:17.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
until the threat passed.

00:02:17.787 --> 00:02:21.324 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You could say it was
like an extended “lockdown”

00:02:21.324 --> 00:02:25.628 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that kept them away
from family and friends for some time.

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:29.098 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jesus experienced what it’s really like

00:02:29.098 --> 00:02:32.569 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to grow up as a child in a wicked world.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:36.206 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows the pressures and the dangers.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:38.241 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s no wonder

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:41.945 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that he took a special interest
in children during his ministry,

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:46.916 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and today he shares
your deep concern for your children.

00:02:48.418 --> 00:02:53.089 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you Christian parents
have other good examples to look to.

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:56.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s the example of our brothers and sisters

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who live in areas
that have been hit hard by the pandemic.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.700 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
More recently, this has been the case

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.970 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in India and Brazil.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.806 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We spoke to parents in those lands

00:03:09.806 --> 00:03:12.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and asked them how this
has affected their families

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.712 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and, in particular, their children.

00:03:18.982 --> 00:03:21.751 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
For a child, it’s been a whole year

00:03:21.751 --> 00:03:23.052 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
without being able to play

00:03:23.052 --> 00:03:24.354 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
with other children.

00:03:24.354 --> 00:03:27.457 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So they really miss being with their friends.

00:03:29.425 --> 00:03:31.828 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
A big challenge that parents have now

00:03:31.828 --> 00:03:33.830 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
is coming up with something fun

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:35.331 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
for them to do as a family

00:03:35.331 --> 00:03:36.833 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so that their child

00:03:36.833 --> 00:03:39.068 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
doesn’t feel upset or sad.

00:03:39.068 --> 00:03:41.070 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
They feel anxious to go out,

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.805 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
and it’s very challenging for us

00:03:42.805 --> 00:03:45.108 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
to keep them motivated to stay inside.

00:03:45.108 --> 00:03:48.511 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Our family was infected with COVID-19.

00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:50.647 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
It was physically and emotionally

00:03:50.647 --> 00:03:52.649 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
very stressful for all of us.

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.451 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
We’re not able to meet the friends

00:03:55.451 --> 00:03:57.186 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
at the Kingdom Hall anymore.

00:03:57.186 --> 00:03:59.188 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Neither can we see our relatives,

00:03:59.188 --> 00:04:02.058 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
so the kids are getting really bored.

00:04:03.593 --> 00:04:05.662 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
Right after the pandemic began,

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.564 line:10%,start position:50%,center align:center
we got the news that Denise had cancer.

00:04:08.564 --> 00:04:12.902 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, one of our main concerns
was our daughter.

00:04:12.902 --> 00:04:15.505 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
She really became anxious

00:04:15.505 --> 00:04:18.007 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
about what was going to happen to her mom.

00:04:21.711 --> 00:04:23.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps you can sympathize

00:04:23.713 --> 00:04:27.984 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with some of the challenges
parents in India and Brazil are facing.

00:04:27.984 --> 00:04:32.989 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We know it’s not been easy for parents
and families during the pandemic.

00:04:32.989 --> 00:04:37.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with every trial,
there are also opportunities

00:04:37.627 --> 00:04:41.998 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to remain loyal to Jehovah
and to grow spiritually.

00:04:41.998 --> 00:04:45.201 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For example, many parents have said

00:04:45.201 --> 00:04:47.503 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that they’ve had
more time with their children

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:51.975 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to do what it says at Deuteronomy 6:6, 7:

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.380 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“These words that I am commanding you today

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:01.684 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“must be on your heart,
and you must inculcate them

00:05:01.684 --> 00:05:04.554 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“in your sons and speak of them

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.056 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“when you sit in your house

00:05:07.056 --> 00:05:10.727 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“and when you walk on the road
and when you lie down

00:05:10.727 --> 00:05:12.762 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and when you get up.”

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.000 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Many of us have had more time

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.369 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to “sit in [our] house” during the pandemic,

00:05:19.369 --> 00:05:21.571 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whether we wanted to or not.

00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:24.640 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if this was your circumstance,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
hopefully you made good use
of the opportunity.

00:05:28.177 --> 00:05:31.314 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah gave the command to Israel

00:05:31.314 --> 00:05:35.018 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because he knew
that spiritually strong families

00:05:35.018 --> 00:05:37.787 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
would be happy families.

00:05:37.787 --> 00:05:40.156 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The same is true today.

00:05:40.156 --> 00:05:43.459 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When your family stays close to Jehovah,

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:48.398 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
you bring a blessing to yourself
and your congregation.

00:05:48.398 --> 00:05:53.169 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But you parents are not just caring
for your children’s spiritual needs.

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:56.105 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
You have spiritual needs too.

00:05:56.105 --> 00:05:59.575 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah’s command in Deuteronomy chapter 6

00:05:59.575 --> 00:06:04.580 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
said that Israelite parents
must have his words on their heart.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.517 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Notice the benefit you gain

00:06:07.517 --> 00:06:10.453 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when you make time for your spirituality.

00:06:10.453 --> 00:06:13.923 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Proverbs 20:7

00:06:13.923 --> 00:06:15.625 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
explains it this way:

00:06:16.426 --> 00:06:20.396 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“The righteous one
is walking in his integrity.

00:06:20.396 --> 00:06:24.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Happy are his children who come after him.”

00:06:26.769 --> 00:06:30.807 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
So righteous parents make for happy children.

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Parents, we know that you know these things.

00:06:35.445 --> 00:06:38.514 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We commend you for what you’re doing,

00:06:38.514 --> 00:06:41.284 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we’re praying for Jehovah’s holy spirit

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:45.588 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to give you strength,
even when you feel tired out.

00:06:45.588 --> 00:06:49.926 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our spiritual routine is even more important

00:06:49.926 --> 00:06:52.061 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
when we’re being tested.

00:06:52.061 --> 00:06:57.066 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The families we met from India and Brazil
were aware of this too.

00:06:57.066 --> 00:07:01.471 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
They shared what they’ve done
to adapt their spiritual routine

00:07:01.471 --> 00:07:03.873 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to meet the challenge of the pandemic.

00:07:06.175 --> 00:07:09.011 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We go out in the ministry
together as a family

00:07:09.011 --> 00:07:11.047 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
much more often than we did before.

00:07:11.047 --> 00:07:14.383 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Saturday is a special day for us.

00:07:14.383 --> 00:07:17.987 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We work together
as a family every Saturday morning,

00:07:17.987 --> 00:07:20.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and we make plans with other families

00:07:20.723 --> 00:07:23.359 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
who are also close friends of our children.

00:07:23.359 --> 00:07:26.429 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We always have a very enjoyable time.

00:07:27.797 --> 00:07:32.135 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When we conduct our Bible studies,
we have them sit in.

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:36.305 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The kids watch us closely,
and they learn from us.

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:40.076 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Family worship
has played a very important role.

00:07:40.076 --> 00:07:43.613 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s a relaxed atmosphere
in which we can have a good time. 

00:07:43.613 --> 00:07:47.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of the games we play
is you name a Bible character,

00:07:47.416 --> 00:07:51.220 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and the next person has to come up
with someone whose name starts

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.290 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
with the last letter
of the name that was just said.

00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:57.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This way, the kids are getting to know
new Bible characters

00:07:57.627 --> 00:07:59.729 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and they’re learning a lot about them.

00:07:59.729 --> 00:08:03.065 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
One of our projects is a model of Noah’s ark.

00:08:03.065 --> 00:08:06.702 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our kids have learned
almost all of the original songs.

00:08:06.702 --> 00:08:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We’ve played a few games
using some of the activities on jw.org.

00:08:12.542 --> 00:08:14.977 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We made some models of Bible accounts.

00:08:14.977 --> 00:08:18.548 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We enacted Bible scenes
and role plays of Bible characters.

00:08:19.348 --> 00:08:21.651 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There was one time that we wrapped our son

00:08:21.651 --> 00:08:25.087 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
in toilet paper and he was Lazarus.

00:08:25.087 --> 00:08:28.958 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And we have considered
timely articles appearing on jw.org.

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.627 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
We also did a project
on the metal image

00:08:31.627 --> 00:08:34.030 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
of Daniel’s prophecy.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:37.099 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Our son enjoys family worship

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:39.101 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
because we do things that he likes

00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:40.836 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—something that holds his attention.

00:08:40.836 --> 00:08:41.837 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it’s fun.

00:08:41.837 --> 00:08:44.907 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And seeing them happy, makes us happy.

00:08:56.986 --> 00:08:59.222 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
All this has drawn us closer to each other.

00:08:59.222 --> 00:09:01.824 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And it also helped us
to draw closer to Jehovah.

00:09:07.563 --> 00:09:09.232 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
With Jehovah’s help,
we can get through anything. 

00:09:15.071 --> 00:09:18.374 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps something
those families are doing can work

00:09:18.374 --> 00:09:21.177 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or is already working for your family.

00:09:21.177 --> 00:09:23.946 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let’s review some suggestions

00:09:23.946 --> 00:09:27.116 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
that can help
your family’s spiritual routine.

00:09:27.116 --> 00:09:30.219 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
For families with young children:

00:09:30.219 --> 00:09:33.489 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Dramatize Bible scenes.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:37.093 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Your children may like
to dress up and make props

00:09:37.093 --> 00:09:41.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to bring the account to life
and remember the lessons.

00:09:41.731 --> 00:09:45.401 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And the good thing is
you don’t need expensive props

00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:47.536 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to make this interesting.

00:09:47.536 --> 00:09:50.473 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Play memory games<b>.</b>

00:09:50.473 --> 00:09:53.909 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
This could be based
on recent points from the meetings

00:09:53.909 --> 00:09:58.848 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
or something they’ve been reading
or watching on JW Broadcasting®.

00:09:58.848 --> 00:10:02.885 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try a jw.org activity

00:10:02.885 --> 00:10:04.954 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
for children together.

00:10:04.954 --> 00:10:09.425 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These are under
the “Bible Teachings” section of the website.

00:10:09.425 --> 00:10:12.028 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But if you have young children,

00:10:12.028 --> 00:10:14.764 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
I suspect you’ve been there before.

00:10:14.764 --> 00:10:19.535 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And here are some ideas
for families with teens:

00:10:19.535 --> 00:10:23.439 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Practice “What if . . . ?” situations.

00:10:23.439 --> 00:10:28.210 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Perhaps let your teen
choose a situation they’re concerned about.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:30.546 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk about goals<b>.</b>

00:10:30.546 --> 00:10:33.816 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
These can be short-term or long-term goals.

00:10:33.816 --> 00:10:37.253 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Let your teen tell why they chose the goal,

00:10:37.253 --> 00:10:40.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and what steps they feel
will help them reach it.

00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:44.427 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Read or watch a life story.

00:10:44.427 --> 00:10:48.731 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Again, let your teen choose a life story
of someone they’re interested in.

00:10:50.366 --> 00:10:54.770 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Remember, though,
that you don’t have to use every suggestion.

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:58.307 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Talk to your family, pray about it,

00:10:58.307 --> 00:11:02.445 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and try what you think
can make a difference for you.

00:11:02.445 --> 00:11:07.083 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And, of course, there’s nothing wrong
with watching JW Broadcasting

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.085 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
during a family worship.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:11.320 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
After all, that’s why we’re here.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.356 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But when you do,

00:11:13.356 --> 00:11:17.693 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
try to make it
more than just watching TV.

00:11:17.693 --> 00:11:21.330 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Take time to talk
about the program as a family,

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:25.301 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
either at the end of the broadcast
or after each segment.

00:11:26.936 --> 00:11:29.271 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Those are the suggestions.

00:11:29.271 --> 00:11:33.743 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Now here are the necessities for your family:

00:11:33.743 --> 00:11:36.379 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Pray together every day.

00:11:36.379 --> 00:11:41.384 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Try to include the feelings
and concerns of each family member.

00:11:41.384 --> 00:11:44.153 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Keep attending the meetings.

00:11:44.153 --> 00:11:47.990 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Help each other
to pay attention and participate.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:50.393 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Unlike being in the Kingdom Hall,

00:11:50.393 --> 00:11:54.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we may have many distractions
when we attend from home.

00:11:54.463 --> 00:11:57.366 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Share in the ministry together.

00:11:57.366 --> 00:12:01.971 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
As the pandemic continues to limit
how we do our preaching work,

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:05.775 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
talk about the different forms
of the ministry you can do

00:12:05.775 --> 00:12:09.044 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and how each family member feels about them.

00:12:09.044 --> 00:12:13.282 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Listen, and encourage everyone
to do their best.

00:12:14.950 --> 00:12:17.353 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Finally, we urge you parents

00:12:17.353 --> 00:12:20.656 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
to keep doing what you already know is vital:

00:12:20.656 --> 00:12:23.592 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Be alert for signs that your children

00:12:23.592 --> 00:12:27.363 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
are struggling
with negative emotions or stress.

00:12:27.363 --> 00:12:29.532 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
If you sense that they are,

00:12:29.532 --> 00:12:31.567 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
please read the article

00:12:31.567 --> 00:12:34.937 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Help Your Children Cope With Stress.”

00:12:34.937 --> 00:12:39.175 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
It’s in the <i>Awake!</i> of July 22, 1993,

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:42.378 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
pages 10 and 11.

00:12:42.378 --> 00:12:45.648 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
There you’ll find
wonderful suggestions on what you can do.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.685 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jehovah loves your family.

00:12:49.685 --> 00:12:52.154 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
He knows what you’re contending with,

00:12:52.154 --> 00:12:54.723 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and he wants to help you.

00:12:54.723 --> 00:12:58.394 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
The pandemic has been just one of many tests

00:12:58.394 --> 00:13:00.463 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
we’ll face in the last days.

00:13:00.463 --> 00:13:05.134 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
That’s not meant to discourage you;
it’s just reality.

00:13:05.134 --> 00:13:07.436 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
But with Jehovah’s help,

00:13:07.436 --> 00:13:11.707 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
your family can come out
of each test spiritually stronger

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:14.543 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
and more prepared to face what’s ahead.

00:13:14.543 --> 00:13:17.713 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Jeremiah chapter 17

00:13:17.713 --> 00:13:21.851 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
gives us this beautiful assurance in verse 7:

00:13:23.118 --> 00:13:27.289 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“Blessed is the man
who puts his trust in Jehovah,

00:13:27.289 --> 00:13:30.092 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
whose confidence is in Jehovah.”

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.896 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And verse 8 concludes saying:

00:13:34.697 --> 00:13:38.734 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
“And in the year of drought
he will not be anxious,

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:42.004 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
nor will he quit producing fruit.”

00:13:42.705 --> 00:13:46.275 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
Of course, we also want these tests to end.

00:13:46.275 --> 00:13:48.310 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
And they will!

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.114 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
When you look back
at the pandemic from the new world,

00:13:52.114 --> 00:13:54.416 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
it will seem “momentary and light,”

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:57.386 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
even if it doesn’t seem so now.

00:13:57.386 --> 00:14:02.258 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
In the meantime,
we continue to pray for all of you

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:07.263 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
—parents, children,
and all in our worldwide spiritual family.

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:11.967 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
May Jehovah bless your love and endurance.

00:14:11.967 --> 00:14:15.604 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:14:15.604 --> 00:14:18.340 line:90%,end position:50%,center align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
