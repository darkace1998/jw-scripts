Welcome to JW Broadcasting®.

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,

00:00:06.527 --> 00:00:10.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll see how much the Bible
can improve our lives,

00:00:10.406 --> 00:00:13.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
how it can save us from lasting harm,

00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:16.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
how it can help us
to get along with one another,

00:00:16.996 --> 00:00:19.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how it reassures us

00:00:19.206 --> 00:00:21.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
that even if we stumble,

00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will help us find our way back.

00:00:25.629 --> 00:00:27.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the life of John the Baptist,

00:00:27.798 --> 00:00:30.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll learn how to cope with fear,

00:00:31.302 --> 00:00:35.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
rejoice when others are blessed,
and maintain a positive attitude

00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:37.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when facing problems.

00:00:38.434 --> 00:00:41.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll see
from Brother Gordon Mackay’s experience

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah wants us
to “draw close to [him]”

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:49.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we’ve had
a serious spiritual setback.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our newest music video

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
extends a warm invitation to all

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
who find themselves estranged from Jehovah

00:00:57.661 --> 00:01:01.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his imperfect but faithful family.

00:01:01.248 --> 00:01:04.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminds us of what a wonderful blessing

00:01:04.418 --> 00:01:07.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
our spiritual home is.

00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:11.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the February 2024 edition

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:31.904 --> 00:01:35.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I was young,
one of my favorite desserts

00:01:35.658 --> 00:01:37.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
was my mother’s sweet potato pie.

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.829 line:10% position:50% align:center
It always tasted the same.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.750 line:10% position:50% align:center
To me, it was perfect every time.

00:01:45.584 --> 00:01:50.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d often ask her,
“Ma, what do you put in here

00:01:50.047 --> 00:01:52.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make it taste so good?”

00:01:52.758 --> 00:01:57.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’d always respond,
“I just use the same stuff every time.”

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words, number one,
she wasn’t going to tell me.

00:02:01.684 --> 00:02:05.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
And two,
she had a recipe that worked,

00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:07.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she never changed it.

00:02:08.482 --> 00:02:12.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the Bible is like a cookbook,

00:02:12.528 --> 00:02:14.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
full of recipes that work,

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can make
our life spiritually successful.

00:02:19.702 --> 00:02:24.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please note how Paul explains
the benefits of these recipes

00:02:24.665 --> 00:02:29.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17:

00:02:29.294 --> 00:02:32.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All Scripture is inspired of God

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and beneficial for teaching, for reproving,

00:02:35.718 --> 00:02:39.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for setting things straight,
for disciplining in righteousness,

00:02:40.305 --> 00:02:43.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that the man of God
may be fully competent,

00:02:43.934 --> 00:02:47.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
completely equipped for every good work.”

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:53.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes the recipe from God’s inspired Word

00:02:53.277 --> 00:02:56.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
comes in the form of a Bible example.

00:02:56.613 --> 00:02:58.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we study that example,

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:03.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
we extract qualities and attitudes
that we can imitate.

00:03:04.163 --> 00:03:08.625 line:90% position:50% align:center
At other times, 
there’s a list of qualities,

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:12.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as the various aspects
of the fruitage of God’s spirit

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:14.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in Galatians chapter 5

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:17.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the list of positive things to consider

00:03:17.217 --> 00:03:19.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Philippians 4:8, 9.

00:03:19.803 --> 00:03:24.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course,
there are numerous Bible principles

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:28.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we can use
to help us make good decisions.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meditating on and applying
these principles,

00:03:32.649 --> 00:03:35.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
qualities, and examples

00:03:35.778 --> 00:03:40.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be a recipe
that contributes to spiritual success.

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:43.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider one example.

00:03:43.327 --> 00:03:48.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s recorded at 1 Peter 3:8.

00:03:48.082 --> 00:03:50.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take note of the ingredients.

00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:54.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
“All of you have unity of mind,

00:03:54.963 --> 00:03:56.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fellow feeling,

00:03:56.965 --> 00:03:58.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“brotherly affection,

00:03:58.967 --> 00:04:00.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
“tender compassion,

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and humility.”

00:04:03.514 --> 00:04:08.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a recipe
of five beautiful qualities

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
that contribute to our spiritual success.

00:04:11.105 --> 00:04:12.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:15.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s discuss the ingredients.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter first mentions “unity of mind.”

00:04:19.988 --> 00:04:23.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
The footnote says “think in agreement.”

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:28.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we must think in agreement
with one another

00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:33.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially with Jehovah
and his organization.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
In what way?

00:04:34.545 --> 00:04:37.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
The latter part of Isaiah 30:15 says:

00:04:38.882 --> 00:04:43.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your strength will be in keeping calm
and showing trust.”

00:04:44.138 --> 00:04:47.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s exactly what the faithful slave
has done.

00:04:47.933 --> 00:04:51.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let us have unity of mind with them

00:04:51.895 --> 00:04:56.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have the same calmness
and confidence in Jehovah

00:04:56.859 --> 00:04:59.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we face personal challenges in our life.

00:05:01.446 --> 00:05:04.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Kings chapter 4,

00:05:04.783 --> 00:05:07.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
a Shunammite woman is mentioned

00:05:07.244 --> 00:05:09.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
who had confidence in the prophet Elisha.

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:14.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
She suffered a terrible tragedy in her life.

00:05:14.543 --> 00:05:17.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, she remained calm

00:05:17.004 --> 00:05:20.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showed trust
in “the man of the true God,” Elisha.

00:05:21.758 --> 00:05:25.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her example of trust
in Jehovah’s representative

00:05:25.304 --> 00:05:27.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
is worthy of imitation.

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:32.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, there is an expression
she uses in chapter 4

00:05:32.227 --> 00:05:34.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
that conveys the level of trust

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:36.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to have in Jehovah

00:05:36.607 --> 00:05:38.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his earthly representatives today.

00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:43.363 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let me tell you about this woman.

00:05:43.363 --> 00:05:46.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
She and her husband lived in Shunem.

00:05:46.116 --> 00:05:50.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha would regularly make
encouraging visits with them

00:05:50.495 --> 00:05:53.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was in that city.

00:05:53.207 --> 00:05:56.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha appreciated their hospitality

00:05:56.168 --> 00:05:58.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wanted to do something kind for them.

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:00.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would he do?

00:06:00.714 --> 00:06:04.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, verses 14-16

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:06.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 2 Kings chapter 4

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicate that she did not have a son

00:06:09.514 --> 00:06:11.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that her husband was old.

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:14.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elisha told her that the next year

00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:17.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
she would be embracing a son.

00:06:17.147 --> 00:06:20.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as Elisha foretold,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
she gave birth the next year.

00:06:24.238 --> 00:06:28.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
But unfortunately,
something drastic happened.

00:06:29.201 --> 00:06:33.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
The child grew up
and one day went out to work with his father.

00:06:33.997 --> 00:06:37.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 19,
the boy complained of a headache,

00:06:37.751 --> 00:06:41.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
which led to his eventual death.

00:06:42.089 --> 00:06:43.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh my!

00:06:43.548 --> 00:06:45.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would this woman do?

00:06:45.634 --> 00:06:48.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was her only son.

00:06:48.428 --> 00:06:51.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, she had confidence

00:06:51.223 --> 00:06:53.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
in “the man of the true God,” Elisha,

00:06:53.642 --> 00:06:57.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she says to her husband in verse 22:

00:06:57.938 --> 00:07:00.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Send me, please, one of the attendants

00:07:00.774 --> 00:07:02.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and one of the donkeys,

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:04.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and let me go quickly

00:07:04.027 --> 00:07:06.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the man of the true God and return.”

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:09.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 23, her husband asks:

00:07:09.866 --> 00:07:13.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why are you going to see him today?”

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:17.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
“What can he do for us?”

00:07:17.833 --> 00:07:20.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, note her response

00:07:20.627 --> 00:07:23.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the end of verse 23 and verse 24:

00:07:24.423 --> 00:07:27.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, she said:

00:07:27.217 --> 00:07:31.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Everything is all right.’

00:07:31.138 --> 00:07:33.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So she saddled the donkey

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and said to her attendant: ‘Go quickly.

00:07:35.851 --> 00:07:39.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do not slow down for me unless I tell you to.’”

00:07:39.688 --> 00:07:43.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
So this calm, trusting woman

00:07:43.025 --> 00:07:48.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
rides about 19 miles, or 30 kilometers,

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:50.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finds Elisha.

00:07:50.073 --> 00:07:52.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he ends up resurrecting her son.

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:58.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
Her trusting relationship
and association with Elisha

00:07:58.165 --> 00:08:01.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
had given her confidence.

00:08:01.043 --> 00:08:03.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although she experienced a tragedy,

00:08:03.295 --> 00:08:07.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
she knew that everything was all right.

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:11.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elisha’s faith and confidence in Jehovah

00:08:11.178 --> 00:08:13.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped this devoted woman also

00:08:13.889 --> 00:08:16.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remain calm and confident

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:18.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
when facing adversity.

00:08:19.936 --> 00:08:22.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Isaiah 41:10,

00:08:22.481 --> 00:08:24.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
note Jehovah’s assurance:

00:08:25.484 --> 00:08:29.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be afraid, for I am with you.

00:08:29.446 --> 00:08:32.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not be anxious, for I am your God.

00:08:33.283 --> 00:08:37.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will fortify you, yes, I will help you,

00:08:37.996 --> 00:08:40.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I will really hold on to you

00:08:40.874 --> 00:08:43.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
with my right hand of righteousness.”

00:08:43.877 --> 00:08:47.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s work hard to have unity of mind

00:08:47.506 --> 00:08:49.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s organization

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:54.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
by keeping calm
and showing trust in Jehovah

00:08:54.012 --> 00:08:57.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by being confident
that with Jehovah’s help

00:08:57.307 --> 00:09:01.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
everything will be all right.

00:09:01.103 --> 00:09:03.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a beautiful ingredient

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this recipe for spiritual success.

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 1 Peter 3:8,

00:09:10.362 --> 00:09:14.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter next mentions three more ingredients.

00:09:14.199 --> 00:09:17.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are aspects of love:

00:09:17.202 --> 00:09:18.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“fellow feeling,

00:09:18.829 --> 00:09:20.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“brotherly affection,

00:09:20.497 --> 00:09:23.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
tender compassion.”

00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:27.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
These aspects of love convey empathy.

00:09:28.171 --> 00:09:31.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Empathy is “the ability to understand

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:34.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
and share the feelings of another.”

00:09:35.554 --> 00:09:38.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
As this system draws to a close,

00:09:38.056 --> 00:09:42.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan will try to divide us from within.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:46.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
So love for our brothers and sisters

00:09:46.731 --> 00:09:49.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
and empathizing with one another

00:09:49.401 --> 00:09:51.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
will become ever more important.

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:54.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
It will serve to unify us.

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:57.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of the empathy

00:09:57.617 --> 00:10:00.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s organization.

00:10:00.328 --> 00:10:03.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all have personal challenges,

00:10:03.206 --> 00:10:05.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
but so do our overseers,

00:10:05.417 --> 00:10:09.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
those taking the lead
in the organization here on earth.

00:10:09.504 --> 00:10:12.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of them have lost loved ones in death

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like us.

00:10:14.342 --> 00:10:17.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some have experienced sickness and anxiety

00:10:17.637 --> 00:10:19.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like us.

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:22.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love them for their empathy.

00:10:23.727 --> 00:10:27.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the heavenly part
of Jehovah’s organization.

00:10:27.689 --> 00:10:31.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since Satan’s rebellion,
Jehovah has been disappointed,

00:10:31.943 --> 00:10:36.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
saddened, angered at the actions
of imperfect men.

00:10:36.865 --> 00:10:39.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are real feelings

00:10:39.242 --> 00:10:42.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our empathetic heavenly Father
possesses.

00:10:43.288 --> 00:10:47.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus experienced
similar disappointment and sadness

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:50.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he also saw the rebellion

00:10:50.295 --> 00:10:54.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Satan, Adam, and Eve
and what’s resulted.

00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:00.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
Jesus’ understanding became deeper

00:11:00.013 --> 00:11:05.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he became human
and began to experience human emotions.

00:11:05.018 --> 00:11:08.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
The April 15, 2002, <i>Watchtower</i>  article

00:11:08.688 --> 00:11:13.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
entitled
“Empathy—Key to Kindness and Compassion”

00:11:13.693 --> 00:11:17.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned three ways
we can sharpen our sensitivity

00:11:17.822 --> 00:11:20.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the needs and feelings of others.

00:11:21.243 --> 00:11:25.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
The first: ‘Listen.

00:11:25.121 --> 00:11:27.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘By listening carefully,

00:11:27.165 --> 00:11:30.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘we learn what problems others face.

00:11:30.544 --> 00:11:32.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘And the better we listen,

00:11:32.546 --> 00:11:35.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘the more likely
they will open up their hearts

00:11:35.924 --> 00:11:38.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reveal their feelings.’

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:42.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second: ‘Observe.

00:11:42.097 --> 00:11:44.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Not everyone will openly tell us

00:11:44.224 --> 00:11:46.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘how they feel

00:11:46.268 --> 00:11:49.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘or what they are going through.

00:11:49.187 --> 00:11:51.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘A keen observer will notice

00:11:51.982 --> 00:11:54.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘when a fellow Christian needs encouragement

00:11:54.276 --> 00:11:56.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
or some practical assistance.’

00:11:56.778 --> 00:12:01.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
Third: “Use Your Imagination.

00:12:01.449 --> 00:12:04.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The most powerful way to stimulate empathy

00:12:04.995 --> 00:12:07.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is to ask yourself:

00:12:07.038 --> 00:12:09.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘If I were in this situation,

00:12:09.207 --> 00:12:11.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘how would I feel?

00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:13.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘How would I respond?

00:12:13.253 --> 00:12:15.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
What would I need?’”

00:12:16.548 --> 00:12:21.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
So fellow feeling, brotherly affection,
and tender compassion

00:12:21.469 --> 00:12:24.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
are aspects of loving empathy

00:12:24.514 --> 00:12:28.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
and are valuable ingredients
to our spiritual success

00:12:28.476 --> 00:12:30.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will benefit others.

00:12:32.939 --> 00:12:37.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
The final quality highlighted at 1 Peter 3:8

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.738 line:90% position:50% align:center
is humility.

00:12:39.738 --> 00:12:42.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why do we need humility?

00:12:42.574 --> 00:12:45.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because we need to trust.

00:12:45.243 --> 00:12:48.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trust in Jehovah and his organization

00:12:48.622 --> 00:12:51.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires humility

00:12:51.166 --> 00:12:55.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
—not relying on our own strength or wisdom.

00:12:55.337 --> 00:12:58.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility helps us to cope

00:12:58.006 --> 00:13:01.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whatever God permits.

00:13:01.009 --> 00:13:03.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we face anxiety
and pressure in our life,

00:13:03.928 --> 00:13:07.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may yearn for immediate relief.

00:13:07.974 --> 00:13:11.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
But humility helps us to trust

00:13:11.436 --> 00:13:15.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah knows precisely when

00:13:15.607 --> 00:13:18.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how to act in our behalf.

00:13:18.652 --> 00:13:20.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wait

00:13:20.987 --> 00:13:22.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
patiently.

00:13:22.989 --> 00:13:26.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah always responds to our needs

00:13:26.368 --> 00:13:30.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
in his time and in his way.

00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:34.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility helps us to admit
that Jehovah’s thoughts

00:13:34.292 --> 00:13:38.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
are vastly superior to our own.

00:13:38.505 --> 00:13:41.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
We recognize our limited discernment

00:13:41.883 --> 00:13:43.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
in comparison

00:13:43.927 --> 00:13:48.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s all-encompassing perception.

00:13:48.348 --> 00:13:51.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees things we do not discern,

00:13:51.518 --> 00:13:56.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thus we trust
that his way of doing things

00:13:56.189 --> 00:13:58.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
is always best.

00:13:58.858 --> 00:14:01.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as the great tribulation approaches,

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
humbly trust in Jehovah

00:14:05.824 --> 00:14:07.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his organization.

00:14:08.743 --> 00:14:11.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter chapter 5,

00:14:11.663 --> 00:14:14.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
and verse 6 says this:

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:17.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Humble yourselves, therefore,

00:14:17.502 --> 00:14:20.088 line:90% position:50% align:center
“under the mighty hand of God,

00:14:20.088 --> 00:14:24.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he may exalt you in due time.”

00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:30.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers, there is no better place to be

00:14:30.014 --> 00:14:35.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
than “under the mighty hand of God.”

00:14:35.019 --> 00:14:38.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility is a beautiful ingredient

00:14:38.648 --> 00:14:42.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helps us to remain there.

00:14:45.238 --> 00:14:47.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what were the ingredients

00:14:47.532 --> 00:14:50.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our recipe for spiritual success?

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
First was unity of mind.

00:14:55.165 --> 00:14:59.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be at unity with Jehovah’s organization today

00:14:59.169 --> 00:15:03.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
by keeping calm and showing trust.

00:15:03.047 --> 00:15:06.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the words of the Shunammite woman
in 2 Kings chapter 4,

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:10.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
when facing adversity,
always know that with Jehovah

00:15:10.972 --> 00:15:14.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
“everything is all right.”

00:15:14.559 --> 00:15:17.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second was fellow feeling,

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
brotherly affection, and tender compassion

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:24.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
—all aspects of loving empathy.

00:15:24.736 --> 00:15:29.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember, we’re all in this together.

00:15:29.073 --> 00:15:33.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
The celestial chariot
is empathetic toward what we face

00:15:33.244 --> 00:15:37.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will respond
to our personal and organizational needs.

00:15:39.250 --> 00:15:42.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, try always

00:15:42.504 --> 00:15:44.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
to include humility

00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:47.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your recipe for success.

00:15:47.717 --> 00:15:51.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
Humility requires trust,

00:15:51.387 --> 00:15:55.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
so trust that Jehovah’s way of doing things

00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:57.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
is always best.

00:15:58.895 --> 00:16:02.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 119:105 says

00:16:02.524 --> 00:16:06.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the Bible “is a lamp to my foot,

00:16:06.361 --> 00:16:09.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a light for my path.”

00:16:10.406 --> 00:16:12.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
So take time to consider

00:16:12.867 --> 00:16:16.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
a portion of God’s Word each day.

00:16:16.496 --> 00:16:21.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
As situations, decisions,
and challenges arise,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
search for the right recipe

00:16:24.087 --> 00:16:28.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Bible example, Christian quality, principle.

00:16:29.092 --> 00:16:32.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you do,
Jehovah will light up

00:16:32.512 --> 00:16:34.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
the path ahead of you

00:16:34.514 --> 00:16:39.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help you to be spiritually successful.

00:16:41.771 --> 00:16:43.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve seen that the Bible’s “recipes”

00:16:43.898 --> 00:16:46.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
can make our life spiritually successful

00:16:46.109 --> 00:16:49.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help us improve our relationships.

00:16:49.153 --> 00:16:51.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following interview,

00:16:51.155 --> 00:16:55.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
note how applying
a recipe of Bible principles

00:16:55.368 --> 00:17:00.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also undo
the damage caused by poor decisions.

00:17:01.207 --> 00:17:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
We graduated in June, got married in July,

00:17:04.627 --> 00:17:06.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
and had a child in November.

00:17:08.798 --> 00:17:10.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it was a happy time.

00:17:12.802 --> 00:17:16.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
At one point, two Witnesses

00:17:16.097 --> 00:17:18.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
knocked on my door,

00:17:18.141 --> 00:17:22.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they showed me Psalm 83:18,

00:17:22.353 --> 00:17:24.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
that God’s name is Jehovah.

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:29.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
They offered a Bible study,

00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:34.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
but my study only lasted two to three weeks.

00:17:36.117 --> 00:17:37.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got a car.

00:17:37.952 --> 00:17:40.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
We started going to parties

00:17:40.997 --> 00:17:42.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
—starting to smoke,

00:17:42.498 --> 00:17:45.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
having drugs, getting drunk.

00:17:45.209 --> 00:17:47.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
We did all these things

00:17:47.003 --> 00:17:50.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really tore our marriage apart.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
We thought moving away from our town

00:17:53.718 --> 00:17:56.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our old associates would help.

00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:01.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was worse then ever.

00:18:04.896 --> 00:18:09.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Baseball was more important to me
than even my wife.

00:18:11.402 --> 00:18:14.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a real problem with headship.

00:18:15.448 --> 00:18:18.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were times when I felt like

00:18:18.868 --> 00:18:20.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was smarter than him,

00:18:20.828 --> 00:18:22.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I felt like I could make

00:18:22.956 --> 00:18:25.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
a better decision than he could make.

00:18:28.544 --> 00:18:33.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
In time, Zanna left me for another person,

00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:37.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s what really hurt me.

00:18:40.264 --> 00:18:43.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Zanna had a hard time
with drugs and so forth.

00:18:43.685 --> 00:18:46.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when I got custody of the kids.

00:18:51.651 --> 00:18:56.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided at that moment that I was done,

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:03.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:06.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
popped into my head.

00:19:07.583 --> 00:19:10.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember

00:19:10.753 --> 00:19:13.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting down

00:19:13.673 --> 00:19:17.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
and telling Jehovah,

00:19:17.552 --> 00:19:21.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Just show me; show me what to do.”

00:19:21.848 --> 00:19:25.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went through the telephone book

00:19:25.518 --> 00:19:28.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and looked up Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:19:29.856 --> 00:19:33.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
They gave me a book,

00:19:33.443 --> 00:19:35.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
a <i>Family Life</i>  book.

00:19:37.321 --> 00:19:39.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
I showed him that book,

00:19:42.285 --> 00:19:44.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I told him,

00:19:44.287 --> 00:19:48.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Had we applied this in our marriage

00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:49.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the beginning,

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:54.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
our marriage would’ve never broken up.”

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:59.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mind was going:
‘Really? Really?’

00:19:59.343 --> 00:20:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’d see she was doing things
in a spiritual way.

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
She stopped doing drugs,

00:20:09.937 --> 00:20:14.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I just saw her mannerisms change.

00:20:15.777 --> 00:20:20.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that short period of time,
things got better and better.

00:20:21.282 --> 00:20:25.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I started
studying the Bible with Zanna.

00:20:25.286 --> 00:20:29.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s when things started clicking.

00:20:30.208 --> 00:20:32.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the scriptures

00:20:32.001 --> 00:20:35.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
that helped me to rebuild our marriage

00:20:35.546 --> 00:20:39.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
is 1 Corinthians 11:3.

00:20:40.718 --> 00:20:44.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
Art is my head; I am not the head.

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:46.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that everybody

00:20:46.682 --> 00:20:50.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah has a head,

00:20:50.103 --> 00:20:55.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
I view that as a protection.

00:20:56.234 --> 00:20:59.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I don’t have
to make decisions on my own.

00:21:02.406 --> 00:21:07.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Galatians 5:22, 23

00:21:07.203 --> 00:21:10.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that helped me to show love,

00:21:10.665 --> 00:21:13.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be a better husband,

00:21:14.127 --> 00:21:16.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
a better father.

00:21:18.381 --> 00:21:21.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I always treat her like a lady, 

00:21:21.801 --> 00:21:25.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
you know, listen to her viewpoints
and things like that.

00:21:26.556 --> 00:21:28.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remarried Arthur

00:21:28.391 --> 00:21:32.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
on April 2, 1979.

00:21:34.272 --> 00:21:38.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would tell someone
who is struggling in their marriage now,

00:21:38.484 --> 00:21:43.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Apply Bible principles

00:21:43.364 --> 00:21:45.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
—apply them.”

00:21:50.246 --> 00:21:53.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learned to be a family with Jehovah,

00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:56.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s why we can deal with the problems

00:21:56.252 --> 00:21:58.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have to face every day.

00:21:58.796 --> 00:22:00.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
The second time around

00:22:00.798 --> 00:22:03.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
is so much sweeter

00:22:03.509 --> 00:22:06.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah in the picture.

00:22:08.347 --> 00:22:10.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
Amazing—isn’t it?—

00:22:10.558 --> 00:22:13.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
how learning and applying Bible principles

00:22:13.686 --> 00:22:16.647 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keeping Jehovah in the picture

00:22:16.647 --> 00:22:20.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
made such a difference for Art and Zanna!

00:22:20.067 --> 00:22:22.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why we exert ourselves

00:22:22.612 --> 00:22:26.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring God’s Word
to as many as possible.

00:22:27.783 --> 00:22:30.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
This includes helping people hear the truth

00:22:30.995 --> 00:22:34.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the language of their heart.

00:22:34.123 --> 00:22:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know you’ll enjoy our next segment

00:22:36.626 --> 00:22:38.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how a publishing innovation

00:22:38.628 --> 00:22:41.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
invented by our brothers years ago

00:22:41.047 --> 00:22:44.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
has accelerated
the translation of the good news,

00:22:44.342 --> 00:22:47.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading to the greatest witness in history.

00:22:49.513 --> 00:22:51.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses are known

00:22:51.974 --> 00:22:54.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
for publishing in hundreds of languages,

00:22:54.518 --> 00:22:56.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a website recognized

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:00.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the most widely translated in the world.

00:23:00.107 --> 00:23:03.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
But have you ever wondered
how we’re able to release our literature

00:23:03.986 --> 00:23:08.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
in print and online
in so many languages at once?

00:23:08.407 --> 00:23:12.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
The answer involves
a cutting-edge publishing system

00:23:12.161 --> 00:23:15.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our brothers developed
more than 40 years ago

00:23:15.581 --> 00:23:18.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a breakthrough in publishing called MEPS.

00:23:19.418 --> 00:23:22.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
But just what is MEPS?

00:23:22.588 --> 00:23:25.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s find out and see how this technology

00:23:25.591 --> 00:23:28.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
has helped to unite Jehovah’s people

00:23:28.302 --> 00:23:33.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
and has opened the way for us
to give the greatest witness in history.

00:23:44.026 --> 00:23:46.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
God’s people have long understood

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
the need to share the truth
in as many languages as possible.

00:23:51.325 --> 00:23:54.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Revelation 14:6

00:23:54.203 --> 00:23:56.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
prophesied that the good news
would be preached

00:23:56.789 --> 00:24:01.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to every nation and tribe
and tongue and people.”

00:24:01.711 --> 00:24:04.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as far back as the late 1800’s,

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:08.092 line:90% position:50% align:center
the early Bible Students
translated our literature

00:24:08.092 --> 00:24:10.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
into languages other than English

00:24:10.428 --> 00:24:14.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that people could learn the truth
in their mother tongue.

00:24:14.473 --> 00:24:18.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
But for decades, publishing
the good news in many languages

00:24:18.728 --> 00:24:22.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
was a labor-intensive process.

00:24:22.106 --> 00:24:26.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine yourself working
at a Bethel printery decades ago.

00:24:26.902 --> 00:24:29.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was hot and loud.

00:24:29.947 --> 00:24:32.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
Printing required the use
of a Linotype machine,

00:24:32.908 --> 00:24:35.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
which turned molten lead

00:24:35.161 --> 00:24:39.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
into small metal slabs of type called slugs

00:24:39.332 --> 00:24:42.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
one line at a time.

00:24:42.376 --> 00:24:46.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Workers had
to meticulously compose pages

00:24:46.255 --> 00:24:49.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
by arranging the slugs
into large metal frames

00:24:49.592 --> 00:24:53.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
that were used to make special embossed mats.

00:24:53.471 --> 00:24:58.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then more hot metal was used
to cast printing plates from the mats.

00:24:58.225 --> 00:25:00.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for long press runs,

00:25:00.770 --> 00:25:05.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
the plates then had to be electroplated
with nickel to harden them.

00:25:05.274 --> 00:25:08.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
Finally, after removing any irregularities,

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
the plates were ready to be mounted

00:25:10.988 --> 00:25:14.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a large rotary printing press.

00:25:14.116 --> 00:25:18.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Publishing the same material
in another language meant

00:25:18.496 --> 00:25:23.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
repeating these prepress steps
from beginning to end.

00:25:23.209 --> 00:25:26.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took months for a single magazine

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:31.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be translated from English,
typeset, and printed.

00:25:31.342 --> 00:25:34.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
For books, it could take years!

00:25:36.472 --> 00:25:40.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
The days of hot metal were quickly ending.

00:25:40.684 --> 00:25:44.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
The printing industry began adopting the use

00:25:44.438 --> 00:25:47.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
of phototypesetting and offset presses.

00:25:49.235 --> 00:25:51.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was time to modernize operations at Bethel

00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:55.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make the transition to computers.

00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:59.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the brothers faced a unique challenge.

00:25:59.787 --> 00:26:03.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this point,
we were already printing literature

00:26:03.457 --> 00:26:06.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
in 167 languages.

00:26:06.252 --> 00:26:08.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we needed a solution

00:26:08.254 --> 00:26:11.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could handle
all those languages and more.

00:26:11.549 --> 00:26:15.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
And not one of the commercially available
systems could do that.

00:26:17.888 --> 00:26:22.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in 1979,
a group of brothers and sisters

00:26:22.017 --> 00:26:27.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
were called to Watchtower Farms
in Wallkill, New York,

00:26:27.022 --> 00:26:31.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
to develop a Multilanguage Electronic
Phototypesetting System,

00:26:31.735 --> 00:26:33.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
or MEPS.

00:26:34.864 --> 00:26:37.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we got to work on building MEPS.

00:26:37.283 --> 00:26:41.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some brothers and sisters concentrated
on the hardware—the actual circuitry.

00:26:41.704 --> 00:26:45.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Other brothers concentrated
on the screen itself and building that.

00:26:45.624 --> 00:26:48.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then others of us
concentrated on the software,

00:26:48.502 --> 00:26:50.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
the operating system, you might say.

00:26:51.464 --> 00:26:56.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
The MEPS team designed
and built almost everything

00:26:56.093 --> 00:27:00.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
—computers, keyboards, screens, and software.

00:27:00.431 --> 00:27:02.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
They had to.

00:27:02.057 --> 00:27:06.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personal computers with the power needed
still weren’t available

00:27:06.061 --> 00:27:09.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
and wouldn’t be for another few years.

00:27:09.523 --> 00:27:13.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another massive part of the project
involved creating the fonts

00:27:13.861 --> 00:27:18.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the individual letters
used to make up the pages of text.

00:27:18.866 --> 00:27:23.412 line:90% position:50% align:center
Commercial fonts weren’t available
or were too expensive

00:27:23.412 --> 00:27:26.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
for many of the languages needed.

00:27:26.207 --> 00:27:31.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
So brothers and sisters
had to draw each character by hand

00:27:31.795 --> 00:27:33.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
and scan them into the computer.

00:27:35.883 --> 00:27:40.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
For some languages,
this meant drawing thousands of characters.

00:27:41.347 --> 00:27:43.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
The software then had to be programmed

00:27:43.557 --> 00:27:46.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
with all the rules
for spacing and hyphenation

00:27:46.936 --> 00:27:51.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that words and characters
could be displayed correctly.

00:27:51.565 --> 00:27:54.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just three years after the project began,

00:27:54.777 --> 00:27:59.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
the first MEPS unit was completed in 1982.

00:28:00.324 --> 00:28:04.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
With MEPS, an operator could enter text
at a computer workstation

00:28:04.912 --> 00:28:07.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
in any supported language.

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
After this, the workstation
could be used to format the text

00:28:11.377 --> 00:28:14.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and compose pages.

00:28:14.296 --> 00:28:16.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
This approach allowed the brothers

00:28:16.715 --> 00:28:19.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
to use a single-page layout‎

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:23.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
‎to produce the same publication
for all languages.

00:28:23.472 --> 00:28:27.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
The final pages were then rendered
on photographic paper,

00:28:27.977 --> 00:28:31.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
transferred to film,
and used to make printing plates.

00:28:32.815 --> 00:28:35.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
MEPS didn’t do the translation itself.

00:28:35.568 --> 00:28:38.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was, and still is,

00:28:38.487 --> 00:28:41.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
a job for human translators.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:43.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it allowed all the prepress work

00:28:43.659 --> 00:28:46.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be completed in a fraction of the time.

00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:50.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And MEPS achieved something
even more important

00:28:50.541 --> 00:28:53.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
than increased speed and efficiency.

00:28:53.043 --> 00:28:56.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
It addressed a global spiritual need.

00:28:56.714 --> 00:28:59.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even before the MEPS project began,

00:28:59.592 --> 00:29:01.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body realized

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:04.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
that if Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide

00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:08.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
could somehow study the same material
each week at meetings,

00:29:08.809 --> 00:29:12.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would unite them as never before.

00:29:12.271 --> 00:29:14.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was clear that with MEPS,

00:29:14.356 --> 00:29:18.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with faster presses
and other adjustments in production,

00:29:18.402 --> 00:29:21.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
this could finally become a reality.

00:29:22.531 --> 00:29:26.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, so much time could be saved
in this projected operation

00:29:26.702 --> 00:29:31.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
that someday we may be able
to bring out <i>The Watchtower</i>

00:29:31.332 --> 00:29:33.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
in all principal languages

00:29:33.709 --> 00:29:38.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
with each dated issue
containing exactly the same spiritual food

00:29:38.047 --> 00:29:40.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
for the brothers all around the world.

00:29:41.925 --> 00:29:45.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
The April 1, 1984,
issue of <i>The Watchtower </i>

00:29:45.763 --> 00:29:50.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
became the first to be published
in multiple languages simultaneously.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:55.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
In just the next year,
the number of simultaneous languages

00:29:55.939 --> 00:29:58.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
grew to 23.

00:29:58.025 --> 00:30:01.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by 2021,
the study edition of <i>The Watchtower </i>

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
was being published simultaneously

00:30:04.281 --> 00:30:07.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
in more than 390 languages!

00:30:08.911 --> 00:30:11.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Almost all of Jehovah’s Witnesses

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:15.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
are now able to study the same spiritual food
at our meetings

00:30:15.542 --> 00:30:17.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the same time

00:30:17.544 --> 00:30:21.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
—truly a modern-day miracle!

00:30:21.131 --> 00:30:24.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, MEPS does a lot more than typesetting.

00:30:24.593 --> 00:30:28.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s grown to become
a full set of publishing tools.

00:30:28.847 --> 00:30:31.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
MEPS programming paved the way

00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:34.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
for <i>Watchtower Library</i>  on CD-ROM

00:30:34.645 --> 00:30:38.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
and contributed to the development
of the <i>JW Library®</i>  app.

00:30:38.774 --> 00:30:41.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, the MEPS acronym now stands

00:30:41.819 --> 00:30:46.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
for Multilanguage
Electronic Publishing System

00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:51.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it drives our publishing
both in print and online.

00:30:51.995 --> 00:30:54.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the end, the story of MEPS

00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:57.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
is more than a story of technology;

00:30:57.418 --> 00:30:59.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s one of love.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love moved the Governing Body

00:31:01.839 --> 00:31:05.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
to seek better ways to provide spiritual food

00:31:05.008 --> 00:31:08.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
to people of every “tribe and tongue.”

00:31:08.595 --> 00:31:12.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
As a result of that love
and with Jehovah’s holy spirit,

00:31:12.891 --> 00:31:16.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
we now enjoy unprecedented unity

00:31:16.812 --> 00:31:18.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ability to preach the good news

00:31:18.814 --> 00:31:22.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a scale never before possible.

00:31:32.536 --> 00:31:35.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
From molten metal slabs of type

00:31:35.831 --> 00:31:38.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
to computerized publishing,

00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:42.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
the development of MEPS
has been a real blessing.

00:31:42.463 --> 00:31:45.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s helped unify Jehovah’s people

00:31:45.299 --> 00:31:48.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we preach the good news
“in all the inhabited earth

00:31:48.761 --> 00:31:51.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a witness to all the nations.”

00:31:53.265 --> 00:31:55.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what if we face a situation

00:31:55.684 --> 00:31:58.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we personally begin to wonder

00:31:58.395 --> 00:32:00.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
if Jehovah is blessing us?

00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:05.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see how lessons
from the life of John the Baptist

00:32:05.736 --> 00:32:10.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us remain certain
of Jehovah’s love and protection.

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:18.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew this day would come.

00:32:22.294 --> 00:32:23.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
True Christians

00:32:23.921 --> 00:32:25.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
expect opposition,

00:32:28.383 --> 00:32:30.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it hurt to see Brother Vasil

00:32:30.803 --> 00:32:32.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
get arrested.

00:32:47.569 --> 00:32:49.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
After what happened,

00:32:52.491 --> 00:32:54.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was scared to talk about Jehovah.

00:33:13.929 --> 00:33:17.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
Marcos has been looking for work for months.

00:33:20.352 --> 00:33:22.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s starting to feel hopeless.

00:33:31.989 --> 00:33:35.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
I appreciate that he supports me
in the pioneer ministry,

00:33:36.743 --> 00:33:40.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
but shouldn’t he focus on finding work?

00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:54.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy
when I heard Nicole got invited to SKE,

00:33:59.182 --> 00:34:01.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as I kept thinking about it,

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started to feel empty,

00:34:05.355 --> 00:34:07.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
disappointed.

00:34:08.859 --> 00:34:11.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others seem to get so many privileges.

00:34:13.155 --> 00:34:15.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why not me?

00:34:23.332 --> 00:34:24.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
In my Bible reading,

00:34:24.374 --> 00:34:26.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
I found an example of courage

00:34:26.168 --> 00:34:28.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
to preach boldly despite opposition.

00:34:32.049 --> 00:34:35.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
After I told Marcos how I was feeling,

00:34:35.761 --> 00:34:39.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
we considered a Bible character
who endured with hope.

00:34:44.061 --> 00:34:44.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said:

00:34:45.437 --> 00:34:47.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Among those born of women,

00:34:48.065 --> 00:34:50.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“there has not been raised up

00:34:50.442 --> 00:34:53.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
anyone greater than John the Baptist.”

00:35:01.161 --> 00:35:04.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many that listened to him
were moved to repent and get baptized,

00:35:04.998 --> 00:35:08.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
preparing their hearts
to receive the Messiah.

00:35:15.258 --> 00:35:16.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
He even baptized

00:35:16.885 --> 00:35:18.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Son of God.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
But as Jesus’ ministry increased,

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
John’s began to decrease.

00:35:32.567 --> 00:35:34.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
When his disciples

00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:35.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
pointed that out to John,

00:35:37.155 --> 00:35:40.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
he humbly rejoiced
at what Jehovah was accomplishing

00:35:40.784 --> 00:35:42.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
through Jesus.

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:48.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, John faced adversity

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:50.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like worshippers of Jehovah today.

00:35:59.428 --> 00:36:02.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
John was imprisoned
for boldly declaring the truth.

00:36:12.983 --> 00:36:16.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing prevented him
from preaching courageously.

00:36:21.908 --> 00:36:25.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
As time passed and he remained in prison,

00:36:27.122 --> 00:36:28.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
John needed reassurance,

00:36:30.584 --> 00:36:32.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like I do.

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
His disciples returned

00:36:55.192 --> 00:36:57.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a message from Jesus:

00:37:00.155 --> 00:37:02.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
Observe what Jehovah

00:37:02.824 --> 00:37:04.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
is accomplishing around you.

00:37:53.375 --> 00:37:55.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I see what Jehovah

00:37:55.377 --> 00:37:57.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
is accomplishing around me.

00:38:06.263 --> 00:38:10.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can imitate John the Baptist
and endure with hope.

00:38:18.358 --> 00:38:21.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have so many reasons to be joyful,

00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:25.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
among them seeing Jehovah use others

00:38:25.615 --> 00:38:27.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accomplish his will.

00:38:44.467 --> 00:38:46.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
People need to learn about Jehovah.

00:38:49.347 --> 00:38:52.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like John, I can have courage,

00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:54.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what adversity I may face.

00:39:02.777 --> 00:39:05.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
Excellent lessons for us all!

00:39:06.489 --> 00:39:08.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
One sister was overly concerned

00:39:08.992 --> 00:39:11.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
about her husband finding employment.

00:39:11.536 --> 00:39:13.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
But she later realized the value

00:39:13.705 --> 00:39:17.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
of him keeping up his spiritual routine
in the ministry with her.

00:39:19.002 --> 00:39:22.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another sister felt empty and disappointed,

00:39:22.839 --> 00:39:26.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
but she learned to rejoice,
as did John,

00:39:26.801 --> 00:39:30.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
in seeing Jehovah use others
to advance Kingdom interests.

00:39:31.765 --> 00:39:34.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our brother who faced persecution

00:39:34.351 --> 00:39:37.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
learned to overcome his fear and speak up.

00:39:40.690 --> 00:39:43.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, in lands where our work is banned,

00:39:43.652 --> 00:39:46.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
lies and propaganda are spread

00:39:46.446 --> 00:39:48.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
to justify persecution.

00:39:50.116 --> 00:39:54.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s not just in such lands
where we face false reports,

00:39:54.621 --> 00:39:58.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
misinformation, and outright lies.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:02.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact,
even though we bear the truth,

00:40:02.003 --> 00:40:04.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
apostates and others

00:40:04.005 --> 00:40:07.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
may cast us as dishonest, as deceivers.

00:40:08.718 --> 00:40:12.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we respond to that unfair treatment?

00:40:13.306 --> 00:40:18.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s listen to Brother Seth Hyatt’s
recent Morning Worship discussion, 

00:40:18.186 --> 00:40:22.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Speaking Truth Though Labeled as Deceivers.</i>

00:40:23.441 --> 00:40:26.236 line:10% position:50% align:center
Have you ever been confronted

00:40:26.236 --> 00:40:29.114 line:10% position:50% align:center
by a bad report,

00:40:29.114 --> 00:40:31.408 line:10% position:50% align:center
a false report,

00:40:33.034 --> 00:40:35.036 line:10% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s people?

00:40:37.664 --> 00:40:40.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may be a newspaper article

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:43.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
or a segment on the evening news

00:40:43.461 --> 00:40:48.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
or perhaps some subject
is brought up in the ministry.

00:40:48.133 --> 00:40:51.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could be a broad range of subjects:

00:40:51.553 --> 00:40:54.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
our neutral stand,

00:40:54.222 --> 00:40:56.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
our stand on blood,

00:40:56.641 --> 00:41:01.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
our adherence
to Jehovah’s elevated moral standards

00:41:01.396 --> 00:41:05.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciation
for the sanctity of marriage,

00:41:05.525 --> 00:41:09.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
or our insistence
on keeping the congregation clean

00:41:09.988 --> 00:41:14.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
by disfellowshipping
unrepentant wrongdoers.

00:41:14.659 --> 00:41:17.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
But whatever the subject,

00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:20.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are some commonalities.

00:41:20.248 --> 00:41:23.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such reports

00:41:23.043 --> 00:41:26.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
are often characterized by distortions,

00:41:26.338 --> 00:41:28.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
inaccuracies,

00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:31.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes outright falsehood.

00:41:33.094 --> 00:41:35.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
And inevitably,

00:41:35.555 --> 00:41:40.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re presented with certainty and surety

00:41:40.352 --> 00:41:42.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
as though they were fact.

00:41:43.772 --> 00:41:46.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you’re confronted with such a report,

00:41:48.026 --> 00:41:50.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
how do you feel:

00:41:50.362 --> 00:41:53.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
disheartened, discouraged,

00:41:54.908 --> 00:41:56.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
angry?

00:41:57.535 --> 00:42:00.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the experience of a pioneer sister

00:42:01.956 --> 00:42:04.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was conducting a Bible study.

00:42:04.584 --> 00:42:07.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the course of conducting the study,

00:42:07.921 --> 00:42:11.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
a woman walked into the house unannounced.

00:42:11.549 --> 00:42:15.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
She didn’t ring the doorbell, didn’t knock

00:42:15.136 --> 00:42:19.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, as it turned out,
was an acquaintance of the student.

00:42:19.474 --> 00:42:23.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
She walked right in
and interrupted the Bible study.

00:42:23.895 --> 00:42:26.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in her hand was a book

00:42:26.731 --> 00:42:31.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
written by a man who at one time
had associated with Jehovah’s people.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
The woman said to the student,

00:42:35.073 --> 00:42:38.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You need to read this book.”

00:42:39.786 --> 00:42:42.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, an interesting conversation ensued,

00:42:42.789 --> 00:42:47.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our sister found herself in the position

00:42:47.043 --> 00:42:50.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
of being cast in the role of a deceiver.

00:42:52.090 --> 00:42:55.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did she handle that situation,

00:42:55.677 --> 00:42:58.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how did the Bible student respond?

00:42:59.931 --> 00:43:02.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, before we answer that question,

00:43:02.767 --> 00:43:05.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s see how the words of today’s text

00:43:05.645 --> 00:43:08.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
and surrounding verses

00:43:08.273 --> 00:43:11.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
can help us to have the proper view.

00:43:11.776 --> 00:43:15.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look, if you would, please,
at 2 Corinthians chapter 6,

00:43:18.366 --> 00:43:21.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice verse 4.

00:43:21.286 --> 00:43:23.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul says:
“In every way

00:43:23.413 --> 00:43:27.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
we recommend ourselves
as God’s ministers.”

00:43:27.542 --> 00:43:30.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what follows is a lengthy series

00:43:30.795 --> 00:43:33.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
of circumstances and situations

00:43:33.798 --> 00:43:37.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the apostle Paul faced in his ministry

00:43:37.886 --> 00:43:42.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that faithful Christians
have faced in their ministry ever since.

00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:46.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 7, the words of today’s text:

00:43:46.144 --> 00:43:49.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We recommend ourselves
as God’s ministers, . . .

00:43:49.481 --> 00:43:52.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
by truthful speech.”

00:43:52.108 --> 00:43:55.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we worship Jehovah, “the God of truth,”

00:43:56.613 --> 00:43:59.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we take delight in that.

00:43:59.449 --> 00:44:02.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as our <i>Watchtower</i>  comment
makes the point,

00:44:02.660 --> 00:44:07.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re truthful in things “big and small.”

00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:09.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love the truth.

00:44:09.375 --> 00:44:12.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love telling the truth about Jehovah.

00:44:14.506 --> 00:44:16.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s interesting to note

00:44:16.591 --> 00:44:19.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul’s words in verse 8.

00:44:19.802 --> 00:44:23.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says:
“Through glory and dishonor,

00:44:23.515 --> 00:44:27.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
through bad report and good report.”

00:44:27.519 --> 00:44:30.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then this intriguing statement:

00:44:30.146 --> 00:44:34.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We are regarded as deceivers

00:44:34.025 --> 00:44:38.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet we are truthful.”

00:44:38.071 --> 00:44:40.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that’s an interesting paradox, isn’t it?

00:44:40.823 --> 00:44:42.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be truthful

00:44:42.325 --> 00:44:46.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
and yet cast in the role of a deceiver.

00:44:48.498 --> 00:44:52.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we are confronted with a negative report

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
that does that to Jehovah’s people,

00:44:55.296 --> 00:44:59.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s good to remember
that Jehovah was the first target

00:44:59.884 --> 00:45:02.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
of such an attack.

00:45:02.095 --> 00:45:04.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look in your Bible at Genesis chapter 3,

00:45:07.934 --> 00:45:09.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
beginning in verse 1:

00:45:11.229 --> 00:45:13.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now the serpent was the most cautious

00:45:13.481 --> 00:45:16.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of all the wild animals of the field

00:45:16.484 --> 00:45:19.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that Jehovah God had made.

00:45:19.028 --> 00:45:22.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So it said to the woman:

00:45:22.031 --> 00:45:24.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Did God really say

00:45:24.909 --> 00:45:28.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you must not eat
from every tree of the garden?’”

00:45:29.455 --> 00:45:32.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we learn something
about Satan’s method.

00:45:32.500 --> 00:45:34.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t begin with a statement.

00:45:34.669 --> 00:45:36.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
He began with a question,

00:45:36.921 --> 00:45:39.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not just a question,

00:45:39.591 --> 00:45:44.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
a question that was designed
to sow seeds of doubt:

00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:48.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Did God really say that . . . ?”

00:45:48.391 --> 00:45:51.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, in verses 2 and 3,
the woman responds.

00:45:51.603 --> 00:45:53.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
Toward the close of verse 3,

00:45:53.605 --> 00:45:56.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
she actually quotes Jehovah’s command:

00:45:58.026 --> 00:46:01.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You must not eat from it,
no, you must not touch it;

00:46:01.571 --> 00:46:05.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
otherwise you will die.”

00:46:05.325 --> 00:46:07.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she understood the command,

00:46:07.368 --> 00:46:10.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she understood the penalty.

00:46:10.830 --> 00:46:12.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice in verse 4:

00:46:12.957 --> 00:46:15.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The serpent said to the woman:

00:46:15.627 --> 00:46:18.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘You certainly will not die.’”

00:46:19.922 --> 00:46:21.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, that was a lie.

00:46:23.551 --> 00:46:28.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it was presented
with certainty and surety

00:46:28.139 --> 00:46:30.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
as though it were a fact.

00:46:31.809 --> 00:46:34.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then in verse 5:
“For God knows

00:46:34.854 --> 00:46:36.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that in the very day you eat from it,

00:46:36.939 --> 00:46:40.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
“your eyes will be opened
and you will be like God,

00:46:40.026 --> 00:46:42.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
knowing good and bad.”

00:46:43.738 --> 00:46:46.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
Satan, “the father of the lie,”

00:46:46.491 --> 00:46:50.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
cast Jehovah in the role of a deceiver.

00:46:52.997 --> 00:46:56.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus experienced similar attacks

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
during his earthly ministry,

00:46:58.294 --> 00:47:02.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the apostle Paul
was labeled by his opposers

00:47:02.006 --> 00:47:04.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a deceiver.

00:47:04.050 --> 00:47:05.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we’re confronted

00:47:05.551 --> 00:47:09.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
with negative, false reports,

00:47:09.597 --> 00:47:11.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re not surprised.

00:47:11.391 --> 00:47:14.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question is,
How will we respond?

00:47:16.270 --> 00:47:18.272 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever considered some questions

00:47:18.272 --> 00:47:21.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Eve could have asked herself

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:25.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
that would have helped her
to make a good decision?

00:47:25.029 --> 00:47:27.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one:

00:47:27.031 --> 00:47:29.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What do I know about the person

00:47:29.826 --> 00:47:32.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘who is the source of this negative report?

00:47:34.706 --> 00:47:36.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What is his motive?

00:47:36.999 --> 00:47:40.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Does he have my best interests at heart,

00:47:40.044 --> 00:47:42.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
or does he have an agenda?’

00:47:44.799 --> 00:47:47.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
And another question:

00:47:47.218 --> 00:47:50.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Before I accept as truth

00:47:50.346 --> 00:47:54.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘a negative report from someone I don’t know,

00:47:54.851 --> 00:47:56.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘is there someone I do know,

00:47:56.853 --> 00:48:00.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘someone I trust who I can talk with

00:48:00.064 --> 00:48:02.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
and get some good advice?’

00:48:03.192 --> 00:48:06.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Eve certainly could have talked
with her husband,

00:48:06.529 --> 00:48:09.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
and together they could have talked
with Jehovah.

00:48:09.532 --> 00:48:12.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if Eve had asked herself those questions,

00:48:13.578 --> 00:48:17.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
the world would likely be
a much different place today.

00:48:19.584 --> 00:48:24.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Eve chose to believe a lie.

00:48:25.923 --> 00:48:27.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about the pioneer sister

00:48:27.967 --> 00:48:31.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible student
that I mentioned earlier?

00:48:31.763 --> 00:48:34.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did they handle the situation?

00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:37.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, the pioneer sister told us

00:48:37.351 --> 00:48:41.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she reflected on the fact

00:48:41.063 --> 00:48:44.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she was a guest
in the Bible student’s house.

00:48:45.193 --> 00:48:49.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so she felt it would be rude
for her to interrupt the conversation.

00:48:49.947 --> 00:48:52.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she chose to say nothing.

00:48:54.619 --> 00:48:57.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did the Bible student do?

00:48:57.246 --> 00:49:00.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Interestingly, she asked the woman:

00:49:00.792 --> 00:49:03.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do you know the man who wrote that book?”

00:49:04.504 --> 00:49:05.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No.”

00:49:05.797 --> 00:49:08.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do you know his motive for writing?

00:49:08.174 --> 00:49:10.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Why would he write such a book?

00:49:12.303 --> 00:49:16.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well, I know this lady who comes
and studies the Bible with me,

00:49:16.808 --> 00:49:19.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I know her motive is good.

00:49:19.644 --> 00:49:22.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I don’t think I need to read your book.”

00:49:24.065 --> 00:49:26.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a beautiful response!

00:49:26.317 --> 00:49:29.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible student got it,

00:49:29.946 --> 00:49:31.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we get it too.

00:49:33.491 --> 00:49:36.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know and we’re not surprised

00:49:36.702 --> 00:49:40.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we will be the target
of negative reports.

00:49:40.414 --> 00:49:45.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, we may even be cast
in the role of deceivers.

00:49:45.878 --> 00:49:48.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has frankly told us

00:49:48.464 --> 00:49:50.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there are some

00:49:50.466 --> 00:49:54.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
who are willing to exchange the truth of God
for the lie.

00:49:56.305 --> 00:50:00.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that will never be true of you or me.

00:50:00.184 --> 00:50:05.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead, we hold to Jehovah,
“the God of truth.”

00:50:05.106 --> 00:50:09.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
We continue to “recommend ourselves
as God’s ministers . . .

00:50:09.652 --> 00:50:11.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
by truthful speech.”

00:50:12.989 --> 00:50:17.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, let’s benefit
from the experience of a brother

00:50:17.326 --> 00:50:20.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made significant life changes

00:50:20.079 --> 00:50:22.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he accepted the truth

00:50:22.582 --> 00:50:26.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
only to slip back and stray from it later.

00:50:27.753 --> 00:50:32.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how Jehovah feels
about those who stray

00:50:32.341 --> 00:50:36.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he extends
his loving arm of assistance.

00:50:48.566 --> 00:50:50.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
I grew up in the Highlands of Scotland.

00:50:51.777 --> 00:50:54.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a beautiful part of the world
to grow up in.

00:50:54.614 --> 00:50:57.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father (when I was growing up, you know),

00:50:57.033 --> 00:51:01.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
he and his friends worked very hard,
but they also drank a lot.

00:51:01.913 --> 00:51:04.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a lot of violence
and heavy drinking

00:51:04.707 --> 00:51:08.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course, this sometimes
came in to our home life as well.

00:51:09.879 --> 00:51:11.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the time I was 14, I’d started drinking

00:51:11.797 --> 00:51:16.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
and sometimes I fought
with my father and my stepfather.

00:51:16.218 --> 00:51:19.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
It affected my self-esteem
and my view of myself,

00:51:19.639 --> 00:51:22.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I often went to school
feeling low and crushed.

00:51:22.975 --> 00:51:24.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at times—

00:51:24.435 --> 00:51:26.771 line:90% position:50% align:center
The teachers started to read the Bible to us.

00:51:26.771 --> 00:51:29.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those accounts touched me so deeply,

00:51:29.273 --> 00:51:32.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it gave me
a real sense of hope for the future.

00:51:33.903 --> 00:51:36.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
I didn’t want to be fighting
and getting into trouble.

00:51:36.739 --> 00:51:38.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to be a better person.

00:51:40.326 --> 00:51:41.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a purpose.

00:51:41.619 --> 00:51:45.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew there was more to life than this,
and so I joined the army.

00:51:45.331 --> 00:51:49.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
The army gave me the opportunity
to get out of the environment

00:51:49.835 --> 00:51:53.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to see the world.

00:51:53.047 --> 00:51:55.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, on the weekends, we often

00:51:55.383 --> 00:51:58.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
ended up drinking too much and being violent.

00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I got into trouble,
I always felt deep regret.

00:52:03.224 --> 00:52:04.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always wanted to change.

00:52:04.767 --> 00:52:07.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I knew that I needed to escape
from that environment and start off fresh.

00:52:08.771 --> 00:52:10.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided to move to Edinburgh.

00:52:11.565 --> 00:52:15.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was really doing a lot of fitness training
at this time,

00:52:15.361 --> 00:52:17.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
but really what I had done was

00:52:17.238 --> 00:52:19.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I had replaced one addiction,
which was alcohol,

00:52:19.865 --> 00:52:21.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
with another addiction, which was fitness.

00:52:22.535 --> 00:52:25.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I was smiling on the outside,
but I burned out.

00:52:25.621 --> 00:52:28.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was in a black hole
where I couldn’t get out.

00:52:29.709 --> 00:52:33.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that God was
the only person that could help me,

00:52:33.087 --> 00:52:35.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I prayed a lot during that time

00:52:35.089 --> 00:52:38.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that he would help me
 to find happiness and a purpose in life.

00:52:40.136 --> 00:52:43.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
A colleague came to work alongside me
who had been in the marines.

00:52:43.597 --> 00:52:46.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had gone to a nightclub,
and on the way home,

00:52:46.767 --> 00:52:48.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said that I
didn’t like this type of environment.

00:52:48.978 --> 00:52:52.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to my surprise, this colleague of mine

00:52:52.148 --> 00:52:54.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to talk to me about the Bible.

00:52:54.483 --> 00:52:57.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after two or three hours of my questions,

00:52:58.279 --> 00:53:00.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
he said, “I will get my dad to speak to you.”

00:53:00.406 --> 00:53:02.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
His father was one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:53:02.658 --> 00:53:06.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave me some publications,
and he encouraged me to read them

00:53:06.704 --> 00:53:09.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
alongside the Bible,
looking up the verses in the Bible.

00:53:10.124 --> 00:53:12.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
We started to study the Bible
with his father.

00:53:12.918 --> 00:53:15.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
We started to attend the meetings.

00:53:15.671 --> 00:53:18.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
About one and a half years
after we’d started,

00:53:18.591 --> 00:53:22.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
we both got baptized as one
of Jehovah’s Witnesses on the same day.

00:53:23.637 --> 00:53:27.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few years after I got baptized,
I moved to Germany,

00:53:27.266 --> 00:53:29.310 line:90% position:50% align:center
and during that time, unfortunately,

00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:31.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was disfellowshipped
from the Christian congregation.

00:53:33.105 --> 00:53:36.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
I went to work in the North Sea,
and I was so unhappy in this environment

00:53:36.942 --> 00:53:40.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when I was not working,
I was drinking a lot.

00:53:40.696 --> 00:53:44.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I was not careful, I would end up
doing some damage to my health.

00:53:46.327 --> 00:53:48.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I decided to move to Italy.

00:53:48.454 --> 00:53:51.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
Often, when I was out riding my bike
and every time I

00:53:51.332 --> 00:53:53.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
passed the Kingdom Hall,
I would ask the question,

00:53:53.459 --> 00:53:56.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
How am I going to return to Jehovah?

00:53:56.921 --> 00:53:59.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought, ‘Well, Jehovah
will never want me to come back.’

00:54:00.508 --> 00:54:04.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
One Saturday morning,
the doorbell rang and, sure enough,

00:54:04.136 --> 00:54:05.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was two of Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:54:05.971 --> 00:54:08.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that Jehovah
had sent these two Witnesses.

00:54:08.974 --> 00:54:12.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehovah was saying:
“I still love you, you know.

00:54:12.061 --> 00:54:14.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
No matter what you have done,
I still love you.”

00:54:15.856 --> 00:54:19.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so for the next few months,
I spent a lot of time thinking about that

00:54:19.777 --> 00:54:22.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
and accepting Jehovah’s love.

00:54:23.572 --> 00:54:25.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still had some distractions in my life.

00:54:25.741 --> 00:54:28.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was training for a race across the Alps.

00:54:28.452 --> 00:54:31.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was still working on the oil platforms
in the North Sea.

00:54:31.914 --> 00:54:35.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wasn’t making spiritual progress.

00:54:36.418 --> 00:54:38.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
One time, the elders in the Kingdom Hall

00:54:38.963 --> 00:54:42.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
told me that there was no meeting
during the week,

00:54:42.133 --> 00:54:45.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they encouraged me
to go to an assembly in Rome.

00:54:45.636 --> 00:54:50.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
What really touched me the most
was how clean Jehovah’s people were

00:54:50.224 --> 00:54:54.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
compared to the people that I’d been
associating with for so many years.

00:54:56.438 --> 00:54:59.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
While I was driving home,
I remember there was a storm.

00:54:59.733 --> 00:55:02.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had all these thoughts
racing through my mind:

00:55:02.945 --> 00:55:05.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘How did I manage to leave the congregation?

00:55:05.239 --> 00:55:07.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did I manage to leave Jehovah?’

00:55:08.701 --> 00:55:12.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
On that journey home,
I knew that I would never go back to work

00:55:12.246 --> 00:55:14.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the oil platforms in the North Sea.

00:55:16.041 --> 00:55:19.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had a lot of free time on my hands,
so I read the Bible a lot

00:55:19.086 --> 00:55:21.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the publications
from Jehovah’s Witnesses.

00:55:21.505 --> 00:55:24.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there was something
in those publications that touched me,

00:55:24.133 --> 00:55:27.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
because it said:
‘Return to me whole-souled.

00:55:27.553 --> 00:55:29.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s set matters straight between us now.’

00:55:31.974 --> 00:55:36.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
I spoke with the elders
and told them of my intent

00:55:36.854 --> 00:55:40.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend all the meetings
and to serve Jehovah whole-souled.

00:55:40.441 --> 00:55:45.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
And after a period of time,
I was reinstated in the congregation.

00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:49.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I tried to do things my own way,

00:55:49.658 --> 00:55:53.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
my life ended up out of balance—a mess.

00:55:53.829 --> 00:55:55.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so unhappy.

00:55:55.414 --> 00:55:57.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
But with Jehovah in my life,

00:55:57.416 --> 00:56:00.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
it gave me more balance in my life.

00:56:00.628 --> 00:56:04.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was about learning to accept
Jehovah’s love.

00:56:04.048 --> 00:56:07.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when I did that,
I started to make progress

00:56:07.051 --> 00:56:09.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I was able to accept Jehovah’s love

00:56:09.553 --> 00:56:12.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I was also able to accept the love

00:56:12.181 --> 00:56:14.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
through the brothers in the congregation.

00:56:15.434 --> 00:56:18.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love is way greater than that.

00:56:18.103 --> 00:56:20.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s love is able to cover everything.

00:56:20.898 --> 00:56:23.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
So I realized that Jehovah’s wisdom

00:56:23.734 --> 00:56:26.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
is, for me, priceless because

00:56:26.278 --> 00:56:29.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is the only one
who can turn a negative situation

00:56:29.406 --> 00:56:31.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
into something positive and give us

00:56:31.617 --> 00:56:34.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
a real sense of purpose
and happiness in our life.

00:56:37.456 --> 00:56:40.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you, like Brother Mackay, strayed?

00:56:41.835 --> 00:56:44.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you become inactive

00:56:44.213 --> 00:56:47.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even been removed from the congregation?

00:56:48.842 --> 00:56:51.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider the following invitation

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
so warmly brought to life

00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:57.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
in our new music video, 

00:56:57.810 --> 00:56:59.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Home.</i>

00:57:07.319 --> 00:57:15.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can feel lost sometimes,
Like I’m drifting out to sea,

00:57:15.411 --> 00:57:23.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
When troubles in my life
Take me far from Kingdom realities.

00:57:23.168 --> 00:57:27.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I’m never
left in the lurch.

00:57:27.381 --> 00:57:32.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah hears
and sends out the search.

00:57:32.928 --> 00:57:40.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
He finds me,
lifts me up in his arms.

00:57:40.978 --> 00:57:49.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
He carries me
safely away from harm.

00:57:49.361 --> 00:57:54.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
He brings me back to his fold—
my home, my family.

00:57:54.825 --> 00:57:58.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am never alone

00:58:00.456 --> 00:58:06.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I’m home.

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is no place
like this.

00:58:13.344 --> 00:58:17.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a shelter
from the storm

00:58:17.556 --> 00:58:20.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where I find
peace and rest

00:58:20.768 --> 00:58:25.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
And loving friends
who bring out the very best.

00:58:25.439 --> 00:58:29.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if you find
you’re out on your own,

00:58:29.651 --> 00:58:33.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will hear
your cries to come home.

00:58:35.491 --> 00:58:43.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll find you,
lead you back with his voice,

00:58:43.248 --> 00:58:51.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remind you
serving him was your best choice.

00:58:51.882 --> 00:58:57.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll bring you back to his fold—
your home, your family.

00:58:57.429 --> 00:59:03.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are never alone
when you’re home.

00:59:03.185 --> 00:59:11.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
How we’ll be singing:
“You made it back! Welcome home!”

00:59:11.527 --> 00:59:20.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s where you belong;
And we’re so happy to see you.

00:59:20.744 --> 00:59:28.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now you’re home.

00:59:28.544 --> 00:59:34.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are home.

00:59:39.346 --> 00:59:43.058 line:10% position:50% align:center
He found you,

00:59:43.058 --> 00:59:47.229 line:10% position:50% align:center
lifted you up in his arms.

00:59:47.229 --> 00:59:50.774 line:10% position:50% align:center
He carried you

00:59:50.774 --> 00:59:55.904 line:10% position:50% align:center
safely away from harm.

00:59:55.904 --> 01:00:00.284 line:10% position:50% align:center
He brought you back to his fold.

01:00:00.284 --> 01:00:04.329 line:10% position:50% align:center
You’ll never be alone

01:00:07.708 --> 01:00:13.547 line:10% position:50% align:center
When you’re home.

01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:26.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
Home is with Jehovah and his people.

01:00:26.018 --> 01:00:29.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
Home is where we belong.

01:00:29.271 --> 01:00:31.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’ve wandered,

01:00:31.482 --> 01:00:33.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
come home.

01:00:35.277 --> 01:00:37.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
The beauty of our spiritual home

01:00:37.279 --> 01:00:40.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
extends across the entire world.

01:00:40.866 --> 01:00:43.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s explore another “room” in that home

01:00:43.785 --> 01:00:47.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
by visiting our brothers and sisters
in Suriname.

01:00:49.374 --> 01:00:52.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suriname is a heavily forested country
in South America

01:00:52.711 --> 01:00:55.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s almost like an island.

01:00:55.506 --> 01:00:59.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
It isn’t currently connected by road
to any other country.

01:00:59.176 --> 01:01:01.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
On its east and west,

01:01:01.345 --> 01:01:03.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s bounded by rivers;

01:01:03.472 --> 01:01:04.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the north,

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:06.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the Atlantic Ocean;

01:01:06.934 --> 01:01:09.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to the south, by tropical rainforests,

01:01:09.561 --> 01:01:13.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
savannas, and the mighty Amazon River Basin.

01:01:13.524 --> 01:01:15.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
While Suriname may be

01:01:15.609 --> 01:01:18.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
one of the smallest countries
in South America,

01:01:18.570 --> 01:01:21.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
its abundant wild areas host

01:01:21.198 --> 01:01:23.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
some of the continent’s largest animals.

01:01:26.161 --> 01:01:27.621 line:90% position:50% align:center
The giant anteater, for example,

01:01:27.621 --> 01:01:32.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
eats some 35,000 ants and termites a day.

01:01:32.042 --> 01:01:35.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also found in Suriname are the tapir

01:01:35.504 --> 01:01:38.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
(South America’s largest land mammal)

01:01:38.257 --> 01:01:42.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the jaguar
(the largest of South American cats).

01:01:43.428 --> 01:01:46.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suriname’s rich diversity
isn’t limited to wildlife.

01:01:46.807 --> 01:01:51.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Its people are one
of the most ethnically diverse in the region.

01:01:52.145 --> 01:01:54.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their varying customs and foods

01:01:54.189 --> 01:01:57.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
enrich the country’s overall culture.

01:01:59.319 --> 01:02:02.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
In such
a heavily forested and diverse country,

01:02:02.197 --> 01:02:04.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
imagine the challenge

01:02:04.283 --> 01:02:07.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
our over 3,300 brothers face,

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:09.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
first reaching

01:02:09.413 --> 01:02:11.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then preaching to people

01:02:11.623 --> 01:02:14.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
in their own languages.

01:02:14.167 --> 01:02:17.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
While the official language of Suriname
is Dutch,

01:02:17.379 --> 01:02:19.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Suriname branch oversees

01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:22.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
translation into five other languages:

01:02:22.801 --> 01:02:26.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sranantongo, Aukan,

01:02:26.054 --> 01:02:28.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Saramaccan, Surinamese Sign Language,

01:02:28.932 --> 01:02:30.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Carib.

01:02:30.601 --> 01:02:35.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2022,
20 translators in Suriname Bethel

01:02:35.105 --> 01:02:38.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
worked with 13 full-time commuters

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:40.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
and 8 remote workers

01:02:40.277 --> 01:02:42.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet this need.

01:02:42.446 --> 01:02:44.823 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s meet some of our brothers working

01:02:44.823 --> 01:02:46.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the various language fields.

01:02:46.867 --> 01:02:50.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 34 publishers
in the Brownsweg Congregation

01:02:50.329 --> 01:02:52.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
speak the Saramaccan language,

01:02:52.956 --> 01:02:55.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
used by descendants of escaped slaves

01:02:55.792 --> 01:02:58.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
who fled to the country’s interior

01:02:58.086 --> 01:03:00.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
almost 400 years ago.

01:03:00.422 --> 01:03:04.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Apoera Congregation’s 18 Kingdom preachers

01:03:04.343 --> 01:03:06.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
conduct 30 Bible studies each month.

01:03:07.721 --> 01:03:10.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many in the area are Arawak Indians,

01:03:10.515 --> 01:03:12.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
among the original inhabitants of Suriname.

01:03:13.727 --> 01:03:15.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
Deep in Suriname’s interior

01:03:15.937 --> 01:03:18.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the Pulugudu Congregation,

01:03:18.231 --> 01:03:21.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
located near Pulugudu Falls.

01:03:21.151 --> 01:03:25.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
These waters
are notoriously difficult to navigate.

01:03:25.322 --> 01:03:28.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers are adept
at using their wooden boats

01:03:28.825 --> 01:03:31.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
to carry out the preaching work
on the river “roads.”

01:03:32.913 --> 01:03:37.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 38 publishers preach
in the Maroon Aukan language.

01:03:38.543 --> 01:03:40.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters of Suriname

01:03:40.962 --> 01:03:45.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Brownsweg, Apoera,
and Pulugudu congregations

01:03:45.801 --> 01:03:48.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you their love.

01:03:48.345 --> 01:03:51.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:54.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
