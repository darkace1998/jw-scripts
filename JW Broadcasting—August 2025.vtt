00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:04.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
We warmly welcome all of you

00:00:04.692 --> 00:00:07.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
to JW Broadcasting®!

00:00:07.653 --> 00:00:09.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s theme

00:00:09.655 --> 00:00:13.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
is “Imitate Jehovah’s Generosity.”

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our program will bring us closer

00:00:16.537 --> 00:00:18.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our great God, Jehovah.

00:00:18.998 --> 00:00:20.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a sample.

00:00:20.416 --> 00:00:23.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will you do in Paradise?

00:00:24.211 --> 00:00:27.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of our young ones share what
they look forward to in the new world

00:00:28.841 --> 00:00:31.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how their hope draws them to Jehovah.

00:00:32.928 --> 00:00:36.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book of Hosea
can teach us profound truths

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:39.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
—if we know how to find them.

00:00:40.144 --> 00:00:42.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll explore Hosea together

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
and learn how to dig for our own treasures.

00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:49.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
You Christian sisters

00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:53.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
are beautiful examples of compassion,

00:00:53.532 --> 00:00:57.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
self-sacrifice, humility,

00:00:57.494 --> 00:00:59.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
and so much more.

00:01:00.497 --> 00:01:02.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at times, some of you may feel

00:01:02.833 --> 00:01:05.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
that others don’t notice what you do.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:09.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
This month’s music video will assure you

00:01:09.131 --> 00:01:12.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
that your brothers and sisters love

00:01:12.426 --> 00:01:15.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
and appreciate you very much.

00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:18.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s much to look forward to

00:01:18.057 --> 00:01:22.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this edition of JW Broadcasting.

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:42.790 line:10% position:50% align:center
Humans are born

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.961 line:10% position:50% align:center
with a strong inclination to imitate.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:49.171 line:10% position:50% align:center
In fact, very young infants

00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:53.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been observed
imitating facial expressions.

00:01:53.425 --> 00:01:55.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s amazing!

00:01:55.886 --> 00:01:59.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes me think of an experience
I had some 40 years ago

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:02.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Susan and I were in the circuit work.

00:02:02.434 --> 00:02:06.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
A sister told me
that her little five-year-old son

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:08.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
was looking in a mirror

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:12.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and making various expressions
with his face and eyes.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:16.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
His mother asked,
“What are you doing?”

00:02:16.365 --> 00:02:17.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said,

00:02:17.992 --> 00:02:21.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I can’t do like Brother Lett;

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:23.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ll never be a circuit overseer!”

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:27.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’m sure he soon learned

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:30.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
that voluminous facial expressions

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
are not a requirement for circuit work.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, they could be a disadvantage.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:42.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
By the way, thank you
for putting up with me all these years.

00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how does a small child learn to walk,

00:02:47.062 --> 00:02:49.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
feed himself, and talk?

00:02:49.356 --> 00:02:52.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
He learns by imitating
his parents and others.

00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:56.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, there’s one type of imitating

00:02:56.905 --> 00:03:01.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
that does not come
automatically or even easily.

00:03:01.327 --> 00:03:04.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s identified at Ephesians 5:1.

00:03:04.747 --> 00:03:08.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Therefore, become

00:03:08.876 --> 00:03:12.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
imitators of God, as beloved children.”

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice the word “become.”

00:03:15.507 --> 00:03:19.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are not born as “imitators of God.”

00:03:19.053 --> 00:03:21.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of inherited imperfection,

00:03:21.513 --> 00:03:24.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
we aren’t even born with an inclination

00:03:24.808 --> 00:03:27.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become an imitator of God.

00:03:27.603 --> 00:03:29.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Genesis 8:21 says:

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the inclination of the heart of man

00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:36.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
is bad from his youth up.”

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:39.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, it takes earnest effort

00:03:39.698 --> 00:03:42.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become an imitator of God.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:47.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s well worth the effort,
and Jehovah will help us.

00:03:47.206 --> 00:03:51.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
What blessings will we personally reap

00:03:51.126 --> 00:03:54.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we become an imitator of God?

00:03:54.171 --> 00:03:56.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
The greatest blessing

00:03:56.006 --> 00:03:59.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah will see that we
are trying to be like him,

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will love us and draw close to us.

00:04:03.764 --> 00:04:08.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Also, the more we learn about Jehovah
and strive to be like him,

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
the more we’ll love him

00:04:10.938 --> 00:04:13.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the closer we’ll draw to him.

00:04:14.817 --> 00:04:17.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cultivating godly qualities

00:04:17.194 --> 00:04:20.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
will result
in improved relations with others.

00:04:20.781 --> 00:04:25.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imitating godly qualities
will make us a better person overall.

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
The more we’re like Jehovah,

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
the happier we’ll be.

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:33.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how he created us.

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:38.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those are just a few
of the blessings we’ll reap

00:04:38.215 --> 00:04:41.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we become an imitator of God.

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:44.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our publications,

00:04:44.763 --> 00:04:48.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
more than 40 different qualities of Jehovah

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:51.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
have been identified and discussed.

00:04:51.645 --> 00:04:55.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in this discussion,
let’s examine just one.

00:04:55.816 --> 00:04:57.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll discuss the theme

00:04:57.818 --> 00:05:01.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Imitate Jehovah’s Generosity.”

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:07.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Generosity is an aspect of Jehovah’s love.

00:05:07.119 --> 00:05:09.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unquestionably, Jehovah God

00:05:09.496 --> 00:05:13.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the most generous Giver in the universe.

00:05:13.917 --> 00:05:16.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about this.

00:05:16.086 --> 00:05:18.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eons and eons ago,

00:05:18.714 --> 00:05:21.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah God was all alone.

00:05:21.633 --> 00:05:25.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even though it’s impossible
for us to comprehend,

00:05:25.387 --> 00:05:29.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
he wasn’t lonely or lacking anything.

00:05:29.308 --> 00:05:31.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
But because of love,

00:05:31.518 --> 00:05:34.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
he generously chose to share

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
the gift of life with others.

00:05:37.441 --> 00:05:41.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
He decided to become a Father, a Creator.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
Logically, he began by creating a Son

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:49.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whom He could directly enjoy fellowship.

00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:53.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we know,
this Son became known as the Word,

00:05:53.081 --> 00:05:55.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jehovah’s Spokesman.

00:05:55.918 --> 00:05:59.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then, at some point in time, again,

00:05:59.296 --> 00:06:02.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because of loneliness
or lacking anything,

00:06:02.174 --> 00:06:04.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of love,

00:06:04.301 --> 00:06:08.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
He chose to further expand His family

00:06:08.222 --> 00:06:12.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
by creating millions of angelic sons

00:06:12.684 --> 00:06:15.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
who could also directly associate with Him.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, amazingly,
further down the stream of time,

00:06:20.359 --> 00:06:22.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of love,

00:06:22.361 --> 00:06:26.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
He again chose to expand His family.

00:06:26.073 --> 00:06:29.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
These children were a lower form of life

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:34.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
but ones who were made in His image
and whom He loved deeply.

00:06:34.164 --> 00:06:37.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we’re talking about Adam and Eve

00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:41.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the original parents of all of us.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah had not created them,

00:06:44.007 --> 00:06:46.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
none of us would ever have been born.

00:06:47.594 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, life itself

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a wonderful, miraculous,

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:55.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
and generous gift.

00:06:55.352 --> 00:06:57.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without this gift,

00:06:57.187 --> 00:07:01.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
we wouldn’t be able to enjoy any
of Jehovah’s other marvelous blessings.

00:07:02.859 --> 00:07:06.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s now talk about Jehovah’s generosity

00:07:06.446 --> 00:07:08.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
when it comes to physical gifts.

00:07:09.783 --> 00:07:13.620 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Every good gift and every perfect present

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:15.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
is from above.”

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:20.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think for a moment
about the planet we live on.

00:07:20.085 --> 00:07:23.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah created the earth as a beautiful

00:07:23.463 --> 00:07:26.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and unique home for us.

00:07:26.049 --> 00:07:30.429 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has all the right conditions
to sustain life,

00:07:30.429 --> 00:07:34.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
including the oxygen and water cycles

00:07:34.975 --> 00:07:39.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
that continually recycle essential resources.

00:07:39.354 --> 00:07:42.941 line:10% position:50% align:center
If the earth were closer to the sun,

00:07:42.941 --> 00:07:45.402 line:10% position:50% align:center
all the water would boil off

00:07:45.402 --> 00:07:47.863 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the planet would be a barren rock.

00:07:47.863 --> 00:07:52.200 line:10% position:50% align:center
Conversely, if it were farther from the sun,

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.202 line:10% position:50% align:center
the water would freeze

00:07:54.202 --> 00:07:55.746 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the planet would be like

00:07:55.746 --> 00:07:59.374 line:10% position:50% align:center
an uninhabitable iceberg.

00:07:59.374 --> 00:08:01.418 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah placed the earth

00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:03.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
at the perfect location,

00:08:03.837 --> 00:08:07.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
often called the Goldilocks zone.

00:08:09.343 --> 00:08:14.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think, too, about the marvelous gift
of our human bodies.

00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:17.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even in our imperfect state,

00:08:17.017 --> 00:08:20.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
as mentioned at Psalm 139:14,

00:08:20.395 --> 00:08:23.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
we are “wonderfully made.”

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:26.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t it brilliant how our skin

00:08:26.526 --> 00:08:31.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
is designed to heal when we cut,
scrape, or bruise it?

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:34.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we scratch, scrape, or dent our car,

00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:37.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
does it heal itself?

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you imagine

00:08:38.747 --> 00:08:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
what we would look like if every time
we damaged our skin,

00:08:43.126 --> 00:08:45.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
it just stayed that way?

00:08:45.796 --> 00:08:48.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d begin to look pretty rough

00:08:48.465 --> 00:08:51.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
in just a short period of time.

00:08:51.468 --> 00:08:53.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
And isn’t it amazing

00:08:53.679 --> 00:08:57.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
how the skin allows water to exit the body

00:08:57.849 --> 00:09:00.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the form of perspiration?

00:09:00.143 --> 00:09:01.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at the same time,

00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:05.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
it doesn’t allow water to enter into the body

00:09:05.315 --> 00:09:07.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we take a bath;

00:09:07.359 --> 00:09:11.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
otherwise, we’d become waterlogged.

00:09:11.029 --> 00:09:14.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ponder for a moment about how food

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:17.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
is not only nutritious,

00:09:17.285 --> 00:09:20.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s also delicious.

00:09:20.622 --> 00:09:24.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
This makes fueling our bodies very enjoyable.

00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:26.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could have made eating

00:09:26.878 --> 00:09:29.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
like putting gasoline in a car

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:32.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a necessary function

00:09:32.426 --> 00:09:34.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
but void of enjoyment.

00:09:35.804 --> 00:09:39.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of all the tasty varieties of food.

00:09:39.391 --> 00:09:41.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
As just one example,

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.939 line:90% position:50% align:center
how many varieties of grapes are there?

00:09:45.939 --> 00:09:49.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
According to the Food
and Agriculture Organization,

00:09:49.359 --> 00:09:51.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are about 10,000

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
different grape varieties worldwide.

00:09:55.615 --> 00:09:59.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah could have given us
just two varieties

00:09:59.786 --> 00:10:02.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
—red and green.

00:10:02.372 --> 00:10:06.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
But why do we have some 10,000 varieties?

00:10:06.168 --> 00:10:10.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of Jehovah’s voluminous generosity.

00:10:11.506 --> 00:10:12.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

00:10:12.924 --> 00:10:16.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate Jehovah’s generosity

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
in giving physical gifts?

00:10:19.848 --> 00:10:24.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s obvious that Jehovah
has put a lot of thought into his gift-giving

00:10:24.853 --> 00:10:28.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that his gifts
are practical and beneficial.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:32.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Likewise, we should prayerfully meditate

00:10:32.819 --> 00:10:35.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that our gifts are useful.

00:10:35.781 --> 00:10:38.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not all gifts are practical.

00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:40.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
One brother gave this example:

00:10:40.994 --> 00:10:43.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
A puppy might make a fine gift

00:10:43.872 --> 00:10:47.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a young one living in a rural setting,

00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:50.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s a terrible gift to a Bethelite.

00:10:52.047 --> 00:10:56.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
If our brother lacks food,
clothing, or shelter,

00:10:56.551 --> 00:10:58.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
we don’t just say:

00:10:58.637 --> 00:11:03.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go in peace; keep warm and well fed.”

00:11:03.391 --> 00:11:07.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we apply Proverbs 3:27,

00:11:08.063 --> 00:11:09.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says:

00:11:09.189 --> 00:11:13.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not withhold good from those
to whom you should give it

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
if it is within your power to help.”

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:22.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition
to helping brothers in need directly,

00:11:22.035 --> 00:11:24.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
we can indirectly help them

00:11:24.746 --> 00:11:28.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
by making donations to the worldwide work.

00:11:29.459 --> 00:11:33.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
prayerfully strives to use wisely

00:11:33.338 --> 00:11:38.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
these precious, dedicated funds
to help our dear brothers

00:11:38.176 --> 00:11:43.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’ve been afflicted
by natural or man-made disasters

00:11:43.098 --> 00:11:46.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
and who urgently need suitable Kingdom Halls

00:11:46.852 --> 00:11:50.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and assistance in many other ways.

00:11:50.522 --> 00:11:53.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
Speaking of the need for Kingdom Halls,

00:11:53.275 --> 00:11:55.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
as just one example,

00:11:55.402 --> 00:11:58.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
please look at these pictures
from the Philippines.

00:11:58.989 --> 00:12:03.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are six before and after photographs.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what do you think
was the individual average cost

00:12:08.498 --> 00:12:11.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
for these six new simplified

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:14.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
but dignified Kingdom Halls?

00:12:14.671 --> 00:12:18.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
Twenty one thousand U.S. dollars.

00:12:19.467 --> 00:12:21.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please think about this:

00:12:21.469 --> 00:12:24.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s physical gifts such as the rain,

00:12:24.514 --> 00:12:28.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
sunshine, and oxygen are recurring.

00:12:28.977 --> 00:12:32.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s one way to imitate
this aspect of Jehovah’s giving?

00:12:34.065 --> 00:12:37.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, 1 Corinthians 16:2 says:

00:12:37.068 --> 00:12:39.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the first day of every week,

00:12:39.487 --> 00:12:44.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“each of you should set something aside

00:12:44.075 --> 00:12:46.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to his own means.”

00:12:47.162 --> 00:12:50.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with this Scriptural principle,

00:12:50.207 --> 00:12:54.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
many have chosen
to “set something aside” each month

00:12:54.711 --> 00:12:59.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
by scheduling recurring online donations.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now let’s briefly contemplate
Jehovah’s spiritual gifts,

00:13:04.346 --> 00:13:07.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
which are even more impressive.

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:09.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about the Bible.

00:13:09.434 --> 00:13:12.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where would we be without it?

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:16.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lost, hopeless, floundering.

00:13:16.566 --> 00:13:21.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d have to learn by experience
—“the school of hard knocks.”

00:13:21.446 --> 00:13:24.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’d need at least two lives to live

00:13:24.908 --> 00:13:27.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one to practice

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:30.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the second to perform.

00:13:31.206 --> 00:13:34.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, think about the holy spirit.

00:13:34.209 --> 00:13:38.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 14:26 describes it as a helper,

00:13:38.338 --> 00:13:41.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
teacher, and a remembrancer.

00:13:41.758 --> 00:13:44.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is the most powerful force
in the universe,

00:13:44.636 --> 00:13:48.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah gives it to us generously.

00:13:48.932 --> 00:13:52.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider for a moment the resurrection hope.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:56.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
It strengthens us in times of great distress

00:13:56.481 --> 00:13:58.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
—when death takes a loved one

00:13:59.734 --> 00:14:02.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when we face death ourselves.

00:14:02.612 --> 00:14:06.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m reminded
of the six-year-old girl who said:

00:14:06.199 --> 00:14:10.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Thank you, Jehovah,
for the resurrection hope.

00:14:10.662 --> 00:14:13.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is a very good idea!’

00:14:15.333 --> 00:14:17.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
For our final example,

00:14:17.419 --> 00:14:21.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
what was Jehovah’s
greatest spiritual gift of generosity?

00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
The gift of his Son

00:14:23.758 --> 00:14:27.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
to purchase us from sin and death.

00:14:27.470 --> 00:14:31.308 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it wasn’t just any angel
whom Jehovah sent;

00:14:31.308 --> 00:14:35.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was his Firstborn,
his only-begotten Son.

00:14:36.438 --> 00:14:39.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if you were tied to a chair

00:14:39.024 --> 00:14:42.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
and forced to watch the torture and execution

00:14:42.569 --> 00:14:45.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
of your most beloved child?

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:47.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would be horrible!

00:14:47.782 --> 00:14:50.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah was not tied,

00:14:50.702 --> 00:14:53.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
but because of his great love for us,

00:14:53.705 --> 00:14:56.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
he restrained himself

00:14:56.041 --> 00:14:58.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and allowed the torture and execution

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his most precious Son.

00:15:01.379 --> 00:15:06.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is the ultimate example of generosity.

00:15:07.636 --> 00:15:09.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now we ask,

00:15:09.262 --> 00:15:12.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we imitate Jehovah’s generosity

00:15:12.682 --> 00:15:15.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
in giving spiritual gifts?

00:15:15.644 --> 00:15:19.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
One way is by being generous
in giving sincere commendation.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you see something good,

00:15:23.526 --> 00:15:26.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
say something good.

00:15:26.154 --> 00:15:28.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Proverbs 15:23 says:

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A word spoken at the right time

00:15:31.743 --> 00:15:34.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
—how good it is!”

00:15:35.038 --> 00:15:37.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
Words have great power.

00:15:37.832 --> 00:15:40.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
To illustrate, think of how two words

00:15:40.502 --> 00:15:44.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a convention chairman
can lift thousands of pounds.

00:15:44.881 --> 00:15:46.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are they?

00:15:46.883 --> 00:15:48.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please stand!”

00:15:49.969 --> 00:15:53.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this vein, Proverbs 18:21 says:

00:15:53.348 --> 00:15:56.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Death and life

00:15:56.434 --> 00:15:58.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
are in the power of the tongue.”

00:15:59.354 --> 00:16:01.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just a few words at the right time

00:16:01.398 --> 00:16:05.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
can make a tremendous difference
in a person’s life.

00:16:05.318 --> 00:16:08.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
They can cause a depressed one to “stand”

00:16:08.613 --> 00:16:11.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a positive hope for the future.

00:16:12.826 --> 00:16:17.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way
is to freely give out forgiveness.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
Colossians 3:13 reminds us

00:16:19.874 --> 00:16:23.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
that ‘Jehovah freely forgives us’

00:16:23.044 --> 00:16:27.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we “must also do the same.”

00:16:27.632 --> 00:16:32.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
The word “freely” in English
means “generously”

00:16:32.011 --> 00:16:35.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
and can also mean “without charge.”

00:16:35.098 --> 00:16:37.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is there someone you can extend

00:16:37.767 --> 00:16:41.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
true forgiveness to in imitation
of our generous God?

00:16:43.106 --> 00:16:47.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally, how about generously
giving out knowledge?

00:16:47.736 --> 00:16:50.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we pray for a Bible study

00:16:50.029 --> 00:16:52.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then work in harmony with those prayers

00:16:52.615 --> 00:16:56.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
by searching diligently for a deserving one?

00:16:57.287 --> 00:17:02.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we liberally train others
and share the skills we have in the ministry

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.546 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the maintenance
and construction of theocratic facilities?

00:17:07.505 --> 00:17:11.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
People in general often hoard
the knowledge they have

00:17:11.593 --> 00:17:14.387 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to protect their job.

00:17:14.387 --> 00:17:16.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Jehovah,

00:17:16.389 --> 00:17:20.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
we gladly share the knowledge
we have with others.

00:17:22.395 --> 00:17:26.941 line:90% position:50% align:center
During our discussion,
we barely scratched the surface

00:17:26.941 --> 00:17:29.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding Jehovah’s generosity

00:17:29.652 --> 00:17:32.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can imitate him.

00:17:32.238 --> 00:17:36.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will learn forever about our great God

00:17:36.618 --> 00:17:40.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how we can better reflect his qualities.

00:17:40.246 --> 00:17:44.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in the meantime,
the more we learn about him

00:17:44.417 --> 00:17:47.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the more closely we can imitate him,

00:17:47.587 --> 00:17:51.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
the richer, happier,

00:17:51.091 --> 00:17:55.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
and more satisfying our lives will be.

00:17:55.095 --> 00:17:57.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
And why?

00:17:57.097 --> 00:18:00.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because that’s how he created us.

00:18:02.727 --> 00:18:06.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way we imitate Jehovah’s generosity

00:18:06.481 --> 00:18:09.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
is by showing hospitality.

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:12.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you sometimes hold back?

00:18:12.612 --> 00:18:16.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our next segment offers practical suggestions

00:18:16.616 --> 00:18:18.159 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can help you.

00:18:27.001 --> 00:18:28.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
What mattered most to me

00:18:28.586 --> 00:18:30.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
was that everything was just right.

00:18:30.713 --> 00:18:33.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
My apartment had to be spotless,

00:18:33.007 --> 00:18:35.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the dining table had to be full

00:18:35.135 --> 00:18:36.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
with different types of food

00:18:36.469 --> 00:18:37.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
—completely full.

00:18:37.804 --> 00:18:39.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was worried

00:18:39.264 --> 00:18:41.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
that our apartment wasn’t big enough

00:18:41.683 --> 00:18:43.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accommodate guests,

00:18:43.726 --> 00:18:46.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even for a meal.

00:18:46.146 --> 00:18:47.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was often wondering

00:18:47.856 --> 00:18:50.733 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we would have enough time for invitations

00:18:50.733 --> 00:18:52.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if it would be too stressful.

00:18:52.735 --> 00:18:55.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before,
my financial situation was much better.

00:18:55.989 --> 00:18:58.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
Currently, it’s not good, but I manage.

00:18:58.616 --> 00:19:02.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters
are such a precious gift from Jehovah.

00:19:02.954 --> 00:19:05.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is truly the family he gave us.

00:19:05.748 --> 00:19:08.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters
have shown us so much love,

00:19:08.543 --> 00:19:11.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I want to do all I can
to express my gratitude.

00:19:11.921 --> 00:19:15.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best way to do so
is just by spending time together.

00:19:15.508 --> 00:19:18.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re happy to take time for our brothers.

00:19:18.636 --> 00:19:21.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many of the friends live alone

00:19:21.014 --> 00:19:24.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
or just want someone to spend time with.

00:19:24.309 --> 00:19:26.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s nice when we can show hospitality
in our homes,

00:19:26.895 --> 00:19:28.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I’ve learned that hospitality

00:19:28.938 --> 00:19:30.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
starts in the Kingdom Hall.

00:19:30.732 --> 00:19:34.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all, Jehovah has invited all of us
to be his guests.

00:19:34.235 --> 00:19:36.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
I prefer to stand right by the entrance.

00:19:36.529 --> 00:19:39.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
This way I can notice any interested ones
who come to the meetings.

00:19:40.158 --> 00:19:42.327 line:10% position:50% align:center
A warm smile shows personal interest

00:19:42.327 --> 00:19:43.536 line:10% position:50% align:center
and lets them know

00:19:43.536 --> 00:19:45.580 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’m genuinely happy that they’ve come.

00:19:46.623 --> 00:19:49.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brothers and sisters in the congregation
are my family.

00:19:49.751 --> 00:19:51.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
That is why I want to hug them,

00:19:51.794 --> 00:19:53.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
kiss them, ask them how they feel.

00:19:53.963 --> 00:19:57.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
They should feel happy just as I am.

00:19:57.342 --> 00:20:00.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m normally pretty tired after the meeting.

00:20:00.136 --> 00:20:04.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve had a long day and still have
the rest of the week ahead of me,

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that is the case with the others too.

00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:09.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes there are things
they would like to share.

00:20:09.437 --> 00:20:11.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Taking the time to listen to them

00:20:11.439 --> 00:20:13.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
can really make their day.

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:17.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
I planned to invite four to five friends
every other week.

00:20:17.695 --> 00:20:20.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
To my great joy,
my plan came true within a year and a half.

00:20:21.574 --> 00:20:23.368 line:10% position:50% align:center
Everyone was invited,

00:20:23.368 --> 00:20:24.535 line:10% position:50% align:center
and everyone came.

00:20:24.535 --> 00:20:26.371 line:10% position:50% align:center
Brothers usually ask me what to bring.

00:20:27.121 --> 00:20:29.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
I say: “Don’t bring anything
—just your beautiful smile.

00:20:29.791 --> 00:20:32.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
And bring someone who you know very well
but who I don’t know.”

00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:35.922 line:10% position:50% align:center
There have been times after the meeting

00:20:35.922 --> 00:20:37.924 line:10% position:50% align:center
when we’ve said to each other,

00:20:37.924 --> 00:20:40.843 line:10% position:50% align:center
“We just have to invite someone over!”

00:20:40.843 --> 00:20:42.762 line:10% position:50% align:center
Then we go around asking people,

00:20:42.762 --> 00:20:44.472 line:10% position:50% align:center
sometimes four or more,

00:20:44.472 --> 00:20:46.724 line:10% position:50% align:center
until we find someone who has time.

00:20:47.809 --> 00:20:50.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
This has led
to so many beautiful moments together.

00:20:50.103 --> 00:20:52.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
No one feels pressured
or expects anything extravagant.

00:20:53.523 --> 00:20:54.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone is relaxed,

00:20:54.732 --> 00:20:58.111 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it feels like a calm evening with family.

00:21:01.030 --> 00:21:04.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
One experience
completely changed my view of hospitality.

00:21:04.575 --> 00:21:08.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
A friend of mine called me and said:
“Hey! I’m close by.

00:21:08.288 --> 00:21:12.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you have time?
Can I come over?”

00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:14.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought,
‘What am I supposed to cook?’

00:21:14.711 --> 00:21:17.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment, the doorbell rang;

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:19.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
my friend was already there.

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:21.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
The only thing I could think of to cook

00:21:21.384 --> 00:21:23.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
was pasta with sauce.

00:21:23.594 --> 00:21:25.013 line:10% position:50% align:center
When we sat down to eat,

00:21:25.013 --> 00:21:26.764 line:10% position:50% align:center
my friend said to me,

00:21:26.764 --> 00:21:29.976 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Stefanie, pasta is my favorite food!”

00:21:29.976 --> 00:21:31.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was a great moment.

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
I live a simple life.

00:21:34.605 --> 00:21:36.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
To host brothers, I need to spend some money.

00:21:37.734 --> 00:21:39.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
there are leaflets with special offers.

00:21:39.777 --> 00:21:42.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
I check them to see what’s discounted.

00:21:42.613 --> 00:21:44.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
The friends are happy,

00:21:44.032 --> 00:21:46.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I didn’t spend a lot of money.

00:21:47.327 --> 00:21:50.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ve had several brothers
spend the night here.

00:21:50.121 --> 00:21:53.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
They come for pioneer school, elders’ school,

00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:55.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other theocratic projects.

00:21:56.794 --> 00:21:58.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so encouraging

00:21:58.046 --> 00:22:00.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see their positive attitude

00:22:00.048 --> 00:22:02.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
when they come home in the evenings.

00:22:02.091 --> 00:22:03.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s priceless.

00:22:03.843 --> 00:22:06.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re energized from the school,

00:22:06.304 --> 00:22:08.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they have so many upbuilding thoughts.

00:22:08.765 --> 00:22:11.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their positivity is contagious.

00:22:12.935 --> 00:22:15.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our apartment isn’t very big.

00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:18.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wondered
where our guests could sleep.

00:22:18.399 --> 00:22:21.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
We decided
to turn the office into a guest room.

00:22:22.487 --> 00:22:25.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to move the desk into our room,

00:22:25.073 --> 00:22:27.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now we have space for an air mattress

00:22:27.909 --> 00:22:29.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our guests to sleep on.

00:22:29.994 --> 00:22:31.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s a great solution.

00:22:31.996 --> 00:22:35.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
I take photos of my guests
and stick them into my photo album.

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:39.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
We live in such times
when it’s normal to get sad sometimes.

00:22:39.170 --> 00:22:40.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happens to me too.

00:22:40.838 --> 00:22:44.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
My remedy for sadness
is to take the photos, look at them,

00:22:44.842 --> 00:22:47.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember our get-togethers,
remember our laughter,

00:22:47.261 --> 00:22:50.681 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember the atmosphere we had,
the experiences I heard.

00:22:50.681 --> 00:22:53.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
I meditate on them,
and that lifts me up again.

00:22:54.769 --> 00:22:58.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I see how happy my guests are,
it makes me truly happy.

00:22:58.398 --> 00:23:00.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
Spending time together
not only strengthens

00:23:00.608 --> 00:23:02.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
our friendships with each other

00:23:02.735 --> 00:23:05.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also with Jehovah as well.

00:23:05.154 --> 00:23:07.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
We live in such insecure times.

00:23:07.949 --> 00:23:11.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really don’t know what life situations
we will face next.

00:23:11.619 --> 00:23:15.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not only are we affected by these situations
but others are also.

00:23:15.331 --> 00:23:18.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Making the best
out of the time we have together

00:23:18.418 --> 00:23:22.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps to build friendships
—strong and meaningful friendships.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:24.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many different personalities

00:23:24.882 --> 00:23:26.092 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the congregation,

00:23:26.092 --> 00:23:28.094 line:10% position:50% align:center
and the time is coming

00:23:28.094 --> 00:23:29.637 line:10% position:50% align:center
when it will be essential

00:23:29.637 --> 00:23:31.639 line:10% position:50% align:center
for us to stick together.

00:23:31.639 --> 00:23:34.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will face more and more pressure

00:23:34.267 --> 00:23:37.019 line:10% position:50% align:center
in this system of things.

00:23:37.019 --> 00:23:39.397 line:10% position:50% align:center
But we will be ever more thankful

00:23:39.397 --> 00:23:41.983 line:10% position:50% align:center
for the friendships in the congregation

00:23:41.983 --> 00:23:45.153 line:10% position:50% align:center
that can help us to resist this pressure.

00:23:45.153 --> 00:23:47.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
Together we are stronger

00:23:47.196 --> 00:23:51.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we can all support and rely
on each other.

00:24:06.716 --> 00:24:08.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
How timely!

00:24:08.885 --> 00:24:12.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
That same <i>Watchtower </i> article
made this point:

00:24:12.597 --> 00:24:14.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As pressures mount,

00:24:14.724 --> 00:24:18.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we will need the deepest of love between us

00:24:18.478 --> 00:24:20.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our brothers and sisters.”

00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:24.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, by generously extending hospitality,

00:24:24.525 --> 00:24:28.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
we strengthen the bonds of love among us.

00:24:29.947 --> 00:24:33.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need that close bond
with our brothers and sisters,

00:24:33.701 --> 00:24:37.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially when we suffer a painful,

00:24:37.413 --> 00:24:40.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
unexpected tragedy.

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:43.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Marcela, Maythe, and Jacky

00:24:43.711 --> 00:24:46.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
faced such a crisis.

00:24:46.506 --> 00:24:48.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we hear their story,

00:24:48.591 --> 00:24:51.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice how their strong faith helped them

00:24:51.469 --> 00:24:54.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their family endure.

00:24:56.015 --> 00:24:57.558 line:10% position:50% align:center
I’m from Colombia.

00:24:57.558 --> 00:24:59.268 line:10% position:50% align:center
I have five more sisters.

00:24:59.268 --> 00:25:02.396 line:10% position:50% align:center
I learned the truth from a very young age

00:25:02.396 --> 00:25:04.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
through my parents.

00:25:04.023 --> 00:25:06.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a very active spiritual life.

00:25:06.526 --> 00:25:08.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad lived the truth.

00:25:08.653 --> 00:25:11.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wasn’t just in the truth;
he lived the truth,

00:25:12.365 --> 00:25:15.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he always tried to pass that on to us.

00:25:16.536 --> 00:25:20.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
He made sure that we never went to school
without reading the day’s text first.

00:25:20.498 --> 00:25:22.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was essential.

00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:24.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
We could be late for school,

00:25:24.126 --> 00:25:26.671 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we couldn’t leave the house
without reading the text.

00:25:28.256 --> 00:25:30.174 line:10% position:50% align:center
We were a big family,

00:25:30.174 --> 00:25:32.218 line:10% position:50% align:center
but we were always at the meeting.

00:25:32.218 --> 00:25:33.928 line:10% position:50% align:center
We filled two rows.

00:25:35.012 --> 00:25:38.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was always concerned
about the well-being of the brothers.

00:25:38.224 --> 00:25:40.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was always available.

00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was very hospitable—my mom as well.

00:25:45.439 --> 00:25:50.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he used to invite his Bible students
and the brothers to our house,

00:25:50.444 --> 00:25:53.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I remember that he would
close the kitchen door,

00:25:53.614 --> 00:25:56.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
put on some music,
and cook a delicious meal.

00:25:57.994 --> 00:26:00.079 line:10% position:50% align:center
He liked to keep everything fun

00:26:00.079 --> 00:26:02.081 line:10% position:50% align:center
and for us girls to have fun,

00:26:02.081 --> 00:26:04.083 line:10% position:50% align:center
especially when we were together as a family.

00:26:06.794 --> 00:26:10.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
He would give each one of us
what we needed and enjoyed.

00:26:13.593 --> 00:26:16.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
He used to take us for walks on the weekend

00:26:16.345 --> 00:26:20.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
after the meeting and after preaching.

00:26:20.266 --> 00:26:23.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a privilege
to have a father like that.

00:26:26.355 --> 00:26:31.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that day I remember
that we were at home.

00:26:31.068 --> 00:26:33.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was going to put the car in the garage.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some men came to the car
and threatened him and my mom

00:26:41.329 --> 00:26:43.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
with machine guns

00:26:43.372 --> 00:26:46.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
to get him out of the car to kidnap him.

00:26:46.959 --> 00:26:48.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
We heard a noise.

00:26:50.421 --> 00:26:53.841 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all got scared and ran outside,

00:26:53.841 --> 00:26:57.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I remember
that my dad was on the ground,

00:26:58.596 --> 00:27:00.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
and some men had shot him.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was just left there.

00:27:09.857 --> 00:27:12.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just picked him up in my arms.

00:27:14.612 --> 00:27:16.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was taken to the hospital,

00:27:16.989 --> 00:27:19.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a few hours later, he died.

00:27:22.703 --> 00:27:25.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad’s last words were:

00:27:25.206 --> 00:27:27.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, protect my daughters.

00:27:27.959 --> 00:27:30.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take care of my daughters

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:33.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my little old lady”
—that meant my mom.

00:27:39.011 --> 00:27:41.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom, she was strong.

00:27:41.514 --> 00:27:44.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
She gave us—
She gave us a lot of strength.

00:27:44.266 --> 00:27:47.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she carried on
with the spiritual routine.

00:27:47.311 --> 00:27:50.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
The same week that my dad died,
we had a meeting

00:27:50.606 --> 00:27:53.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my sister Raquel had a talk.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:56.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
And even though
my dad had died the day before,

00:27:56.153 --> 00:27:59.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
she gave her part in the meeting
the very next day.

00:28:00.074 --> 00:28:04.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
That next week we had an assembly;
we didn’t miss it.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:09.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wanted to follow that pattern
that my dad had left.

00:28:10.334 --> 00:28:12.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was very difficult and complicated.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:18.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah always took first place
in all the decisions we made;

00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:22.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were always made
while thinking of Jehovah

00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:26.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the loyalty that my dad
always had shown toward him.

00:28:27.476 --> 00:28:30.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
I carried on as if he was alive,

00:28:30.104 --> 00:28:33.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to keep all my sisters together

00:28:33.065 --> 00:28:35.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the truth, you know?

00:28:36.235 --> 00:28:38.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
At first, I prayed to Jehovah for peace:

00:28:38.696 --> 00:28:41.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Give me ‘the peace . . .
that surpasses all understanding.’”

00:28:41.991 --> 00:28:44.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
And now when there is
something that is harder,

00:28:44.327 --> 00:28:45.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
I say to Jehovah:

00:28:45.578 --> 00:28:48.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, preserve the peace
that you have already given me.

00:28:48.998 --> 00:28:51.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t let this trial take away my peace.”

00:28:52.043 --> 00:28:54.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s when Jehovah strengthens me.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I am very fond of my sisters.

00:28:59.008 --> 00:29:01.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have a lot of respect for them

00:29:01.635 --> 00:29:03.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they were like extra mothers to me.

00:29:04.638 --> 00:29:06.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three of my sisters still live in Colombia,

00:29:06.682 --> 00:29:09.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we make sure to stay in touch
on the phone or on Zoom.

00:29:09.977 --> 00:29:12.229 line:90% position:50% align:center
That way they can see how Mom is doing.

00:29:14.357 --> 00:29:17.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some of my relatives who are not Witnesses

00:29:17.109 --> 00:29:20.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
wanted to have some of my sisters
live with them to finish raising them.

00:29:20.571 --> 00:29:23.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we didn’t want our family to be split up

00:29:23.115 --> 00:29:25.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
because that was not my dad’s plan.

00:29:25.993 --> 00:29:29.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
His plan was for all of us
to make it into the new world

00:29:29.205 --> 00:29:31.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving Jehovah together.

00:29:31.207 --> 00:29:35.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
All his efforts, all his life,
and all that he devoted to Jehovah

00:29:35.795 --> 00:29:39.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
was not going to be in vain
just because he was no longer with us.

00:29:39.673 --> 00:29:41.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
We couldn’t let all that go away.

00:29:44.053 --> 00:29:46.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
My dad taught me so many simple things

00:29:46.263 --> 00:29:49.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
about creation and about Jehovah

00:29:50.768 --> 00:29:54.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
that instilled love for Jehovah in me.

00:29:54.063 --> 00:29:58.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
That was something that I didn’t know,
at that time,

00:29:58.442 --> 00:30:00.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
was going to help me to move forward.

00:30:00.986 --> 00:30:03.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then I always say, “Wow!

00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Dad’s not here,

00:30:06.283 --> 00:30:09.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he left me another Father, Jehovah.”

00:30:09.912 --> 00:30:12.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what has helped me to move on.

00:30:14.250 --> 00:30:17.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Paradise, what I long for the most

00:30:18.879 --> 00:30:20.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
—those last words that he said,

00:30:20.881 --> 00:30:23.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah, my wife, my daughters”—

00:30:23.968 --> 00:30:26.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to be able to say to him:

00:30:26.178 --> 00:30:27.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Look! Here they are.

00:30:27.638 --> 00:30:28.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are all here.”

00:30:29.932 --> 00:30:31.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
We made it!

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:33.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
You did a good job.

00:30:39.442 --> 00:30:41.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Maythe said,

00:30:41.861 --> 00:30:45.406 line:90% position:50% align:center
their parents truly “lived the truth.”

00:30:45.406 --> 00:30:49.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their example nurtured in their children
a deep love for Jehovah

00:30:49.952 --> 00:30:54.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
and built a sure hope
in the promises to come.

00:30:55.207 --> 00:30:59.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parents, your efforts to build faith
in your children

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:04.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
can produce a lifetime of benefits.

00:31:04.425 --> 00:31:08.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
Listen to what these young ones
say about the Paradise.

00:31:12.808 --> 00:31:15.060 line:10% position:50% align:center
In Paradise, everyone is happy.

00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:16.270 line:10% position:50% align:center
They have fun,

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:18.606 line:10% position:50% align:center
and it’s a very beautiful place.

00:31:19.398 --> 00:31:21.442 line:10% position:50% align:center
You can live forever in Paradise,

00:31:21.442 --> 00:31:22.735 line:10% position:50% align:center
so you can become friends

00:31:22.735 --> 00:31:24.945 line:10% position:50% align:center
with everyone from all over the world

00:31:24.945 --> 00:31:27.072 line:10% position:50% align:center
and become one big family.

00:31:28.532 --> 00:31:29.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Paradise,

00:31:29.783 --> 00:31:31.202 line:10% position:50% align:center
there are mountains,

00:31:31.202 --> 00:31:33.621 line:10% position:50% align:center
forests, rivers,

00:31:33.621 --> 00:31:35.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
lots of flowers,

00:31:35.289 --> 00:31:37.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can hear people singing and laughing.

00:31:37.666 --> 00:31:39.793 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s exciting!

00:31:43.672 --> 00:31:47.051 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can’t really go near animals
and play with them now.

00:31:47.051 --> 00:31:48.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in Paradise,

00:31:48.802 --> 00:31:51.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
they won’t hurt you or try to bite you,

00:31:51.347 --> 00:31:53.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
so you can play with them and have fun.

00:31:55.392 --> 00:31:58.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to have a race with the cheetahs
in the Paradise!

00:32:01.774 --> 00:32:04.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Paradise,
Satan will be no more,

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
so fun will continue forever.

00:32:08.572 --> 00:32:10.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The meek will possess the earth,

00:32:10.574 --> 00:32:13.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they will find exquisite delight

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the abundance of peace.”

00:32:15.871 --> 00:32:18.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I can recite this scripture by heart.

00:32:20.668 --> 00:32:24.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right now,
there are a lot of disasters and crimes.

00:32:24.296 --> 00:32:26.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in Paradise,

00:32:26.340 --> 00:32:29.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are going to be
lots of good and happy things.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:31.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
There will be smiles everywhere.

00:32:34.098 --> 00:32:37.893 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sophia was imagining
that she was in a garden

00:32:37.893 --> 00:32:39.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
full of butterflies.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Sophia’s imagination about Paradise,

00:32:45.317 --> 00:32:47.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
she saw the little Israelite girl

00:32:47.403 --> 00:32:49.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
that worked in Naaman’s house

00:32:49.238 --> 00:32:53.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she played
with a lot of different butterflies.

00:32:56.704 --> 00:32:58.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Caleb and Sophia’s dad
said that it’s good

00:32:58.747 --> 00:33:01.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
to picture yourself in Paradise

00:33:01.166 --> 00:33:04.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . because you can “rejoice in the hope.”

00:33:04.086 --> 00:33:07.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
By thinking about myself
in the beautiful Paradise,

00:33:07.006 --> 00:33:09.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can be patient during hard times.

00:33:11.927 --> 00:33:15.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to live with my family and animals

00:33:15.055 --> 00:33:18.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a tree house with a swing and a slide.

00:33:22.563 --> 00:33:25.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here in Paradise, birds are singing happily.

00:33:25.274 --> 00:33:27.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is me and my family.

00:33:32.281 --> 00:33:33.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to meet David.

00:33:35.117 --> 00:33:38.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s because I want to know why
he had so much trust in Jehovah

00:33:38.495 --> 00:33:41.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how he could be so courageous.

00:33:43.459 --> 00:33:46.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want to meet resurrected Daniel in Paradise

00:33:46.128 --> 00:33:48.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
and ask him how he felt

00:33:48.255 --> 00:33:50.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was thrown into the lion’s pit.

00:33:52.343 --> 00:33:56.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah promises
so many fun and happy things.

00:33:58.265 --> 00:34:01.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think he is a kind God.

00:34:04.271 --> 00:34:08.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is really powerful
and has a lot of wisdom,

00:34:08.984 --> 00:34:10.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is also kind.

00:34:10.611 --> 00:34:13.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
I think he is just really great.

00:34:15.282 --> 00:34:17.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah never lies,

00:34:17.743 --> 00:34:19.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
so all his words come true,

00:34:19.453 --> 00:34:22.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he is a very loving God.

00:34:30.089 --> 00:34:34.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah loves you young ones.

00:34:34.468 --> 00:34:36.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants you, your family,

00:34:36.804 --> 00:34:40.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all who love him to be in Paradise.

00:34:40.724 --> 00:34:43.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Learn all you can about the Bible.

00:34:43.435 --> 00:34:45.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when you do,

00:34:45.437 --> 00:34:49.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll make Jehovah your best Friend.

00:34:50.776 --> 00:34:54.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is a treasure trove,

00:34:54.071 --> 00:34:58.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
but discovering
its spiritual gems takes effort.

00:34:58.575 --> 00:35:02.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help us develop
good personal study habits,

00:35:02.162 --> 00:35:05.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body is pleased to introduce

00:35:05.332 --> 00:35:08.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
a new series, 

00:35:08.168 --> 00:35:11.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>Dig for Treasures.</i>

00:35:11.964 --> 00:35:14.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our first episode,

00:35:14.133 --> 00:35:17.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
we explore the book of Hosea.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
The book of Hosea is packed
with spiritual treasure, wouldn’t you say?

00:35:31.984 --> 00:35:33.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, absolutely.

00:35:33.819 --> 00:35:36.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reveals aspects of Jehovah’s personality

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his sovereignty,

00:35:38.032 --> 00:35:40.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s so much we can apply ourselves.

00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:42.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
We just have to know how
to find the treasure.

00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:43.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that case,

00:35:43.746 --> 00:35:46.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s dig into Hosea.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love to.

00:35:47.583 --> 00:35:51.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
So a good way to start is by watching
the <i>Introduction to Hosea</i>  video.

00:35:51.462 --> 00:35:53.297 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives an overview of the book,

00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:55.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
it helps us to understand
the historical context

00:35:56.383 --> 00:35:59.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, most important,
it shows how it connects to God’s Kingdom.

00:35:59.636 --> 00:36:01.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s a great study tip.

00:36:01.388 --> 00:36:02.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, thanks.

00:36:03.724 --> 00:36:06.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
The video mentioned
that Hosea’s “career as a prophet

00:36:06.602 --> 00:36:08.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
continued for about 60 years”

00:36:08.604 --> 00:36:10.939 line:10% position:50% align:center
during a time of great political turmoil

00:36:10.939 --> 00:36:12.232 line:10% position:50% align:center
in Israel.

00:36:12.232 --> 00:36:13.525 line:10% position:50% align:center
That wouldn’t have been

00:36:13.525 --> 00:36:15.903 line:10% position:50% align:center
an easy assignment on its own.

00:36:15.903 --> 00:36:17.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
But we can start to dig deeper

00:36:17.946 --> 00:36:19.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
by asking some questions.

00:36:20.908 --> 00:36:24.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
Asking questions is such a fundamental step
in digging for treasures.

00:36:24.495 --> 00:36:25.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, for example:

00:36:25.704 --> 00:36:29.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did Jehovah choose
to start Hosea’s prophetic career?

00:36:29.708 --> 00:36:31.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hosea 1:2 says:

00:36:31.752 --> 00:36:36.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go, marry a woman of prostitution
and have children of prostitution.”

00:36:37.299 --> 00:36:41.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, can you imagine the first thing
that Jehovah tells you as a prophet

00:36:41.929 --> 00:36:46.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that he wants you to marry a woman
who’s going to be unfaithful to you?

00:36:46.975 --> 00:36:49.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder how he felt.

00:36:49.019 --> 00:36:51.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was his initial response?

00:36:51.688 --> 00:36:56.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
What went through his mind
knowing that marital infidelity awaited him?

00:36:56.735 --> 00:36:59.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many who have gone
through that circumstance say that it’s

00:36:59.863 --> 00:37:03.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
an excruciating and devastating experience.

00:37:03.283 --> 00:37:04.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:37:04.493 --> 00:37:06.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s not all.

00:37:06.453 --> 00:37:08.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
That verse also mentions

00:37:08.372 --> 00:37:11.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“have children of prostitution.”

00:37:11.458 --> 00:37:13.877 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there were children involved.

00:37:13.877 --> 00:37:16.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hosea and Gomer had a son together,

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
but later, Gomer had two other children,
likely out of wedlock.

00:37:21.468 --> 00:37:23.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wonder what that was like for Hosea.

00:37:23.929 --> 00:37:24.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
Right?

00:37:24.721 --> 00:37:28.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if they weren’t his,
when did he find out?

00:37:28.684 --> 00:37:31.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he feel
taking care of these children?

00:37:31.937 --> 00:37:35.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are so many questions we can ask
to make the account real.

00:37:35.858 --> 00:37:38.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I’ve been asked this before,
and I’m sure you have too:

00:37:39.570 --> 00:37:41.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why would Jehovah ask Hosea

00:37:41.697 --> 00:37:45.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put himself
in such a painful family situation?

00:37:45.117 --> 00:37:46.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:37:46.034 --> 00:37:47.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
It doesn’t seem right.

00:37:47.035 --> 00:37:49.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you respond to that?

00:37:49.204 --> 00:37:53.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why is such an important question
when we’re digging for treasures.

00:37:54.168 --> 00:37:55.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
So think about it:

00:37:55.794 --> 00:37:57.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah really told him why

00:37:57.796 --> 00:38:00.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that same verse where he commissioned him:

00:38:00.507 --> 00:38:02.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because by prostitution

00:38:02.134 --> 00:38:05.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
the land has turned completely away
from following Jehovah.”

00:38:06.847 --> 00:38:09.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>All Scripture</i>  book says:

00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:11.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Israel had been to Jehovah

00:38:11.393 --> 00:38:14.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
“like a wife who had become unfaithful,

00:38:14.271 --> 00:38:16.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
“committing fornication.

00:38:16.023 --> 00:38:17.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Yet he would show his love for her

00:38:17.774 --> 00:38:19.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and try to recover her.

00:38:19.776 --> 00:38:21.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Hosea’s wife, Gomer,

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
could accurately illustrate this.”

00:38:25.282 --> 00:38:28.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
So by having Hosea experience
something similar

00:38:28.327 --> 00:38:30.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
to what Jehovah was going through
with Israel,

00:38:30.954 --> 00:38:34.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hosea could better empathize
and communicate

00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:36.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
how deeply the people had hurt Jehovah.

00:38:36.251 --> 00:38:39.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, I can only imagine the weight

00:38:39.463 --> 00:38:41.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
that gave to Hosea’s words.

00:38:41.882 --> 00:38:42.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mm-hmm.

00:38:42.633 --> 00:38:44.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here is the big question:

00:38:45.177 --> 00:38:48.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this reveal
about Jehovah’s personality?

00:38:48.347 --> 00:38:49.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
What stands out to you?

00:38:49.848 --> 00:38:51.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s something surprising
about this account:

00:38:52.684 --> 00:38:55.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah told Hosea to take Gomer back.

00:38:56.772 --> 00:39:00.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hosea 3:1 says:

00:39:00.067 --> 00:39:02.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Go once again,

00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:05.155 line:90% position:50% align:center
“love the woman who is loved by another man

00:39:05.155 --> 00:39:07.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and is committing adultery,

00:39:07.157 --> 00:39:10.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
“just as Jehovah loves the people of Israel

00:39:10.869 --> 00:39:12.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
while they turn to other gods.”

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:18.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hosea taking Gomer back
wasn’t to be mechanical.

00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:22.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah told Hosea to love this woman again.

00:39:22.256 --> 00:39:26.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, that’s a much different response
than simply pretending everything is OK.

00:39:27.678 --> 00:39:29.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s restoration.

00:39:30.722 --> 00:39:33.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it shows
that even though Jehovah was deeply hurt,

00:39:33.725 --> 00:39:37.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still loved Israel
and wanted them to return

00:39:37.604 --> 00:39:40.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not just out of obligation.

00:39:40.023 --> 00:39:44.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wanted to restore
that loving, intimate relationship.

00:39:44.778 --> 00:39:46.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Jehovah’s loyal love.

00:39:47.489 --> 00:39:50.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a glimpse into Jehovah’s personality

00:39:50.325 --> 00:39:52.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, really, his sovereignty!

00:39:52.619 --> 00:39:55.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is not only loyal,
but he is a God of loyal love.

00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:57.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
Outstanding.

00:39:58.667 --> 00:40:02.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
OK, so the next step: Make it personal.

00:40:03.088 --> 00:40:05.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
The study tips
on the back of <i>The Watchtower</i>  suggest

00:40:05.924 --> 00:40:08.760 line:10% position:50% align:center
to identify lessons and apply them.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:10.262 line:10% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the takeaway?

00:40:10.971 --> 00:40:15.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Disloyalty causes Jehovah so much pain,

00:40:15.183 --> 00:40:17.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the opposite is also true.

00:40:17.603 --> 00:40:20.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we imitate Jehovah’s loyal love,

00:40:20.689 --> 00:40:22.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
he must be so pleased.

00:40:23.108 --> 00:40:26.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when we do our best to maintain
a loving atmosphere in our marriage

00:40:26.695 --> 00:40:28.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
even though it isn’t easy

00:40:29.781 --> 00:40:30.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
or if we feel mistreated

00:40:30.949 --> 00:40:32.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
and when we are loyal
to our brothers and sisters

00:40:33.535 --> 00:40:36.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
and work to restore a damaged relationship
even when they hurt us,

00:40:36.872 --> 00:40:39.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
we make Jehovah happy.

00:40:40.709 --> 00:40:42.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, we’re imitating him.

00:40:42.919 --> 00:40:47.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s not mechanical;
it’s an act of loyal love.

00:40:47.507 --> 00:40:51.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t just forgive; we love.

00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:52.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another takeaway:

00:40:52.596 --> 00:40:54.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we’ve hurt Jehovah
by our actions in the past.

00:40:55.766 --> 00:40:57.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those memories may stay with us

00:40:57.601 --> 00:41:00.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we’ve repented
and gained forgiveness.

00:41:00.187 --> 00:41:03.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might find it hard to forgive ourselves.

00:41:03.398 --> 00:41:05.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
But that’s not how Jehovah wants us to feel.

00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just like with the Israelites,

00:41:09.196 --> 00:41:11.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still wants to be our God and assures us

00:41:11.782 --> 00:41:14.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
of his forgiveness and loyal love.

00:41:14.743 --> 00:41:17.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remembering this account can give us peace

00:41:17.746 --> 00:41:19.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we’ve made a mistake.

00:41:20.415 --> 00:41:23.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at what we can find
with just a few steps:

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:27.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
getting an overview
from the <i>Introduction</i>  video,

00:41:27.547 --> 00:41:31.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking questions
to dig into the details and context,

00:41:31.259 --> 00:41:32.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for what it teaches us

00:41:32.928 --> 00:41:35.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
about Jehovah’s personality,

00:41:35.097 --> 00:41:37.516 line:10% position:50% align:center
and then making it personal.

00:41:37.516 --> 00:41:41.436 line:10% position:50% align:center
The book of Hosea is packed with such gems.

00:41:41.436 --> 00:41:43.063 line:10% position:50% align:center
And we didn’t even dig everything

00:41:43.063 --> 00:41:45.107 line:10% position:50% align:center
out of those verses.

00:41:45.107 --> 00:41:48.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did Jehovah require Hosea
to pay to buy Gomer back?

00:41:48.318 --> 00:41:51.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do the names of the children reveal
about Jehovah?

00:41:52.698 --> 00:41:55.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why did Jehovah hold out a hope
of a future king from David’s line?

00:41:55.909 --> 00:42:00.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can I imitate Hosea’s example
of accepting challenging assignments?

00:42:00.247 --> 00:42:02.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is still so much there.

00:42:02.874 --> 00:42:04.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then let’s keep going.

00:42:04.418 --> 00:42:07.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s no end to the treasure we can find
in the book of Hosea.

00:42:09.131 --> 00:42:11.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we dig for treasures,

00:42:11.717 --> 00:42:16.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
we immerse ourselves
in the lives of people like us,

00:42:16.096 --> 00:42:19.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
we witness Jehovah’s qualities in action,

00:42:19.391 --> 00:42:24.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
and what we learn
we can apply in our daily lives.

00:42:24.354 --> 00:42:26.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
In future episodes,

00:42:26.523 --> 00:42:30.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll dig into Amos, Micah, Habakkuk,

00:42:30.861 --> 00:42:34.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other Bible books sometimes called

00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:36.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
the “minor prophets.”

00:42:36.241 --> 00:42:38.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope this new series

00:42:38.326 --> 00:42:41.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
inspires and equips you

00:42:41.705 --> 00:42:45.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discover treasures
in your personal studies.

00:42:46.793 --> 00:42:48.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
We make Jehovah happy

00:42:48.879 --> 00:42:52.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he sees us doing our best to serve him.

00:42:53.133 --> 00:42:57.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are other benefits of knowing
that Jehovah sees all the good we do?

00:42:58.555 --> 00:43:02.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
That question is answered
in this Morning Worship talk

00:43:02.642 --> 00:43:05.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
presented by Brother John Ekrann.

00:43:06.772 --> 00:43:08.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we benefit

00:43:08.774 --> 00:43:11.109 line:10% position:50% align:center
from knowing that Jehovah sees

00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:14.738 line:10% position:50% align:center
all the good that we do?

00:43:14.738 --> 00:43:17.657 line:10% position:50% align:center
Our friends, our workmates, and family

00:43:17.657 --> 00:43:19.951 line:10% position:50% align:center
—they see some of the good that we do.

00:43:19.951 --> 00:43:22.245 line:10% position:50% align:center
But no friend, relative, or even mate

00:43:22.245 --> 00:43:24.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
can see all the good that we do.

00:43:24.706 --> 00:43:26.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah does:

00:43:26.708 --> 00:43:30.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we defend a friend
who isn’t there to defend themselves,

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:33.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
or we resisted a temptation,

00:43:33.256 --> 00:43:37.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
or our prayers for others
that only Jehovah knows about.

00:43:37.385 --> 00:43:41.932 line:90% position:50% align:center
Fortunately, we don’t have to report
every good deed to Jehovah

00:43:41.932 --> 00:43:46.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
and list in our prayers at night
all the good things that we did that day.

00:43:46.478 --> 00:43:50.148 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re content with knowing
that Jehovah saw them all

00:43:50.148 --> 00:43:52.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was pleased with us.

00:43:52.984 --> 00:43:56.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus was content
with knowing that Jehovah saw

00:43:56.446 --> 00:43:58.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
and was pleased with what he was doing.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:02.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we look at John 8:29,

00:44:03.954 --> 00:44:06.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 8:29,

00:44:06.957 --> 00:44:10.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
he says:
“And the One who sent me is with me;

00:44:10.043 --> 00:44:12.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he did not abandon me to myself,

00:44:12.712 --> 00:44:15.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I always do the things
pleasing to him.”

00:44:17.175 --> 00:44:19.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jesus knew that he was not alone

00:44:19.219 --> 00:44:22.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
in seeing the good things that he was doing,

00:44:22.139 --> 00:44:26.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if he was falsely accused
or his opposers lied about him.

00:44:26.351 --> 00:44:29.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
He knew that he was doing the things
that were pleasing to Jehovah.

00:44:30.522 --> 00:44:33.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what lesson is there for us in that?

00:44:33.775 --> 00:44:35.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very comforting.

00:44:35.485 --> 00:44:38.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah sees all the good that we do,

00:44:38.405 --> 00:44:41.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing good that we do
is missed by him.

00:44:43.243 --> 00:44:47.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how can knowing
that Jehovah sees all the good that we do

00:44:47.831 --> 00:44:50.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us when we’re falsely accused?

00:44:52.252 --> 00:44:53.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This is what you said.”

00:44:53.879 --> 00:44:56.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No, I didn’t say that.”

00:44:56.756 --> 00:44:59.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
You sometimes wish you had a recording

00:44:59.009 --> 00:45:01.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
or you could go back in time.

00:45:01.303 --> 00:45:03.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
But sometimes, of course,
it doesn’t make a difference

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:05.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
no matter what you say.

00:45:05.432 --> 00:45:08.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of how Mephibosheth may have felt

00:45:08.435 --> 00:45:11.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
when slandered by Ziba to King David.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:16.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you think Mephibosheth wished
he had an eyewitness or a recording?

00:45:17.068 --> 00:45:19.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, to kind of illustrate
the power of an eyewitness,

00:45:19.946 --> 00:45:22.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want you to imagine a traffic accident.

00:45:22.574 --> 00:45:25.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re just sitting at a stop sign

00:45:25.327 --> 00:45:28.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
and another car comes around the corner
and runs right into you.

00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:33.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when the police come,
shockingly, the person who ran into you

00:45:33.376 --> 00:45:37.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
says that you ran into them,
and the police believe them.

00:45:38.465 --> 00:45:40.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
You take the matter to court.

00:45:40.842 --> 00:45:45.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
The judge listens as the other person
testifies in detail how you ran into them.

00:45:46.765 --> 00:45:50.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
But before you can say anything,

00:45:50.018 --> 00:45:54.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
the judge says:
“No, that is not what happened.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I was walking on the sidewalk that day,

00:45:57.817 --> 00:46:00.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I saw the whole thing.”

00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:04.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, who would imagine
that the judge in your case

00:46:04.991 --> 00:46:07.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
actually was an eyewitness?

00:46:07.786 --> 00:46:10.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
You say to yourself,
‘Well, if I had known that,

00:46:10.163 --> 00:46:12.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘I wouldn’t have been so worried
about what was going to happen

00:46:12.332 --> 00:46:14.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
in court today.’

00:46:14.417 --> 00:46:17.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, while it’s extremely unlikely
that you’re going to go to court

00:46:17.712 --> 00:46:21.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the judge
is going to be an eyewitness for you,

00:46:21.925 --> 00:46:25.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
this does illustrate the peace of mind
that we can have in knowing

00:46:25.929 --> 00:46:29.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah is an eyewitness
to all that happens.

00:46:30.892 --> 00:46:33.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the lesson for us:
When we’re falsely accused,

00:46:33.812 --> 00:46:36.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is of great comfort for us to know

00:46:36.439 --> 00:46:41.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah was there that day
and saw the whole thing.

00:46:43.571 --> 00:46:46.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, knowing that Jehovah sees
all the good that we do

00:46:46.157 --> 00:46:50.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
can also help us avoid putting on a pretense.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:52.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is not fooled by people

00:46:52.747 --> 00:46:56.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
who do good deeds just to be seen by others.

00:46:56.918 --> 00:47:01.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Pharisees of Jesus’ day just loved
to put on a pretense of righteousness.

00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:06.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jesus tells an illustration
that really exemplified that point,

00:47:06.136 --> 00:47:10.265 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we go to Luke chapter 18,

00:47:10.265 --> 00:47:12.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
verses 9-14.

00:47:16.688 --> 00:47:19.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Luke 18:9-14.

00:47:21.151 --> 00:47:23.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says:
“He also told this illustration

00:47:23.153 --> 00:47:25.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to some who trusted
in their own righteousness

00:47:25.572 --> 00:47:28.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and who considered others as nothing:

00:47:28.491 --> 00:47:31.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Two men went up into the temple to pray,

00:47:31.286 --> 00:47:34.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘the one a Pharisee
and the other a tax collector.

00:47:34.748 --> 00:47:38.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The Pharisee stood
and began to pray these things to himself,

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:42.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“O God, I thank you
that I am not like everyone else

00:47:42.714 --> 00:47:45.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“—extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers—

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“or even like this tax collector.

00:47:48.553 --> 00:47:50.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“I fast twice a week;

00:47:50.555 --> 00:47:53.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I give the tenth of all things I acquire.”

00:47:54.601 --> 00:47:57.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘But the tax collector,
standing at a distance,

00:47:57.896 --> 00:48:01.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘was not willing
even to raise his eyes heavenward

00:48:01.316 --> 00:48:03.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘but kept beating his chest, saying,

00:48:03.526 --> 00:48:07.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘“O God, be gracious to me, a sinner.”

00:48:07.739 --> 00:48:09.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘I tell you,
this man went down to his home

00:48:09.783 --> 00:48:12.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and was proved more righteous
than that Pharisee.

00:48:12.327 --> 00:48:16.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Because everyone
who exalts himself will be humiliated,

00:48:16.247 --> 00:48:19.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
but whoever humbles himself
will be exalted.’”

00:48:20.877 --> 00:48:23.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the Pharisee
was trying to impress Jehovah

00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:27.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
with listing all of his so-called good deeds.

00:48:27.509 --> 00:48:30.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s true that Jehovah
sees all the good we do,

00:48:30.553 --> 00:48:33.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he also sees the motive behind it.

00:48:33.556 --> 00:48:35.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never want to fool ourselves

00:48:35.558 --> 00:48:39.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
that simply doing good things
that others can see

00:48:39.396 --> 00:48:43.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
does not hide who we really are
from Jehovah.

00:48:44.401 --> 00:48:48.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson for us
is that the good things that we do

00:48:48.029 --> 00:48:50.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
are because we love Jehovah,

00:48:50.407 --> 00:48:53.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
not because we want
praise or credit from others.

00:48:56.037 --> 00:48:58.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that Jehovah
sees all the good that we do

00:48:58.998 --> 00:49:03.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
also makes us comfortable
with Jehovah as our Judge.

00:49:04.671 --> 00:49:07.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re all going to be judged by Jehovah.

00:49:07.674 --> 00:49:10.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, we’ll all be judged

00:49:10.385 --> 00:49:14.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
as either worthy of life
or judged as worthy of death.

00:49:14.931 --> 00:49:16.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
How comforting it is to know that Jehovah,

00:49:16.933 --> 00:49:20.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
the one who’s going to make
that life-or-death decision,

00:49:20.729 --> 00:49:23.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
is Someone who knows everything about us!

00:49:24.941 --> 00:49:28.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like that judge we mentioned
in the illustration earlier,

00:49:28.319 --> 00:49:30.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
you didn’t even have to testify.

00:49:30.321 --> 00:49:34.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
The judge already knew
exactly what had happened.

00:49:35.869 --> 00:49:38.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
Have you ever thought
after someone compliments you

00:49:38.580 --> 00:49:41.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
or says you’re great
or you did something wonderful,

00:49:41.916 --> 00:49:45.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
you thought to yourself, ‘Yeah,
but you really don’t know me that well’?

00:49:46.379 --> 00:49:47.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the other hand,

00:49:47.797 --> 00:49:51.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are people who know you really well.

00:49:51.843 --> 00:49:53.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve known you for many years.

00:49:53.553 --> 00:49:57.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’ve been through some good times
and some bad times with you.

00:49:57.766 --> 00:49:59.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, they still love you.

00:50:00.852 --> 00:50:05.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you think to yourself:
‘Wow, with all they know about me

00:50:05.273 --> 00:50:08.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘and all that we’ve been through,
they still love me.

00:50:08.818 --> 00:50:10.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s amazing!’

00:50:12.030 --> 00:50:15.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah knows everything about us,

00:50:15.158 --> 00:50:19.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we’ve made mistakes or sins.

00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:22.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we repent
and we continue to try to do what is right,

00:50:22.332 --> 00:50:23.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
he still loves us.

00:50:25.126 --> 00:50:27.837 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, I have no doubt
that as you take some time

00:50:27.837 --> 00:50:30.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meditate on our text for today,

00:50:30.381 --> 00:50:34.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
you could come up with many more lessons
to apply in our day-to-day lives

00:50:34.928 --> 00:50:37.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
by knowing that Jehovah is watching

00:50:37.889 --> 00:50:40.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seeing all the good that we do.

00:50:40.850 --> 00:50:42.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know, as we read earlier,

00:50:42.352 --> 00:50:46.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said that Jehovah
had not left him to himself,

00:50:46.981 --> 00:50:50.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah has not left us to ourselves.

00:50:50.568 --> 00:50:52.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
He is with us,

00:50:52.779 --> 00:50:54.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
he sees us,

00:50:54.864 --> 00:50:56.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
he knows us,

00:50:56.866 --> 00:51:00.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he loves us for all the good that we do.

00:51:02.413 --> 00:51:07.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is generous
in taking the time to see us,

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:10.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
not as a large group of worshippers,

00:51:10.922 --> 00:51:14.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as unique individuals.

00:51:14.801 --> 00:51:18.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s how we see each
of our hardworking sisters too.

00:51:19.722 --> 00:51:21.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is beautifully expressed

00:51:21.850 --> 00:51:24.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
in this month’s music video.

00:51:38.741 --> 00:51:44.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’d like to take this time
just to let you know

00:51:44.789 --> 00:51:52.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
I am inspired by the faithfulness
you’ve always shown.

00:51:52.255 --> 00:51:58.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
With pen and paper,
I put down these words

00:51:58.511 --> 00:52:06.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
To help you understand
that we all can see your worth.

00:52:06.227 --> 00:52:12.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whenever you find
that you’re hard on yourself,

00:52:12.734 --> 00:52:16.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hope these words help.

00:52:18.823 --> 00:52:25.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see you, sister,
Always a smile on your face.

00:52:25.705 --> 00:52:32.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
You keep on going
Though you may doubt your precious place.

00:52:32.295 --> 00:52:38.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you could only see yourself
through our eyes,

00:52:38.968 --> 00:52:47.352 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you would know how we see you.
We see you, sister.

00:52:52.065 --> 00:52:58.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re always looking out
to help behind the scenes

00:52:58.237 --> 00:53:05.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without the hope of praise
for all you do for those in need.

00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:12.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
The gifts you give in secret
have become known.

00:53:12.043 --> 00:53:19.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve lifted others up
with so much love as they have grown.

00:53:19.968 --> 00:53:26.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
You think it’s not much,
but there are so many times

00:53:26.683 --> 00:53:29.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have touched our lives.

00:53:32.021 --> 00:53:39.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see you, sister,
Always a smile on your face.

00:53:39.153 --> 00:53:45.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
You keep on going
Though you may doubt your precious place.

00:53:45.743 --> 00:53:52.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you could only see yourself
through our eyes,

00:53:52.417 --> 00:53:59.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you would know how we see you.
We see you, sister.

00:54:09.017 --> 00:54:15.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s greater
than your heart.

00:54:15.565 --> 00:54:22.196 line:90% position:50% align:center
He sees the beautiful gem
that you are

00:54:22.196 --> 00:54:26.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you work hard
to do your part.

00:54:28.578 --> 00:54:35.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see you, sister,
Always a smile on your face.

00:54:35.793 --> 00:54:42.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
You keep on going
Though you may doubt your precious place.

00:54:42.258 --> 00:54:49.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you could only see yourself
through our eyes,

00:54:49.057 --> 00:54:57.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then you would know how we see you.
We see you, sister.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:09.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
Don’t lose that smile on your face.
Here you have found your precious place.

00:55:12.121 --> 00:55:15.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see you, sister.

00:55:20.546 --> 00:55:29.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see you,
we see you, sister.

00:55:33.643 --> 00:55:37.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
We see you, sister.

00:55:41.109 --> 00:55:45.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dear sisters, you are wonderful examples.

00:55:45.321 --> 00:55:48.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate all that you do.

00:55:48.366 --> 00:55:50.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love you dearly.

00:55:51.577 --> 00:55:53.996 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this month’s program,

00:55:53.996 --> 00:55:57.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were encouraged
to imitate Jehovah’s generosity

00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
by showing hospitality,

00:56:00.753 --> 00:56:03.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
we uncovered a valuable lesson

00:56:03.673 --> 00:56:07.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
about loyal love in the book of Hosea,

00:56:07.427 --> 00:56:09.929 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we were reminded

00:56:09.929 --> 00:56:14.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the hard work parents
put into training their children

00:56:14.392 --> 00:56:18.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
produces strong faith and a sure hope.

00:56:18.813 --> 00:56:21.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
For this month’s postcard,

00:56:21.441 --> 00:56:24.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
we travel to French Guiana

00:56:24.444 --> 00:56:26.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
in South America.

00:56:27.321 --> 00:56:31.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a lush, tropical land.

00:56:31.200 --> 00:56:35.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well over 90 percent of French Guiana
is covered in forests

00:56:35.371 --> 00:56:39.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
fed by heavy rains from December to July.

00:56:40.334 --> 00:56:43.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
An extraordinary variety of plants,

00:56:44.005 --> 00:56:47.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
mammals, birds,

00:56:48.009 --> 00:56:50.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
and insects thrive here.

00:56:50.845 --> 00:56:54.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful diversity
is also seen in the people

00:56:54.515 --> 00:56:56.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the many cultures,

00:56:56.517 --> 00:56:59.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
among them Creole, French,

00:56:59.687 --> 00:57:03.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
Surinamese, Brazilian, and South Asian.

00:57:04.692 --> 00:57:07.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
This land became a French colony

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:10.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the 17th century.

00:57:10.198 --> 00:57:13.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
For decades, thousands of convicts

00:57:13.618 --> 00:57:15.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
were sentenced to forced labor

00:57:15.912 --> 00:57:18.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
in places like Royale Island,

00:57:18.414 --> 00:57:20.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Devil’s Island, and Kourou.

00:57:21.876 --> 00:57:25.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
Happily, those things are in the past.

00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:29.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, French Guiana remains
part of the French Republic,

00:57:29.675 --> 00:57:34.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
though it’s more than
4,000 miles (6,000 km) from France.

00:57:34.222 --> 00:57:36.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
Kourou is now the site

00:57:36.224 --> 00:57:40.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a European Space Agency Center.

00:57:41.145 --> 00:57:42.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Kingdom message

00:57:42.563 --> 00:57:45.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
first reached French Guiana

00:57:45.024 --> 00:57:47.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Brother Olga Laaland,

00:57:47.652 --> 00:57:50.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
a zealous minister from Guadeloupe,

00:57:50.655 --> 00:57:53.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
arrived in 1945.

00:57:53.407 --> 00:57:55.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over the next two years,

00:57:55.409 --> 00:57:58.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
he joyfully shared the good news in villages,

00:57:58.538 --> 00:58:01.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
gold mines, and trading posts.

00:58:01.999 --> 00:58:04.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Though his stay was temporary,

00:58:04.627 --> 00:58:07.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
he planted many seeds of truth.

00:58:08.089 --> 00:58:10.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Xavier and Sara Noll,

00:58:10.508 --> 00:58:14.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
after graduating from Gilead in 1958,

00:58:14.428 --> 00:58:16.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
went to help a small group

00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:19.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the capital city, Cayenne,

00:58:19.433 --> 00:58:23.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is said to be
the birthplace of cayenne pepper.

00:58:25.439 --> 00:58:29.360 line:90% position:50% align:center
Soon Brother Noll
was conducting daily Bible studies

00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:31.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Christian Bonecaze.

00:58:33.406 --> 00:58:35.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Within a short time,

00:58:35.825 --> 00:58:37.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
Christian and his friends

00:58:37.827 --> 00:58:41.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
became the first baptized Witnesses
in French Guiana.

00:58:44.292 --> 00:58:47.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, an average of 3,000 publishers

00:58:47.545 --> 00:58:49.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
proclaim the good news.

00:58:49.964 --> 00:58:53.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Recently two milestones were reached:

00:58:53.509 --> 00:58:56.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
a peak of 700 regular pioneers

00:58:56.888 --> 00:58:59.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a record Memorial attendance

00:58:59.765 --> 00:59:03.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
of more than 11,500

00:59:03.019 --> 00:59:06.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nearly four times the number of publishers.

00:59:07.815 --> 00:59:10.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although most of the population

00:59:10.234 --> 00:59:13.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
is concentrated in and around Cayenne,

00:59:13.988 --> 00:59:16.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
our brothers work hard

00:59:16.198 --> 00:59:19.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
to find people everywhere.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
This isn’t easy.

00:59:21.162 --> 00:59:25.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Only 40 percent
of the country’s roads are paved.

00:59:25.249 --> 00:59:28.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some rivers have treacherous rapids,

00:59:28.836 --> 00:59:31.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
bearing names like Saut Fracas,

00:59:31.923 --> 00:59:34.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
or Crash Rapids,

00:59:34.634 --> 00:59:37.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
and A Dieu Vať,

00:59:37.053 --> 00:59:41.474 line:90% position:50% align:center
which translates into “That’s the End of It.”

00:59:41.474 --> 00:59:45.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Undaunted, publishers travel by boat

00:59:45.186 --> 00:59:48.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
to reach people in distant territories.

00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:51.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Preaching is done in many languages,

00:59:51.859 --> 00:59:56.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Palikur, Tyrewuju, and Hmong.

00:59:57.657 --> 01:00:02.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three congregations serve the needs
of those who speak Saramaccan.

01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:07.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seven congregations
and a remote translation office

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:11.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
support the French Guianese Creole field.

01:00:12.380 --> 01:00:15.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
When our brothers gather for association,

01:00:15.633 --> 01:00:20.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
they enjoy dancing,
singing, and playing music.

01:00:21.222 --> 01:00:24.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
A famous local dish
called <i>bouillon d’awara </i>

01:00:24.809 --> 01:00:27.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
can often be found on the table.

01:00:27.269 --> 01:00:31.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a stew
made of the pulp of awara fruit

01:00:31.524 --> 01:00:34.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
and is typically mixed with smoked meats

01:00:34.652 --> 01:00:36.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
and fresh seafood.

01:00:36.696 --> 01:00:39.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we depart French Guiana,

01:00:39.532 --> 01:00:43.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
we receive warm greetings
from our brothers and sisters

01:00:43.202 --> 01:00:47.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
who meet at the Saint-Laurent
du Maroni Kingdom Hall

01:00:47.665 --> 01:00:51.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
and from the remote translation office
in Cayenne.

01:00:55.131 --> 01:00:57.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
They say to us, <i>“Nou kontan zot!” </i>

01:00:57.883 --> 01:00:59.510 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We love you!”

01:00:59.510 --> 01:01:04.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

01:01:04.515 --> 01:01:08.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting!
