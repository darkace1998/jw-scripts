02:00.770 --> 02:03.005
Welcome, brothers and sisters. 


02:03.005 --> 02:05.408
This is a historic moment! 


02:05.408 --> 02:09.678
Our studio has moved 
and is now located only minutes 


02:09.678 --> 02:14.016
from the new world headquarters complex 
at Warwick, New York.


02:14.017 --> 02:17.154
And this first program 
from our new studio 


02:17.153 --> 02:20.021
will bring you 
many spiritual gems.


02:20.022 --> 02:23.325
First, what obstacles 
have been overcome 


02:23.325 --> 02:27.430
so that common people 
can read God’s Word? 


02:27.430 --> 02:30.967
In this exciting documentary, 
we will see the courage shown 


02:30.967 --> 02:34.404
by William Tyndale of England.


02:34.403 --> 02:36.840
What helped two fierce enemies 


02:36.840 --> 02:38.742
to become close friends? 


02:38.742 --> 02:41.644
The uniting power 
of the Bible is evident 


02:41.643 --> 02:43.680
in this account. 


02:43.680 --> 02:45.748
And what can we learn 
from the apostle Paul 


02:45.748 --> 02:48.551
that will improve our ministry? 


02:48.552 --> 02:50.654
We will find out as we join this family 


02:50.653 --> 02:53.000
during their Family Worship evening. 


02:54.357 --> 02:58.000
This is the January program 
of JW Broadcasting!


03:15.545 --> 03:20.048
As Jehovah’s Witnesses, 
we truly love the Bible. 


03:20.048 --> 03:22.051
Why? 


03:22.052 --> 03:24.954
Because we know it is God’s Word. 


03:24.953 --> 03:28.758
That’s why we love reading it, 
we love studying it, 


03:28.758 --> 03:31.726
and we love learning about its history. 


03:31.727 --> 03:35.030
When we pause 
for a moment and reflect on 


03:35.030 --> 03:38.400
the many efforts that have been made 
through the centuries 


03:38.400 --> 03:42.805
to hinder and even stop 
the distribution of the Bible, 


03:42.805 --> 03:47.477
it becomes obvious 
that its Author, Jehovah, 


03:47.477 --> 03:50.847
has been personally involved 
in preserving 


03:50.847 --> 03:53.884
and making known 
his precious Word. 


03:53.883 --> 03:56.885
This is very much 
in harmony with the thought 


03:56.885 --> 04:00.357
in Isaiah 40:8: 


04:00.357 --> 04:03.425
“The green grass dries up, 


04:03.425 --> 04:05.962
“the blossom withers, 


04:05.962 --> 04:10.000
but the word
of our God endures forever.”


04:11.200 --> 04:12.968
With that in mind, 


04:12.968 --> 04:15.305
I’m happy to speak 
with you this month 


04:15.305 --> 04:18.875
on a theme 
that’s very close to my heart:


04:18.875 --> 04:22.878
“The Word of Our God Endures Forever.” 


04:22.878 --> 04:27.450
The more we come to appreciate 
the value of God’s Word, 


04:27.450 --> 04:30.085
the more we’ll be moved to read it


04:30.085 --> 04:35.525
and, even more important, 
to apply it in our lives.


04:35.525 --> 04:39.662
Jehovah gave us an outstanding gift 
when he inspired 


04:39.662 --> 04:43.667
faithful men 
to record his precious Word. 


04:43.667 --> 04:46.635
It’s through the pages of God’s Word 


04:46.635 --> 04:51.040
that we learn 
just how much God loves us. 


04:51.040 --> 04:54.743
Thus, his Word contains 
guidance on how to live. 


04:54.743 --> 04:58.648
It outlines his purpose 
in creating us. 


04:58.648 --> 05:03.018
It gives us his precious promises 
for life everlasting 


05:03.018 --> 05:05.455
in peace and happiness. 


05:05.455 --> 05:09.192
No wonder the apostle Paul 
was inspired to write 


05:09.192 --> 05:14.830
at 2 Timothy 3:16, 17: 


05:14.830 --> 05:18.600
“All Scripture is inspired of God 


05:18.600 --> 05:22.505
“and beneficial for teaching, 
for reproving, 


05:22.505 --> 05:27.443
“for setting things straight, 
for disciplining in righteousness, 


05:27.443 --> 05:31.246
“so that the man of God 
may be fully competent, 


05:31.247 --> 05:36.685
completely equipped for every good work.”


05:36.685 --> 05:40.923
Of course, Satan the Devil 
does not want people to have access 


05:40.923 --> 05:45.093
to these precious truths 
from our heavenly Father, Jehovah. 


05:45.093 --> 05:48.865
It’s no surprise 
that there have been many obstacles 


05:48.865 --> 05:51.167
to making the Bible available. 


05:51.167 --> 05:55.037
While Satan may not have been 
directly behind all of these, 


05:55.037 --> 05:58.607
he certainly 
has made use of them. 


05:58.607 --> 06:01.110
What are some 
of these obstacles, 


06:01.110 --> 06:03.813
and how have they been overcome?


06:03.813 --> 06:06.748
Let’s consider the first obstacle: 


06:06.748 --> 06:09.451
language barriers.


06:09.452 --> 06:12.089
The first 39 books of the Bible, 


06:12.088 --> 06:14.856
which are often called the Old Testament, 


06:14.857 --> 06:18.560
were written primarily 
in the Hebrew language. 


06:18.560 --> 06:20.863
These books were known 


06:20.863 --> 06:24.200
by Hebrew-speaking servants of Jehovah. 


06:24.200 --> 06:27.002
However, as time went on,


06:27.002 --> 06:30.272
particularly after 
the destruction of Babylon, 


06:30.272 --> 06:34.677
many Jews established communities 
in other nations of the earth. 


06:34.677 --> 06:37.547
Many of these Jews spoke Greek. 


06:37.547 --> 06:40.082
They no longer used Hebrew. 


06:40.082 --> 06:43.954
That meant that many Jews 
no longer had access 


06:43.953 --> 06:47.656
to the Scriptures in a language 
they could understand.


06:47.657 --> 06:50.125
Consider what had happened. 


06:50.125 --> 06:52.362
As Alexander the Great conquered 


06:52.362 --> 06:54.797
more and more 
of the then-known world, 


06:54.797 --> 06:56.899
Greek gradually became 


06:56.898 --> 06:59.968
the common language 
of commerce and government 


06:59.968 --> 07:02.138
throughout his empire. 


07:02.138 --> 07:04.773
If the Bible 
was to be understood 


07:04.773 --> 07:07.843
by the Jews and by Jewish proselytes 


07:07.843 --> 07:12.080
who were scattered throughout 
this vast Greek-speaking territory, 


07:12.080 --> 07:16.218
it needed to be translated into Greek. 


07:16.218 --> 07:20.355
Beginning in about the year 250 B.C.E., 


07:20.355 --> 07:24.593
the Hebrew Scriptures began 
to be translated into Greek. 


07:24.593 --> 07:28.763
In time, that Greek translation 
came to be known 


07:28.763 --> 07:30.900
as the Septuagint. 


07:30.900 --> 07:34.603
It was widely and frequently used 
by the Christians 


07:34.603 --> 07:37.406
in the first century who spoke Greek. 


07:37.407 --> 07:41.677
In fact, the writers 
of the Christian Greek Scriptures,


07:41.677 --> 07:44.347
which is often called 
the New Testament, 


07:44.347 --> 07:49.319
frequently quoted directly 
from that translation.


07:49.318 --> 07:52.321
So that obstacle had been overcome. 


07:52.322 --> 07:56.492
But there were many more 
language obstacles ahead. 


07:56.492 --> 08:00.062
As the Roman Empire 
began to flourish, 


08:00.062 --> 08:03.465
Latin replaced Greek 
as a common language. 


08:03.465 --> 08:07.937
Now it was necessary 
to translate the Bible into Latin. 


08:07.937 --> 08:12.000
Some Latin translations 
of the Bible books began to appear. 


08:13.442 --> 08:18.380
But it was in the year 405 C.E. 
that Jerome completed 


08:18.380 --> 08:22.017
the definitive Latin translation 
of the Bible. 


08:22.017 --> 08:24.220
It came to be known 


08:24.220 --> 08:26.222
as the Latin Vulgate. 


08:26.222 --> 08:29.292
Jerome’s translation 
would become 


08:29.292 --> 08:32.329
the standard Bible 
used by Christendom 


08:32.328 --> 08:37.098
for the next nearly 1,000 years. 


08:37.098 --> 08:42.003
However, Latin soon became 
the language of the learned and the elite, 


08:42.003 --> 08:45.741
so the common people 
could no longer understand 


08:45.742 --> 08:47.910
the Bible’s message.


08:47.910 --> 08:52.782
During that long period, 
there were sincere men 


08:52.782 --> 08:57.019
that translated portions of the Bible 
into some additional languages, 


08:57.018 --> 09:02.625
but these translations were, 
of course, all made by hand. 


09:02.625 --> 09:07.597
Such handwritten copies of the Bible 
were rare and expensive. 


09:07.597 --> 09:11.067
Therefore, 
access to the Bible in vernacular, 


09:11.067 --> 09:14.737
or common languages, 
 was very limited.


09:14.737 --> 09:17.840
But language was not 
the only obstacle 


09:17.840 --> 09:21.343
that threatened to prevent 
the distribution of God’s Word. 


09:21.343 --> 09:24.346
Consider a second factor: 


09:24.347 --> 09:28.985
direct opposition 
to Bible translation and distribution 


09:28.985 --> 09:31.520
from religious leaders.


09:31.520 --> 09:36.492
That opposition 
started to increase in 1229 


09:36.492 --> 09:40.964
when the local church 
Council of Toulouse decreed:


09:40.963 --> 09:45.333
“We prohibit also 
that the laity should be permitted 


09:45.333 --> 09:49.000
to have the books 
of the Old or the New Testament.”


09:50.338 --> 09:55.043
In 1234, 
the Council of Tarragona decreed: 


09:55.043 --> 09:59.781
“No one should possess the books 
of the Old or the New Testament 


09:59.782 --> 10:01.984
“in the vernacular [language], 


10:01.983 --> 10:04.120
“and if anyone possesses them, 


10:04.120 --> 10:07.723
“let him deliver them, within eight days 


10:07.723 --> 10:10.491
“from the promulgation of this decree, 


10:10.492 --> 10:15.030
to the local bishop, 
so that they may be burned.”


10:15.030 --> 10:19.602
Thus, during 
a very long period in history, 


10:19.602 --> 10:22.505
there was limited access to the Bible 


10:22.505 --> 10:25.742
in the languages 
spoken by common people. 


10:25.742 --> 10:28.744
But did that mean 
that the Word of God 


10:28.743 --> 10:31.313
would not continue to endure?


10:31.313 --> 10:33.681
Neither language barriers 


10:33.682 --> 10:36.285
nor opposition from religious leaders 


10:36.285 --> 10:40.322
could stop God’s Word 
from being made known. 


10:40.322 --> 10:42.892
Even in those dark times, 


10:42.892 --> 10:46.029
there were individuals 
who loved God’s Word 


10:46.028 --> 10:48.763
and who worked hard 
to translate it 


10:48.763 --> 10:51.800
and to make it available to others. 


10:51.800 --> 10:53.802
Consider John Wycliffe 


10:53.802 --> 10:57.072
and his followers 
who were called the Lollards.


10:57.072 --> 10:59.675
John Wycliffe and his associates 


10:59.675 --> 11:01.810
completed the translation 
of the Bible 


11:01.810 --> 11:06.015
into English 
about the year 1382. 


11:06.015 --> 11:09.518
They eagerly 
hand copied the translation 


11:09.518 --> 11:11.986
and then traveled 
from village to village 


11:11.987 --> 11:15.390
reading the Bible 
to the common people. 


11:15.390 --> 11:18.927
Despite tremendous opposition 
from the church, 


11:18.927 --> 11:22.832
Wycliffe and his followers 
made the Bible available 


11:22.832 --> 11:27.437
to many honesthearted people 
in the English language.


11:27.437 --> 11:31.807
After Wycliffe died in 1384, 


11:31.807 --> 11:35.044
great opposition 
came to his followers. 


11:35.043 --> 11:38.413
Many had land 
and property confiscated. 


11:38.413 --> 11:41.000
Others were burned 
at the stake.


11:42.718 --> 11:46.355
In response to the work 
of Wycliffe and the Lollards, 


11:46.355 --> 11:48.523
in 1408, 


11:48.523 --> 11:53.000
Thomas Arundel, 
Archbishop of Canterbury, declared: 


11:54.763 --> 11:57.833
“We therefore decree and ordain 


11:57.833 --> 12:02.771
“that no man shall, hereafter, 
by his own authority, 


12:02.772 --> 12:05.842
“translate any text of the Scripture 


12:05.842 --> 12:08.944
“into English, 
or any other tongue, 


12:08.943 --> 12:13.915
. . . upon pain 
of greater excommunication.”


12:13.915 --> 12:16.952
Did such opposition 
wipe out efforts 


12:16.952 --> 12:20.189
to translate and make 
the Bible available? 


12:20.188 --> 12:22.625
Absolutely not! 


12:22.625 --> 12:25.560
The work of Wycliffe 
and his associates 


12:25.560 --> 12:28.963
stimulated interest in the Bible 
throughout England 


12:28.963 --> 12:32.568
and even as far as central Europe. 


12:32.568 --> 12:37.573
Religious leaders were not able 
to silence the Word of God.


12:37.573 --> 12:42.511
In fact, within just a few decades 
after Wycliffe’s death, 


12:42.512 --> 12:46.249
two factors 
led to a tremendous increase 


12:46.248 --> 12:49.185
in the availability 
of the Bible. 


12:49.185 --> 12:52.822
The first, 
about the year 1454, 


12:52.822 --> 12:57.059
was the development 
of printing with movable type. 


12:57.058 --> 13:01.230
This invention would 
in time allow for the printing 


13:01.230 --> 13:06.035
of large quantities 
of Bibles in many languages.


13:06.035 --> 13:10.973
The second factor was 
the compiling and printing 


13:10.973 --> 13:14.876
of the Hebrew and Greek 
original language text 


13:14.877 --> 13:16.879
of the Holy Scriptures. 


13:16.878 --> 13:19.315
This allowed many translators 


13:19.315 --> 13:22.852
to have access 
to the original language texts 


13:22.852 --> 13:24.987
so that they then could produce 


13:24.987 --> 13:29.192
high-quality translations 
in their own languages.


13:29.192 --> 13:31.327
What was the result? 


13:31.327 --> 13:34.997
In the 1500’s across Europe, 


13:34.997 --> 13:38.467
fresh translations 
were made and printed 


13:38.467 --> 13:41.004
in vernacular, 
or common languages, 


13:41.003 --> 13:45.206
including German, English, Italian, French, 


13:45.207 --> 13:49.010
Dutch, Czech, Danish, Swedish, 


13:49.010 --> 13:52.882
Spanish, Slovenian, and many others.


13:52.882 --> 13:56.752
However, opposition continued. 


13:56.752 --> 14:01.457
Bible translators were frequently hounded 
by the Inquisition, 


14:01.457 --> 14:06.162
and some translators like 
William Tyndale and John Rogers 


14:06.162 --> 14:09.299
were even put to death 
for their work. 


14:09.298 --> 14:13.635
Nonetheless, the Word of God 
continued to endure 


14:13.635 --> 14:18.273
and be made available 
to more and more language groups.


14:18.273 --> 14:21.010
By the early 1800’s, 


14:21.010 --> 14:24.145
Bible translation 
began to speed up. 


14:24.145 --> 14:27.717
Bible societies 
and intrepid translators 


14:27.717 --> 14:30.785
began to work 
in many parts of the earth 


14:30.785 --> 14:33.955
so that the Bible began 
to appear in languages 


14:33.955 --> 14:37.760
of Asia, Africa, 
the Pacific islands, 


14:37.760 --> 14:41.897
as well as in indigenous languages 
of the Americas. 


14:41.897 --> 14:45.767
From 1800 to 1899, 


14:45.767 --> 14:48.670
some portions of the Bible 
were translated 


14:48.670 --> 14:51.640
into some 400 languages, 


14:51.640 --> 14:54.477
and from 1900 to 1950, 


14:54.477 --> 14:58.980
more than 500 languages 
were added.


14:58.980 --> 15:03.818
Consider what has been accomplished 
with the New World Translation. 


15:03.818 --> 15:07.355
As of this month, 
the New World Translation 


15:07.355 --> 15:10.525
has been produced 
in whole or in part 


15:10.525 --> 15:13.728
in 149 languages, 


15:13.728 --> 15:17.766
with an additional 
37 languages approved.


15:17.767 --> 15:21.770
It’s obvious 
that neither language barriers 


15:21.770 --> 15:24.673
nor opposition 
from religious leaders 


15:24.673 --> 15:28.476
was able to stop 
the distribution of God’s Word. 


15:28.477 --> 15:32.982
Jehovah has protected it 
through the ages. 


15:32.982 --> 15:37.000
It’s just as Psalm 12:6, 7 says: 


15:38.320 --> 15:42.090
“The sayings of Jehovah are pure; 


15:42.090 --> 15:45.962
“they are like silver refined 
in an earthen furnace, 


15:45.962 --> 15:48.864
“purified seven times. 


15:48.863 --> 15:51.733
“You will guard them, O Jehovah; 


15:51.733 --> 15:54.201
“you will protect each one of them 


15:54.202 --> 15:58.607
from this generation forever.”


15:58.607 --> 16:02.712
Yes, Jehovah 
has protected each one 


16:02.712 --> 16:06.315
of his precious sayings 
down through the ages.


16:06.315 --> 16:09.818
But consider a third obstacle. 


16:09.818 --> 16:13.988
Although the Bible is now available 
in whole or in part 


16:13.988 --> 16:17.125
in almost 3,000 languages, 


16:17.125 --> 16:20.695
many people are no longer interested 
in reading it. 


16:20.695 --> 16:24.198
In our modern age, 
people have become


16:24.198 --> 16:27.235
increasingly skeptical and irreligious. 


16:27.235 --> 16:30.538
Scientists have extolled 
the theory of evolution 


16:30.538 --> 16:32.908
and have made it appear intelligent 


16:32.908 --> 16:35.510
to doubt the existence of God. 


16:35.510 --> 16:37.512
At the same time, 


16:37.512 --> 16:40.182
secular philosophy has encouraged people 


16:40.182 --> 16:44.520
to make life decisions 
according to what feels right to them. 


16:44.520 --> 16:46.555
What is the result? 


16:46.555 --> 16:49.525
A world where people 
are often guided 


16:49.525 --> 16:53.362
by their own selfish, fleshly desires. 


16:53.362 --> 16:55.597
Instead of leading to happiness, 


16:55.597 --> 17:00.069
many people are left 
feeling empty and dissatisfied.


17:00.068 --> 17:04.338
How is this third obstacle overcome? 


17:04.338 --> 17:06.241
Around the world, 


17:06.242 --> 17:09.712
people are opening 
God’s Word, the Bible, 


17:09.712 --> 17:11.947
and reading it 
for themselves. 


17:11.947 --> 17:15.050
They’re recognizing 
that its thoughts 


17:15.050 --> 17:17.352
are not simply human wisdom. 


17:17.352 --> 17:21.090
As they apply 
its principles in their lives, 


17:21.090 --> 17:23.725
they find 
contentment and joy. 


17:23.725 --> 17:27.562
They develop 
self-respect and dignity 


17:27.562 --> 17:31.100
from living according to 
the upright moral standards 


17:31.100 --> 17:33.368
outlined by our Creator. 


17:33.368 --> 17:39.875
As Psalm 119:97-100 states: 


17:39.875 --> 17:42.477
“How I do love your law! 


17:42.477 --> 17:46.082
“I ponder over it all day long. 


17:46.082 --> 17:49.985
“Your commandment 
makes me wiser than my enemies, 


17:49.985 --> 17:52.587
“because it is with me forever. 


17:52.587 --> 17:56.092
“I have more insight 
than all my teachers, 


17:56.092 --> 17:59.327
“because I ponder over your reminders. 


17:59.327 --> 18:03.199
“I act with more understanding 
than older men, 


18:03.198 --> 18:07.770
because I observe your orders.”


18:07.770 --> 18:09.972
What a powerful proof 


18:09.972 --> 18:13.642
that the Word of God endures forever. 


18:13.642 --> 18:18.014
While the advice of human philosophers 
is frequently flawed, 


18:18.013 --> 18:21.483
the Bible’s counsel works. 


18:21.483 --> 18:23.485
If we apply it, 


18:23.485 --> 18:27.122
it can help us either 
to overcome or to cope 


18:27.122 --> 18:31.059
with any problem 
or situation that we may face. 


18:31.058 --> 18:33.061
What is more, 


18:33.062 --> 18:36.665
by explaining 
God’s purpose for the future, 


18:36.665 --> 18:38.733
it gives us a solid hope 


18:38.733 --> 18:42.770
this earth will be restored 
to the Paradise 


18:42.770 --> 18:45.373
that it was 
when it was first created. 


18:45.373 --> 18:49.678
It will be filled 
with peace and righteousness. 


18:49.678 --> 18:52.146
What a wonderful gift 


18:52.147 --> 18:55.317
Jehovah gave us through the Bible! 


18:55.317 --> 18:59.889
Yes, languages barriers, 
opposition from religious leaders,


18:59.888 --> 19:03.425
and even 
an increasingly irreligious world 


19:03.425 --> 19:06.195
cannot stop God’s Word.


19:06.195 --> 19:09.397
How can you be part 
of the evidence 


19:09.397 --> 19:12.467
that the Word of God 
endures forever? 


19:12.467 --> 19:16.472
Read it every day, 
study it, 


19:16.472 --> 19:20.275
meditate on the deep thoughts 
that it contains, 


19:20.275 --> 19:25.180
and then apply 
those priceless teachings in your life.


19:25.180 --> 19:29.652
In this way, 
not just on the printed page, 


19:29.652 --> 19:32.754
not just on the library shelf, 


19:32.753 --> 19:36.558
but in our minds, 
in our own hearts, 


19:36.558 --> 19:38.593
in our own lives 


19:38.593 --> 19:44.766
the Word of God 
will truly endure forever.


19:44.767 --> 19:48.204
Now, let’s get better acquainted 
with one of the individuals 


19:48.203 --> 19:52.206
we just mentioned 
who truly loved God’s Word. 


19:52.207 --> 19:56.612
In the 16th century, 
English scholar William Tyndale 


19:56.612 --> 20:01.584
had to endure harsh persecution 
in order to translate the Bible. 


20:01.583 --> 20:06.255
But he was convinced 
that the Bible had to be translated. 


20:06.255 --> 20:09.190
You will notice 
that this brief documentary


20:09.190 --> 20:12.293
has been designed also
to appeal to people 


20:12.293 --> 20:14.428
who are not 
Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


20:14.428 --> 20:16.598
as it will later 
be made available 


20:16.598 --> 20:21.000
on our official website, 
jw.org.


20:39.120 --> 20:42.123
In the autumn of 1536, 


20:42.123 --> 20:46.495
William Tyndale was led from his prison cell, 
in the castle of Vilvoorde, 


20:46.495 --> 20:49.397
to the site of his impending execution. 


20:49.397 --> 20:52.667
There a post had been prepared for him. 


20:52.667 --> 20:56.237
Tyndale was chained to the post, 


20:56.237 --> 20:58.240
strangled to death, 


20:58.240 --> 21:01.008
and then his body burned 


21:01.008 --> 21:03.011
before the onlooking crowd. 


21:03.012 --> 21:05.014
His crime? 


21:05.013 --> 21:08.883
Tyndale struggled to reconcile 
the teachings of the church 


21:08.883 --> 21:11.386
with his own studies of the Bible. 


21:11.387 --> 21:15.657
William Tyndale died 
with his faith intact 


21:15.657 --> 21:19.000
that the Bible 
is the Word of God.


21:23.832 --> 21:26.234
William Tyndale 
was the first person to seek 


21:26.233 --> 21:29.003
to translate the Bible 
from the original languages 


21:29.003 --> 21:31.005
into English.


21:31.005 --> 21:34.242
Tyndale was born 
in the late 15th century. 


21:34.242 --> 21:37.379
He was born 
in the area of Gloucestershire 


21:37.378 --> 21:41.516
but had a chance to go to Oxford 
and became a priest.


21:41.517 --> 21:44.285
In the 15th century, 
there was a lot of resistance


21:44.285 --> 21:46.287
—the idea that the Word of God 


21:46.287 --> 21:49.424
could just simply be accessible 
by the general people.


21:49.423 --> 21:52.693
People knew the Latin Bible from church, 


21:52.693 --> 21:55.396
which was interpreted by the priest for them. 


21:55.397 --> 21:58.767
They never had direct access 
to the Bible themselves.


21:58.767 --> 22:01.937
Tyndale was not allowed 
to do this translation in England. 


22:01.937 --> 22:03.972
He went to the Bishop of London 


22:03.972 --> 22:08.210
asking for his permission 
to translate the New Testament 


22:08.210 --> 22:11.245
from the Greek
—the original text—


22:11.245 --> 22:15.000
into English 
but was not given that permission.


22:17.218 --> 22:20.021
Such was the opposition 
to Bible translation 


22:20.022 --> 22:22.124
that Tyndale later wrote 
that there was 


22:22.123 --> 22:24.591
no place to do it in all England. 


22:24.592 --> 22:28.564
And so with the help of merchants 
sympathetic to his cause, 


22:28.563 --> 22:31.966
Tyndale fled to Germany 
where he could more easily work 


22:31.967 --> 22:35.104
on his English translation 
of the New Testament. 


22:35.103 --> 22:37.105
By 1525, 


22:37.105 --> 22:40.108
his translation was complete 
and ready to be printed. 


22:40.108 --> 22:43.745
The British Library in London 
holds the answer 


22:43.745 --> 22:45.747
to what happened next. 


22:45.747 --> 22:49.250
Dr. Karen Limper-Herz, 
a lead curator at the library, 


22:49.250 --> 22:51.820
is going to help us find out.


22:51.820 --> 22:54.823
So we are looking 
at a unique copy of the first edition 


22:54.823 --> 22:57.991
of Tyndale’s New Testament, 
printed in Cologne in 1525. 


22:57.992 --> 23:00.362
The Cologne Fragment 
is the only known copy 


23:00.362 --> 23:02.497
of what exists of Tyndale’s first edition 


23:02.497 --> 23:04.199
of the New Testament. 


23:04.198 --> 23:06.768
The fact that it is a fragment 
shows that it was a dangerous thing to do. 


23:06.768 --> 23:09.336
The printer had too much to drink 


23:09.337 --> 23:11.172
and mentioned that he 


23:11.172 --> 23:15.177
was printing 
this pro-Lutheran English New Testament 


23:15.177 --> 23:17.179
for somebody called William Tyndale. 


23:17.178 --> 23:19.981
The authorities found out about it, 
and the print shop was raided. 


23:19.982 --> 23:21.984
Tyndale and his partners ran


23:21.983 --> 23:23.985
—and this is all that survives today—


23:23.985 --> 23:26.053
and they went down the Rhine 
a bit further to Worms. 


23:26.053 --> 23:29.523
So the fact that they didn’t get much further 
than part way through Matthew 


23:29.523 --> 23:31.526
is quite indicative 
of how dangerous it was.


23:31.527 --> 23:35.064
The first complete copies 
of Tyndale’s translation 


23:35.063 --> 23:38.666
of the Christian Greek Scriptures 
were finally printed 


23:38.667 --> 23:41.369
in the city of Worms in Germany 


23:41.368 --> 23:43.371
in 1526. 


23:43.372 --> 23:48.000
Around 3,000 or more 
of these books were produced.


23:55.583 --> 23:57.585
After leaving Germany, 


23:57.585 --> 24:00.000
Tyndale moved to Antwerp. 


24:01.657 --> 24:04.225
This bustling city 
was ideal for Tyndale. 


24:04.225 --> 24:06.828
It had a thriving printing industry 


24:06.828 --> 24:08.930
and its busy port 


24:08.930 --> 24:12.533
made it easy for his books 
to reach readers in England. 


24:12.533 --> 24:15.536
Professor Guido Latré 
has kindly offered to show me 


24:15.537 --> 24:19.007
around the very streets that Tyndale 
would have walked himself 


24:19.007 --> 24:21.375
some 500 years ago.


24:21.375 --> 24:25.213
What he saw around him here 
were ordinary people 


24:25.213 --> 24:27.715
having access to the Bible in Dutch. 


24:27.715 --> 24:31.620
He wanted the same 
for his own folk in England. 


24:31.620 --> 24:35.690
If you wanted to smuggle Bibles 
on a large scale into England, 


24:35.690 --> 24:39.793
this was Northern Europe’s biggest seaport. 


24:39.793 --> 24:42.896
You can’t easily smuggle 


24:42.897 --> 24:45.634
a big volume and a big format. 


24:45.633 --> 24:48.970
So tiny loose leaves 


24:48.970 --> 24:50.705
that were taken to places like this


24:50.705 --> 24:52.707
—these underground cellars, 
the warehouses—


24:52.707 --> 24:54.977
and between the leaves 


24:54.977 --> 24:57.312
of larger books 
that were not forbidden, 


24:57.312 --> 25:01.149
the tiny leaves of Tyndale’s translation 
would have been hidden. 


25:01.148 --> 25:03.551
In London, 
someone would have recognized: 


25:03.552 --> 25:06.220
‘Aha! 
These are the stacks that are marked. 


25:06.220 --> 25:08.723
‘I must have a look at these 


25:08.723 --> 25:11.593
and find the loose leaves 
of Tyndale’s Bible.’ 


25:11.593 --> 25:14.930
There were about 30,000 copies 


25:14.930 --> 25:16.932
of Tyndale’s Bible available 


25:16.932 --> 25:18.099
by the end of his life. 


25:18.098 --> 25:21.301
This was a brave man 
and a big man in terms of courage 


25:21.302 --> 25:23.805
and in terms of investment of time. 


25:23.805 --> 25:27.000
And the risks he took 
are not to be underestimated.


25:28.743 --> 25:31.111
William Tyndale was imprisoned here


25:31.112 --> 25:33.949
in Vilvoorde, 
just north of Brussels. 


25:33.948 --> 25:35.850
As he languished 
in prison for over a year, 


25:35.850 --> 25:40.000
he no doubt contemplated the cruel death 
that inevitably awaited him. 


25:41.288 --> 25:45.293
Tyndale is often renowned 
for his influence on the English language, 


25:45.293 --> 25:49.596
but his work was more than 
that of just scholarly ambition. 


25:49.597 --> 25:52.834
Tyndale loved the Bible. 


25:52.833 --> 25:54.835
Maybe it can be said of him 


25:54.835 --> 25:57.872
that he shared the feelings of the psalmist 
who spoke of God’s Word 


25:57.872 --> 26:02.000
and said: 
“How I do love your law!”


26:04.445 --> 26:07.682
Despite intense opposition,


26:07.682 --> 26:11.185
the Bible and the wisdom in it 
survives to this day, 


26:11.185 --> 26:14.990
a faithful transmission 
of the original writers’ words. 


26:14.990 --> 26:19.000
No wonder so many have placed 
such value on the Bible.


26:24.565 --> 26:27.168
You’ll be happy to know 
that later this month 


26:27.168 --> 26:29.603
an extended version 
of this documentary 


26:29.603 --> 26:31.606
will be made available. 


26:31.607 --> 26:34.709
It contains 
additional examples of individuals 


26:34.708 --> 26:38.280
who risked their lives 
to spread God’s Word. 


26:38.280 --> 26:42.050
The video is called 
They Valued the Bible 


26:42.050 --> 26:44.152
and will be released 
on Video on Demand 


26:44.152 --> 26:47.155
under the heading 
“The Bible.”


26:47.155 --> 26:50.225
Knowing that Jehovah 
is personally involved 


26:50.225 --> 26:53.328
in preserving 
and making known his Word, 


26:53.328 --> 26:55.930
we can be confident 
that the Bible 


26:55.930 --> 26:59.533
is the only true means 
of drawing close to him. 


26:59.533 --> 27:01.535
As a child, 


27:01.535 --> 27:04.872
David Sibrey, from England, 
had not read the Bible. 


27:04.872 --> 27:08.877
Instead, he had been taught 
traditions of men. 


27:08.877 --> 27:12.000
What helped him see the truth?


27:14.882 --> 27:17.919
I was born in 1930. 


27:17.918 --> 27:19.920
We lived in Littlehampton, 


27:19.920 --> 27:22.157
which was a seaside town, 


27:22.157 --> 27:26.000
a very pleasant little place, 
quiet place.


27:27.062 --> 27:29.464
I would like to walk 
in the countryside. 


27:29.463 --> 27:31.766
Nature intrigued me. 


27:31.767 --> 27:34.569
My interest was in what I saw 
rather than what I read.


27:34.568 --> 27:36.470
Well, in 1939, 


27:36.470 --> 27:41.575
war broke out, and our road 
became the second line of defense. 


27:41.575 --> 27:43.945
And then, of course, 
you get the aircraft. 


27:43.945 --> 27:47.448
Well, there was a young boy 
(younger than myself), 


27:47.448 --> 27:51.451
and one Sunday morning 
an air raid took place, 


27:51.452 --> 27:53.622
and the house 
where he was living 


27:53.622 --> 27:55.624
was destroyed, 
and he was killed.


27:55.623 --> 27:58.426
But I remember 
saying to my mother, 


27:58.427 --> 28:01.062
“Why did he have to die?” 


28:01.062 --> 28:03.264
And her answer was: 


28:03.263 --> 28:05.266
“Well, he’s in a better place. 


28:05.267 --> 28:07.269
He’s with God in heaven,” 


28:07.268 --> 28:10.205
which didn’t quite 
add up to me. 


28:10.205 --> 28:12.440
I couldn’t understand 
how God 


28:12.440 --> 28:15.077
could be responsible 
for his death, 


28:15.077 --> 28:17.845
which meant 
He was responsible for war. 


28:17.845 --> 28:22.850
So it was—
The whole thing was depressing; 


28:22.850 --> 28:24.985
perhaps put it that way.


28:24.985 --> 28:27.888
As far as religion was concerned, 


28:27.888 --> 28:29.890
I accepted it was there, 


28:29.890 --> 28:32.000
but I couldn’t understand 
how it fit in with what was going on. 


28:33.462 --> 28:35.497
There was a gap somewhere, 


28:35.497 --> 28:37.632
and I couldn’t, I couldn’t, plug it. 


28:37.632 --> 28:39.634
Every time you went to church, 


28:39.633 --> 28:41.936
you had a hymnbook 
and a prayer book, 


28:41.937 --> 28:44.472
but a Bible was something 
you had personally. 


28:44.472 --> 28:47.009
And the only time 
I ever opened it 


28:47.008 --> 28:51.645
was when I began to study 
with Jehovah’s Witnesses.


28:51.645 --> 28:55.250
I was 17 or 18 years of age 
when I started. 


28:55.250 --> 28:59.820
A brother named Joe Gladwin 
called upon me. 


28:59.820 --> 29:01.823
I knew nothing about the Bible. 


29:01.823 --> 29:03.858
The fact that he said it, 
fair enough. 


29:03.858 --> 29:06.060
He said it was in the Bible, OK. 


29:06.060 --> 29:08.062
But what do other people say? 


29:08.062 --> 29:10.832
I decided to look for myself. 


29:10.832 --> 29:15.337
I realized that what Joe 
was telling me was right. 


29:15.337 --> 29:17.572
He showed me 
that the Bible was true.


29:17.572 --> 29:20.575
I began to see that the Bible 


29:20.575 --> 29:22.677
told me things 
that I had never known. 


29:22.677 --> 29:24.745
Over the years, 
I’ve been privileged 


29:24.745 --> 29:28.015
to collect so many 
different translations of the Bible. 


29:28.015 --> 29:30.017
Reading through the different translations, 


29:30.017 --> 29:33.889
it’s clear that God’s Word never changes.


29:33.888 --> 29:38.626
I got baptized 
at the age of 20 in 1950. 


29:38.627 --> 29:41.897
Over the years, 
I’ve served first of all as a pioneer. 


29:41.897 --> 29:43.899
From then I came to Bethel. 


29:43.898 --> 29:48.268
Moving from Bethel 
to the circuit and district work, 


29:48.268 --> 29:52.640
and then finally, 
coming back to Bethel for the Writing Desk.


29:52.640 --> 29:54.808
The assignments I’ve had 


29:54.808 --> 29:58.378
have strengthened my conviction 
not only that Jehovah 


29:58.378 --> 30:02.483
is giving direction and his spirit 
can enable us to do 


30:02.483 --> 30:05.253
whatever he wants us to do 


30:05.253 --> 30:07.921
but that the organization has grown and, 


30:07.922 --> 30:11.459
with the development 
of the Governing Body’s direction, 


30:11.458 --> 30:14.828
is an organization 
which is second to none. 


30:14.828 --> 30:19.666
And, therefore, 
staying with it is the logical thing to do.


30:19.667 --> 30:23.304
In my life, 
I looked in many places 


30:23.303 --> 30:25.606
for answers 
to life’s questions, 


30:25.607 --> 30:29.577
but only the Bible 
has provided answers. 


30:29.577 --> 30:34.000
I am so thankful 
that Jehovah continues to teach us.


30:37.752 --> 30:41.689
Brother Sibrey’s appreciation 
for the Bible is heartwarming. 


30:41.688 --> 30:45.058
Do you remember how 
we can personally demonstrate 


30:45.058 --> 30:47.795
our appreciation 
for the Word of God? 


30:47.795 --> 30:51.732
By reading, 
studying, and meditating 


30:51.732 --> 30:53.969
on the deep thoughts 
that it contains 


30:53.968 --> 30:56.336
and then by applying 


30:56.337 --> 30:58.874
those inspired teachings 
in our lives. 


30:58.873 --> 31:01.141
When we do that, 


31:01.142 --> 31:04.545
we allow the holy spirit 
to affect our inner being, 


31:04.545 --> 31:08.817
to shape our desires 
and objectives in life.


31:08.817 --> 31:12.654
However, what if someone 
has harbored resentment 


31:12.653 --> 31:15.121
against his fellow man 
for years, 


31:15.122 --> 31:18.560
perhaps to the point 
of wanting to kill that person? 


31:18.560 --> 31:23.063
What can God’s Word do 
in such a serious circumstance?


31:23.063 --> 31:28.101
Remember the words 
of Hebrews 4:12: 


31:28.102 --> 31:32.974
“For the word of God 
is alive and exerts power 


31:32.973 --> 31:37.611
. . . and is able to discern 
thoughts and intentions of the heart.”


31:37.612 --> 31:40.815
Yes, Jehovah 
has preserved the Bible


31:40.815 --> 31:44.000
so that we can benefit 
from the power of his Word. 


31:45.720 --> 31:49.223
Vladimir Olkhov 
and Valery Zaporozhsky,  


31:49.223 --> 31:52.760
who are from Russia, 
were the fiercest of enemies, 


31:52.760 --> 31:57.000
yet they experienced 
that power firsthand.


32:05.307 --> 32:08.000
I was the ringleader of a criminal gang. 


32:10.010 --> 32:13.147
We extorted money,
put people out of business, 


32:13.147 --> 32:16.000
threatened them, 
dragged them away.


32:22.190 --> 32:24.658
And they would hand over everything. 


32:24.658 --> 32:28.000
People were afraid of me, 
and I liked it that way. 


32:30.263 --> 32:32.366
I never forgave anybody. 


32:32.367 --> 32:34.402
If someone wronged me, 


32:34.402 --> 32:37.839
I would say: 
“Throw one stone at me! 


32:37.838 --> 32:41.000
I’ll bury you in a mountain of rocks!”


32:44.112 --> 32:47.082
In 1993, 
I was working for the police. 


32:47.082 --> 32:49.017
They assigned me to gather information 


32:49.017 --> 32:53.000
about a gang 
whose leader was Vladimir Olkhov.


32:55.590 --> 32:59.000
One time, when committing a crime, 
they caught me at the scene.


33:06.733 --> 33:10.000
I swore revenge on everybody involved 
with my arrest.


33:13.440 --> 33:15.477
During interrogations,
I did everything 


33:15.477 --> 33:18.000
to humiliate Vladimir 
and tried to break him.


33:24.885 --> 33:26.000
We just hated each other!


33:28.222 --> 33:30.792
I told Valery,
“Just remember: 


33:30.792 --> 33:33.962
“Sooner or later 
I’m getting out of prison 


33:33.962 --> 33:36.497
and then you’re a dead man!” 


33:36.497 --> 33:39.100
I thought to myself:
‘For a start, 


33:39.100 --> 33:41.102
‘I’m going to blow up his car. 


33:41.102 --> 33:45.000
If he doesn’t understand, 
then I’ll just eliminate him.’


33:47.442 --> 33:51.145
His threats sounded so serious 
that I started to fear for my life. 


33:51.145 --> 33:53.948
I decided to have my friends 
and acquaintances 


33:53.948 --> 33:56.750
make his life behind bars unbearable 


33:56.750 --> 34:00.000
and to make sure 
that he would never get out.


34:04.925 --> 34:08.028
I saw that one of my cell mates 
had a pocket New Testament. 


34:08.028 --> 34:10.096
I asked him if I could read it. 


34:10.097 --> 34:13.367
Seeing my interest in spiritual things, 


34:13.367 --> 34:16.000
someone gave me a Watchtower magazine. 


34:17.105 --> 34:19.107
When I started reading the magazine, 


34:19.107 --> 34:22.377
I realized that there are 
other people out there—real people. 


34:22.377 --> 34:25.547
There’s a totally different way 
of life to be had, even now, 


34:25.547 --> 34:27.982
and with such prospects. 


34:27.982 --> 34:30.284
I was just stunned. 


34:30.283 --> 34:33.686
Then I found another five magazines 
around the prison. 


34:33.687 --> 34:35.690
I devoured them as well. 


34:35.690 --> 34:40.000
And I became thoroughly convinced 
that I had found the truth.


34:41.395 --> 34:43.898
When my wife was first allowed to visit me, 


34:43.898 --> 34:47.000
I told her right away,
“I’ve found the truth!” 


34:48.668 --> 34:53.740
My wife made pretty fast progress
and was baptized two years later. 


34:53.740 --> 34:55.810
Her support was invaluable. 


34:55.810 --> 34:59.180
She would visit me, 
constantly encouraging me 


34:59.180 --> 35:02.000
to be faithful 
and remain loyal to God.


35:04.052 --> 35:07.000
In 1993, 
Jehovah’s Witnesses visited me. 


35:08.188 --> 35:13.000
I agreed to a Bible study, 
but the truth didn’t touch my heart. 


35:14.195 --> 35:17.498
One time, Jehovah’s Witnesses 
invited me to a gathering, 


35:17.498 --> 35:20.166
and there they told me that Vladimir Olkhov


35:20.167 --> 35:21.735
—that criminal—


35:21.735 --> 35:25.405
was about to get baptized 
and become one of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 


35:25.405 --> 35:28.877
I was cut to the heart! 


35:28.877 --> 35:31.545
When I got home, 
I burst into tears. 


35:31.545 --> 35:34.448
I realized that I had to make 
spiritual progress. 


35:34.448 --> 35:37.451
Because if he, 
in his circumstances, 


35:37.452 --> 35:39.454
could do it, then I could do it. 


35:39.453 --> 35:44.125
That very moment,
I prayed for the first time in my life.


35:44.125 --> 35:47.595
I was released in October of 1997. 


35:47.595 --> 35:51.432
After I was released, 
the brothers organized a gathering.


35:51.432 --> 35:54.902
They invited me to this gathering. 


35:54.902 --> 35:57.605
I remember 
that as I was approaching the place, 


35:57.605 --> 36:02.310
I suddenly realized this is where 
I once conducted a search!


36:02.310 --> 36:05.000
And then Valery walked into the room. 


36:06.113 --> 36:09.000
We just hugged each other
and burst into tears.


36:12.920 --> 36:15.488
And I saw in his eyes 
a completely different look, 


36:15.488 --> 36:18.591
not like before
—it was a kind look. 


36:18.592 --> 36:20.662
It brought tears to my eyes. 


36:20.662 --> 36:23.464
It was like a big weight 
was lifted from my chest. 


36:23.463 --> 36:24.831
‘My brother!’ 


36:24.832 --> 36:27.000
We begged one another for forgiveness.


36:29.603 --> 36:33.273
On the 23rd of November 1997, 


36:33.273 --> 36:37.478
I was baptized together in the same pool 


36:37.478 --> 36:41.000
as my new friend Valery.


36:42.850 --> 36:45.820
We really became the best of friends. 


36:45.820 --> 36:49.290
And now we serve as elders 
in the same congregation.


36:49.290 --> 36:51.458
My wife and I often talk about


36:51.458 --> 36:53.460
what would have happened to us 


36:53.460 --> 36:55.663
if we had not started to study the Bible. 


36:55.663 --> 36:58.933
Probably we wouldn’t even be alive now. 


36:58.933 --> 37:01.301
We’ve kept our family together. 


37:01.302 --> 37:04.005
Even better, 
we now have a spiritual family 


37:04.005 --> 37:06.007
in the Christian congregation. 


37:06.007 --> 37:09.710
And my former enemy 
is now my brother and best friend. 


37:09.710 --> 37:11.845
More importantly, we’ve developed 


37:11.845 --> 37:14.000
a close relationship with Jehovah.


37:16.517 --> 37:18.519
Only God is able to change the thinking 


37:18.518 --> 37:21.000
of such bitter enemies as Vlad and I were. 


37:23.457 --> 37:25.459
And I eagerly look forward to the day


37:25.458 --> 37:27.461
when everything that divides people 


37:27.462 --> 37:30.000
will be gone forever.


37:38.072 --> 37:40.474
Do you see 
one reason why Jehovah 


37:40.473 --> 37:43.910
did not allow his Word 
to be obliterated? 


37:43.910 --> 37:47.315
He knew the benefits 
you and I would reap 


37:47.315 --> 37:49.850
from having access to the Bible. 


37:49.850 --> 37:53.187
Its message is so powerful, 


37:53.187 --> 37:55.824
it could help Vladimir and Valery 


37:55.823 --> 37:59.000
to change their lives 
and even become close friends.


38:00.928 --> 38:05.565
While very few of us have taken part 
in the translation of the Bible, 


38:05.565 --> 38:08.802
all of us can share it with our neighbors 


38:08.802 --> 38:12.407
and help them to gain 
accurate knowledge of Jehovah. 


38:12.407 --> 38:14.875
In the following dramatization, 


38:14.875 --> 38:19.247
note some of the theocratic activities 
that this family enjoys 


38:19.247 --> 38:24.000
and what they had to do 
to become so zealous.


38:54.548 --> 38:56.483
OK, OK. 


38:56.483 --> 38:59.986
We already know 
how this story is going to end. 


38:59.987 --> 39:02.000
No real surprises there.


39:06.693 --> 39:08.861
So the real question is, 


39:08.862 --> 39:11.000
How did we get here?


39:14.435 --> 39:16.470
For the record, 


39:16.470 --> 39:19.000
I never thought our ministry 
really needed help.


39:24.312 --> 39:28.749
My wife and daughter 
were both regular pioneers. 


39:28.748 --> 39:32.000
My son was a solid publisher.


39:34.288 --> 39:37.458
And while my schedule 
didn’t let me pioneer yet, 


39:37.458 --> 39:41.000
I was trying to do 
all I could to support them.


39:44.798 --> 39:47.535
I always assumed 


39:47.535 --> 39:50.838
the best support I could provide 
was just being out with them 


39:50.838 --> 39:53.000
as much as possible, 


39:54.808 --> 39:58.000
but I quickly realized more was needed.


40:01.148 --> 40:03.150
Our Field Service Group Overseer 


40:03.150 --> 40:05.953
had been making a real effort 


40:05.953 --> 40:09.656
to work in the ministry with us 
regularly the last few weeks, 


40:09.657 --> 40:11.659
and he kindly mentioned 


40:11.658 --> 40:14.000
he’d noticed a few challenges.


40:15.128 --> 40:17.396
While our service time was great, 


40:17.397 --> 40:22.970
he pointed out that our return visits 
were slowly dwindling.


40:22.970 --> 40:26.073
And other than the studies 
I had with the children, 


40:26.073 --> 40:29.676
no one in the family 
was conducting a Bible study.


40:29.677 --> 40:32.780
I asked him 
what we could do to try 


40:32.780 --> 40:36.000
and improve 
the quality of our ministry. 


40:38.118 --> 40:43.323
He showed me Romans 15:19, 
highlighting Paul’s words: 


40:43.323 --> 40:48.228
“I have thoroughly preached 
the good news about the Christ.”


40:48.228 --> 40:52.198
He suggested 
on our next Family Worship night 


40:52.198 --> 40:57.000
studying Paul’s ministry and seeing 
what we could learn from his example.


41:10.750 --> 41:14.855
As we looked at Paul’s ministry, 
we realized 


41:14.855 --> 41:17.000
to be more productive 
we needed boldness.


41:19.092 --> 41:22.395
Ephesians 6:19 says: 


41:22.395 --> 41:24.332
“Pray also for me, 


41:24.332 --> 41:27.802
“that the words may be given to me 
when I open my mouth, 


41:27.802 --> 41:30.905
“so that I may be able to speak boldly 


41:30.905 --> 41:34.000
in making known 
the sacred secret of the good news.”


41:39.813 --> 41:42.650
Rina also noticed how Paul 


41:42.650 --> 41:45.000
reasoned persuasively with people.


41:52.527 --> 41:57.000
And Keiko liked how he found 
common ground with those he talked to


41:58.698 --> 42:02.970
—even referring to a pagan altar 
to an unknown god 


42:02.970 --> 42:07.440
as a way to direct 
the conversation to Jehovah.


42:07.440 --> 42:12.145
Finally, Haruto noted how 2 Timothy said 


42:12.145 --> 42:15.815
Paul was 
“a workman with nothing to be ashamed of,


42:15.815 --> 42:18.918
handling the word of the truth aright.” 


42:18.918 --> 42:23.000
So he was skilled in using the Scriptures 
with those he witnessed to.


42:29.697 --> 42:32.365
See, I told you. 


42:32.365 --> 42:36.000
You already knew 
how this was going to end.


42:39.340 --> 42:44.000
I started auxiliary pioneering.


42:52.853 --> 42:56.156
We now have a number of return visits 


42:56.157 --> 43:00.000
and a few progressive Bible studies.


43:03.863 --> 43:06.033
But how did we get here? 


43:06.033 --> 43:09.235
We learned from the example of Paul 


43:09.235 --> 43:13.000
and how he 
“thoroughly preached the good news.”


43:20.547 --> 43:23.084
The group overseer 
could’ve simply listed 


43:23.083 --> 43:26.553
what changes were needed 
to improve the family’s ministry. 


43:26.553 --> 43:29.623
Instead, 
he directed the father 


43:29.623 --> 43:32.760
to a specific principle 
found in the Scriptures. 


43:32.760 --> 43:36.130
After all, 
it is only God’s Word 


43:36.130 --> 43:39.733
that “is inspired . . . for teaching.”


43:39.733 --> 43:42.268
Bible translations 
in common languages 


43:42.268 --> 43:45.538
started to spread 
across Europe in the 1500’s, 


43:45.538 --> 43:47.540
but it took much longer 


43:47.540 --> 43:50.510
for more remote places 
to receive the Bible.


43:50.510 --> 43:53.580
It was in 1766 


43:53.580 --> 43:57.017
that the complete Greek Scriptures, 
or New Testament, 


43:57.017 --> 43:59.754
was first published in Greenlandic


43:59.753 --> 44:04.256
—a language spoken today 
by about 50,000 people. 


44:04.257 --> 44:06.560
In August of last year, 


44:06.560 --> 44:10.630
I had the privilege of serving 
a regional convention in Greenland, 


44:10.630 --> 44:13.900
which is overseen 
by the Scandinavia branch. 


44:13.900 --> 44:17.637
Greenland is the neighbor 
to the north of Newfoundland, 


44:17.637 --> 44:19.974
where I pioneered for 11 years. 


44:19.973 --> 44:24.911
So it was a wonderful experience 
to go there and meet our brothers. 


44:24.912 --> 44:29.717
Some 400 brothers and sisters 
traveled at their own expense 


44:29.717 --> 44:34.355
from all over Scandinavia to support 
the convention in Greenland. 


44:34.355 --> 44:39.058
Although Greenland is a land 
covered by large ice caps, 


44:39.058 --> 44:45.000
there are many warm hearts 
yearning for the truth.


44:54.073 --> 44:56.643
I think that Jesus had Greenland in mind 


44:56.643 --> 45:01.781
when he spoke about preaching 
to the most distant part of the earth. 


45:01.782 --> 45:03.884
My name is Arne Mattsson. 


45:03.883 --> 45:08.000
My wife, Karin, and I have lived 
in Greenland for more than 34 years. 


45:09.022 --> 45:12.525
We have traveled all over the country 
preaching about God’s Kingdom, 


45:12.525 --> 45:15.895
and we have had 
some fantastic experiences.


45:15.895 --> 45:20.433
In the 1950’s, two young special pioneers
 came to Greenland 


45:20.433 --> 45:22.668
as the first publishers. 


45:22.668 --> 45:25.405
They traveled by boat 
from town to town 


45:25.405 --> 45:28.475
carrying just tents 
and simple equipment. 


45:28.475 --> 45:31.010
They had to endure 
the cold weather, 


45:31.010 --> 45:33.580
face resistance 
from the local ministers, 


45:33.580 --> 45:37.483
and even fight with sledge dogs 
that took their food. 


45:37.483 --> 45:39.986
But they laid the groundwork 
for the great effort 


45:39.987 --> 45:43.590
that has been made 
to preach to all in this country.


45:43.590 --> 45:46.527
In the 1960’s and ’70’s, 


45:46.527 --> 45:49.095
many families 
moved here from Denmark 


45:49.095 --> 45:51.165
to help with the preaching work. 


45:51.165 --> 45:54.468
I remember how I, 
as a teenager in 1971, 


45:54.468 --> 45:57.838
moved from Denmark 
to Greenland with my family. 


45:57.838 --> 46:01.040
It was not easy 
to learn the language, 


46:01.040 --> 46:03.910
but the brothers and sisters 
from Denmark did their best, 


46:03.910 --> 46:06.000
and it had a good effect 
on the territory.


46:07.782 --> 46:12.887
In 1973, The Watchtower began 
to be published in Greenlandic. 


46:12.887 --> 46:14.889
Just to pronounce the name, 


46:14.888 --> 46:18.291
Napassuliak’ Alapernaerssuivfik, 
was a challenge. 


46:18.292 --> 46:23.000
But it has been a popular magazine 
in Greenland ever since. 


46:24.532 --> 46:26.567
Once, we met a couple 


46:26.567 --> 46:29.904
who for many years 
had received copies of The Watchtower 


46:29.903 --> 46:32.171
when publishers visited their settlement. 


46:32.172 --> 46:36.000
They told us that they often felt depressed 
when they woke up in the morning, 


46:38.112 --> 46:40.214
but when they read the magazine, 
they felt better. 


46:40.213 --> 46:44.000
And they would read 
the same copies over and over again.


46:51.023 --> 46:54.160
When the temperature drops 
and the snow falls, 


46:54.160 --> 46:56.163
the landscape gets covered 


46:56.163 --> 46:58.831
by a beautiful white blanket for half a year, 


46:58.832 --> 47:02.837
so the publishers 
make good use of the summer. 


47:02.837 --> 47:05.705
Some towns and settlements 


47:05.705 --> 47:08.008
only seldom receive a witness. 


47:08.008 --> 47:12.378
There are no roads between the towns, 
but we reach isolated areas by boat. 


47:12.378 --> 47:14.380
When someone shows interest 
in our message, 


47:14.380 --> 47:18.000
the contact 
is maintained by phone. 


47:19.285 --> 47:22.355
Many have great respect for the Bible, 


47:22.355 --> 47:27.293
and so My Book of Bible Stories 
has found its way into many, many homes.


47:27.293 --> 47:31.598
Over a period of 24 years, 
Karin and I have sailed so much 


47:31.598 --> 47:34.466
that it equals a trip 
twice around the globe. 


47:34.467 --> 47:36.970
This has cost a lot of effort and money, 


47:36.970 --> 47:39.238
but with Jehovah’s blessing, 


47:39.238 --> 47:42.508
we have been able 
to continue year after year 


47:42.508 --> 47:45.000
preaching to the distant parts 
of Greenland. 


47:51.050 --> 47:55.122
The preaching work here 
is a great experience. 


47:55.122 --> 47:57.424
People are attentive and kind. 


47:57.423 --> 47:59.726
But it took a long time 
before the first native Greenlander 


47:59.727 --> 48:01.729
was baptized


48:01.728 --> 48:05.000
—actually 18 years of zealous preaching. 


48:07.100 --> 48:10.570
Today, there are 
more than 150 publishers 


48:10.570 --> 48:12.638
in 5 congregations. 


48:12.638 --> 48:14.641
Jehovah has really blessed 


48:14.642 --> 48:19.000
the work that has been done here 
for more than 60 years.


48:28.055 --> 48:30.890
In August 2016, 


48:30.890 --> 48:34.493
a very special convention 
was held in the capital of Nuuk. 


48:34.493 --> 48:37.965
Brothers and sisters 
from all over Scandinavia 


48:37.965 --> 48:41.000
traveled all the way 
to attend the convention. 


48:44.605 --> 48:46.607
We were very encouraged 


48:46.607 --> 48:48.775
by the visit of a member 
of the Governing Body, 


48:48.775 --> 48:50.777
Brother Mark Sanderson, 


48:50.777 --> 48:53.000
who gave us 
some faith-strengthening talks.


48:56.650 --> 48:59.385
I think it’s a great privilege 


48:59.385 --> 49:01.488
to be able to understand the truth. 


49:01.488 --> 49:04.490
It’s amazing that Jehovah 
gave his attention 


49:04.490 --> 49:07.000
to an insignificant human like me.


49:10.530 --> 49:12.532
When I started to follow 


49:12.532 --> 49:16.002
the Bible’s unique teachings 
and principles, 


49:16.002 --> 49:18.205
I clearly understood 


49:18.205 --> 49:21.808
how it would benefit my own life.


49:21.808 --> 49:25.878
After this convention, 
even though we live in small towns 


49:25.878 --> 49:29.081
far away 
from the rest of the world, 


49:29.082 --> 49:33.000
we feel closer than ever before 
to the worldwide brotherhood.


49:39.592 --> 49:44.030
The peak attendance 
at the convention was 614


49:44.030 --> 49:46.567
—the largest ever in Greenland. 


49:46.567 --> 49:49.169
Our brothers 
from other parts of Scandinavia 


49:49.168 --> 49:51.705
who attended 
the convention also took part


49:51.705 --> 49:54.240
in a campaign 
inviting interested ones. 


49:54.240 --> 49:56.510
In only two hours, 


49:56.510 --> 49:59.412
the whole capital city of Nuuk 
was covered. 


49:59.412 --> 50:02.082
It was a wonderful witness!


50:02.082 --> 50:04.150
And speaking of witnessing 


50:04.150 --> 50:06.152
in “the most distant part 
of the earth,” 


50:06.152 --> 50:07.787
you’ll be happy to know 


50:07.787 --> 50:10.657
that Brother Geoffrey Jackson 
of the Governing Body 


50:10.657 --> 50:13.260
recently explained 
in a morning worship 


50:13.260 --> 50:16.997
how the Bible was translated 
into numerous languages 


50:16.997 --> 50:18.999
in the 19th century. 


50:18.998 --> 50:22.935
That segment is now available 
on Video on Demand. 


50:22.935 --> 50:27.073
It is entitled 
Reaching “the Most Distant Part.”


50:27.073 --> 50:29.341
And later this month, 


50:29.342 --> 50:33.012
a beautiful segment 
from the 2011 annual meeting 


50:33.012 --> 50:35.115
will be posted 
for your enjoyment. 


50:35.115 --> 50:37.117
It is an interview 


50:37.117 --> 50:40.654
with five widows 
of Governing Body members. 


50:40.653 --> 50:43.956
The sisters relate 
how they learned the truth 


50:43.957 --> 50:47.260
and share treasured memories 
from their many years 


50:47.260 --> 50:49.095
of faithful service. 


50:49.095 --> 50:50.563
This segment is entitled 


50:50.563 --> 50:55.535
Interview With Faithful Sisters
—Widows of Governing Body Members 


50:55.535 --> 50:57.170
and will be available 


50:57.170 --> 51:02.708
on Video on Demand under the 
“Interviews and Experiences” category.


51:02.708 --> 51:05.711
Do you agree that Jehovah gave us 


51:05.712 --> 51:08.882
an outstanding gift in his Word? 


51:08.882 --> 51:11.317
He not only gave us the gift 


51:11.317 --> 51:15.222
but also made sure time and time again 


51:15.222 --> 51:19.525
that it was preserved for our benefit.


51:19.525 --> 51:21.895
Individuals we met earlier in the program, 


51:21.895 --> 51:24.497
such as Brothers David Sibrey, 


51:24.497 --> 51:28.735
Vladimir Olkhov, 
and Valery Zaporozhsky, 


51:28.735 --> 51:31.572
have all seen 
the effects of the power  


51:31.572 --> 51:33.874
that God’s Word exerts 


51:33.873 --> 51:36.910
and the guidance it provides. 


51:36.910 --> 51:39.045
We also saw that the Bible 


51:39.045 --> 51:41.080
is “beneficial for teaching” 


51:41.080 --> 51:43.150
and “for setting things straight,” 


51:43.150 --> 51:47.087
as we watched a family 
learn how to improve their ministry 


51:47.087 --> 51:50.924
by following the example 
of the apostle Paul. 


51:50.923 --> 51:53.860
Yes, God’s Word has endured 


51:53.860 --> 51:57.630
and will continue to endure forever.


51:57.630 --> 52:00.267
As you know, 


52:00.267 --> 52:02.869
on April 3, 2017, 


52:02.868 --> 52:06.438
our museums in Warwick 
will open to the public. 


52:06.438 --> 52:09.441
In addition 
to our enlarged gallery entitled 


52:09.442 --> 52:12.445
“The Bible and the Divine Name,” 


52:12.445 --> 52:15.915
we will also have 
a new gallery on the theme 


52:15.915 --> 52:18.918
“The Word of God Endures Forever.” 


52:18.918 --> 52:21.921
Please come and visit. 


52:21.922 --> 52:26.392
You’ll be happy to see 
a wonderful collection of Bibles 


52:26.392 --> 52:30.497
that illustrates the points 
we have discussed in this broadcast.


52:30.497 --> 52:33.934
The psalmist was inspired to write: 


52:33.933 --> 52:37.170
“How I do love your law!” 


52:37.170 --> 52:39.172
And we agree. 


52:39.172 --> 52:43.210
We love Jehovah 
and we love the Bible 


52:43.210 --> 52:46.245
and so have millions 
throughout the centuries, 


52:46.245 --> 52:50.850
including those who were used 
by Jehovah to preserve his Word. 


52:50.850 --> 52:53.018
With these thoughts in mind, 


52:53.018 --> 52:56.823
let’s enjoy 
this month’s music video entitled 


52:56.823 --> 53:00.000
Your Word Endures Forever.


53:20.180 --> 53:29.923
They looked up at the stars
With godly fear in their hearts.


53:29.923 --> 53:40.566
They thanked their God up above
For revealing to them His love.


53:40.567 --> 53:50.077
So You gave them your name,
A Kingdom hope to proclaim.


53:50.077 --> 54:00.120
They’re words preserved for our day.
They’re faithful words to show us the way.


54:00.120 --> 54:10.763
They loved you from their heart,
And they were proud to play their part—


54:10.763 --> 54:21.306
Approved by you to preserve your Word,
Wrote it down so you would be heard.


54:21.307 --> 54:31.550
Your Word endures forever,
And your sayings are, oh, so deep.


54:31.550 --> 54:36.657
The good news you declare 
is a breath of fresh air,


54:36.657 --> 54:42.000
And your sayings I just want to keep.


54:44.030 --> 54:54.340
Oh, whatever Your enemies tried,
They could not silence You.


54:54.340 --> 55:04.317
Your loyal ones who loved your Word
Kept their faith, integrity too.


55:04.317 --> 55:14.427
And when they tried to ban their Bibles,
They were prepared to give their lives.


55:14.427 --> 55:20.167
For so strong was their faith 
and the witness they gave,


55:20.167 --> 55:24.904
Not one of your words was erased.


55:24.903 --> 55:34.880
And so your Word endures forever,
And your sayings are, oh, so deep.


55:34.880 --> 55:40.453
The good news you declare 
is a breath of fresh air,


55:40.453 --> 55:45.458
And your sayings I just want to keep.


55:45.458 --> 55:55.601
And you told us your name is Jehovah.
In your Word it’s plain to see.


55:55.602 --> 56:01.140
So your name will endure,
All your words will come true,


56:01.140 --> 56:08.147
And we’ll praise you all of our days.


56:08.147 --> 56:18.692
So your Word endures forever,
And your sayings are, oh, so deep.


56:18.692 --> 56:23.830
The good news you declare 
is a breath of fresh air,


56:23.830 --> 56:30.970
And your sayings I just want to keep,


56:30.970 --> 56:37.000
All of my days.


56:45.852 --> 56:48.120
A beautiful song, indeed!


56:48.120 --> 56:50.190
We would like to conclude 


56:50.190 --> 56:52.192
this program 
by sharing these greetings 


56:52.192 --> 56:55.060
from our brothers and sisters in Mali. 


56:55.060 --> 56:57.963
Mali is located in western Africa, 


56:57.963 --> 57:00.133
reaching well into the Sahara Desert. 


57:00.133 --> 57:03.903
The northern part of the country 
is hot and covered with sand, 


57:03.903 --> 57:07.340
but the southern region, 
which is watered by the Niger River, 


57:07.340 --> 57:11.510
is green with forests and vegetation.


57:11.510 --> 57:15.215
The Witnesses in the country 
have a huge task, 


57:15.215 --> 57:18.417
as the ratio 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses to population 


57:18.417 --> 57:23.155
is about one publisher 
to 59,000 residents. 


57:23.155 --> 57:26.358
Also, the distances are tremendous. 


57:26.358 --> 57:28.995
The approximately 300 publishers 


57:28.995 --> 57:30.997
cover an area more than twice 


57:30.997 --> 57:33.734
the size of the country of France.


57:33.733 --> 57:37.270
Mali is one of the hottest countries 
in the world, 


57:37.270 --> 57:39.438
so some groups and congregations 


57:39.438 --> 57:41.440
hold their meetings outdoors 


57:41.440 --> 57:43.610
under the cool shade of a tree.


57:43.610 --> 57:47.313
Although the official language 
of the country is French, 


57:47.313 --> 57:49.681
most people better understand 


57:49.682 --> 57:52.052
the local language Bambara. 


57:52.052 --> 57:56.622
Thus, most meetings are either 
held or interpreted in Bambara. 


57:56.622 --> 58:00.394
Recently, language classes 
were held in Bomu, 


58:00.393 --> 58:03.730
which is another local language.


58:03.730 --> 58:06.498
Also, the seven publishers 
of the American Sign Language group 


58:06.498 --> 58:08.501
have been assigned to witness 


58:08.502 --> 58:12.505
to the more than 
350,000 people in Mali 


58:12.505 --> 58:14.873
who have 
a hearing impairment.


58:14.873 --> 58:17.910
Last year, the total attendance 
for the Memorial 


58:17.910 --> 58:21.113
was over 1,100 people. 


58:21.113 --> 58:23.348
One man who received an invitation 


58:23.348 --> 58:25.685
walked three kilometers, 


58:25.685 --> 58:28.120
or almost two miles, 
to attend the Memorial 


58:28.120 --> 58:31.723
despite having 
a physical challenge with his foot. 


58:31.723 --> 58:34.126
He is now regular at the meetings 


58:34.127 --> 58:36.829
and is making good progress.


58:36.828 --> 58:40.633
Recently, a new Kingdom Hall 
was built in the capital city. 


58:40.633 --> 58:43.068
Municipal and state authorities, 


58:43.068 --> 58:45.438
neighbors, and many passersby 


58:45.438 --> 58:47.906
have been amazed 
at what they have seen, 


58:47.907 --> 58:50.844
and they have praised 
the brothers working on the project.


58:50.843 --> 58:55.248
Our brothers and sisters 
in Mali send us their love. 


58:55.248 --> 58:59.018
We love them, 
and we love all of you. 


58:59.018 --> 59:01.620
This is JW Broadcasting 


59:01.620 --> 59:11.682
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
