00:00.883 --> 00:05.821
For a few moments, 
I would like to speak to you on the theme 


00:05.822 --> 00:10.827
“We Continually Remember 
Your Endurance.” 


00:10.827 --> 00:13.564
What is endurance? 


00:13.563 --> 00:15.631
The original language word 


00:15.632 --> 00:17.634
in the Greek Scriptures 


00:17.633 --> 00:20.903
has the sense 
of standing one’s ground 


00:20.903 --> 00:22.905
and persevering, 


00:22.905 --> 00:26.575
remaining steadfast under trial. 


00:26.575 --> 00:30.980
But it means even more 
than just toughing it out 


00:30.980 --> 00:33.517
under a difficult circumstance. 


00:33.517 --> 00:38.320
The Christian who endures 
has genuine hope. 


00:38.320 --> 00:40.657
He or she is convinced 


00:40.657 --> 00:45.162
that as 2 Corinthians 4:17 puts it, 


00:45.162 --> 00:50.100
“the tribulation 
is momentary and light” 


00:50.100 --> 00:55.072
compared with the reward, 
which is everlasting.


00:55.072 --> 00:58.542
To illustrate 
the importance of endurance, 


00:58.542 --> 01:02.545
you see before me 
a number of suitcases


01:02.545 --> 01:05.915
—some are small, 
some are large. 


01:05.915 --> 01:10.387
What we don’t know 
is how heavy each one is. 


01:10.387 --> 01:13.590
That depends on what’s inside. 


01:13.590 --> 01:18.462
Some large suitcases 
can be surprisingly light. 


01:18.462 --> 01:24.900
Some smaller ones 
could be surprisingly heavy. 


01:24.900 --> 01:27.837
In a sense, this illustrates 


01:27.837 --> 01:29.839
what confronts each one of us 


01:29.838 --> 01:32.575
when we dedicate our life to Jehovah 


01:32.575 --> 01:35.645
and start out on the race for life. 


01:35.645 --> 01:38.582
At first, we may not know 


01:38.582 --> 01:40.917
what loads we’ll have to carry. 


01:40.917 --> 01:42.919
We may worry 


01:42.918 --> 01:45.655
about what 
might seem to be big tests, 


01:45.655 --> 01:48.725
only to find 
that they’re not as overwhelming 


01:48.725 --> 01:50.993
as we feared they would be. 


01:50.993 --> 01:52.995
On the other hand, 


01:52.995 --> 01:55.798
some loads that we thought 
would be light, 


01:55.798 --> 01:59.201
perhaps getting along 
with one another in love, 


01:59.202 --> 02:03.607
might be heavier to carry 
than we anticipated. 


02:03.607 --> 02:07.000
Then there are unexpected tests 
of our faith 


02:08.310 --> 02:10.980
—tests that could involve health problems, 


02:10.980 --> 02:13.182
financial anxieties, 


02:13.182 --> 02:16.987
family issues, 
and personal disappointments. 


02:16.987 --> 02:21.000
All such situations 
call for endurance.


02:22.792 --> 02:26.930
The Governing Body wants 
you dear brothers and sisters to know 


02:26.930 --> 02:31.600
that we love you 
for your steadfast endurance. 


02:31.600 --> 02:36.138
Our feelings are well summarized 
by Paul’s words 


02:36.138 --> 02:41.643
at 1 Thessalonians 1:2, 3. 


02:41.643 --> 02:45.215
There he wrote 
to the faithful Christians: 


02:45.215 --> 02:49.318
“We always thank God 
when we mention 


02:49.318 --> 02:53.890
“all of you in our prayers, 
for we continually remember 


02:53.890 --> 02:57.760
“your faithful work, 
your loving labor, 


02:57.760 --> 03:01.563
“and your endurance 
because of your hope 


03:01.563 --> 03:03.766
“in our Lord Jesus Christ 


03:03.767 --> 03:07.070
in the presence 
of our God and Father.” 


03:07.070 --> 03:10.273
How beautifully these words 


03:10.273 --> 03:13.441
convey our feelings about you! 


03:13.442 --> 03:17.514
We are greatly encouraged 
and strengthened 


03:17.513 --> 03:20.916
by your faithfulness, 
your integrity, 


03:20.917 --> 03:23.185
and your endurance. 


03:23.185 --> 03:26.957
No matter what type 
of hardship you are facing, 


03:26.957 --> 03:29.692
two things are certain: 


03:29.692 --> 03:33.764
Jehovah knows 
how heavy your load is, 


03:33.763 --> 03:37.900
and he can give you 
the strength to carry it.


03:37.900 --> 03:40.637
Think about that first statement: 


03:40.637 --> 03:44.940
Jehovah knows 
how heavy your load is. 


03:44.940 --> 03:46.943
How do we know that? 


03:46.943 --> 03:48.945
Open your Bible 


03:48.945 --> 03:52.000
to Hebrews 6:10. 


03:53.817 --> 03:55.885
Here the apostle Paul, 


03:55.885 --> 04:00.022
himself a wonderful example 
of endurance, 


04:00.022 --> 04:05.027
tells us what makes 
our steadfast endurance worthwhile. 


04:05.027 --> 04:08.665
Hebrews 6:10 says: 


04:08.665 --> 04:11.935
“For God is not unrighteous 


04:11.935 --> 04:14.803
“so as to forget your work 


04:14.803 --> 04:17.873
“and the love 
you showed for his name 


04:17.873 --> 04:19.875
“by ministering 


04:19.875 --> 04:23.378
and continuing 
to minister to the holy ones.” 


04:23.378 --> 04:25.381
Imagine, 


04:25.382 --> 04:28.985
Jehovah 
would consider it unrighteous 


04:28.985 --> 04:31.587
to take your endurance 
for granted. 


04:31.587 --> 04:33.589
In fact, 


04:33.588 --> 04:37.126
Jehovah does more 
than acknowledge your work; 


04:37.127 --> 04:41.330
he also helps you 
to carry your load. 


04:41.330 --> 04:43.332
How do we know that? 


04:43.332 --> 04:45.369
Open your Bible 


04:45.368 --> 04:50.000
to Philippians 4:12, 13, 


04:52.575 --> 04:56.245
and notice here 
what the apostle Paul, 


04:56.245 --> 04:59.782
this model of endurance, 
tells us. 


04:59.782 --> 05:02.152
Now, just before we read it, 


05:02.152 --> 05:05.120
perhaps we may think of Paul 


05:05.120 --> 05:08.190
as being a newcomer 
to the Christian faith, 


05:08.190 --> 05:12.128
and compared 
to many others, he was. 


05:12.128 --> 05:14.930
But by the time 
he wrote to the Philippians 


05:14.930 --> 05:18.200
in 60 or 61 C.E., 


05:18.200 --> 05:21.537
Paul had encountered 
many obstacles. 


05:21.537 --> 05:24.740
He had many heavy loads to carry. 


05:24.740 --> 05:28.210
Paul mentions a few of them 
in these verses,


05:28.210 --> 05:32.182
but then, 
in the second half of verse 12, 


05:32.182 --> 05:34.850
notice what Paul writes: 


05:34.850 --> 05:39.488
“In everything 
and in all circumstances 


05:39.488 --> 05:41.823
“I have learned the secret 


05:41.823 --> 05:46.028
“of both how to be full 
and how to hunger, 


05:46.028 --> 05:51.033
both how to have an abundance 
and how to do without.” 


05:51.033 --> 05:55.203
Now, notice what he says 
in verse 13: 


05:55.203 --> 05:59.741
“For all things 
I have the strength 


05:59.742 --> 06:03.212
through the one 
who gives me power.” 


06:03.212 --> 06:06.282
What does this mean for us? 


06:06.282 --> 06:10.687
That whatever load 
we have to carry as a Christian, 


06:10.687 --> 06:14.357
we are not doing it 
with our own power. 


06:14.357 --> 06:17.560
Jehovah will help us carry it. 


06:17.560 --> 06:20.830
He will give us the needed strength. 


06:20.830 --> 06:25.233
Paul knew 
that because he had experienced this 


06:25.233 --> 06:28.370
from Jehovah firsthand, 


06:28.370 --> 06:31.173
he had Jehovah’s help in his life. 


06:31.173 --> 06:33.175
How?


06:33.175 --> 06:38.047
Well, consider what Paul faced 
on his first missionary tour. 


06:38.047 --> 06:41.784
An exciting assignment 
lay before Paul, 


06:41.783 --> 06:45.588
Barnabas, 
and their traveling companions. 


06:45.588 --> 06:48.156
Would it be a light load, 


06:48.157 --> 06:51.194
full of only good experiences, 


06:51.193 --> 06:54.930
or would this assignment 
involve challenges, 


06:54.930 --> 06:58.267
some perhaps heavier 
than he anticipated? 


06:58.267 --> 07:00.604
Let’s find out. 


07:00.603 --> 07:05.406
One of Paul’s first stops 
was Pisidian Antioch. 


07:05.407 --> 07:09.612
Here Paul and his companions 
had great success. 


07:09.612 --> 07:12.882
In fact, the people 
begged them to come back 


07:12.882 --> 07:16.019
on the next Sabbath 
to tell them more. 


07:16.018 --> 07:20.155
That seems like a light load to carry, 
doesn’t it? 


07:20.155 --> 07:24.427
But Paul’s return visit 
did not go as smoothly 


07:24.427 --> 07:26.829
as he probably expected. 


07:26.828 --> 07:29.931
While some accepted the good news, 


07:29.932 --> 07:32.869
opposers stirred up the crowd 


07:32.868 --> 07:35.471
to the extent 
that Paul and his companions 


07:35.472 --> 07:38.809
were thrown out of the city. 


07:38.808 --> 07:41.343
Paul’s next stop was Iconium, 


07:41.343 --> 07:44.146
about a 100-mile, 


07:44.147 --> 07:47.950
or 160-kilometer, trip from Antioch. 


07:47.950 --> 07:52.522
Paul couldn’t take a train, 
a bus, or a taxi; 


07:52.522 --> 07:55.090
he had to travel on foot. 


07:55.090 --> 07:59.428
Did things go better for him 
when he got to Iconium? 


07:59.428 --> 08:03.231
Would his preaching there 
be a lighter load to carry 


08:03.232 --> 08:05.367
than it was in Antioch? 


08:05.367 --> 08:08.570
Well, some did accept his message, 


08:08.570 --> 08:12.775
but then opposers 
stirred up opposition. 


08:12.775 --> 08:14.777
Before long, 


08:14.777 --> 08:17.980
Paul and his companions 
had to flee again. 


08:17.980 --> 08:20.983
This time they walked 20 miles, 


08:20.983 --> 08:24.386
or about 30 kilometers, to Lystra. 


08:24.387 --> 08:27.657
At first, things went well there. 


08:27.657 --> 08:31.960
After Paul and Barnabas 
were mistaken for gods, 


08:31.960 --> 08:36.098
they gave a skillful witness 
to the people of Lystra 


08:36.098 --> 08:39.101
about their powerful Creator. 


08:39.102 --> 08:41.770
But then the opposers 


08:41.770 --> 08:45.440
from Antioch and Iconium 
came after Paul. 


08:45.440 --> 08:49.312
Some of them hated Paul so much 


08:49.312 --> 08:52.715
they walked over 100 miles, 


08:52.715 --> 08:56.685
or 160 kilometers, 
to attack him. 


08:56.685 --> 09:00.222
When they found him, 
they stoned Paul 


09:00.222 --> 09:05.294
and dragged him out of the city, 
leaving him for dead. 


09:05.293 --> 09:09.765
Did Paul think that this load 
was getting too heavy to carry? 


09:09.765 --> 09:12.302
Did he cave in to discouragement 


09:12.302 --> 09:14.837
because opposers hated him 


09:14.837 --> 09:17.374
and even attacked him physically? 


09:17.373 --> 09:19.375
No. 


09:19.375 --> 09:22.043
Paul had endurance. 


09:22.043 --> 09:26.048
And a person who endures 
never gives up hope, 


09:26.048 --> 09:28.985
even in the face of persecution.


09:28.985 --> 09:32.120
So, what did Paul do? 


09:32.120 --> 09:35.390
He continued right on with preaching, 


09:35.390 --> 09:37.393
this time in Derbe. 


09:37.393 --> 09:41.196
Just imagine the effort 
Paul had to exert 


09:41.197 --> 09:43.532
to walk the 60 miles, 


09:43.532 --> 09:46.402
or about 100 kilometers, to Derbe 


09:46.402 --> 09:50.840
the day after he 
had almost been stoned to death. 


09:50.840 --> 09:54.777
However, 
the trip was worth the effort 


09:54.777 --> 09:56.845
because while in Derbe, 


09:56.845 --> 10:00.000
Paul and his companions 
made many disciples.


10:01.717 --> 10:06.589
As you can see, 
Paul had a heavy load to carry, 


10:06.588 --> 10:08.991
but he didn’t give up. 


10:08.992 --> 10:11.660
He continued preaching. 


10:11.660 --> 10:15.665
But then Paul did something more. 


10:15.665 --> 10:20.002
Open your Bible to Acts chapter 14. 


10:20.002 --> 10:23.872
Here we see something that proved Paul 


10:23.872 --> 10:26.809
to be a man of endurance. 


10:26.808 --> 10:31.513
At Acts 14:21 we read: 


10:31.513 --> 10:35.016
“After declaring the good news 
to that city 


10:35.017 --> 10:37.720
“and making quite a few disciples, 


10:37.720 --> 10:40.588
“they returned to Lystra, 


10:40.588 --> 10:43.725
Iconium, and Antioch.” 


10:43.725 --> 10:47.397
Imagine, Paul and his companions 


10:47.397 --> 10:49.999
walked back to the very cities 


10:49.998 --> 10:52.735
where they had been viciously persecuted. 


10:52.735 --> 10:54.737
Why? 


10:54.737 --> 10:57.105
Verse 22 says: 


10:57.105 --> 11:00.642
“There they strengthened the disciples, 


11:00.642 --> 11:04.914
“encouraging them 
to remain in the faith and saying: 


11:04.913 --> 11:08.383
“‘We must enter 
into the Kingdom of God 


11:08.383 --> 11:11.000
through many tribulations.’” 


11:12.087 --> 11:16.092
At first, 
that statement might seem strange. 


11:16.092 --> 11:19.295
How could Paul 
encourage the disciples 


11:19.295 --> 11:22.832
by telling them that they 
would have “many tribulations”? 


11:22.832 --> 11:27.000
That prospect would seem depressing, 
not encouraging. 


11:28.070 --> 11:31.807
But look carefully at Paul’s words. 


11:31.807 --> 11:34.077
He didn’t simply say: 


11:34.077 --> 11:37.279
‘We must endure many tribulations.’ 


11:37.278 --> 11:40.115
He said: “We must enter 


11:40.115 --> 11:42.452
“into the Kingdom of God 


11:42.452 --> 11:44.520
through many tribulations.” 


11:44.520 --> 11:46.522
In other words, 


11:46.522 --> 11:49.125
Paul strengthened the disciples 


11:49.125 --> 11:52.595
by emphasizing the positive result 


11:52.595 --> 11:54.630
of endurance. 


11:54.630 --> 11:59.235
As Jesus said at Matthew 10:22: 


11:59.235 --> 12:01.637
“The one who has endured 


12:01.637 --> 12:04.974
to the end will be saved.”


12:04.973 --> 12:07.000
What’s the lesson for us? 


12:08.543 --> 12:11.880
Endurance is not just a matter 
of toughing it out 


12:11.880 --> 12:14.417
under a difficult situation. 


12:14.417 --> 12:16.419
Endurance means 


12:16.418 --> 12:19.488
keeping our hope bright in our mind. 


12:19.488 --> 12:22.525
It means being personally convinced 


12:22.525 --> 12:26.995
that as 2 Corinthians 4:17 says: 


12:26.995 --> 12:31.667
“The tribulation 
is momentary and light,” 


12:31.667 --> 12:46.834
but the reward is everlasting.
