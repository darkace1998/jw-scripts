Welcome to JW Broadcasting! 

00:00:04.988 --> 00:00:07.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
On our program for this month, 

00:00:07.223 --> 00:00:10.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll hear the experience 
of Brother Jim Brown. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
He studied the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses 

00:00:12.762 --> 00:00:16.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
off and on for 30 years! 

00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:20.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
What motivated him to make changes 
and dedicate his life to Jehovah? 

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:24.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s important for youths to develop 
good spiritual habits early. 

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:28.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can teenagers get the most 
out of their daily Bible reading? 

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:34.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have a lot to look forward to 
on the April 2018 edition 

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting. 

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:58.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
As God’s Word touches 
the heart of a Bible student, 

00:00:58.658 --> 00:01:01.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may need to make significant changes 

00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:03.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
to live by Jehovah’s standards. 

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
We start our program with just such a story. 

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:11.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meet Jim Brown, 
a brother from Key Largo, Florida, 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the United States. 

00:01:13.316 --> 00:01:15.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before becoming one of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 

00:01:15.675 --> 00:01:19.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
he was on a dangerous path 
of vice and violence. 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:23.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
What changes did he have to make 
on the road to true worship? 

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:30.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m 53 years old.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was known as a troublemaker.

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:37.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was fighting in the bars.

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:40.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
It comes to a point to where
you begin to enjoy it.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was flat-out scary.

00:01:42.769 --> 00:01:45.839 line:10% position:50% align:center
He was a very mean and violent man,

00:01:45.839 --> 00:01:47.640 line:10% position:50% align:center
so everybody

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.476 line:10% position:50% align:center
kind of kept their distance from him.

00:01:50.043 --> 00:01:54.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
My language was detestable.

00:01:54.047 --> 00:01:56.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
I would make grown men blush

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:58.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the things that I would say
and things that I would do.

00:01:58.885 --> 00:02:01.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was involved with some bikers,

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:05.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were trying to prospect me
into getting into their club.

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:08.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things were escalating.

00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:12.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
We got married very young,
and we were 17.

00:02:12.132 --> 00:02:14.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we had my oldest daughter.

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.871 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was the mom, and he lived a life

00:02:17.871 --> 00:02:21.774 line:10% position:50% align:center
of being out with his friends and partying.

00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:26.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
About that time, my wife started studying
the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:29.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a big change for her, 
but she explained the reasoning behind it.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t argue with it. 

00:02:31.618 --> 00:02:34.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
She talked me into studying.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
I studied from 20 years old to 30.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had always seen it.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had always seen that it was good.

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:44.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew that this was where I needed to be.

00:02:44.097 --> 00:02:47.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
Somehow, I just could never break free
of the person that I was.

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:49.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
My mom always raised us in the truth, 

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:51.971 line:10% position:50% align:center
growing up, and that’s what we knew. 

00:02:51.971 --> 00:02:53.339 line:10% position:50% align:center
So, then, to see my dad, 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:55.808 line:10% position:50% align:center
where he was so different

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:57.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
but yet believed it to be the truth, 

00:02:59.232 --> 00:03:02.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then to see that his lifestyle 
didn’t do him any good 

00:03:02.682 --> 00:03:05.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
was kind of a good example

00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:07.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a bad example, if that makes sense.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was afraid of the change.

00:03:12.058 --> 00:03:15.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
People accepted me for who I was,

00:03:15.028 --> 00:03:19.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
being the tough guy, being Jimmy Brown.

00:03:19.632 --> 00:03:21.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
The scripture comes to mind:

00:03:21.067 --> 00:03:24.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I planted, Apollos watered,
but God kept making it grow.”

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many brothers have studied with Jim

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:28.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
from time to time over the years.

00:03:28.775 --> 00:03:32.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just happened to be the one
at the time in his life

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he was taking the truth
and running with it.

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:40.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
I wanted to be a better person.

00:03:40.253 --> 00:03:43.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
I truly knew that this was just

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
not the way of life that I wanted anymore.

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:49.796 line:90% position:50% align:center
He changed his friends;
he changed his life;

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
he changed his dress and grooming; 

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:54.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
he changed his speech patterns;

00:03:54.334 --> 00:03:57.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
he changed the way he was a grandfather; 

00:03:57.303 --> 00:03:59.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
he changed the way he was a father;
he changed the way he was a husband.

00:03:59.772 --> 00:04:02.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything changed about him.

00:04:04.978 --> 00:04:07.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
I knew the work that Witnesses do

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
—going out door to door talking to people. 

00:04:08.982 --> 00:04:10.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought I could never do that. 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whoa! 
Me, going door to door? 

00:04:12.218 --> 00:04:14.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m going to run into people that I know, 

00:04:14.754 --> 00:04:17.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I drank with for years and years. 

00:04:17.323 --> 00:04:20.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can I face them now? 

00:04:20.226 --> 00:04:22.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had always told my wife, 

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
“It would be much easier for me 

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:26.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
to become a Witness if I didn’t live here.”

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:29.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
But how wrong I was

00:04:29.769 --> 00:04:32.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
because what a witness my changes have been

00:04:32.505 --> 00:04:35.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
to so many people in town.

00:04:38.111 --> 00:04:40.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of my favorite things to do

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:43.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
is bridge witnessing with my granddaughter.

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:47.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
People are fishing on the bridge
—some have been there all night.

00:04:47.453 --> 00:04:50.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
I even have return visits that I do
because people regularly

00:04:50.523 --> 00:04:53.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
come down on the weekend
to fish on the bridges.

00:04:53.526 --> 00:04:55.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
I seize every opportunity.

00:04:55.628 --> 00:04:57.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
My kids laugh at me.

00:04:57.597 --> 00:05:00.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’ll witness to anybody, anytime, anywhere.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ll see some raggedy-taggedy,
old, rough guy

00:05:04.037 --> 00:05:06.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he knew
and brought to the Kingdom Hall.

00:05:06.572 --> 00:05:08.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
In a few weeks,
he’s got a new suit on,

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:11.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
got a haircut,
clean-shaven, and just—

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:16.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the effect he has on the people
that he comes in contact with.

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:20.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love life now.

00:05:20.019 --> 00:05:22.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
I have true friends.

00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that I have hope for the future.

00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:28.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has seen something in me,

00:05:28.227 --> 00:05:30.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’s brought it to light

00:05:30.296 --> 00:05:32.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I am a good person.

00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can be a good human being;
I can help other people;

00:05:36.402 --> 00:05:40.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
I can be loved by Him.

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:43.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s priceless.

00:05:51.184 --> 00:05:53.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you a Bible student who is undecided 

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:56.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
on whether to “commit your way to Jehovah”? 

00:05:57.156 --> 00:06:00.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take note of the trust and confidence 

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:03.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Brown showed 
in dedicating his life to God. 

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be assured that Jehovah 
will guide and care for us 

00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:09.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we give him the opportunity. 

00:06:10.298 --> 00:06:14.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Brown now enjoys the blessing 
of living under Jehovah’s protection, 

00:06:14.507 --> 00:06:17.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving as a ministerial servant 
and regular pioneer. 

00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:22.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
You too can experience 
Jehovah’s spiritual protection, 

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:25.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’ll learn throughout our program. 

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.487 line:10% position:50% align:center
The theme of our broadcast 

00:06:27.487 --> 00:06:29.622 line:10% position:50% align:center
is a very comforting one: 

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:32.091 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Being ‘Securely Wrapped 

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.327 line:10% position:50% align:center
in the Bag of Life With Jehovah.’” 

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps the thought 
of being securely wrapped 

00:06:37.697 --> 00:06:40.867 line:90% position:50% align:center
makes us think of a safely swaddled baby 

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:44.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
or of being enveloped 
in a warm blanket on a cold night. 

00:06:45.398 --> 00:06:48.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Bible, these words 
were uttered by the woman Abigail 

00:06:48.608 --> 00:06:50.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
to Jehovah’s servant David. 

00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:55.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
To understand the meaning of the words 
and their importance today, 

00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:58.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s review the context 
of 1 Samuel chapter 25. 

00:06:59.685 --> 00:07:03.222 line:90% position:50% align:center
David and 600 of his men 
 were dwelling as fugitives. 

00:07:03.222 --> 00:07:05.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
They eventually encountered men 

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:08.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
who worked as shepherds 
for Abigail’s husband, Nabal. 

00:07:08.948 --> 00:07:12.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
David and his men began 
to help guard Nabal’s flocks 

00:07:12.598 --> 00:07:16.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
and serve as “a protective wall” 
for Nabal’s flocks and servants 

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:19.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
against thieves and invaders 
who roamed through the wilderness. 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was likely challenging 
to find enough food for 600 soldiers, 

00:07:25.411 --> 00:07:27.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
so David decided to send ten of his men 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
to kindly ask Nabal for food 

00:07:30.183 --> 00:07:34.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
in repayment for the services 
that they had performed. 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:39.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at 1 Samuel 25:10, 11, 

00:07:39.826 --> 00:07:41.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
note Nabal’s reply: 

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Nabal answered David’s servants: 

00:07:45.865 --> 00:07:50.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse? 

00:07:50.236 --> 00:07:54.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Nowadays many servants 
are breaking away from their masters. 

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:58.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Do I have to take my bread and my water 

00:07:58.377 --> 00:08:01.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘and the meat 
that I butchered for my shearers 

00:08:01.013 --> 00:08:04.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
and give it to men who come 
from who knows where?’” 

00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:09.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was not the response that David 
and his men were expecting to hear. 

00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:15.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible describes Nabal 
as a very harsh, worthless man, 

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:18.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is certainly evidenced by his reply. 

00:08:18.397 --> 00:08:22.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He screamed insults” 
at the messengers and ridiculed David, 

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:25.104 line:90% position:50% align:center
comparing him to a runaway servant. 

00:08:26.397 --> 00:08:29.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
So David decided 
to take matters into his own hands 

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:33.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
and resolve the situation 
the way many people today might 

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:35.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
—by fighting. 

00:08:35.948 --> 00:08:37.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 13, 

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has 400 of his men 
prepare themselves for battle, 

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:43.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
with one mission

00:08:43.122 --> 00:08:45.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to wipe out every male 
in Nabal’s household. 

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
Eventually, word got back to Abigail 
about what her husband had done. 

00:08:52.298 --> 00:08:55.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
Without telling Nabal, 
she gathered an abundance of food 

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:57.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
and went out to meet David. 

00:08:57.303 --> 00:09:01.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
When she met up with him, 
she poured out her heart at length, 

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
asking David to forgive her personally 

00:09:03.943 --> 00:09:06.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and making a powerful plea for mercy 

00:09:06.145 --> 00:09:08.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
on behalf of her husband and her household. 

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:13.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
She acknowledged that Nabal 
was a foolish and senseless man, 

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:16.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
so she urged David not to take any action 

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:18.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might bring bloodguilt upon him 

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:21.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
or cause him to be affected 
by a troubled conscience. 

00:09:22.731 --> 00:09:25.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Abigail concluded her appeal to David, 

00:09:25.965 --> 00:09:29.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
notice what she tells him in verse 29, 

00:09:29.802 --> 00:09:31.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
the theme of our discussion: 

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:37.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When someone rises up 
to pursue you and seeks your life, 

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:40.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the life of my lord will be wrapped securely 

00:09:40.413 --> 00:09:43.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the bag of life with Jehovah your God, 

00:09:43.449 --> 00:09:45.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but the lives of your enemies 

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:48.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will hurl away like stones from a sling.” 

00:09:50.064 --> 00:09:52.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just as we might wrap up something valuable 

00:09:52.458 --> 00:09:55.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to protect and preserve it, 

00:09:55.227 --> 00:09:58.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Abigail was telling David 
that that is how his life 

00:09:58.097 --> 00:10:00.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
would be in Jehovah’s hands. 

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:04.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah would protect and preserve 
David’s life from his enemies 

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:08.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
as long as he did not seek 
to save himself by personal efforts 

00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:10.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
but waited on Jehovah, 

00:10:10.943 --> 00:10:13.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
trusting in the One to whom he owed his life.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:18.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
What lessons can we learn from this account? 

00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:23.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
As David saw, his relationship 
with Jehovah was a protection. 

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:28.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 32, he acknowledges 
that God had sent Abigail with the warning. 

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:33.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
We learn 
that Jehovah’s spiritual protection for us 

00:10:33.432 --> 00:10:37.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
is related to the quality 
of our relationship with him. 

00:10:38.237 --> 00:10:42.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why the Bible tells us at James 4:8: 

00:10:44.194 --> 00:10:46.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Draw close to God, 

00:10:46.545 --> 00:10:48.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he will draw close to you.” 

00:10:49.281 --> 00:10:52.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah invites us to draw near to him 

00:10:52.385 --> 00:10:56.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
because he wants to receive us 
into his favor as his friends. 

00:10:57.330 --> 00:11:01.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we dedicate our lives 
and vow to serve him unconditionally, 

00:11:01.260 --> 00:11:03.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
we gain an approved standing with him; 

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:06.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re figuratively put in that “bag of life.” 

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we work to develop 
a close personal relationship with him, 

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:15.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we can experience 
Jehovah’s friendship and protection. 

00:11:15.941 --> 00:11:18.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never want 
to restrict Jehovah’s protection 

00:11:18.678 --> 00:11:22.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
by not looking to him for guidance 
or relying on our own thinking. 

00:11:24.083 --> 00:11:27.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, can we think of areas or situations 

00:11:27.019 --> 00:11:29.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
that might require us to wait on Jehovah? 

00:11:30.589 --> 00:11:34.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps we’re experiencing 
literal opposition at work or at school. 

00:11:35.461 --> 00:11:39.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Abigail, we might face the challenge 
of living with a difficult marriage mate. 

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe we’re battling a health issue 

00:11:43.069 --> 00:11:46.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
and loyalty is needed 
regarding our medical choices. 

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or it may be that we live in a country 

00:11:48.641 --> 00:11:50.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we cannot preach freely 

00:11:50.876 --> 00:11:54.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that we face opposition for our beliefs. 

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:57.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Really, it could be any number of situations. 

00:11:57.249 --> 00:12:00.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it is our response

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:03.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the way we handle the situation—

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:08.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
that indicates how much 
we are allowing Jehovah to help us. 

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do we trust him enough 
that we can leave the matter in his hands 

00:12:13.199 --> 00:12:16.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see how he works 
things out in our behalf? 

00:12:17.636 --> 00:12:21.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to manifest 
Christian qualities in order to do that. 

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:26.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think about what qualities displayed 
by Abigail and David impress you most. 

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:31.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two that come to mind 
are patience and reasonableness. 

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
Patience is closely connected with endurance 

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:38.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enables one to put up 
with difficult circumstances 

00:12:38.491 --> 00:12:40.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
while maintaining a positive attitude. 

00:12:42.046 --> 00:12:45.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reasonableness describes 
a person who is fair, 

00:12:45.397 --> 00:12:48.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
considerate, willing to yield to others. 

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
How well this describes Abigail! 

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:56.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
It must have been quite a challenge 
to live with someone like Nabal. 

00:12:56.542 --> 00:13:00.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
But nowhere do we read 
that she was ever disrespectful of him 

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:02.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
or that she belittled him. 

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:06.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when she referred to him 
as senseless in verse 25, 

00:13:06.919 --> 00:13:10.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
from Jehovah’s standpoint, 
her comments were proper 

00:13:10.289 --> 00:13:14.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Nabal’s actions 
put his entire household in danger. 

00:13:15.227 --> 00:13:17.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
How about David? 

00:13:17.396 --> 00:13:19.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was in a position of authority, 

00:13:19.398 --> 00:13:24.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he showed great patience 
and reasonableness in listening to Abigail 

00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:27.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
and having the good sense 
to know that she was right. 

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:30.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s not always easy to do 
in the heat of the moment 

00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:32.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
or when we’re upset. 

00:13:32.978 --> 00:13:34.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps you recall that at our 

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:38.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Don’t Give Up!” 
Regional Convention last year, 

00:13:38.017 --> 00:13:42.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
when discussing 2 Peter 1:5-8, 

00:13:42.087 --> 00:13:44.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
we learned a nice formula 
that can help us 

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:47.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
to cultivate and strengthen 
Christian qualities. 

00:13:48.396 --> 00:13:51.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were encouraged to study them, 

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditate on them, 

00:13:53.933 --> 00:13:56.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
and put them into practice. 

00:13:56.502 --> 00:13:58.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we apply this formula 

00:13:58.504 --> 00:14:01.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the qualities 
of patience and reasonableness, 

00:14:01.207 --> 00:14:04.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
it can help us to endure 
our trials successfully. 

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:07.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’re confident 
that Jehovah will supply us 

00:14:07.479 --> 00:14:09.915 line:90% position:50% align:center
with whatever power we need 

00:14:09.915 --> 00:14:12.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that we will not tire out 

00:14:12.218 --> 00:14:15.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we continue to endure 
and put our trust in him. 

00:14:17.523 --> 00:14:19.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to developing these qualities, 

00:14:19.525 --> 00:14:23.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
something else that can help us 
is our spiritual routine. 

00:14:23.629 --> 00:14:27.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our consistent routine 
of study, meeting attendance, 

00:14:27.499 --> 00:14:31.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the ministry will help us remain busy, 

00:14:31.036 --> 00:14:35.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
stay active, and make good decisions. 

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll have no time 
to become curious or occupied 

00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:41.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the things this world has to offer. 

00:14:41.981 --> 00:14:45.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s good to remember 
the people during the days of Haggai. 

00:14:46.151 --> 00:14:51.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the Jews lost their focus 
and started neglecting Jehovah’s temple, 

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:55.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
they lost his blessing 
and protection spiritually. 

00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.763 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what was the result? 

00:14:57.763 --> 00:15:00.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, notice how Haggai draws our attention 

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:03.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
to a different type of “bag” 

00:15:03.068 --> 00:15:06.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
at Haggai 1:6: 

00:15:08.007 --> 00:15:12.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have sown much seed, 
but you harvest little. 

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:16.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You eat, but it is not to satisfaction. 

00:15:16.515 --> 00:15:20.019 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You drink, but you do not drink your fill. 

00:15:20.019 --> 00:15:24.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You put on clothing, but no one gets warm. 

00:15:24.556 --> 00:15:28.060 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one who hires himself out puts his wages 

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:30.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
in a bag full of holes.”

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:35.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Jews sowed seed 
but had a meager harvest. 

00:15:35.434 --> 00:15:38.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lacked enough food 
to satisfy their needs. 

00:15:38.704 --> 00:15:42.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were unable to clothe 
themselves with warm garments. 

00:15:42.274 --> 00:15:45.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah withheld his blessings, 

00:15:45.444 --> 00:15:48.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
Haggai rightly compared them to a man 

00:15:48.113 --> 00:15:51.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
who “puts his wages in a bag full of holes.” 

00:15:52.912 --> 00:15:57.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the disappointment 
of discovering that hard-earned wages 

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:59.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
had gradually disappeared 
through a leaking bag! 

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:04.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, 
our focus is not material prosperity, 

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:08.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
because, whether we have 
an abundance of material things or not, 

00:16:08.634 --> 00:16:12.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we fail to receive Jehovah’s blessing, 

00:16:12.204 --> 00:16:14.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
our spirituality is jeopardized. 

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:20.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we must be determined 
never to lose our focus 

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:23.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep Jehovah 
in the forefront of our lives.

00:16:24.717 --> 00:16:27.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we examine the life of David, 

00:16:27.486 --> 00:16:29.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s evident that he enjoyed 

00:16:29.488 --> 00:16:32.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
a preserved and protected 
relationship with God. 

00:16:33.892 --> 00:16:36.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
When you read the book of Psalms, 

00:16:36.228 --> 00:16:40.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
take note of how David 
describes Jehovah’s protective care 

00:16:40.766 --> 00:16:42.768 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Psalm 18, 

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:45.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 31, and Psalm 34 

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he went through distresses 

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
—just beautiful accounts! 

00:16:51.179 --> 00:16:54.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, did David always do 
everything the right way? 

00:16:54.713 --> 00:16:56.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
No. 

00:16:56.515 --> 00:16:58.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of his encounter with Nabal. 

00:16:58.650 --> 00:17:01.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
While his angry reaction was understandable, 

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:05.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
his way of expressing it was not correct. 

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
But David learned from his mistakes, 

00:17:08.794 --> 00:17:11.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
and each new trial that he went through 

00:17:11.830 --> 00:17:15.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthened his relationship 
with Jehovah even more. 

00:17:16.229 --> 00:17:19.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, 
after the ordeal with Nabal, 

00:17:19.571 --> 00:17:22.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
a short time later, 
David married Abigail. 

00:17:22.908 --> 00:17:24.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were still fugitives, 

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:27.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he found a king that befriended them, 

00:17:27.513 --> 00:17:30.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he gave David’s men 
and family a land to dwell in. 

00:17:31.795 --> 00:17:34.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
One day, while all the men were away, 

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:37.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Amalekites raided and burned the city 

00:17:37.589 --> 00:17:40.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
and carried off all the men’s wives, 

00:17:40.192 --> 00:17:42.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
children, and flocks. 

00:17:42.494 --> 00:17:45.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
Upon returning 
and seeing what had happened, 

00:17:45.497 --> 00:17:48.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
David and his men wept. 

00:17:48.534 --> 00:17:50.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Grief quickly turned to bitterness, 

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:53.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and David’s men spoke of stoning him. 

00:17:54.695 --> 00:17:57.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was likely quite stressful for David. 

00:17:57.843 --> 00:18:00.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was concerned 
for the safety of his family, 

00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:04.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
and likely he was frustrated 
that his men had turned on him. 

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:08.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe he felt disrespected again, 
as he had with Nabal. 

00:18:10.095 --> 00:18:12.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how would he handle this situation? 

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:15.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get a glimpse of David’s feelings 

00:18:15.894 --> 00:18:19.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Samuel 30:6: 

00:18:22.034 --> 00:18:24.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
“David was very distressed, 

00:18:24.636 --> 00:18:27.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because the men were talking of stoning him, 

00:18:27.473 --> 00:18:29.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for all the men had become very bitter 

00:18:29.875 --> 00:18:32.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
over the loss of their sons and daughters.” 

00:18:33.512 --> 00:18:37.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
But notice, 
how did David handle the situation? 

00:18:37.983 --> 00:18:40.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
The verse continues: 

00:18:41.553 --> 00:18:46.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But David strengthened himself 
by Jehovah his God.” 

00:18:47.059 --> 00:18:49.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he do this? 

00:18:49.094 --> 00:18:50.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 8 says: 

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:55.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
“David inquired of Jehovah.” 

00:18:56.535 --> 00:19:01.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time, David has 
a different thought process and response. 

00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:05.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
Immediately he remembers 
to consult Jehovah. 

00:19:06.595 --> 00:19:08.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t this a nice reminder 

00:19:08.247 --> 00:19:12.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
that when you and I are going 
through difficult trials and situations, 

00:19:12.351 --> 00:19:15.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to immediately pray to Jehovah 

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:19.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and seek his direction 
through the pages of his Word, the Bible? 

00:19:19.691 --> 00:19:24.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is essential 
for our spiritual protection. 

00:19:25.764 --> 00:19:30.769 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in review, 
as we face difficult situations in life, 

00:19:30.769 --> 00:19:35.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
may we look for opportunities 
to show and develop our Christian qualities 

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:38.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
—such as patience and reasonableness. 

00:19:38.844 --> 00:19:42.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
These qualities show Jehovah 
that we want to be like him, 

00:19:42.514 --> 00:19:45.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we have 
the mental disposition of Christ, 

00:19:45.217 --> 00:19:48.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we will allow Him 
to guide us constantly. 

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:53.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
Next, may we keep focused and busy 
“in the work of the Lord.” 

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:57.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
By drawing close to Jehovah through prayer 

00:19:57.396 --> 00:19:59.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
and engaging in spiritual activities, 

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:03.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
we make the best of our situation now. 

00:20:03.569 --> 00:20:05.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we will also find 

00:20:05.571 --> 00:20:08.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
everlasting protection in Jehovah’s hands, 

00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
safely swaddled 

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:14.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
and securely wrapped in his “bag of life”! 

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:21.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
We need to rely on Jehovah’s guidance 
even in the most severe trials. 

00:20:21.386 --> 00:20:24.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s possible that you 
may face a life-threatening issue 

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:27.292 line:90% position:50% align:center
where there’s no desirable option, 

00:20:27.292 --> 00:20:30.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
but a decision <i>is </i>necessary. 

00:20:30.395 --> 00:20:32.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the following dramatization, 

00:20:32.798 --> 00:20:36.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
Emma is faced with a situation like this. 

00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will she do? 

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
And how will God’s Word 
help her to make a decision? 

00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:48.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Thomas and I first learned 
I was pregnant, 

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:50.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
we were both really shocked. 

00:20:56.221 --> 00:20:59.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then we grew more and more excited. 

00:21:02.294 --> 00:21:06.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were so thrilled when we saw 
our little girl for the first time. 

00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:14.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
We really didn’t care 
if it was a boy or a girl; 

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
we just wanted the baby to be healthy. 

00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:36.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, our hopes 
were completely destroyed 

00:21:36.261 --> 00:21:39.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the doctor told us 
that the baby would likely be born 

00:21:39.498 --> 00:21:43.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
with severe problems and could even die. 

00:21:52.144 --> 00:21:55.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
My husband and his parents 
are not Jehovah’s Witnesses, 

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:58.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they do feel abortion is wrong. 

00:22:06.425 --> 00:22:09.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, they thought that we should listen 
to our doctor’s advice. 

00:22:13.131 --> 00:22:15.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t believe this was happening. 

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:19.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
I even questioned why Jehovah would allow it. 

00:22:19.237 --> 00:22:22.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really felt it was more than I could bear. 

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:28.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thomas asked me what I wanted to do, 

00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I told him 
that I could never<i> </i>have an abortion. 

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:34.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
He agreed that normally it would be wrong 

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:38.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
but felt that in our situation 
God would understand. 

00:22:42.627 --> 00:22:44.830 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so overwhelmed. 

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:48.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was being pressured 
to make a decision I knew was wrong 

00:22:48.834 --> 00:22:52.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
but that everyone 
was telling me was best for my child. 

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
I had never felt so alone. 

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:03.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
I needed Jehovah more than ever, 

00:23:03.115 --> 00:23:06.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I poured out my heart to him in prayer. 

00:23:15.927 --> 00:23:17.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I did research. 

00:23:36.882 --> 00:23:40.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
I showed Thomas the scripture I had found. 

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If men should struggle with each other 

00:23:57.736 --> 00:24:00.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and they hurt a pregnant woman 

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
“. . . if a fatality does occur, 

00:24:04.509 --> 00:24:07.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
then you must give life for life.”

00:24:08.647 --> 00:24:11.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah views even the unintentional killing 

00:24:11.716 --> 00:24:14.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
of an unborn child as a serious sin. 

00:24:14.753 --> 00:24:18.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how could we intentionally take 
the life of our child? 

00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:26.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
I made my decision clear to our doctor 

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:34.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to my in-laws. 

00:24:37.542 --> 00:24:40.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
There was a chance 
the diagnosis was incorrect, 

00:24:40.912 --> 00:24:44.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’d love to say that’s what occurred; 

00:24:44.015 --> 00:24:46.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it did not. 

00:24:46.184 --> 00:24:50.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
My daughter Chloe only lived 
a few weeks after she was born, 

00:24:50.388 --> 00:24:54.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
and losing her was the hardest thing 
I’ve ever had to endure. 

00:24:54.759 --> 00:24:58.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah gave me the courage 
to explain my beliefs to my husband, 

00:24:58.897 --> 00:25:01.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
my in-laws, and the medical staff, 

00:25:01.933 --> 00:25:05.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they all expressed admiration 
for my strong faith. 

00:25:05.971 --> 00:25:09.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ve never regretted the decision I made. 

00:25:10.709 --> 00:25:13.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even though Chloe only lived those few weeks, 

00:25:13.879 --> 00:25:16.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so grateful for the time I had with her. 

00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:20.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know Jehovah remembers 
every detail about her, 

00:25:20.385 --> 00:25:24.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he’ll give her back to me 
in the resurrection in perfect health, 

00:25:24.890 --> 00:25:29.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
because all<i> </i>life 
is truly precious in his eyes. 

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:36.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Getting Jehovah’s thinking on a matter 

00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:40.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be the first thing 
we do when making decisions. 

00:25:40.472 --> 00:25:44.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is especially true 
when well-intentioned friends or family 

00:25:44.509 --> 00:25:48.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
offer advice that may conflict 
with Bible principles. 

00:25:48.246 --> 00:25:50.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
As we weigh a variety of options, 

00:25:50.749 --> 00:25:53.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
follow Emma’s good example 
of consulting God’s Word 

00:25:53.785 --> 00:25:55.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our Christian publications. 

00:25:55.887 --> 00:25:59.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help us make decisions 
that bring honor to Jehovah. 

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our program, we’ve seen a few ways 

00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:06.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Satan will exert pressure on those 

00:26:06.398 --> 00:26:09.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘securely wrapped in the bag of life.’ 

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:12.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
True Christians 
courageously stand up to the Devil, 

00:26:12.203 --> 00:26:16.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
never allowing him to pry us 
away from Jehovah’s protection. 

00:26:16.374 --> 00:26:18.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
At a recent Bethel morning worship, 

00:26:18.643 --> 00:26:23.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Mark Sanderson 
of the Governing Body discussed 1 Peter 5:9 

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:27.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
and outlined how we take 
our stand against Satan. 

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.689 line:10% position:50% align:center
Is it possible to survive 

00:26:30.689 --> 00:26:34.059 line:10% position:50% align:center
the attack of a roaring lion? 

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:36.394 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, now, I did some just quick checking 

00:26:36.394 --> 00:26:38.930 line:10% position:50% align:center
on various wildlife websites, 

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.532 line:10% position:50% align:center
and here’s what they say. 

00:26:40.532 --> 00:26:41.533 line:10% position:50% align:center
Basically, 

00:26:41.533 --> 00:26:43.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
they all give the same advice 

00:26:43.268 --> 00:26:45.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
if you’re being attacked by a lion. 

00:26:45.537 --> 00:26:48.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
They say: “Hold your ground. 

00:26:48.139 --> 00:26:51.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
Never run or turn back.” 

00:26:51.409 --> 00:26:54.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, one website says: 

00:26:54.279 --> 00:26:57.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
“A lion can run 50 miles per hour (80 km/h). 

00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:59.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So stand still. 

00:26:59.784 --> 00:27:03.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you run, you will only die tired.” 

00:27:05.023 --> 00:27:07.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s true. 

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:10.395 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Peter 5:9 

00:27:10.395 --> 00:27:13.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
gives us exactly the same advice. 

00:27:13.798 --> 00:27:18.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: “Take your stand against him.” 

00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:21.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in this case 
not against a literal lion, 

00:27:21.439 --> 00:27:25.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
but against that “roaring lion,” 
Satan the Devil, 

00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:29.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
who is seeking to devour 
every single one of us. 

00:27:30.133 --> 00:27:34.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our ability to stand firm 
when facing this lion 

00:27:34.619 --> 00:27:36.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
—to be able to oppose him, 

00:27:36.755 --> 00:27:40.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
to refuse to be intimidated by him, 

00:27:40.158 --> 00:27:44.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
to refuse to run away or turn back— 

00:27:44.162 --> 00:27:48.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
requires what the apostle Peter 
next mentions there in verse 9, 

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Brother Crane 
so nicely covered in his comment. 

00:27:51.803 --> 00:27:55.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to: “Take [our] stand against him, 

00:27:55.407 --> 00:27:58.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
firm in the faith.” 

00:27:58.109 --> 00:28:02.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
To be successful, 
we must have complete trust 

00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:06.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
and complete confidence in Jehovah. 

00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:09.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, in that regard, 
let’s look at an example 

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:14.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
of someone in Bible times who had 
that kind of confidence in Jehovah. 

00:28:14.025 --> 00:28:17.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is in the days of King Jehoshaphat, 

00:28:17.562 --> 00:28:20.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Judah was threatened 
by the combined forces 

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:23.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
 of Moab, Ammon, 

00:28:23.001 --> 00:28:26.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the inhabitants 
of the mountainous region of Seir. 

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:28.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s begin by opening our Bibles 

00:28:28.773 --> 00:28:34.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
and reading 2 Chronicles 20:12. 

00:28:34.779 --> 00:28:37.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here Jehoshaphat is praying to Jehovah; 

00:28:37.582 --> 00:28:41.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s pouring out his heart to him, 
and see what he says: 

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:46.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O our God, 
will you not execute judgment on them? 

00:28:46.391 --> 00:28:49.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For we are powerless before this large crowd 

00:28:49.894 --> 00:28:51.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that is coming against us; 

00:28:51.896 --> 00:28:55.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and we do not know what we should do, 

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:59.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
but our eyes are toward you.” 

00:28:59.204 --> 00:29:03.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehoshaphat was facing the lion. 

00:29:03.174 --> 00:29:07.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said to Jehovah: 
‘We don’t know what to do.’ 

00:29:07.212 --> 00:29:12.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehoshaphat had complete and total trust; 

00:29:12.217 --> 00:29:15.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had firm faith in Jehovah. 

00:29:15.053 --> 00:29:18.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did Jehovah 
tell Jehoshaphat to do? 

00:29:18.356 --> 00:29:21.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
See verse 17: 

00:29:21.059 --> 00:29:24.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You will not need to fight this battle. 

00:29:24.329 --> 00:29:26.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
Take your position.” 

00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
Does that sound familiar? 

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:32.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Take your position, stand still, 

00:29:32.237 --> 00:29:36.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and see the salvation of Jehovah 
in your behalf. 

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:38.209 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Judah and Jerusalem, 

00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:40.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do not be afraid or be terrified. 

00:29:40.645 --> 00:29:43.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Tomorrow go out against them, 

00:29:43.081 --> 00:29:46.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah will be with you.” 

00:29:46.117 --> 00:29:48.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, what did Jehovah tell them to do? 

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:53.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: ‘Take a position 
in opposition to that military force, 

00:29:53.758 --> 00:29:57.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘stand firm, refuse to run away, 

00:29:57.362 --> 00:30:01.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see the salvation 
that will come from Jehovah.’ 

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:03.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in order to do that, 

00:30:03.468 --> 00:30:05.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehoshaphat and the people with him 

00:30:05.770 --> 00:30:10.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
would need to have strong, firm, solid faith. 

00:30:11.142 --> 00:30:13.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, to help the people, 

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:15.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
look at what Jehoshaphat said to them 

00:30:15.246 --> 00:30:17.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they were getting ready for this battle. 

00:30:17.348 --> 00:30:22.053 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 20, you see, 
just about the middle of the verse, 

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:25.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says: 
“Jehoshaphat stood up and said: 

00:30:25.190 --> 00:30:29.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Listen to me, O Judah 
and you inhabitants of Jerusalem! 

00:30:29.661 --> 00:30:33.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put faith in Jehovah your God 

00:30:33.431 --> 00:30:37.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘so that you may be able to stand firm. 

00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:39.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Put faith in his prophets, 

00:30:39.637 --> 00:30:43.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will be successful.’” 

00:30:43.274 --> 00:30:45.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that’s exactly what happened. 

00:30:45.643 --> 00:30:47.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
See, with that kind of confidence in Jehovah, 

00:30:47.946 --> 00:30:52.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
with that firm trust in him, 
with that standing firm, 

00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:54.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
what did Jehovah do? 

00:30:54.219 --> 00:30:56.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, according to verses 22 and 23

00:30:56.988 --> 00:30:58.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you’ll remember what happened—

00:30:58.990 --> 00:31:02.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
the men of Ammon, Moab, 
and the inhabitants 

00:31:02.227 --> 00:31:04.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the mountainous region of Seir, 

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:07.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
they all went to striking down one another. 

00:31:07.866 --> 00:31:10.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
And verse 23 says: 

00:31:10.168 --> 00:31:12.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And the Ammonites and the Moabites 

00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:16.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
“turned against the inhabitants 
of the mountainous region of Seir 

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:18.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to destroy and annihilate them; 

00:31:18.576 --> 00:31:21.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and when they finished 
with the inhabitants of Seir, 

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:24.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
they helped to destroy one another.” 

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:29.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah had rewarded 
their firm faith in him. 

00:31:29.821 --> 00:31:32.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
The weapons that had been formed 

00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:36.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
against Jehoshaphat and his people 
had no success. 

00:31:36.861 --> 00:31:39.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, 
sometimes we think, of course, 

00:31:39.430 --> 00:31:44.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
that these kinds of situations 
only happened in Bible times. 

00:31:44.202 --> 00:31:48.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s amazing to see 
how our brothers in our modern day 

00:31:48.539 --> 00:31:50.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
have had that same kind of faith 

00:31:50.608 --> 00:31:53.945 line:90% position:50% align:center
and have stood firm against the lion. 

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here are just a couple of experiences 

00:31:55.947 --> 00:31:58.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
that really touched my heart. 

00:31:58.383 --> 00:32:02.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one about a brother 
named Pavel from Russia. 

00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1958, 

00:32:04.422 --> 00:32:07.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pavel was arrested for religious activities. 

00:32:07.692 --> 00:32:10.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Accompanying me to the train,” he says, 

00:32:10.161 --> 00:32:12.397 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the officer [with me] said, 

00:32:12.397 --> 00:32:15.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Look at your wife for the last time 

00:32:15.199 --> 00:32:18.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you will never see her again.’” 

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:20.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, there’s the lion. 

00:32:20.204 --> 00:32:24.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I spent six months 
in solitary confinement before my trial. 

00:32:24.876 --> 00:32:28.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During interrogations, . . . 
the investigators did everything 

00:32:28.579 --> 00:32:30.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to undermine my faith. 

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:33.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Sometimes violence was used. 

00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:38.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
I begged Jehovah 
to give me the strength to stay firm.” 

00:32:38.256 --> 00:32:40.858 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now look what happened. 

00:32:40.858 --> 00:32:43.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
“During a routine interrogation, 

00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:47.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the investigator called me 
into his study and [he] said: 

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:51.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Now we will show you 
what your organization is doing. 

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:54.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Then you can see 
if it is God’s work or not!’ 

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:57.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Looking at me intently, he continued: 

00:32:57.775 --> 00:33:01.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘This year your convention in New York 

00:33:01.179 --> 00:33:04.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘was attended by 253,000 people 

00:33:04.449 --> 00:33:06.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘in two stadiums. 

00:33:06.451 --> 00:33:09.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The convention lasted eight days.’ 

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:12.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The investigator strewed 
the table with photographs. 

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:15.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In one of them, 
I saw happy delegates 

00:33:15.693 --> 00:33:18.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in colorful native dress 
embracing one another. 

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:22.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Another photo showed 
Brother Knorr giving a talk, 

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:25.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and yet others showed the baptism. 

00:33:25.203 --> 00:33:29.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The investigator could not even imagine 

00:33:29.407 --> 00:33:31.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“what I was feeling at that moment. 

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:34.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I felt that I was attending the convention 

00:33:34.278 --> 00:33:37.115 line:90% position:50% align:center
“without ever having left the prison. 

00:33:37.115 --> 00:33:40.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I felt new strength flooding into me. 

00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:43.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
“[It was just what] I had needed. 

00:33:43.921 --> 00:33:48.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
“. . . And Jehovah generously 
blessed me in a special way. 

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:50.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was ready to endure further.” 

00:33:50.862 --> 00:33:52.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
Isn’t that amazing?

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:55.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s another similar experience, 

00:33:55.099 --> 00:33:57.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
1960, also in Russia, 

00:33:57.835 --> 00:34:01.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
a large publicized trial 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:34:01.339 --> 00:34:04.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
About 300 persons 
were present in the courtroom, 

00:34:04.509 --> 00:34:07.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
including many of our brothers and sisters. 

00:34:07.678 --> 00:34:09.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as the evidence—

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
As evidence against the brothers, 

00:34:11.816 --> 00:34:16.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
the prosecutor decided to present 
a letter from Nathan H. Knorr. 

00:34:16.821 --> 00:34:20.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
One of the brothers 
who attended the trial said this: 

00:34:20.358 --> 00:34:23.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The prosecutor loudly began to read a letter 

00:34:23.728 --> 00:34:26.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that had been intercepted by the KGB 

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:29.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from Brother Knorr 
to the brothers in the Soviet Union. 

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:32.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For all of us Witnesses present in the hall, 

00:34:32.937 --> 00:34:35.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it was a wonderful gift from Jehovah. 

00:34:35.640 --> 00:34:38.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
“This letter warmed our hearts! 

00:34:38.009 --> 00:34:40.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We heard wise counsel from the Bible 

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:44.215 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and encouragement to serve 
our fellow believers lovingly 

00:34:44.215 --> 00:34:47.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and to stay faithful [even] under trials. 

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:49.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The prosecutor read the letter 

00:34:49.821 --> 00:34:52.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“from the beginning to the very end. 

00:34:52.723 --> 00:34:55.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“We listened with rapt attention. 

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:58.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seemed to us that we were 
attending a convention!”

00:35:00.665 --> 00:35:03.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, brothers, what additional lessons 

00:35:03.835 --> 00:35:07.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
do we learn from these two experiences? 

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:11.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we stand our ground against Satan, 

00:35:11.242 --> 00:35:13.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
firm in the faith, 

00:35:13.244 --> 00:35:16.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
then Jehovah will do just what he promised 

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:19.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Peter 5:10. 

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:21.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you see what it says there? 

00:35:21.185 --> 00:35:24.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But after you have suffered a little while, 

00:35:24.522 --> 00:35:27.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the God of all undeserved kindness, 

00:35:27.391 --> 00:35:31.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who called you to his everlasting glory 
in union with Christ, 

00:35:31.162 --> 00:35:34.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
“will himself finish your training. 

00:35:34.465 --> 00:35:36.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He will make you firm, 

00:35:36.467 --> 00:35:38.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he will make you strong, 

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:41.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
he will firmly ground you.” 

00:35:41.506 --> 00:35:43.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, brothers, 

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:47.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
can we survive the attack of a roaring lion? 

00:35:47.778 --> 00:35:49.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Absolutely! 

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:53.851 line:90% position:50% align:center
With firm faith, let’s stand fast 

00:35:53.851 --> 00:35:56.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
and see the salvation from Jehovah. 

00:35:58.322 --> 00:36:03.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Firm faith is needed to resist 
the relentless attacks of Satan the Devil. 

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:07.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
The modern-day examples brought out 
in the presentation are truly inspiring. 

00:36:08.966 --> 00:36:12.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, 
did you notice that Brother Sanderson 

00:36:12.069 --> 00:36:16.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
also applied 
the Biblical example of Jehoshaphat? 

00:36:16.407 --> 00:36:19.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible is full of accounts that can revive 

00:36:19.677 --> 00:36:22.680 line:90% position:50% align:center
and renew our courage 
every time we read them. 

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:26.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s a question: 

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:29.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
<i>When </i>should we develop the type of faith 

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:32.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
that can resist the attack 
of “a roaring lion”? 

00:36:32.023 --> 00:36:36.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it something 
only longtime servants of Jehovah can do? 

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:38.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 12:1 says 

00:36:38.863 --> 00:36:41.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
to “remember, then, your Grand Creator 

00:36:41.866 --> 00:36:44.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the days of your youth.” 

00:36:45.336 --> 00:36:47.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
Young ones, 

00:36:47.338 --> 00:36:51.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
do you find it a challenge 
to read the Bible every day? 

00:36:51.075 --> 00:36:53.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
A few of your peers 
have excellent suggestions 

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:56.180 line:90% position:50% align:center
based on how they do their Bible reading 

00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how they get the most benefit from it. 

00:37:01.452 --> 00:37:03.688 line:10% position:50% align:center
I often put it off until later. 

00:37:03.688 --> 00:37:05.856 line:10% position:50% align:center
So I come home in the evening tired, 

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:06.924 line:10% position:50% align:center
and I like to relax. 

00:37:06.924 --> 00:37:08.159 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, very often, 

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:09.827 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was tired for many different reasons, 

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.929 line:10% position:50% align:center
and that is why I didn’t have the motivation 

00:37:11.929 --> 00:37:13.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
even to start Bible reading 
in the first place. 

00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:16.367 line:10% position:50% align:center
I also had many phases 

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:17.902 line:10% position:50% align:center
where it was really tough 

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
to stick it out with Bible reading. 

00:37:20.171 --> 00:37:22.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Especially in the age of social media, 

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:25.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are many other things 
you can fill your day with. 

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:28.813 line:10% position:50% align:center
One hobby that mainly got in the way 

00:37:28.813 --> 00:37:30.815 line:10% position:50% align:center
was watching movies. 

00:37:30.815 --> 00:37:33.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really spent a lot of time on that. 

00:37:33.284 --> 00:37:37.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
This often steals precious time 
you could have made better use of. 

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:39.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
So something that moved me 

00:37:39.523 --> 00:37:41.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
was the thought that through Bible reading, 

00:37:41.626 --> 00:37:43.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’re actually talking with Jehovah. 

00:37:43.628 --> 00:37:47.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
You pray to him, and he 
is then answering you through the Bible. 

00:37:47.999 --> 00:37:52.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jehovah promised, he can give us 
both the power and the desire to act. 

00:37:52.336 --> 00:37:55.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just pray to Jehovah, please, 
to first give me the power to read 

00:37:55.539 --> 00:37:58.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the desire follows. 

00:37:58.909 --> 00:38:02.413 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then I decided 
to simply start and stick with it. 

00:38:02.413 --> 00:38:04.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started with reading my favorite book, 

00:38:04.548 --> 00:38:07.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that way it was easier for me. 

00:38:07.752 --> 00:38:12.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I started with Genesis 
just to get through the whole Bible. 

00:38:12.857 --> 00:38:15.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
My favorite Bible book is Esther. 

00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
And because I think 
she was a very special person, 

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:21.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
it was especially then that I could imagine 

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:25.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
what her situation was like 
and what kind of a person she was 

00:38:25.102 --> 00:38:29.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I could see myself in the account. 

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:32.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
The weekly Bible reading program 
has been such a guideline. 

00:38:32.443 --> 00:38:35.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s motivating since we discuss 
this content at the meetings, 

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I could use the study aids 
in our workbook too. 

00:38:38.716 --> 00:38:41.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can better relate 
to the brothers’ and sisters’ comments 

00:38:41.385 --> 00:38:44.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you’ve read the material yourself, 
and I can comment too. 

00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:49.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I’m reading the Bible 
in the <i>JW Library </i>app on my phone, 

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is, of course, 
the risk that it vibrates, 

00:38:51.962 --> 00:38:53.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I get a message. 

00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:57.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then, of course, you have the urge 
to check to see who just wrote me. 

00:38:57.368 --> 00:39:00.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me personally, then, it’s really helpful 

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:02.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
when I put my phone in airplane mode 

00:39:02.273 --> 00:39:04.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I can really focus 
on what I’m reading 

00:39:04.542 --> 00:39:08.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
and nothing can distract me. 

00:39:08.579 --> 00:39:12.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
I like reading at home, 
but I also like to do it outdoors 

00:39:12.483 --> 00:39:15.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
because I think that’s 
where you’re closest to Jehovah. 

00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:19.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never just read about the events 
that are described in the Bible, 

00:39:19.724 --> 00:39:21.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
but I ask myself questions like: 

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Why did Jehovah have this written down? 

00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:25.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is in there for me personally?’ 

00:39:25.963 --> 00:39:29.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
This helps me to stay focused 
and not just scratch the surface; 

00:39:29.667 --> 00:39:31.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
otherwise, my mind 
would immediately start wandering. 

00:39:33.471 --> 00:39:36.006 line:90% position:50% align:center
At a convention, 
I learned something that helps me 

00:39:36.006 --> 00:39:38.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
to really take in the things I read. 

00:39:38.242 --> 00:39:40.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
The point discussed 
was to remember to look 

00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:44.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
in four different directions 
when meditating, so to speak. 

00:39:44.281 --> 00:39:48.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
First, look upwards 
to find out exactly what I am learning 

00:39:48.686 --> 00:39:50.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the text about Jehovah; 

00:39:50.855 --> 00:39:55.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
then downwards to find out 
what it teaches me about his purpose, 

00:39:55.826 --> 00:39:58.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
about what he wants for the earth; 

00:39:58.329 --> 00:40:02.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
then look at myself, 
how I can personally benefit now; 

00:40:02.933 --> 00:40:05.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
and eventually towards others, 

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:07.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking about how I can help other people 

00:40:07.371 --> 00:40:10.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
with this particular Bible text. 

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:15.813 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the <i>JW Library </i>app, there are 
four different colors for highlighting text, 

00:40:15.813 --> 00:40:19.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I simply use a different color 
for each of the four directions 

00:40:19.984 --> 00:40:24.522 line:90% position:50% align:center
and highlight them 
on my tablet or smartphone. 

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:27.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, one of my hobbies is drawing. 

00:40:27.992 --> 00:40:30.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
I decided, one time, 
that I was going to draw 

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:33.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
the spiritual suit of armor, 
all of its different parts 

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their symbolic meanings. 

00:40:35.332 --> 00:40:38.536 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this especially helped me 
to actually see the benefit of it, 

00:40:38.536 --> 00:40:42.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see how many wonderful resources 
Jehovah provides us with 

00:40:42.239 --> 00:40:44.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that he never leaves us alone. 

00:40:44.909 --> 00:40:47.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing 
I like very much is the category 

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:50.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Bible Study Activities” 
where you can directly pick a topic 

00:40:50.481 --> 00:40:52.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you personally find interesting 

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:54.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then read that. 

00:40:54.318 --> 00:40:55.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s Jehovah’s Word. 

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:58.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
I love him and also want 
to please him, of course. 

00:40:58.022 --> 00:41:01.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why it’s very important 
to understand his Word. 

00:41:01.759 --> 00:41:03.994 line:90% position:50% align:center
It feels really good when you’ve understood 

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:06.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
a difficult phrase by doing it this way. 

00:41:06.330 --> 00:41:09.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
It actually makes you feel 
like you’ve achieved something, 

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this brings you a lot closer to Jehovah. 

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:16.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
It happens often that you don’t even know 
what you should pray about 

00:41:16.674 --> 00:41:20.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
or what you could thank Jehovah for. 

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:22.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
My personal Bible reading 
has helped me with this a lot 

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:25.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
because now I know exactly 
what I want to tell Jehovah. 

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:29.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
Daily Bible reading is very important to me 

00:41:29.119 --> 00:41:32.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
as it gives me some sort 
of inner balance when I face situations 

00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:35.593 line:90% position:50% align:center
that may be unfamiliar or shake me up. 

00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:37.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know that no matter what the problem is,

00:41:37.862 --> 00:41:41.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah always has the right answer prepared.

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:44.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the beginning, it is really hard. 

00:41:44.201 --> 00:41:47.805 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have to fight to keep it up, 
and you definitely need discipline. 

00:41:47.805 --> 00:41:50.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
But after a while, 
you truly start to enjoy it 

00:41:50.908 --> 00:41:52.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it gets easier and easier 

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:55.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you’re happy 
that you started in the first place. 

00:41:55.246 --> 00:41:59.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really think that when Jehovah sees 
how much effort you put into it, 

00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:02.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is genuinely proud of you, 

00:42:02.253 --> 00:42:05.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s the best thing 
that can happen to you. 

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:17.801 line:90% position:50% align:center
These young brothers and sisters 
didn’t just acquire knowledge; 

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:20.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
they drew closer to Jehovah. 

00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:24.108 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will help them build 
a fine foundation for their future, 

00:42:24.108 --> 00:42:26.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you can too. 

00:42:26.243 --> 00:42:28.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
It may not be easy at first, 

00:42:28.479 --> 00:42:30.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as one young brother suggested, 

00:42:30.814 --> 00:42:33.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
start with something 
that captures your interest. 

00:42:33.517 --> 00:42:37.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
Try using the <i>JW Library </i>app 
or a handy notebook 

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:41.926 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep track of points you hope 
to apply or discuss at family worship. 

00:42:41.926 --> 00:42:44.528 line:90% position:50% align:center
This will make it 
a part of your daily routine 

00:42:44.528 --> 00:42:46.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you look forward to. 

00:42:47.498 --> 00:42:49.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Each segment 
in the program has highlighted 

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:53.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
some way we can build 
a strong relationship with God. 

00:42:53.571 --> 00:42:56.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our music video depicts the joy of marriage, 

00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:59.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah is part of a threefold cord 

00:42:59.710 --> 00:43:02.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
—one that cannot quickly be torn apart. 

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:06.984 line:90% position:50% align:center
The song is called “Truly in Love.” 

00:43:17.528 --> 00:43:29.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
There is a gift that comes from above,
A lovely gift called being in love.

00:43:29.907 --> 00:43:41.919 line:90% position:50% align:center
When two hearts begin to beat as one,
Then a wonderful time has begun.

00:43:45.756 --> 00:43:51.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s simple, so easy.
And it’s something we know.

00:43:51.161 --> 00:43:57.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.

00:43:57.668 --> 00:44:08.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love

00:44:08.646 --> 00:44:21.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
With someone like you,
Someone like you.

00:44:22.826 --> 00:44:34.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trials will come our way,
But our love will grow stronger each day.

00:44:34.038 --> 00:44:45.683 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will build a bond that no one can break.
We will build a love that no one will take.

00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:49.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, no, no one, no.

00:44:49.987 --> 00:44:55.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s simple, so easy.
And it’s something we know.

00:44:55.492 --> 00:45:01.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.

00:45:01.432 --> 00:45:12.643 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love

00:45:12.643 --> 00:45:24.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
With someone like you,
Someone like you.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:38.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nothing can destroy our love.
This precious gift is from our God up above.

00:45:38.368 --> 00:45:44.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
Exclusive devotion​
—‘love’s as strong as death.’

00:45:44.007 --> 00:45:50.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
You are “bone of my bones”; 
you are “flesh of my flesh,”

00:45:50.013 --> 00:46:04.027 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such an excellent woman in all that you do.
I will spend all my life loving you.

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:16.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
I want you to know how I feel
’Cause my love for you is so very real.

00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:29.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
I bless the day you came into my life.
I bless the day I made you my wife.

00:46:30.654 --> 00:46:32.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, I do.

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:38.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s simple, so easy.
And it’s something we know.

00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:44.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a threefold cord,
Love will grow.

00:46:44.501 --> 00:46:55.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
With Jehovah to guide us in all that we do,
How I love to be truly in love

00:46:55.612 --> 00:47:09.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
With someone like you,
Someone like you.

00:47:09.259 --> 00:47:20.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
How I love to be truly in love
With someone like you.

00:47:24.408 --> 00:47:28.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
So many of our brothers and sisters 
can agree with the words of that song: 

00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
“With a threefold cord, love will grow.” 

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:37.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
In marriage, in youth, 

00:47:37.821 --> 00:47:40.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
really, in all things we’ve considered, 

00:47:40.224 --> 00:47:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will be there to guide us. 

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:45.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
What will be the result? 

00:47:45.195 --> 00:47:47.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll find the warmth and security 

00:47:47.898 --> 00:47:50.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
of being securely wrapped 

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.436 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s “bag of life.” 

00:47:53.737 --> 00:47:56.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you enjoyed our program. 

00:47:56.073 --> 00:47:57.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
We conclude by heading 

00:47:57.574 --> 00:48:00.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the beautiful tropical island 
of Sri Lanka, 

00:48:00.444 --> 00:48:03.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
off the southeast coast 
of India in the Indian Ocean. 

00:48:05.449 --> 00:48:09.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
Over 6,000 publishers 
make up the 112 congregations on the island, 

00:48:09.653 --> 00:48:12.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
including 13 isolated groups. 

00:48:12.689 --> 00:48:14.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you travel throughout the country, 

00:48:14.992 --> 00:48:18.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
the scars of the decades-long civil war 
are still evident. 

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:21.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, our brothers and sisters display 

00:48:21.965 --> 00:48:24.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
the beautiful spirit of Christian unity. 

00:48:24.968 --> 00:48:27.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
Publishers preach the good news 
to those on the coast, 

00:48:28.005 --> 00:48:30.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
high in the mountains, 

00:48:30.007 --> 00:48:33.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
and in the bustling cities. 

00:48:33.043 --> 00:48:35.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
More than 8,000 Bible studies 
are being conducted, 

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:39.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
and over 650 brothers and sisters 
are in the pioneer work. 

00:48:39.883 --> 00:48:43.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because of the dense population 
in the city of Colombo, 

00:48:43.754 --> 00:48:48.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
those in metropolitan witnessing 
see an average of almost 17,000 people 

00:48:48.759 --> 00:48:51.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
in just one 8-hour period. 

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:54.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
High in Sri Lanka’s tea mountains 

00:48:54.631 --> 00:48:58.969 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a small congregation 
in the town of Badulla. 

00:48:58.969 --> 00:49:02.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their productive ministry takes them 
into banana plantations, 

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:05.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
jungles, and mountain tea estates 
as they search 

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:08.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
for those receptive to the good news. 

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:11.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite differing ethnic backgrounds, 

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:15.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re completely united 
in worship and brotherly affection. 

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our brothers and sisters 
who are wrapped up 

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:19.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Jehovah’s “bag of life” 

00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:21.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
send you their warm love and greetings 

00:49:21.591 --> 00:49:23.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the mountaintops of Sri Lanka! 

00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you for watching. 

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:28.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:31.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
