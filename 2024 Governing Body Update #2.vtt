00:00:02.064 --> 00:00:04.150 line:10% position:50% align:center
Welcome to our update!

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:08.738 line:10% position:50% align:center
How did the 2023 annual meeting affect you?

00:00:08.738 --> 00:00:11.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember the information
that highlighted Jehovah

00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the merciful “Judge of all the earth”?

00:00:15.203 --> 00:00:18.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were thrilled to learn
that individuals who died

00:00:18.206 --> 00:00:20.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Flood of Noah’s day,

00:00:20.208 --> 00:00:22.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah,

00:00:22.836 --> 00:00:26.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and even some who might repent
during the great tribulation

00:00:26.673 --> 00:00:30.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
could benefit from Jehovah’s mercy.

00:00:30.052 --> 00:00:32.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since hearing that information,

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:36.767 line:90% position:50% align:center
have you found yourself
thinking a lot about Jehovah’s mercy?

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:39.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, so has the Governing Body.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
In our prayerful study,

00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
meditation, and discussions,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve focused our attention

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:49.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how Jehovah has dealt with people

00:00:49.364 --> 00:00:52.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
who engaged in serious sin.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this update, we’ll briefly consider

00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:59.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
the pattern Jehovah set in the Bible record.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then, we’ll discuss some new information

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
regarding the way we’ll handle
cases of wrongdoing

00:01:05.172 --> 00:01:07.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the Christian congregation.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
Second Peter 3:9 tells us

00:01:11.762 --> 00:01:15.724 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah “does not desire
anyone to be destroyed

00:01:15.724 --> 00:01:20.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
but desires all to attain to repentance.”

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:22.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does that teach us?

00:01:22.356 --> 00:01:24.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps us understand

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah wants people
to repent and gain life.

00:01:29.531 --> 00:01:31.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
When the first human couple rebelled,

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
they condemned the human race
to sin and death.

00:01:36.955 --> 00:01:38.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jehovah do?

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:41.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took immediate steps

00:01:41.001 --> 00:01:45.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help as many of their descendants
as possible to gain life.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:49.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through the sacrifice of Jesus,

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah arranged to cover the sins

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
of all who would exercise faith and repent.

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:59.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
Such ones can live forever.

00:01:59.103 --> 00:02:03.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s not surprising
that throughout the Bible record,

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:07.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find Jehovah
appealing to sinners to repent.

00:02:07.946 --> 00:02:12.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
He urges those
who have strayed from true worship to return.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is in harmony with Romans 2:4,

00:02:16.955 --> 00:02:18.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
which says:

00:02:18.165 --> 00:02:22.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Or do you despise
the riches of his kindness

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and forbearance and patience,

00:02:25.214 --> 00:02:29.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
“because you do not know that God
in his kindness

00:02:29.844 --> 00:02:33.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
is trying to lead you to repentance?”

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider some examples
in which we see Jehovah

00:02:37.477 --> 00:02:40.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
trying to lead sinners to repentance.

00:02:41.231 --> 00:02:44.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cain showed murderous hatred
for his brother Abel,

00:02:44.818 --> 00:02:49.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
but Jehovah reached out to Cain
and tried to reason with him.

00:02:50.031 --> 00:02:53.660 line:90% position:50% align:center
When David sinned,
Jehovah used the prophet Nathan

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead David to repentance.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what about the nation of Israel?

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:02.378 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah kept appealing to them,

00:03:02.378 --> 00:03:05.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
even when they showed no desire to repent.

00:03:06.173 --> 00:03:08.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Ezekiel 33:11,

00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:10.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah appeals to the nation of Israel:

00:03:11.596 --> 00:03:14.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As surely as I am alive, . . .

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I take no pleasure
in the death of the wicked,

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.482 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but rather that someone wicked
changes his way

00:03:22.482 --> 00:03:24.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and keeps living.

00:03:24.234 --> 00:03:28.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Turn back, turn back from your bad ways,

00:03:28.655 --> 00:03:32.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
for why should you die, O house of Israel?”

00:03:32.326 --> 00:03:35.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does this teach us?

00:03:35.037 --> 00:03:39.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
That while Jehovah
doesn’t force anyone to repent of his sins,

00:03:39.249 --> 00:03:42.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
he has demonstrated great compassion

00:03:42.336 --> 00:03:44.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
for imperfect humans.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s gone to great lengths
to make forgiveness possible,

00:03:47.967 --> 00:03:50.470 line:90% position:50% align:center
to appeal to sinners,

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to lead them to repentance
if at all possible.

00:03:55.308 --> 00:03:59.854 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a compassionate
and merciful God we worship!

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:03.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body
has prayerfully considered

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
how Jehovah’s mercy could be better reflected

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:10.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
when dealing with wrongdoers
in the congregation.

00:04:10.324 --> 00:04:15.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s led to a clearer understanding
of three scriptures.

00:04:15.162 --> 00:04:17.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s consider the first.

00:04:17.498 --> 00:04:22.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s 2 Timothy 2:24, 25.

00:04:22.336 --> 00:04:24.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
There Paul said:

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:28.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For a slave of the Lord
does not need to fight,

00:04:28.426 --> 00:04:31.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but needs to be gentle toward all,

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
“qualified to teach,
showing restraint when wronged,

00:04:35.391 --> 00:04:38.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
“instructing with mildness

00:04:38.144 --> 00:04:41.565 line:90% position:50% align:center
“those not favorably disposed.

00:04:41.565 --> 00:04:44.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Perhaps God may give them repentance

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:47.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
leading to an accurate knowledge of truth.”

00:04:47.362 --> 00:04:49.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
To whom was Paul referring

00:04:49.698 --> 00:04:53.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
when he mentioned
“those not favorably disposed”?

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:58.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
A study note on 2 Timothy 2:25 explains:

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:03.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul uses a Greek word that in this context

00:05:03.087 --> 00:05:06.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
“refers to people
who resist Christian teachings

00:05:06.716 --> 00:05:11.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or who place themselves
in opposition to them.

00:05:11.179 --> 00:05:15.433 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul may have had in mind, among others,
those in the congregation

00:05:15.433 --> 00:05:18.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in Ephesus who had a negative attitude

00:05:18.937 --> 00:05:21.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
“toward following Scriptural counsel

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
or heeding admonition
from brothers taking the lead.”

00:05:26.403 --> 00:05:30.783 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today, this could include
brothers and sisters in the congregation

00:05:30.783 --> 00:05:33.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
who disregard Scriptural counsel

00:05:33.202 --> 00:05:36.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
and become involved in serious wrongdoing.

00:05:36.831 --> 00:05:39.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone who gets involved
in serious wrongdoing

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:41.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
needs help from the elders,

00:05:41.836 --> 00:05:45.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
so a committee of elders
meets with the wrongdoer.

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
The goal of these elders

00:05:47.592 --> 00:05:51.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
isn’t merely to judge
whether the wrongdoer is repentant

00:05:51.596 --> 00:05:54.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
but also to act in harmony

00:05:54.224 --> 00:05:58.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
with 2 Timothy 2:24, 25.

00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:00.439 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders must correct

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:04.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
and instruct the wrongdoer with mildness.

00:06:04.151 --> 00:06:06.362 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is their goal?

00:06:06.362 --> 00:06:11.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice what another study note
on 2 Timothy 2:25 says.

00:06:11.992 --> 00:06:14.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When a Christian elder mildly corrects

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or instructs ‘those not favorably disposed,’

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:23.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the good result may be repentance,
or ‘a change of mind.’

00:06:23.755 --> 00:06:27.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The credit for such a change
in thinking and attitude

00:06:27.133 --> 00:06:30.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“goes, not to any human, but to Jehovah,

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:34.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
“who helps the wayward Christian
make this vital change.

00:06:34.725 --> 00:06:38.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Paul goes on to mention
some of the beautiful results

00:06:38.145 --> 00:06:39.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of such repentance

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:44.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—it leads the sinner
to a more accurate knowledge of the truth,

00:06:44.443 --> 00:06:47.905 line:90% position:50% align:center
“it helps him come back to his proper senses,

00:06:47.905 --> 00:06:52.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it enables him
to escape from Satan’s snares.”

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the elders have the goal

00:06:54.704 --> 00:06:58.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
of leading the wrongdoer to repentance.

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:03.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
How does a clearer understanding
of 2 Timothy 2:24, 25

00:07:03.338 --> 00:07:05.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
adjust our current arrangement?

00:07:06.508 --> 00:07:08.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Presently, a committee of elders

00:07:08.635 --> 00:07:12.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
normally meets
with a wrongdoer only one time.

00:07:12.514 --> 00:07:15.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the Governing Body has decided

00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:19.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the committee may decide
to meet with the person more than once.

00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:07:21.065 --> 00:07:25.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Revelation 2:21,
regarding “that woman Jezebel,”

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:29.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus said: “I gave her time to repent.”

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:34.329 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope that
through the loving efforts of the elders,

00:07:34.329 --> 00:07:36.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah will help a wayward Christian

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:40.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
to come back to his proper senses and repent.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
If he repents,

00:07:42.629 --> 00:07:44.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
the committee will provide shepherding

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:48.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the person
can escape from Satan’s snares

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:52.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
and keep making straight paths for his feet.

00:07:52.181 --> 00:07:54.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
This arrangement reflects the same effort

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:56.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah personally made

00:07:56.977 --> 00:08:00.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help David
and the nation of Israel to repent.

00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:06.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about baptized minors
—those under 18 years of age—

00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:09.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
who engage in serious wrongdoing?

00:08:10.283 --> 00:08:12.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under our current arrangement,

00:08:12.452 --> 00:08:16.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
such a baptized minor
along with his Christian parents

00:08:16.206 --> 00:08:19.125 line:90% position:50% align:center
must meet with a committee of elders.

00:08:19.125 --> 00:08:21.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under our new arrangement,

00:08:21.336 --> 00:08:25.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
two elders will meet
with the minor and his Christian parents.

00:08:25.507 --> 00:08:29.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders will find out
what steps the parents have already taken

00:08:29.845 --> 00:08:33.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help their child come to repentance.

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:38.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the minor has a good attitude
and the parents are reaching him,

00:08:38.062 --> 00:08:40.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two elders might decide

00:08:40.064 --> 00:08:44.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it isn’t necessary
to take the matter any further.

00:08:44.068 --> 00:08:47.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the elders
will occasionally check with the parents

00:08:47.739 --> 00:08:51.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that the minor
is getting the help he needs.

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, what if a baptized minor

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:58.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
unrepentantly persists in a wrong course?

00:08:59.709 --> 00:09:03.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that case, a committee of elders
would meet with him

00:09:03.922 --> 00:09:06.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
along with his Christian parents.

00:09:06.758 --> 00:09:09.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body is confident

00:09:09.011 --> 00:09:12.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
that these adjustments
reflect Jehovah’s desire

00:09:12.348 --> 00:09:15.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead sinners to repentance.

00:09:15.226 --> 00:09:17.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wants them to “come to their senses

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.690 line:90% position:50% align:center
and escape from the snare of the Devil.”

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:24.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He does not desire anyone to be destroyed

00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:27.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
but desires all to attain to repentance.”

00:09:28.823 --> 00:09:31.368 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s move on to our second scripture.

00:09:31.368 --> 00:09:35.205 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s 1 Corinthians 5:13, which says:

00:09:35.747 --> 00:09:39.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Remove the wicked person
from among yourselves.”

00:09:40.419 --> 00:09:44.298 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible clearly teaches
that an unrepentant wrongdoer

00:09:44.298 --> 00:09:47.843 line:90% position:50% align:center
should be removed from the congregation.

00:09:47.843 --> 00:09:52.264 line:90% position:50% align:center
And really, it’s a consequence
that the wrongdoer has chosen.

00:09:52.264 --> 00:09:54.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why so?

00:09:54.266 --> 00:09:56.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he refuses to respond

00:09:56.686 --> 00:09:59.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
to repeated loving attempts by the elders

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:02.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead him to repentance.

00:10:03.026 --> 00:10:05.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when the elders inform a person

00:10:05.361 --> 00:10:08.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he’s being removed
from the congregation,

00:10:08.073 --> 00:10:10.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
he won’t be left hopeless.

00:10:10.492 --> 00:10:13.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
The committee will not simply explain

00:10:13.078 --> 00:10:17.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
what steps he can take
to be welcomed back into the congregation.

00:10:17.916 --> 00:10:19.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
What else will they do?

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:22.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
The elders will explain that they’d like

00:10:22.713 --> 00:10:26.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
to meet with the individual again
after a few months

00:10:26.216 --> 00:10:29.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
to see if he’s had a change of heart.

00:10:29.261 --> 00:10:32.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
If the individual is willing to meet,

00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:35.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders will make a warm appeal

00:10:35.017 --> 00:10:37.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
for him to repent and return.

00:10:38.855 --> 00:10:42.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about individuals
who were disfellowshipped in the past,

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps even many years ago?

00:10:45.362 --> 00:10:47.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
In some cases,
they may not even recall

00:10:47.989 --> 00:10:49.991 line:90% position:50% align:center
the reason they were disfellowshipped.

00:10:49.991 --> 00:10:53.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may have abandoned
their wrong course years ago.

00:10:54.204 --> 00:10:56.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Governing Body has decided

00:10:56.206 --> 00:11:00.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the elders should visit such ones,
pray with them,

00:11:00.586 --> 00:11:05.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make a warm appeal for them
to return to the congregation.

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
If a person has been away
from the congregation for many years,

00:11:09.971 --> 00:11:13.808 line:90% position:50% align:center
he would no doubt be very weak spiritually.

00:11:13.808 --> 00:11:17.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, if such a person is willing,

00:11:17.562 --> 00:11:20.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders could arrange for him
to have a Bible study

00:11:20.815 --> 00:11:23.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
even before he’s reinstated.

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:25.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, the individual

00:11:25.612 --> 00:11:28.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
would have to want
to return to the congregation,

00:11:28.448 --> 00:11:33.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the elders would always be the ones
to arrange for such a study.

00:11:34.163 --> 00:11:39.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
In imitation of Jehovah’s mercy
toward imperfect sinners,

00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:43.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
we want to reach out
and help as many as possible

00:11:43.214 --> 00:11:45.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
to know that the door is open

00:11:45.633 --> 00:11:48.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
for them to come back to the congregation.

00:11:49.512 --> 00:11:54.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you are a disfellowshipped person
listening to this update,

00:11:54.517 --> 00:11:58.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
we urge you
to accept the efforts of the elders

00:11:58.354 --> 00:12:01.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help you return to the congregation.

00:12:01.942 --> 00:12:05.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re living in an area
where you don’t know the local elders,

00:12:05.987 --> 00:12:10.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
please feel free to call
or visit the local Kingdom Hall

00:12:10.075 --> 00:12:13.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and request spiritual assistance.

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.833 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants you to come home,
and we do too.

00:12:19.293 --> 00:12:22.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
In keeping with the Scriptural admonition

00:12:22.046 --> 00:12:25.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 1 Corinthians 5:11,

00:12:25.007 --> 00:12:28.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
when a person has been removed
from the congregation,

00:12:28.553 --> 00:12:31.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
we “stop keeping company” with that person,

00:12:31.472 --> 00:12:33.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“not even eating with such a man.”

00:12:34.726 --> 00:12:36.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means we don’t socialize

00:12:36.936 --> 00:12:39.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
with those who are removed
from the congregation.

00:12:40.357 --> 00:12:43.151 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, that does not mean

00:12:43.151 --> 00:12:46.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
that a Christian could not invite
a disfellowshipped person

00:12:46.613 --> 00:12:49.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
to attend a congregation meeting.

00:12:49.533 --> 00:12:52.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
That disfellowshipped person
could be a relative,

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:57.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
a former Bible student,
or someone we were close to in the past.

00:12:58.667 --> 00:13:02.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
How appropriate
this adjustment is at this time,

00:13:02.797 --> 00:13:07.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we’re preparing for the most important
meeting of the year, the Memorial,

00:13:07.802 --> 00:13:11.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
which will be held on Sunday, March 24!

00:13:12.849 --> 00:13:16.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
What if a disfellowshipped person
comes to a congregation meeting?

00:13:17.187 --> 00:13:20.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
Under our current arrangement,
we don’t say a greeting

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
to individuals who’ve been removed
from the congregation.

00:13:24.111 --> 00:13:26.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the Governing Body

00:13:26.613 --> 00:13:28.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
has decided that publishers

00:13:28.449 --> 00:13:31.827 line:90% position:50% align:center
can use their Bible-trained conscience

00:13:31.827 --> 00:13:34.622 line:90% position:50% align:center
to decide whether to give a simple greeting

00:13:34.622 --> 00:13:37.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
and welcome a disfellowshipped individual

00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:39.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
who attends a congregation meeting.

00:13:39.961 --> 00:13:41.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hi.

00:13:41.838 --> 00:13:43.965 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s so good to see you here<i>.</i>

00:13:45.049 --> 00:13:47.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you.

00:13:49.679 --> 00:13:52.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
While we wouldn’t have
an extended conversation

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:55.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
or socialize with such a person,

00:13:55.894 --> 00:13:59.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do not need to ignore him completely.

00:14:01.108 --> 00:14:03.986 line:90% position:50% align:center
That brings us to our third scripture.

00:14:03.986 --> 00:14:06.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s 2 John 9-11.

00:14:07.698 --> 00:14:09.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we read:

00:14:09.116 --> 00:14:13.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Everyone who pushes ahead
and does not remain

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in the teaching of the Christ

00:14:15.122 --> 00:14:17.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
“does not have God.

00:14:17.208 --> 00:14:19.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The one who does remain in this teaching

00:14:19.836 --> 00:14:23.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is the one who has
both the Father and the Son.

00:14:23.715 --> 00:14:28.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If anyone comes to you
and does not bring this teaching,

00:14:28.219 --> 00:14:33.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“do not receive him into your homes
or say a greeting to him.

00:14:33.141 --> 00:14:35.644 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For the one who says a greeting to him

00:14:35.644 --> 00:14:38.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a sharer in his wicked works.”

00:14:39.314 --> 00:14:42.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
But doesn’t 2 John 9-11 tell us

00:14:42.109 --> 00:14:44.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to say a greeting to anyone

00:14:44.612 --> 00:14:46.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
who’s been removed from the congregation?

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
In examining the context of those verses,

00:14:50.785 --> 00:14:52.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body has concluded

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:56.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the apostle John
was really describing apostates

00:14:56.958 --> 00:15:00.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and others
who actively promoted wrong conduct.

00:15:01.337 --> 00:15:04.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
For good reason,
John strongly directed Christians

00:15:04.883 --> 00:15:07.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
not even to greet such a person

00:15:07.719 --> 00:15:10.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of his contaminating influence.

00:15:11.348 --> 00:15:16.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
Therefore, if a disfellowshipped individual
is a known apostate

00:15:16.353 --> 00:15:20.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
or someone
who actively promotes wrongdoing,

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
the elders would not visit him.

00:15:22.902 --> 00:15:26.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
Neither would individual Christians
greet such a person

00:15:26.238 --> 00:15:29.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
or invite him to attend
a congregation meeting.

00:15:31.452 --> 00:15:35.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
In this update,
we’ve examined Jehovah’s desire

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:38.418 line:90% position:50% align:center
to lead sinners to repentance

00:15:38.418 --> 00:15:42.213 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ve received clarification
on three scriptures

00:15:42.213 --> 00:15:45.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
that relate to how wrongdoers
should be dealt with.

00:15:46.343 --> 00:15:50.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with 2 Timothy 2:24, 25,

00:15:50.514 --> 00:15:53.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
a committee of elders will lovingly correct

00:15:53.725 --> 00:15:56.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
and instruct a wrongdoer

00:15:56.020 --> 00:15:59.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the goal of leading him to repentance.

00:16:00.483 --> 00:16:03.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
As outlined at 1 Corinthians 5:13,

00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:06.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
a person who refuses to repent

00:16:06.822 --> 00:16:10.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be removed from the congregation.

00:16:10.201 --> 00:16:12.704 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, the committee will still try

00:16:12.704 --> 00:16:16.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help him see the need
to repent and return

00:16:16.458 --> 00:16:20.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
and will arrange
for a follow-up meeting in a few months.

00:16:21.004 --> 00:16:23.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
We also clarified our understanding

00:16:23.381 --> 00:16:25.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
of 2 John 9-11,

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:29.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
which we learned
applies specifically to apostates

00:16:29.596 --> 00:16:33.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
and others
who actively promote wrong conduct,

00:16:33.392 --> 00:16:36.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to all those who have been removed

00:16:36.187 --> 00:16:38.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the congregation.

00:16:38.814 --> 00:16:41.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ever since the first human couple sinned,

00:16:41.609 --> 00:16:46.197 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has been working
to rescue repentant humans.

00:16:46.197 --> 00:16:48.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, Jehovah isn’t permissive,

00:16:48.992 --> 00:16:52.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he doesn’t shield unrepentant wrongdoers

00:16:52.287 --> 00:16:55.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the consequences of their actions.

00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still, in his love,

00:16:58.293 --> 00:17:01.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah wants sinners
to become reconciled to him

00:17:01.838 --> 00:17:04.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
if at all possible.

00:17:04.049 --> 00:17:07.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
He doesn’t want anyone to be destroyed,

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:09.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
so he appeals to them to repent.

00:17:10.639 --> 00:17:15.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
Elders are privileged
to be fellow workers with Jehovah

00:17:15.394 --> 00:17:19.231 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they work to help sinners
come to repentance.

00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:23.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our love for Jehovah continues to deepen

00:17:23.903 --> 00:17:27.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we meditate on his love,

00:17:27.073 --> 00:17:30.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
mercy, and compassion.

00:17:30.452 --> 00:17:32.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know you’ll be happy to hear

00:17:32.537 --> 00:17:35.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
that the information contained in this update

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
will be published in a series of articles

00:17:38.377 --> 00:17:42.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
that will appear
in the study edition of <i>The Watchtower</i>.

00:17:42.881 --> 00:17:46.218 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition,
the elders will receive direction

00:17:46.218 --> 00:17:49.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
on how to apply this information.

00:17:49.972 --> 00:17:52.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah bless us

00:17:52.641 --> 00:17:55.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we work to implement these arrangements

00:17:55.853 --> 00:17:59.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
that reflect his love and mercy.

00:18:00.024 --> 00:18:01.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we conclude,

00:18:01.859 --> 00:18:06.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Governing Body has asked me
to read the following announcement:

00:18:07.449 --> 00:18:09.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The Governing Body has decided
