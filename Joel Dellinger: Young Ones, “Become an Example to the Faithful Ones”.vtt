00:01.818 --> 00:04.153
During the past five years,


00:04.153 --> 00:07.356
over 1.3 million faithful ones


00:07.357 --> 00:09.425
have symbolized their dedication 


00:09.425 --> 00:11.795
to Jehovah by water baptism. 


00:11.795 --> 00:15.000
That’s an average 
of over 700 each day. 


00:16.232 --> 00:19.135
And among those
courageously taking their stand


00:19.135 --> 00:22.038
for true worship
are thousands of children,


00:22.038 --> 00:25.041
teenagers, and young adults. 


00:25.042 --> 00:27.044
Young brothers and sisters,


00:27.043 --> 00:29.845
we know it is not always easy 


00:29.845 --> 00:32.815
to serve Jehovah
and live up to your dedication. 


00:32.815 --> 00:34.317
Like older ones,


00:34.317 --> 00:38.855
you need to be encouraged
and strengthened spiritually. 


00:38.855 --> 00:42.492
With that in mind,
our theme this month is


00:42.492 --> 00:46.864
“Young Ones, ‘Become an Example
to the Faithful Ones.’”


00:46.863 --> 00:50.133
It is based on the inspiring true-life story


00:50.133 --> 00:53.603
of a young Christian named Timothy.


00:53.603 --> 00:56.105
Before we discuss Timothy’s example, 


00:56.105 --> 00:59.875
did you know that the Bible
specifically foretold


00:59.875 --> 01:04.747
that many young people would take 
sides with Jehovah in our time? 


01:04.747 --> 01:08.184
Let’s look at this at Psalm 110:3. 


01:08.183 --> 01:10.420
And as we read it together, 


01:10.420 --> 01:15.425
note how young ones are having a share 
in fulfilling this prophecy.


01:15.425 --> 01:18.795
Notice the first part of verse 3,


01:18.795 --> 01:20.000
David sang: 


01:21.130 --> 01:24.200
“Your people will offer themselves willingly


01:24.200 --> 01:27.437
on the day of your military force.” 


01:27.437 --> 01:31.374
According to this prophecy, Jesus,
the Messianic King, 


01:31.373 --> 01:35.145
would have a large army
of willing supporters. 


01:35.145 --> 01:39.648
Since 1914, millions have carefully
investigated the facts


01:39.648 --> 01:43.886
and chosen to side with
Jehovah God and Jesus Christ. 


01:43.887 --> 01:46.890
But where do young ones
come into this picture?


01:46.890 --> 01:49.725
The rest of the verse continues:


01:49.725 --> 01:53.797
“In splendid holiness, 
from the womb of the dawn, 


01:53.797 --> 01:57.700
“you have your company of young men


01:57.700 --> 02:00.603
just like dewdrops.” 


02:00.603 --> 02:04.940
Here, the prophecy refers to a “company,”
or group, of young ones. 


02:04.940 --> 02:09.000
They also would study the evidence
and support God’s Kingdom.


02:10.547 --> 02:13.015
How many young people
did Jehovah foresee


02:13.015 --> 02:15.017
supporting true worship? 


02:15.017 --> 02:18.955
We get an idea by
the comparison made to dewdrops. 


02:18.955 --> 02:22.625
Have you have ever gone outside
early in the morning


02:22.625 --> 02:26.830
and noticed a light, sparkling coating
of water on the ground? 


02:26.830 --> 02:29.198
That may have been dew. 


02:29.198 --> 02:33.570
Jehovah designed our atmosphere so that,
under certain conditions,


02:33.570 --> 02:35.972
when the temperature
cools during the night,


02:35.972 --> 02:39.175
a blanket of moisture
forms on the ground. 


02:39.175 --> 02:44.347
That coating is made up
of a multitude of little drops.


02:44.347 --> 02:49.319
Young ones,
what does dew have to do with you? 


02:49.318 --> 02:53.656
In the Bible, dew is connected
with blessing and abundance. 


02:53.657 --> 02:56.192
Dewdrops are also refreshing,


02:56.192 --> 02:58.962
life-sustaining, and numerous. 


02:58.962 --> 03:01.932
Now, remember in Psalm 110:3, 


03:01.932 --> 03:05.100
Jehovah was looking ahead to our time. 


03:05.100 --> 03:08.137
And what did he see? 


03:08.137 --> 03:12.142
The September 15, 2002,
Watchtower on page 8


03:12.142 --> 03:14.144
explained it this way: 


03:14.143 --> 03:17.080
“Just like refreshing dewdrops, 


03:17.080 --> 03:21.317
“many young men and women
cheerfully serve God


03:21.317 --> 03:23.720
and assist their fellow worshipers.”


03:23.720 --> 03:27.990
Today, there are so many mature,


03:27.990 --> 03:31.593
bright, happy young ones
in the Christian congregation


03:31.593 --> 03:36.565
that they are like countless dewdrops
that sparkle in the morning sun. 


03:36.565 --> 03:39.735
You faithful children, teenagers,


03:39.735 --> 03:43.272
and young adults who have dedicated
your life to Jehovah


03:43.272 --> 03:45.809
or who are working toward that goal


03:45.808 --> 03:48.645
are living proof that Jehovah’s confidence


03:48.645 --> 03:51.613
in young people was never misplaced. 


03:51.613 --> 03:56.000
He cherishes you very much and so do we.


03:57.087 --> 04:01.257
Of course, knowing
that Jehovah has confidence in us


04:01.257 --> 04:03.425
can be very encouraging. 


04:03.425 --> 04:07.197
But what if doubts or negative thoughts 


04:07.197 --> 04:09.199
tend to bring us down? 


04:09.198 --> 04:12.601
On occasion,
a young Witness might wonder,


04:12.602 --> 04:16.505
‘Does anyone other
than Jehovah notice me? 


04:16.505 --> 04:20.000
Does my example really matter to others?’


04:21.377 --> 04:23.379
To address these questions,


04:23.378 --> 04:26.815
let’s now consider Timothy’s example. 


04:26.815 --> 04:28.818
Open your Bible, please,


04:28.818 --> 04:33.000
to our theme text at 1 Timothy 4:12. 


04:34.423 --> 04:37.626
When you find it, 
you might want to bookmark the verse


04:37.627 --> 04:41.530
because we want to first
understand the setting.


04:41.530 --> 04:44.967
How old was Timothy at this time? 


04:44.967 --> 04:47.204
Often, when thinking of Timothy, 


04:47.203 --> 04:51.473
I picture a teenager or a young man
in his early twenties. 


04:51.473 --> 04:53.676
And when he
first started traveling with Paul,


04:53.677 --> 04:55.679
he was about that age. 


04:55.678 --> 05:00.215
But several years passed 
before Paul wrote letters to Timothy. 


05:00.215 --> 05:03.052
So by the time
First Timothy was written,


05:03.052 --> 05:06.589
Timothy was likely in his early thirties.


05:06.588 --> 05:08.891
Now, what do you think? 


05:08.892 --> 05:13.830
Was Timothy young or old? 


05:13.830 --> 05:16.765
Some of you younger ones
may be thinking to yourselves,


05:16.765 --> 05:20.302
‘If he was over 30,
then he was old!’ 


05:20.302 --> 05:23.505
But remember,
a much older man like Paul


05:23.505 --> 05:26.208
would say that Timothy was quite young. 


05:26.208 --> 05:30.111
In fact, notice the expression
he uses when writing to Timothy.


05:30.112 --> 05:34.650
First Timothy 4:12, Paul says:


05:34.650 --> 05:39.655
“Never let anyone
look down on your youth. 


05:39.655 --> 05:43.893
“Instead, become an example 
to the faithful ones 


05:43.893 --> 05:47.296
“in speaking, in conduct, in love,


05:47.297 --> 05:50.000
in faith, in chasteness.” 


05:51.000 --> 05:56.005
Paul called Timothy a youth
and urged him to be a good example. 


05:56.005 --> 06:00.543
While Timothy may have been
in his early thirties at this time,


06:00.543 --> 06:03.278
remember that he was
taught about Jehovah


06:03.278 --> 06:05.313
from the time he was a baby,


06:05.313 --> 06:08.751
and he did well in the truth
as a young person. 


06:08.752 --> 06:12.455
In fact, when he was still a teenager
or in his early twenties, 


06:12.455 --> 06:16.325
the elders recommended him
to serve as a missionary with Paul. 


06:16.325 --> 06:20.228
So, in effect, 
Paul here is urging Timothy


06:20.228 --> 06:25.735
to continue to be 
a good example for others.


06:25.735 --> 06:28.000
What else do we know about Timothy? 


06:29.472 --> 06:32.709
He was not proud, or haughty. 


06:32.708 --> 06:37.045
He likely did not view himself
as some amazing example. 


06:37.045 --> 06:41.950
I’m sure he never dreamed
that one day Christians all over the world


06:41.950 --> 06:46.000
would study his life in detail
so as to imitate his faith. 


06:47.055 --> 06:52.060
Timothy was modest
—and this despite his privileges. 


06:52.060 --> 06:56.298
Paul’s words may indicate
that Timothy was somewhat shy. 


06:56.298 --> 06:58.133
Like many of us,


06:58.133 --> 07:02.605
he may have battled with feelings
of self-doubt on occasion.


07:02.605 --> 07:06.675
Based on this information,
let’s do something interesting now. 


07:06.675 --> 07:11.213
Let’s use our imagination
to visualize Timothy, 


07:11.213 --> 07:13.415
an elder in his early thirties, 


07:13.415 --> 07:16.285
coming to give a Scriptural talk
in the congregation. 


07:16.285 --> 07:18.053
Got the picture? 


07:18.053 --> 07:21.023
In your mind,
please look at Timothy


07:21.023 --> 07:23.625
and then look at the audience.


07:23.625 --> 07:26.195
Who do we see? 


07:26.195 --> 07:28.697
Many in attendance are old enough


07:28.697 --> 07:31.867
to be Timothy’s parents
or grandparents. 


07:31.867 --> 07:34.204
How do you think Timothy felt? 


07:34.203 --> 07:36.071
Super confident? 


07:36.072 --> 07:40.910
Are you visualizing him proudly walking
into the meeting place, saying,


07:40.910 --> 07:44.847
“I sure wish my friends back
in Lystra could see me now. 


07:44.847 --> 07:48.000
Look at the crowds
that come to hear me speak!” 


07:49.118 --> 07:53.788
No, that’s not the Timothy we know. 


07:53.788 --> 07:57.260
It’s much more likely that Timothy, 
like most of us,


07:57.260 --> 08:01.163
rehearsed his presentation
over and over again. 


08:01.163 --> 08:04.000
He probably prayed constantly, 


08:04.000 --> 08:08.237
and he probably still got nervous,
like all of us. 


08:08.237 --> 08:11.474
And remember,
Timothy did not have the benefit


08:11.473 --> 08:14.610
of theocratic schools like we do today.


08:14.610 --> 08:16.512
In summary, 


08:16.512 --> 08:19.515
what can we say about Timothy? 


08:19.515 --> 08:22.352
Like so many of you, 


08:22.352 --> 08:26.222
he was an example
of faith and obedience. 


08:26.222 --> 08:29.692
He was exceptional
in displaying Christian qualities, 


08:29.692 --> 08:32.362
such as modesty and humility. 


08:32.362 --> 08:36.165
But Timothy was a person
with normal human feelings,


08:36.165 --> 08:37.933
like all of us. 


08:37.933 --> 08:41.103
Though he had a rich,
happy life in Jehovah’s service,


08:41.103 --> 08:44.806
life in the old world
brought real tests and challenges. 


08:44.807 --> 08:48.310
Timothy also dealt with
frequent cases of sickness, 


08:48.310 --> 08:51.447
and he was imprisoned for a time. 


08:51.447 --> 08:54.050
Some of you in various countries


08:54.050 --> 08:57.553
can relate to those bitter experiences. 


08:57.553 --> 09:00.255
But Timothy endured. 


09:00.255 --> 09:04.760
Was he some “super Christian”
with superpowers? 


09:04.760 --> 09:09.000
No, but he did
prove to be a super example!


09:10.733 --> 09:13.668
How does all of this
help you Christian youths


09:13.668 --> 09:15.938
who have taken the commendable step


09:15.938 --> 09:18.000
to dedicate your lives to Jehovah? 


09:19.142 --> 09:23.879
We just read how Paul told Timothy
to let no one look down on his youth. 


09:23.878 --> 09:26.000
A few of you may be thinking,


09:27.250 --> 09:30.285
‘I wish someone would tell my parents


09:30.285 --> 09:33.822
‘or my elders not to look down on me. 


09:33.822 --> 09:36.000
They still treat me like a little kid.’ 


09:37.360 --> 09:40.428
If that’s the case, 
we feel for you. 


09:40.428 --> 09:45.000
No progressive young one
wants to be treated as if he were a child. 


09:46.102 --> 09:50.372
But let’s look again at 1 Timothy 4:12. 


09:50.372 --> 09:53.775
Is the apostle Paul speaking
to the congregation, 


09:53.775 --> 09:56.000
to parents, or to the elders?


09:57.280 --> 10:00.115
“Never let anyone look down


10:00.115 --> 10:02.785
“on your youth. 


10:02.785 --> 10:07.022
“Instead, become an example
to the faithful ones in speaking,


10:07.022 --> 10:12.362
in conduct, in love,
in faith, in chasteness.” 


10:12.362 --> 10:14.630
It’s clear, isn’t it? 


10:14.630 --> 10:17.300
Paul said your youth. 


10:17.300 --> 10:20.903
He was speaking only to Timothy.


10:20.903 --> 10:25.908
Young ones, by extension,
what is Jehovah saying to each of you? 


10:25.908 --> 10:30.913
It’s this: To gain and maintain
the respect of faithful ones,


10:30.913 --> 10:35.818
you have to work
at proving yourself as a Christian. 


10:35.818 --> 10:40.188
The key is not wanting or hoping
that others will respect you. 


10:40.188 --> 10:44.160
Rather, it’s earning such respect
by setting a good example


10:44.160 --> 10:46.028
in all areas of life. 


10:46.028 --> 10:47.663
If you do that, 


10:47.663 --> 10:51.000
then no one will have any legitimate reason
to look down on your youth. 


10:52.368 --> 10:58.540
Doesn’t it make sense
that we gain respect by earning it?


10:58.540 --> 11:01.677
We are confident
that you young ones are trying hard


11:01.677 --> 11:05.347
to live by Christian principles at school
and in the neighborhood. 


11:05.347 --> 11:11.087
But in verse 12, did you notice
who Timothy was to be an example to? 


11:11.087 --> 11:13.389
To “the faithful ones.” 


11:13.388 --> 11:17.325
Are you an example to Christians,
both younger and older, 


11:17.325 --> 11:20.162
in your congregation 
and in your circuit? 


11:20.162 --> 11:23.899
If you work on Kingdom Hall
construction projects or at Bethel,


11:23.898 --> 11:27.000
are you an example
to your fellow workers?


11:28.070 --> 11:32.842
Well, what are some specific ways
you can become an example 


11:32.842 --> 11:35.310
to all of these “faithful ones”? 


11:35.310 --> 11:38.780
In our theme text, 
Timothy was first directed


11:38.780 --> 11:41.000
to become an example in speaking. 


11:42.217 --> 11:45.554
On this topic,
I’ll never forget an illustration


11:45.553 --> 11:50.558
used in the “Young People Ask” article
from the January 2012 Awake! 


11:50.558 --> 11:54.096
It quoted a young man,
James, who said:


11:54.097 --> 11:59.102
“Once you squeeze toothpaste out,
you can’t put it back in the tube. 


11:59.102 --> 12:01.204
“The same is true with our words. 


12:01.203 --> 12:05.941
Once we say something hurtful, 
we can’t take it back.” 


12:05.942 --> 12:08.977
God’s Word agrees with James.


12:08.977 --> 12:14.317
Note what it says at Ephesians 4:29. 


12:14.317 --> 12:16.419
It tells us:


12:16.418 --> 12:20.455
“Let a rotten word
not come out of your mouth,


12:20.455 --> 12:24.093
“but only what is good
for building up as the need may be, 


12:24.093 --> 12:28.563
to impart what is beneficial
to the hearers.” 


12:28.563 --> 12:31.000
For some years now,
those getting baptized 


12:31.000 --> 12:33.368
have been encouraged 
to complete a study of the book,


12:33.368 --> 12:35.905
“Keep Yourselves in God’s Love.” 


12:35.905 --> 12:41.243
Chapter 12 is entitled
“Speak What ‘Is Good for Building Up.’” 


12:41.243 --> 12:45.346
On page 140, 
there is a box with five questions


12:45.347 --> 12:48.150
that can help us evaluate our speech. 


12:48.150 --> 12:49.985
For example: 


12:49.985 --> 12:54.557
“When was the last time I offered
someone specific commendation? 


12:54.557 --> 12:59.562
“Do I express my respect for others
by saying please and thank you? 


12:59.562 --> 13:03.632
“In conversation,
do I speak mainly about myself,


13:03.632 --> 13:08.037
or am I also interested
in the thoughts and feelings of others?”


13:08.037 --> 13:11.040
Young ones, 
over the next few days,


13:11.040 --> 13:15.410
why not review that box on page 140, 
look up the scriptures,


13:15.410 --> 13:19.013
and think about what Jehovah is saying? 


13:19.013 --> 13:22.685
Then apply what you learn to your speech. 


13:22.685 --> 13:25.855
Doing this will draw you closer to Jehovah


13:25.855 --> 13:29.492
and help you to become
an even better example


13:29.492 --> 13:31.000
to the faithful ones.


13:32.460 --> 13:35.130
The second area
mentioned in our theme text


13:35.130 --> 13:38.367
is becoming an example in conduct. 


13:38.367 --> 13:41.870
Of course,
upbuilding speech would be empty


13:41.870 --> 13:45.000
or hypocritical
if our conduct was questionable. 


13:46.342 --> 13:48.344
Think again about Timothy. 


13:48.343 --> 13:52.648
It wasn’t enough for him to give comments
and talks at the meetings


13:52.648 --> 13:54.816
or preach from door to door. 


13:54.817 --> 13:57.754
Later in the same letter,
Paul reminded Timothy


13:57.753 --> 14:01.690
that he needed to treat older men
and women as fathers and mothers;


14:01.690 --> 14:06.000
younger men and women
were to be treated as brothers and sisters. 


14:07.228 --> 14:10.165
Second Peter 3:11


14:10.165 --> 14:14.035
provides a similar urgent reminder
about our conduct. 


14:14.035 --> 14:16.038
Let’s read that together. 


14:16.038 --> 14:20.108
Again, that’s 2 Peter 3:11.


14:20.108 --> 14:22.110
There it tells us: 


14:22.110 --> 14:26.548
“Since all these things
are to be dissolved in this way, 


14:26.548 --> 14:29.451
“consider what sort of people
you ought to be


14:29.452 --> 14:32.000
in holy acts of conduct.” 


14:33.155 --> 14:34.990
Let’s think about that. 


14:34.990 --> 14:39.895
For a person’s conduct to be holy
from Jehovah’s perspective,


14:39.895 --> 14:42.598
he or she must be morally clean. 


14:42.598 --> 14:45.733
While physical cleanness
is on the outside, 


14:45.733 --> 14:50.000
moral cleanness is on the inside
—in our thoughts and desires. 


14:51.040 --> 14:53.875
Is being morally clean really important? 


14:53.875 --> 14:55.877
Think about it this way. 


14:55.877 --> 15:00.049
When eating a meal, 
would you be content to eat from a bowl


15:00.048 --> 15:03.051
that had been washed
only on the outside? 


15:03.052 --> 15:04.720
Of course not! 


15:04.720 --> 15:06.922
We want to eat from clean dishes


15:06.922 --> 15:10.425
—dishes that are
thoroughly clean inside and out. 


15:10.425 --> 15:15.430
So when we wash dishes,
we wash the outside and the inside. 


15:15.430 --> 15:18.533
Similarly, 
Jehovah expects his servants


15:18.533 --> 15:21.570
to be clean through and through. 


15:21.570 --> 15:25.140
And because Jehovah
—the perfect reader of hearts—


15:25.140 --> 15:29.612
will soon dissolve, yes,
eliminate this dirty system of things, 


15:29.612 --> 15:32.815
it’s urgent that we do so.


15:32.815 --> 15:35.550
This means
that we have to work very hard


15:35.550 --> 15:38.787
so that nothing unclean
enters our mind. 


15:38.787 --> 15:41.324
That means firmly rejecting


15:41.323 --> 15:44.225
so-called fun
and exciting entertainment,


15:44.225 --> 15:47.863
which features sex,
violence, or spiritism. 


15:47.863 --> 15:52.333
At 1 Corinthians 14:20, 
the Bible tells us


15:52.333 --> 15:57.038
that we should become
like “young children as to badness.” 


15:57.038 --> 15:59.273
No matter our age, 


15:59.273 --> 16:01.876
we don’t need and we don’t want


16:01.877 --> 16:05.380
any experience 
with the wickedness of this world. 


16:05.380 --> 16:08.850
Rather, 
we keep the inside of the dish, 


16:08.850 --> 16:11.920
our mind and heart,
clean at all times. 


16:11.920 --> 16:15.857
And when we do so,
our exemplary conduct


16:15.857 --> 16:20.595
pleases Jehovah and it strengthens
our faithful brothers and sisters. 


16:20.595 --> 16:23.665
Really, it’s the only way
to respect ourselves


16:23.665 --> 16:26.368
and to gain the respect of others.


16:26.368 --> 16:29.838
Our theme text at 1 Timothy 4:12


16:29.838 --> 16:32.040
goes on to mention other areas


16:32.040 --> 16:35.910
where we can make steady progress
in becoming an example,


16:35.910 --> 16:40.015
such as in love, in faith,
and in chasteness. 


16:40.015 --> 16:42.417
During your personal study,


16:42.417 --> 16:46.022
that is, your personal time
with your best Friend, Jehovah,


16:46.022 --> 16:49.492
why not examine these areas
in more detail? 


16:49.492 --> 16:52.729
The treasures you gain
from such a study project


16:52.728 --> 16:57.000
can last a lifetime
—an everlasting lifetime.


16:58.067 --> 17:00.235
So, what have we learned? 


17:00.235 --> 17:02.738
In fulfillment of Bible prophecy,


17:02.738 --> 17:06.675
a large company of young people 
from around the world


17:06.675 --> 17:10.145
are taking a stand
with Jehovah and Jesus. 


17:10.145 --> 17:13.415
That includes all of you. 


17:13.415 --> 17:17.318
Like dewdrops,
you’re not only abundant in number


17:17.318 --> 17:20.188
but you sparkle in our congregations. 


17:20.188 --> 17:23.191
Your presence is very refreshing. 


17:23.192 --> 17:28.097
So please,
don’t look down on your youth. 


17:28.097 --> 17:30.699
Rather, rejoice in your youth! 


17:30.698 --> 17:46.098
Yes, “become an example 
to the faithful ones”!
