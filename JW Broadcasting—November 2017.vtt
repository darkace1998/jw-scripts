00:00:01.584 --> 00:00:03.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
Greetings! 

00:00:03.586 --> 00:00:06.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re so happy you could join us 
for this broadcast. 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’m very happy 
because my cohost this month 

00:00:10.126 --> 00:00:14.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a good friend of mine 
and a fellow worker, Brother Jim Mantz. 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Jim and I work together 
in the Writing Department, 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jim helps the Writing Department
—Jim and his team. 

00:00:20.236 --> 00:00:22.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
They help the Writing Department 

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:25.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep track of all the projects 
that we have to work on. 

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
And do you have any idea how many that is? 

00:00:28.111 --> 00:00:31.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two hundred and forty-one at any given time. 

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:35.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jim does a lot of other things as well. 

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:38.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jim, 
we’ve got another project on hand this month, 

00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that’s to get this broadcast under way. 

00:00:40.757 --> 00:00:45.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
So why don’t you tell the folks at home 
just what they have to look forward to?

00:00:45.628 --> 00:00:49.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, David, this month 
we’ll get acquainted with a family 

00:00:49.365 --> 00:00:53.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
that raised their children 
to put Jehovah first in their lives. 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look for points 
we can apply in our families. 

00:00:58.274 --> 00:01:00.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
Later, our music video 
will emphasize the need 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.748 line:90% position:50% align:center
to take the time to marvel 
at Jehovah’s creation. 

00:01:05.715 --> 00:01:09.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we’ll visit 
the Writing Research Department. 

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:11.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
The brothers and sisters there 

00:01:11.087 --> 00:01:14.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
help us to ensure that all our articles 

00:01:14.224 --> 00:01:16.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
and videos are accurate.

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:18.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’re going to enjoy this program, 

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:22.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
and this is the November 2017 program 

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:24.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
of JW Broadcasting!

00:01:42.852 --> 00:01:45.789 line:10% position:50% align:center
This month I’d like to talk about the efforts 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:47.791 line:10% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s organization is making 

00:01:47.791 --> 00:01:51.194 line:10% position:50% align:center
to produce literature, publications, 

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:55.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
articles that are as accurate as possible. 

00:01:55.365 --> 00:02:00.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to talk about accuracy
—accuracy of statement. 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:05.375 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, first, what’s the responsibility 
of the writer of the article? 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
When a writer submits 
an article for publication, 

00:02:09.045 --> 00:02:13.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is expected to supply references 
from reputable sources 

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:16.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
to back up the facts 
that he’s included in his article. 

00:02:16.486 --> 00:02:19.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our Research Department 
will use those references 

00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:22.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
to check the accuracy of everything.

00:02:22.192 --> 00:02:25.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reliable, respected sources. 

00:02:25.595 --> 00:02:29.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do we mean by a reliable source? 

00:02:29.032 --> 00:02:32.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first of all, we go with encyclopedias, 

00:02:32.335 --> 00:02:37.340 line:90% position:50% align:center
books, magazines, and then newspapers

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
—basically in that order. 

00:02:39.475 --> 00:02:42.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prefer encyclopedias over books, 

00:02:42.745 --> 00:02:45.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
books over magazines, 

00:02:45.348 --> 00:02:47.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
and magazines over newspapers

00:02:47.383 --> 00:02:50.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
—generally because newspaper editors 
have a hard time checking their facts. 

00:02:50.954 --> 00:02:54.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
They have a very limited time 
in which to check their facts. 

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:58.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even encyclopedias and books get updated, 

00:02:58.695 --> 00:03:02.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we have to go 
with the latest edition of those. 

00:03:02.098 --> 00:03:06.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to make sure 
that our sources are reliable.

00:03:06.102 --> 00:03:09.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, when a writer quotes an expert, 

00:03:09.172 --> 00:03:12.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
our researchers will ask: 
“Who’s this expert? 

00:03:12.775 --> 00:03:14.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What’s his reputation? 

00:03:14.777 --> 00:03:17.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Is he working for a particular organization? 

00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:21.217 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Does this organization have an agenda? 

00:03:21.217 --> 00:03:23.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it a special-interest group?” 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we find that the goals 
of the organization are questionable, 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
we won’t use the quote
—even if it’s a really good quote.

00:03:33.062 --> 00:03:37.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, suppose that a writer 
wants to quote something from a book. 

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the reference material, 

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:42.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’ll supply a photocopy 
of the quote in the book, 

00:03:42.405 --> 00:03:46.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
but very often he’ll give us 
two or three pages before the quote 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:49.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
and two or three pages after as well. 

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:52.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that way, 
our researchers can examine the quote 

00:03:52.515 --> 00:03:56.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
in context to make sure 
that what we’re saying in print 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:04:00.323 line:90% position:50% align:center
is really what the author 
of the quote had in mind.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:03.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
For example, 
an evolutionist might make a statement 

00:04:03.626 --> 00:04:05.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
which on the surface 

00:04:05.628 --> 00:04:09.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
appears to confirm his support of creation. 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:11.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Or perhaps an atheist will make a statement 

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:15.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
that seems to indicate 
that he believes in God. 

00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:17.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when you examine 
the quote in context, 

00:04:17.473 --> 00:04:21.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
you realize that that isn’t what 
the author had in mind at all. 

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:25.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would never 
deliberately distort a quotation. 

00:04:25.715 --> 00:04:30.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
We try very hard to use all 
of our quotations in context.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:35.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s important to keep up 
with the very latest research. 

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:39.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something that was stated years ago 
as a fact may have been disproved. 

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:41.864 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the reason why is obvious. 

00:04:41.864 --> 00:04:44.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
Someone may spend his entire life 

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.870 line:90% position:50% align:center
researching a very limited point in history

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a very small point in history—

00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:52.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, of course, 
if he spends so much time researching, 

00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:54.077 line:90% position:50% align:center
he’s going to uncover things. 

00:04:54.077 --> 00:04:56.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so it’s not surprising 
that from time to time 

00:04:56.579 --> 00:05:00.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to adjust our view 
of some historical points. 

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to check, check, check. 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:07.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
And later on in this discussion, 
we’re going to consider some examples of it. 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’ll be fun; you’ll love it!

00:05:10.193 --> 00:05:14.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, someone might ask, 
‘Why is it necessary to be so picky, 

00:05:14.464 --> 00:05:18.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be so fussy, about accuracy?’ 

00:05:18.201 --> 00:05:21.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in answer, 
I’d like to give an experience 

00:05:21.437 --> 00:05:23.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I heard about a few years ago. 

00:05:23.606 --> 00:05:25.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Northern Europe, 
there was a man 

00:05:25.775 --> 00:05:28.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
who accepted a Bible study 
from Jehovah’s Witnesses. 

00:05:28.845 --> 00:05:30.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when he was asked 

00:05:30.847 --> 00:05:33.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
what motivated him 
to want to study, he said: 

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:37.320 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I read an article 
in your <i>Awake! </i>magazine on trees. 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, I happen to be 
a bit of an expert on trees. 

00:05:40.556 --> 00:05:43.826 line:90% position:50% align:center
“And after I read the article, 
I said to myself: 

00:05:43.826 --> 00:05:47.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘That article was so well-documented. 

00:05:47.096 --> 00:05:49.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘It was so precise. 

00:05:49.198 --> 00:05:53.403 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Any organization that is that careful 
when writing about trees 

00:05:53.403 --> 00:05:56.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to be just as careful 
when teaching me the Bible.’” 

00:05:56.906 --> 00:06:00.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
And on that basis, 
he accepted a Bible study.

00:06:02.011 --> 00:06:05.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, an area where great care 
needs to be taken 

00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:07.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
is when we’re quoting statistics. 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:10.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
A newspaper may report on a disaster 
in a certain country 

00:06:10.987 --> 00:06:15.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
and say that 10,000 people 
were killed in the disaster. 

00:06:15.758 --> 00:06:18.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
Immediately, 
our researchers are going to ask, 

00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:21.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Where did they get that statistic?” 

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
They might phone the newspaper 
and ask for the source. 

00:06:24.167 --> 00:06:27.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if the reporter 
can’t confirm the statistic, 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:30.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
our researchers will go to another source

00:06:30.173 --> 00:06:33.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a more official source—
to get the correct statistic.

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:38.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Care is also taken 
when quoting personalities of the past. 

00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:43.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, suppose we want to quote 
something that Napoleon Bonaparte said

00:06:43.786 --> 00:06:45.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the French general. 

00:06:45.788 --> 00:06:49.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, being French, 
Napoleon spoke French. 

00:06:49.459 --> 00:06:51.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
So if we’re quoting it in English, 

00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:56.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
that means that somebody translated 
the quote from French into English. 

00:06:56.132 --> 00:06:59.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did they translate the quote correctly? 

00:06:59.936 --> 00:07:04.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our researchers will probably go 
to the target language 

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:08.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
and research the quote 
in French or in another language. 

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:13.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
And more often than not, 
they find that what is presented in English 

00:07:13.649 --> 00:07:17.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
doesn’t accurately represent 
what the individual said at all.

00:07:19.188 --> 00:07:22.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, as we age, 
our memory can play tricks on us. 

00:07:22.825 --> 00:07:25.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our researchers are aware of that. 

00:07:26.295 --> 00:07:29.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
Suppose that an elderly brother 
writes in his life story 

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:33.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
that he was baptized 
at a circuit assembly on a certain date. 

00:07:33.903 --> 00:07:36.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our researchers may look at the date. 

00:07:36.772 --> 00:07:38.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
They may check the date, 

00:07:38.774 --> 00:07:43.012 line:90% position:50% align:center
and suppose they find that the date 
the brother gave fell on a Tuesday. 

00:07:43.012 --> 00:07:47.550 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what are the chances that there was 
a circuit assembly on a Tuesday? 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.286 line:90% position:50% align:center
There may have been, 
but they’re going to check. 

00:07:50.286 --> 00:07:53.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is the brother’s memory failing him? 

00:07:53.289 --> 00:07:55.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
If they can’t confirm the date, 

00:07:55.324 --> 00:07:57.560 line:90% position:50% align:center
they may ask someone to help the brother 

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remember the date 
more correctly, more accurately. 

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:04.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
Perhaps someone was baptized 
at the same circuit assembly as he was, 

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:08.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
and perhaps that person 
has an accurate note of the date.

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:12.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our translators also go to great lengths 

00:08:12.508 --> 00:08:16.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
to present accurate information 
to the brothers and sisters. 

00:08:16.946 --> 00:08:19.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some time ago, 
the <i>Awake! </i>magazine published an article 

00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:23.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
on a very rare species of butterfly. 

00:08:23.152 --> 00:08:25.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, with all animals and insects, 

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
we provide our translators 

00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:31.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the Latin name 
of the animal or the insect. 

00:08:31.294 --> 00:08:33.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so our translators had the Latin name. 

00:08:33.663 --> 00:08:35.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in one large country, 

00:08:35.665 --> 00:08:38.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
they were unable to find 
the name in the vernacular. 

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what did they do? 

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:43.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
They phoned the country’s leading university, 

00:08:43.839 --> 00:08:46.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they were transferred 
to the Biology Department, 

00:08:46.842 --> 00:08:48.911 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there an expert gave them 

00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:52.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
the name in the vernacular 
of that particular butterfly. 

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:56.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
But then he said: 
“Why is it that you’re worrying so much 

00:08:56.085 --> 00:08:58.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
“about the correct name of this butterfly? 

00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If you got it wrong, 
there are only two of us 

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:03.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the whole country 
who would’ve known the difference.” 

00:09:03.693 --> 00:09:07.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that opened the way 
to give a witness to this expert.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:11.133 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now, how well would <i>you </i>do 

00:09:11.133 --> 00:09:13.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
in spotting a statement that is slightly off 

00:09:13.803 --> 00:09:16.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
and making it more accurate? 

00:09:16.072 --> 00:09:18.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would you like to find out? 

00:09:18.074 --> 00:09:20.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course you would! 
It’ll be fun. 

00:09:20.576 --> 00:09:22.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s take a quiz that I’ll call 

00:09:22.778 --> 00:09:24.880 line:90% position:50% align:center
You Be the Editor. 

00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:27.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to put 
a number of statements on the screen, 

00:09:27.817 --> 00:09:30.453 line:90% position:50% align:center
and there’s a problem 
with each one of them. 

00:09:30.453 --> 00:09:33.456 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now your job 
is to figure out what’s wrong, 

00:09:33.456 --> 00:09:37.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
why it is wrong, 
and then suggest how to fix it. 

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.462 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s going to be fun.

00:09:39.462 --> 00:09:41.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the first statement: 

00:09:41.464 --> 00:09:45.534 line:10% position:50% align:center
“According 
to the <i>Smithsonian Knowledge Encyclopedia, </i>

00:09:45.534 --> 00:09:47.570 line:10% position:50% align:center
“the Egyptian Sphinx 

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:51.941 line:10% position:50% align:center
was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.” 

00:09:51.941 --> 00:09:54.577 line:10% position:50% align:center
“The Egyptian Sphinx 

00:09:54.577 --> 00:09:58.914 line:10% position:50% align:center
was constructed around 2550 B.C.E.” 

00:09:58.914 --> 00:10:00.950 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, the problem 

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:03.419 line:10% position:50% align:center
is with the date 2550 B.C.E. 

00:10:03.419 --> 00:10:05.421 line:10% position:50% align:center
The global Flood occurred 

00:10:05.421 --> 00:10:08.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
about 200 years <i>after </i>that date. 

00:10:08.324 --> 00:10:11.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what are the chances 
that the Sphinx survived the Flood? 

00:10:12.762 --> 00:10:16.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
Unless, of course, you think 
that’s how the Sphinx lost his nose. 

00:10:16.766 --> 00:10:19.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, these dates 
are good for you school children 

00:10:19.869 --> 00:10:21.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
to keep in mind 
when you’re writing reports. 

00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:24.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes you copy something 
from an encyclopedia, 

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it gives a certain date. 

00:10:26.542 --> 00:10:29.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
But think about the date of the Flood,
2370 B.C.E.,

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:34.750 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that what you put in your report 
is as accurate as possible.

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:38.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s go on to the next one: 

00:10:38.954 --> 00:10:40.956 line:10% position:50% align:center
“In 29 C.E., 

00:10:40.956 --> 00:10:44.527 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Jesus was baptized by a close relative, 

00:10:44.527 --> 00:10:46.829 line:10% position:50% align:center
John the Baptizer.” 

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:50.666 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, 29 C.E., that looks right. 

00:10:50.666 --> 00:10:52.668 line:10% position:50% align:center
And we know that Jesus 

00:10:52.668 --> 00:10:54.837 line:10% position:50% align:center
was baptized by John; that’s right. 

00:10:54.837 --> 00:10:56.872 line:10% position:50% align:center
So the problem must be 

00:10:56.872 --> 00:10:59.975 line:10% position:50% align:center
“close relative,” and it is. 

00:10:59.975 --> 00:11:02.345 line:10% position:50% align:center
Now, both of Jesus’ parents 

00:11:02.345 --> 00:11:07.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
were of the tribe of Judah, 
and their parents were of the tribe of Judah. 

00:11:07.049 --> 00:11:10.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
But, what about John’s parents, 
Zechariah and Elizabeth? 

00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.922 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were both of the tribe of Levi. 

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:15.591 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Elizabeth and Mary 
couldn’t have been sisters. 

00:11:15.591 --> 00:11:17.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Could they have been cousins? 

00:11:17.626 --> 00:11:18.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe. 

00:11:18.728 --> 00:11:20.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
We can’t even confirm that. 

00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if they were, that would make 
Jesus and John second cousins. 

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, is a second cousin a “close relative”? 

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
Some would say yes; 
some would say no. 

00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.309 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it’s safer just to say, 

00:11:33.309 --> 00:11:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In 29 C.E., 
Jesus was baptized by a relative, 

00:11:37.613 --> 00:11:40.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
John the Baptizer.”

00:11:40.316 --> 00:11:41.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one. 

00:11:41.417 --> 00:11:44.186 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s see if you can spot 
the error in this one: 

00:11:44.186 --> 00:11:46.188 line:10% position:50% align:center
“While most of the early Christians 

00:11:46.188 --> 00:11:48.958 line:10% position:50% align:center
“were held in little esteem in the community, 

00:11:48.958 --> 00:11:52.361 line:10% position:50% align:center
“a few enjoyed an elevated social status. 

00:11:52.361 --> 00:11:56.699 line:10% position:50% align:center
For example, Luke was a respected physician.” 

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.568 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, the word we need 

00:11:59.568 --> 00:12:02.271 line:10% position:50% align:center
to look at is “respected.” 

00:12:02.271 --> 00:12:05.007 line:10% position:50% align:center
We respect our doctors today, 

00:12:05.007 --> 00:12:08.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
and our doctors have 
a very, very fine education. 

00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:11.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
But was that the case in the first century? 

00:12:11.247 --> 00:12:15.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
A reference work says this 
about first-century physicians: 

00:12:15.718 --> 00:12:19.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Many doctors were freed Greek slaves, 

00:12:19.221 --> 00:12:23.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
“hence the social standing 
of doctors was quite low. 

00:12:23.726 --> 00:12:26.629 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Because recovery rates were so low, 

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:30.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
many people were skeptical 
or even scornful of doctors.” 

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:33.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Note this statement from the first century: 

00:12:33.269 --> 00:12:36.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Until recently, Diaulus was a doctor; 

00:12:36.872 --> 00:12:39.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
“now he is an undertaker. 

00:12:39.708 --> 00:12:41.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He is still doing as an undertaker, 

00:12:41.977 --> 00:12:44.980 line:90% position:50% align:center
what he used to do as a doctor.” 

00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:46.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
Not very flattering, is it? 

00:12:46.982 --> 00:12:51.220 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, in this case, we’d probably have to use 
a different example.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:52.755 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one: 

00:12:52.755 --> 00:12:55.825 line:10% position:50% align:center
“In 325 C.E., 

00:12:55.825 --> 00:12:57.827 line:10% position:50% align:center
“the Roman Emperor Constantine 

00:12:57.827 --> 00:12:59.862 line:10% position:50% align:center
“established Christianity 

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.864 line:10% position:50% align:center
“as the official religion 

00:13:01.864 --> 00:13:03.866 line:10% position:50% align:center
of the Roman Empire.” 

00:13:04.834 --> 00:13:08.170 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, 325 C.E., that looks right. 

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:11.173 line:10% position:50% align:center
And Constantine, that looks right. 

00:13:11.173 --> 00:13:13.542 line:10% position:50% align:center
But look at the word “official”

00:13:13.542 --> 00:13:16.212 line:10% position:50% align:center
—“official religion.” 

00:13:16.745 --> 00:13:19.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Constantine never established Christianity 

00:13:19.782 --> 00:13:23.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the official religion 
of the Roman Empire. 

00:13:23.052 --> 00:13:26.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 313 B.C.E., 
he did make it legal to be a Christian, 

00:13:26.822 --> 00:13:29.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
but paganism was still 
one of the official religions. 

00:13:29.725 --> 00:13:33.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Apostate Christianity 
didn’t become the official religion 

00:13:33.696 --> 00:13:36.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
until 391 C.E.

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:39.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
This one is tricky. 

00:13:39.001 --> 00:13:41.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
See how you do with this one: 

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:43.372 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Imagine the apostle Paul 

00:13:43.372 --> 00:13:46.175 line:10% position:50% align:center
“during his first imprisonment in Rome, 

00:13:46.175 --> 00:13:48.444 line:10% position:50% align:center
“writing his letter to the Colossians 

00:13:48.444 --> 00:13:50.946 line:10% position:50% align:center
from a dark prison cell.” 

00:13:52.114 --> 00:13:54.416 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, if you look in the back 
of the <i>New World Translation, </i>

00:13:54.416 --> 00:13:58.087 line:10% position:50% align:center
you’ll find that Paul did write his letter 
to the Colossians while in Rome, 

00:13:58.087 --> 00:14:01.690 line:10% position:50% align:center
and he was imprisoned at the time. 

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:04.059 line:10% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the problem? 

00:14:04.059 --> 00:14:06.362 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Dark prison cell.” 

00:14:06.362 --> 00:14:09.198 line:10% position:50% align:center
Where was Paul 
during his first imprisonment? 

00:14:09.198 --> 00:14:11.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
In his own rented house. 

00:14:11.834 --> 00:14:14.103 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the statement “dark prison cell,” 

00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:17.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s very dramatic, but it’s all wrong.

00:14:18.207 --> 00:14:20.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s an old one: 

00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:22.778 line:10% position:50% align:center
“While Paul generally preached 

00:14:22.778 --> 00:14:24.780 line:10% position:50% align:center
“to people of the nations, 

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:26.849 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Peter was sent to the Jews. 

00:14:26.849 --> 00:14:29.418 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Contrary to popular belief, 

00:14:29.418 --> 00:14:32.321 line:10% position:50% align:center
Peter was never in Rome.” 

00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:34.990 line:10% position:50% align:center
Some scholars used to make that statement, 

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:37.159 line:10% position:50% align:center
and they made it 60 years ago: 

00:14:37.159 --> 00:14:40.062 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Peter was never in Rome.” 

00:14:40.062 --> 00:14:42.064 line:10% position:50% align:center
But can we really say that? 

00:14:42.064 --> 00:14:44.266 line:10% position:50% align:center
Can we be that dogmatic? 

00:14:44.266 --> 00:14:46.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can we say that he didn’t even spend 

00:14:46.835 --> 00:14:49.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
vacation time or have a short visit in Rome? 

00:14:49.138 --> 00:14:51.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, we cannot. 

00:14:51.173 --> 00:14:53.242 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it would be more accurate to state: 

00:14:53.242 --> 00:14:57.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is no record 
that Peter ever lived in Rome.”

00:14:58.581 --> 00:15:00.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s one: 

00:15:00.382 --> 00:15:03.085 line:10% position:50% align:center
“We can have confidence in the Bible

00:15:03.085 --> 00:15:06.589 line:10% position:50% align:center
—it is mankind’s oldest book.” 

00:15:06.589 --> 00:15:10.426 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Mankind’s oldest book.” 

00:15:10.426 --> 00:15:13.195 line:10% position:50% align:center
Years ago, some scholars believed 

00:15:13.195 --> 00:15:16.832 line:10% position:50% align:center
that texts written 
by Adam, Noah, and others 

00:15:16.832 --> 00:15:19.301 line:10% position:50% align:center
survived the Flood 
and became part of the Bible. 

00:15:19.301 --> 00:15:21.303 line:10% position:50% align:center
And if that were true, 

00:15:21.303 --> 00:15:24.974 line:10% position:50% align:center
then we could say that the Bible 
is mankind’s oldest book. 

00:15:25.941 --> 00:15:28.177 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, here’s a quote 
from <i>Insight on the Scriptures, </i>

00:15:28.177 --> 00:15:30.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
our Bible encyclopedia. 

00:15:30.212 --> 00:15:34.516 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: 
“There is no way to establish definitely 

00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:37.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
“that some of the histories 
mentioned in the book of Genesis 

00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:40.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
were committed to writing 
before the Flood.” 

00:15:40.589 --> 00:15:44.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, today we might call the Bible 
one of mankind’s oldest books 

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
or the world’s oldest modern book, 

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:50.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we do in one of our videos.

00:15:50.899 --> 00:15:53.002 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s the last one: 

00:15:53.002 --> 00:15:55.204 line:10% position:50% align:center
“In 1517, 

00:15:55.204 --> 00:15:58.641 line:10% position:50% align:center
“Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses 

00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:02.211 line:10% position:50% align:center
on the door of a church 
in Wittenberg, Germany.” 

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:05.848 line:10% position:50% align:center
Well, we’ve highlighted “95,” 

00:16:05.848 --> 00:16:08.784 line:10% position:50% align:center
but there are questions 
about the entire statement. 

00:16:08.784 --> 00:16:11.420 line:10% position:50% align:center
Some modern scholars have done 

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:14.423 line:10% position:50% align:center
a tremendous, exhaustive study 
of the life of Martin Luther, 

00:16:14.423 --> 00:16:17.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they claim 
that he couldn’t have compiled 

00:16:17.126 --> 00:16:21.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
all 95 of his theses by 1517. 

00:16:21.797 --> 00:16:25.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
Others go so far as to claim 
that it never happened

00:16:25.567 --> 00:16:29.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that he never did nail his theses 
on the door of the church. 

00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:32.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
Still others are just as adamant 
that it’s all true

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:34.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that it all happened. 

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:37.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there’s no consensus. 

00:16:37.179 --> 00:16:39.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
We would have to modify the statement

00:16:39.648 --> 00:16:42.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“some believe” or “it is believed”—

00:16:42.518 --> 00:16:44.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to make it more accurate 

00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:48.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to acknowledge the fact 
that there are differences of opinion.

00:16:49.825 --> 00:16:52.728 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how did you do on the quiz? 

00:16:52.728 --> 00:16:57.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you’re like me, you’ve probably made 
some of those statements yourself at times. 

00:16:57.466 --> 00:17:01.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
The statements were based 
on the best research we had at the time. 

00:17:01.303 --> 00:17:04.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
But this is to illustrate 
the fact that times change; 

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:07.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
research facilities improve. 

00:17:07.743 --> 00:17:12.414 line:90% position:50% align:center
A scholar does exhaustive research 
on one point of history, 

00:17:12.414 --> 00:17:15.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he uncovers things 
that were previously unknown. 

00:17:15.718 --> 00:17:17.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we have to keep up. 

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:20.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have to check, check, check. 

00:17:20.189 --> 00:17:24.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when credible research 
reveals that we have to adjust 

00:17:24.326 --> 00:17:26.962 line:90% position:50% align:center
or tweak a statement 
that we made in the past, 

00:17:26.962 --> 00:17:29.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
we do so without hesitation. 

00:17:29.498 --> 00:17:34.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal is to provide information 
that is as accurate as possible 

00:17:34.503 --> 00:17:37.840 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we know that you 
brothers and sisters use this information. 

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.842 line:90% position:50% align:center
You quote it in the field ministry. 

00:17:39.842 --> 00:17:41.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
You use it in your public talks. 

00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:44.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we want to make sure 
that our brothers are fed 

00:17:44.446 --> 00:17:48.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the most accurate 
spiritual food possible.

00:17:48.584 --> 00:17:52.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re imperfect, of course, 
and we are going to make mistakes. 

00:17:52.287 --> 00:17:55.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do, 
we have to correct them. 

00:17:55.057 --> 00:17:59.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our goal is to do the best we can 
in all our imperfection.

00:18:01.296 --> 00:18:03.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how does it make you feel? 

00:18:03.632 --> 00:18:06.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know how it makes me feel. 

00:18:06.135 --> 00:18:11.140 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m grateful that Jehovah’s organization 
takes accuracy so seriously. 

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
It gives me confidence. 

00:18:13.342 --> 00:18:17.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, you know, I’m reminded 
of the description of another researcher, 

00:18:17.212 --> 00:18:23.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
as recorded at Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10. 

00:18:23.752 --> 00:18:25.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
You know who this is. 

00:18:25.754 --> 00:18:30.192 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ecclesiastes 12:9, 10: 

00:18:30.192 --> 00:18:33.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Not only had the congregator become wise 

00:18:33.829 --> 00:18:37.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“but he continually taught 
the people what he knew, 

00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:40.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and he pondered 

00:18:40.035 --> 00:18:43.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and made a thorough search 

00:18:43.372 --> 00:18:46.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“in order to compile many proverbs. 

00:18:46.341 --> 00:18:49.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The congregator sought 
to find delightful words 

00:18:49.211 --> 00:18:53.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to record accurate words of truth.”

00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:59.087 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s give our attention 
to my good friend Jim. 

00:18:59.087 --> 00:19:02.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I think Jim is ready 
to take us on a field trip 

00:19:02.157 --> 00:19:04.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we can meet 
some of the researchers at Bethel.

00:19:04.626 --> 00:19:05.627 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thank you, David. 

00:19:05.627 --> 00:19:09.965 line:10% position:50% align:center
And, yes, our researchers take very seriously 

00:19:09.965 --> 00:19:11.967 line:10% position:50% align:center
their task of maintaining 

00:19:11.967 --> 00:19:14.903 line:10% position:50% align:center
a high standard of accuracy.

00:19:19.958 --> 00:19:23.630 line:90% position:50% align:center
In today’s media,
much of what’s presented as fact 

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:27.009 line:10% position:50% align:center
is often colored by emotion
and personal opinion.

00:19:32.349 --> 00:19:34.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s Witnesses, however, 

00:19:34.435 --> 00:19:37.147 line:90% position:50% align:center
remain committed
to defending God’s Word, 

00:19:37.147 --> 00:19:39.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Bible, as the standard for truth.

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:42.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Jesus said at John 17:17: 

00:19:42.946 --> 00:19:45.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your word is truth.”

00:19:45.699 --> 00:19:47.785 line:90% position:50% align:center
The wide-ranging subject matter 

00:19:47.785 --> 00:19:50.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
contained in the publications
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 

00:19:50.747 --> 00:19:54.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
is painstakingly researched
by their Writing Research Department. 

00:19:54.711 --> 00:19:58.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Their research methods are modeled
after that of Bible historians 

00:19:58.098 --> 00:20:00.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as Luke and Jeremiah

00:20:00.885 --> 00:20:03.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
—reliance on reputable first-hand sources.

00:20:06.768 --> 00:20:08.645 line:10% position:50% align:center
We’re not looking just for someone’s opinions 

00:20:08.645 --> 00:20:10.189 line:10% position:50% align:center
or what someone believes about a topic.

00:20:10.189 --> 00:20:12.483 line:10% position:50% align:center
If the material is socially 

00:20:12.483 --> 00:20:14.486 line:10% position:50% align:center
or politically biased, for example, 

00:20:14.486 --> 00:20:16.029 line:10% position:50% align:center
we can’t rely on it. 

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:17.781 line:10% position:50% align:center
We look for objective material.

00:20:17.781 --> 00:20:19.625 line:10% position:50% align:center
We cover everything 

00:20:19.625 --> 00:20:23.247 line:90% position:50% align:center
from historical, scientific, geographical 

00:20:23.247 --> 00:20:25.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
to flora, fauna, space.

00:20:25.708 --> 00:20:27.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
So before the script is even written, 

00:20:27.702 --> 00:20:30.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ll provide a research package,

00:20:30.956 --> 00:20:33.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll follow
the project until final delivery

00:20:33.426 --> 00:20:35.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure
that everything that is said

00:20:35.295 --> 00:20:37.098 line:10% position:50% align:center
and everything that is shown

00:20:37.098 --> 00:20:38.891 line:10% position:50% align:center
is solidly based on fact

00:20:38.891 --> 00:20:40.051 line:10% position:50% align:center
and is well-researched.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a lot more research than what 

00:20:42.721 --> 00:20:45.600 line:90% position:50% align:center
the viewer
or the reader will ever see.

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:47.819 line:10% position:50% align:center
You have a one-page article on the otter; 

00:20:47.819 --> 00:20:49.730 line:90% position:50% align:center
you end up with like 12 references 

00:20:49.730 --> 00:20:52.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
to back up every statement that’s made.

00:20:52.325 --> 00:20:53.744 line:10% position:50% align:center
It seems very simple, 

00:20:53.744 --> 00:20:55.112 line:10% position:50% align:center
the height of Mont Blanc. 

00:20:55.112 --> 00:20:56.914 line:90% position:50% align:center
And with the height of Mont Blanc, 

00:20:56.914 --> 00:21:00.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
we found out, number one,
that it was 4,807 meters; 

00:21:00.878 --> 00:21:03.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
then we found another source
—4,810 meters; 

00:21:03.923 --> 00:21:07.419 line:90% position:50% align:center
let’s check a third one
—4,808 meters. 

00:21:07.419 --> 00:21:08.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what is now real? 

00:21:08.421 --> 00:21:10.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
In that case, we had to consult 

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:15.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
the French National Institute
of Geographic and Forest Information.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.691 line:10% position:50% align:center
One of our main research tools 

00:21:17.691 --> 00:21:19.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
is our own library system. 

00:21:19.935 --> 00:21:24.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have about 65,000 books
and other research materials.

00:21:25.742 --> 00:21:28.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we’re researching something
about ancient history 

00:21:28.613 --> 00:21:31.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
or archaeology, 

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:33.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
we may consult
a specialized encyclopedia, 

00:21:34.879 --> 00:21:38.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
like an encyclopedia
of archaeological discoveries, for example.

00:21:38.383 --> 00:21:41.295 line:90% position:50% align:center
Museum websites usually have pictures 

00:21:41.295 --> 00:21:43.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what they have in the museum. 

00:21:43.056 --> 00:21:45.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can find these visuals and then send
those off to production teams 

00:21:45.726 --> 00:21:48.304 line:90% position:50% align:center
as well and say,
“This is a good example 

00:21:48.304 --> 00:21:49.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
of a first-century lamp.”

00:21:49.815 --> 00:21:52.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things that you think are true 

00:21:52.176 --> 00:21:54.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
because they are “commonly known” 

00:21:54.779 --> 00:21:56.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not actually be totally accurate.

00:21:56.949 --> 00:21:59.786 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the research work we’re doing, 

00:21:59.786 --> 00:22:03.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
sometimes it takes a lot of time,
a lot of effort. 

00:22:03.207 --> 00:22:07.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
Sometimes we don’t find
what we are expecting to find. 

00:22:07.921 --> 00:22:11.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s very gratifying
because we’re helping produce 

00:22:11.968 --> 00:22:15.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
accurate information
that our readers can rely on. 

00:22:15.514 --> 00:22:18.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
Reliable information will help us
make good informed decisions.

00:22:19.435 --> 00:22:22.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyone who reads our journals
and who sees our videos 

00:22:22.064 --> 00:22:26.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be confident that this
was thoroughly researched. 

00:22:26.361 --> 00:22:28.747 line:90% position:50% align:center
These are facts; this is the truth.

00:22:28.747 --> 00:22:31.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
So when you consider
the printed publications 

00:22:31.409 --> 00:22:32.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Jehovah’s Witnesses 

00:22:32.744 --> 00:22:35.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
or peruse the jw.org website, 

00:22:35.873 --> 00:22:37.875 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can be confident that the material

00:22:37.875 --> 00:22:41.046 line:90% position:50% align:center
is carefully researched and accurate. 

00:22:41.046 --> 00:22:42.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why? 

00:22:42.256 --> 00:22:44.676 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah’s Witnesses 

00:22:44.676 --> 00:22:47.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
are a people who love and respect 

00:22:47.054 --> 00:22:48.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
the truth.

00:22:53.238 --> 00:22:56.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Psalm 31:5 expresses, 

00:22:56.074 --> 00:23:00.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
we worship “Jehovah, the God of truth.” 

00:23:00.178 --> 00:23:04.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
So it would only make sense 
that we try to imitate him 

00:23:04.082 --> 00:23:06.318 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the best of our ability 

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:10.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being truthful 
in all the materials that we publish. 

00:23:10.822 --> 00:23:13.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
He, no doubt, finds this very pleasing, 

00:23:13.658 --> 00:23:16.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
especially since throughout history, 

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:19.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
many have tried to twist his teachings.

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:24.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although the organization makes efforts 
to publish accurate information, 

00:23:24.669 --> 00:23:28.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are many things 
that we can do as individuals. 

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:33.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
This dramatization highlights 
how our view of celebrations 

00:23:33.979 --> 00:23:36.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
can be pleasing to Jehovah.

00:23:46.892 --> 00:23:47.726 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Buddy! 

00:23:47.726 --> 00:23:49.127 line:90% position:50% align:center
How was school?

00:23:53.031 --> 00:23:54.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s my Dad, Grayson, 

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:57.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my older brother, Dylan.

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:00.105 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, Bro! 

00:24:00.105 --> 00:24:01.373 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’re going to play ball. 
You want to come?

00:24:01.373 --> 00:24:02.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
No thanks.

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:06.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is he OK?

00:24:06.144 --> 00:24:08.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
He normally loves to talk about school. 

00:24:08.847 --> 00:24:10.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
He didn’t want to talk about school today.

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:18.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
It wasn’t my worst day at school
—but pretty close. 

00:24:19.457 --> 00:24:22.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
It all started first thing this morning. 

00:24:23.662 --> 00:24:27.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone was signing a birthday card 
for one of our classmates, Lucas.

00:24:27.566 --> 00:24:29.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to sign 
the birthday card for Lucas?

00:24:29.568 --> 00:24:32.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
He just got home from being 
at the hospital for cancer treatments.

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:33.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
No thanks. 

00:24:33.371 --> 00:24:36.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m a Jehovah’s Witness, 
and I don’t celebrate birthdays.

00:24:36.107 --> 00:24:37.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
What? 

00:24:37.175 --> 00:24:37.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hum? 

00:24:37.976 --> 00:24:38.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s rude. 

00:24:38.577 --> 00:24:41.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
Come on, sign it!

00:24:42.814 --> 00:24:45.517 line:90% position:50% align:center
You guys, you guys, Aiden—

00:24:45.517 --> 00:24:50.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
My teacher said that Lucas 
may not come back to school for a long time. 

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:52.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
I felt so bad he was sick.

00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:05.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
Aiden, Aiden, can you think about it?

00:25:10.942 --> 00:25:14.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
The thing is, I <i>did </i>want to sign the card. 

00:25:17.716 --> 00:25:20.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
Lucas was one of the nicest people 
in my class. 

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:24.623 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maybe I can just sign it. 

00:25:26.024 --> 00:25:29.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
I mean, it’s not like I’m going
to a birthday party.

00:25:34.833 --> 00:25:36.835 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, little man. 
How are you doing?

00:25:38.403 --> 00:25:39.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah? 

00:25:39.237 --> 00:25:41.139 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom said you had a rough day today.

00:25:41.139 --> 00:25:44.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
When Dad came in, 
I told him everything that happened. 

00:25:46.411 --> 00:25:50.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know from the Bible 
that it’s wrong to celebrate birthdays. 

00:25:50.982 --> 00:25:53.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is signing the card really a big deal? 

00:25:55.587 --> 00:25:57.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
Dad said my question was a good one. 

00:25:59.457 --> 00:26:01.259 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he showed me a scripture.

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:02.494 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you want to get your Bible for me? 

00:26:02.494 --> 00:26:04.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s look in Ephesians 5.

00:26:04.095 --> 00:26:05.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ephesians 5:10: 

00:26:06.665 --> 00:26:11.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Keep on making sure 
of what is acceptable to the Lord.”

00:26:11.803 --> 00:26:14.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said, 
“We all have to keep making sure 

00:26:14.572 --> 00:26:17.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
“of what’s acceptable to Jehovah 

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:21.746 line:90% position:50% align:center
because Satan is a master at tricking us.” 

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:24.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then he used the example of Aaron.

00:26:29.287 --> 00:26:32.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Israelites asked Aaron 
to make them a god.

00:26:37.262 --> 00:26:39.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Aaron made a golden calf, 

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:43.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
thinking that it could represent Jehovah. 

00:26:43.134 --> 00:26:45.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
He told the people: 

00:26:45.270 --> 00:26:49.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is a festival to Jehovah tomorrow.” 

00:26:49.741 --> 00:26:54.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
But true worship 
was being mixed with false worship, 

00:26:54.079 --> 00:26:57.549 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah was <i>not </i>happy. 

00:26:57.549 --> 00:27:00.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
And many were punished.

00:27:02.354 --> 00:27:05.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
That example helped me a lot. 

00:27:07.459 --> 00:27:10.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know birthdays are wrong 
because the Bible teaches 

00:27:10.695 --> 00:27:13.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
that they are not approved by Jehovah. 

00:27:14.766 --> 00:27:17.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
But we don’t want to be confused like Aaron 

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:20.538 line:90% position:50% align:center
and try to mix true and false worship.

00:27:20.538 --> 00:27:22.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
All right, let’s go talk to Mom.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to make Jehovah happy.

00:27:27.679 --> 00:27:30.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Dad said, 
“It’s always good to ask, 

00:27:31.683 --> 00:27:34.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would Jehovah feel if I did this?”

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:38.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
I still didn’t sign the card, 
but I’m going to do something else for Lucas.

00:28:00.612 --> 00:28:02.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can I go see Lucas?

00:28:02.447 --> 00:28:03.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah. 
Go ahead, Buddy. 

00:28:03.348 --> 00:28:04.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s right over there.

00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
How have you been feeling?

00:28:16.394 --> 00:28:18.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
A little better.

00:28:19.297 --> 00:28:21.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then I realized something: 

00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Instead of celebrating one day, 

00:28:24.636 --> 00:28:27.005 line:90% position:50% align:center
I could share with Lucas our hope 

00:28:27.005 --> 00:28:30.909 line:90% position:50% align:center
of living forever 
on a beautiful paradise earth.

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:34.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
So there will be no sickness ever again. 

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:38.817 line:90% position:50% align:center
They will build houses and have food.

00:28:41.386 --> 00:28:45.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
I enjoyed seeing how we can show 
love and concern for others, 

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:49.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if we do not share their beliefs. 

00:28:49.094 --> 00:28:53.765 line:90% position:50% align:center
The best way to do so 
is by simple acts of kindness 

00:28:53.765 --> 00:28:58.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by sharing our hope with them, 
just as Aiden did.

00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:02.974 line:90% position:50% align:center
And did you notice 
how the good training by Aiden’s parents 

00:29:02.974 --> 00:29:06.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped him make decisions 
that were pleasing to God? 

00:29:06.711 --> 00:29:11.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
It made me think of Abilio and Ulla Amorim 
from Portugal. 

00:29:11.216 --> 00:29:14.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Both of them endured difficult childhoods, 

00:29:14.552 --> 00:29:19.557 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they did not allow that to affect 
how they raised their own children.

00:29:28.466 --> 00:29:31.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since I was very young,
I was religiously inclined

00:29:31.636 --> 00:29:36.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
and my dream was to get married
to a man that worshipped God

00:29:36.541 --> 00:29:41.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that together we would worship God
and live a peaceful life. 

00:29:42.247 --> 00:29:44.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
That didn’t happen with my parents. 

00:29:45.550 --> 00:29:50.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
We often had a better relationship
with the maid than with my mother.

00:29:54.092 --> 00:29:56.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
My father was a very distant person. 

00:29:56.394 --> 00:30:00.165 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was always very busy
with his work and friends. 

00:30:01.533 --> 00:30:05.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
We wed in 1971 in Paris, France.

00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:09.807 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were baptized in 1974.

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:14.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
I realized I really didn’t know
how to raise children,

00:30:15.180 --> 00:30:17.182 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then I started applying some things

00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:19.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
mentioned in the Bible. 

00:30:20.018 --> 00:30:22.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
If I wanted to teach them right, 

00:30:22.153 --> 00:30:25.290 line:90% position:50% align:center
I first had to understand
things better myself 

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:29.394 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that I could explain them
in a way that God would want us to.

00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:34.933 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 1976, we moved to Portugal

00:30:34.933 --> 00:30:37.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve where there was more need. 

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:43.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
By then, our oldest son
was four and a half years old, 

00:30:43.074 --> 00:30:47.178 line:90% position:50% align:center
Maria was three and a half,
and Benjamin, one and a half.

00:30:48.179 --> 00:30:52.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember when we arrived; 
we lived in a rural area.

00:30:53.484 --> 00:30:55.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was a very small congregation, 

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we really had to participate 

00:30:58.356 --> 00:31:00.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
from a very early age.

00:31:00.091 --> 00:31:01.526 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted to put, 

00:31:01.526 --> 00:31:04.963 line:90% position:50% align:center
for sure, the spiritual interests
first in their life, 

00:31:04.963 --> 00:31:07.732 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they wanted not only to tell us

00:31:08.766 --> 00:31:11.703 line:90% position:50% align:center
to put the Kingdom interests first
but they wanted to show us

00:31:12.370 --> 00:31:13.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
how to do it.

00:31:13.638 --> 00:31:17.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it was not only that we
sat down for family study 

00:31:17.275 --> 00:31:20.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we talked about Jehovah
and spiritual things. 

00:31:20.144 --> 00:31:22.714 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember walking back home 

00:31:22.714 --> 00:31:25.083 line:90% position:50% align:center
from meetings
and then my parents would help us

00:31:25.083 --> 00:31:28.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
to look for a star constellation; 

00:31:28.586 --> 00:31:30.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
it started a conversation about Jehovah.

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:33.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Deuteronomy chapter 6,

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.927 line:90% position:50% align:center
it says that we 
must always talk to our children. 

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:37.829 line:90% position:50% align:center
But it’s good to talk about God

00:31:38.796 --> 00:31:41.065 line:90% position:50% align:center
and help them to see God as a real person

00:31:41.065 --> 00:31:42.834 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a person that is linked
to everything around us. 

00:31:43.902 --> 00:31:47.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now I wanted to teach them very much, 

00:31:47.238 --> 00:31:48.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not that things about God 

00:31:48.673 --> 00:31:51.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
were sad or boring,
but were joyful.

00:31:51.809 --> 00:31:54.112 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we were imperfect. 

00:31:54.112 --> 00:31:57.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
Many times I did the wrong things. 

00:31:57.382 --> 00:32:00.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never remember, “You have to do it
because you have to do it.” 

00:32:00.952 --> 00:32:03.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
They always tried to explain the reasons

00:32:04.155 --> 00:32:05.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Bible reasons.

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:06.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was brought up this way. 

00:32:07.425 --> 00:32:10.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents dictated laws:
“You have to do this. 

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:13.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
You must. 
This is the way I want it to be.” 

00:32:13.865 --> 00:32:17.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I came to understand that God,
even in the Bible,

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:20.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of only giving or dictating laws,
he explains them. 

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:24.342 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gives so many reasons; 
he gives reasons for everything. 

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:29.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
By teaching my children,
I have to say that I have learned a lot too.

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:32.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
We never felt that we must go to meetings; 

00:32:32.617 --> 00:32:35.887 line:90% position:50% align:center
we must go in service
because you have to do it. 

00:32:35.887 --> 00:32:39.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we were always 
motivated to do things.

00:32:39.223 --> 00:32:43.661 line:90% position:50% align:center
I remember, for example, 
when he gave me a new Bible,

00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:47.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he wrote to me in that Bible,

00:32:47.632 --> 00:32:52.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May this book always be
the motivating force in your life.”

00:32:52.637 --> 00:32:54.973 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several times he told me:

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:57.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Please never,

00:32:57.976 --> 00:33:00.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
“never give up in your service. 

00:33:01.713 --> 00:33:05.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah is your Father,
and you have to serve him

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:11.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
all your life.”

00:33:12.690 --> 00:33:16.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Almighty has children
that failed to respond, 

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:20.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
much like any other parent. 

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
God does not force anyone. 

00:33:24.669 --> 00:33:27.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
He respects our free will very much. 

00:33:28.506 --> 00:33:32.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we wanted them
to build their own future. 

00:33:33.745 --> 00:33:37.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
I always felt 
that my children were not my own,

00:33:37.448 --> 00:33:41.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it was Jehovah
who kindly put them into our hands. 

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:45.957 line:90% position:50% align:center
He entrusted them to us
so that we could care for them. 

00:33:47.125 --> 00:33:50.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then when we have done our part,
let them fly.

00:34:03.207 --> 00:34:05.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
My parents always encouraged us

00:34:05.543 --> 00:34:08.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
to pursue full-time service,

00:34:08.179 --> 00:34:10.648 line:90% position:50% align:center
even if that meant
moving far away from home.

00:34:13.651 --> 00:34:17.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
My husband and I are serving
as field missionaries in Klaipeda, Lithuania. 

00:34:18.156 --> 00:34:20.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
I know I will be grateful for all eternity

00:34:20.224 --> 00:34:23.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
that I used my youth to serve Jehovah,

00:34:23.694 --> 00:34:28.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that I didn’t waste
my years of my young age

00:34:28.499 --> 00:34:30.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
doing things for this world.

00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:36.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
My wife and I serve
in the Portugal branch office.

00:34:36.741 --> 00:34:41.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
If Jehovah is happy,
if my parents are happy, I’m happy too. 

00:34:41.045 --> 00:34:43.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m really sure
that they like what we’re doing. 

00:34:43.781 --> 00:34:45.049 line:90% position:50% align:center
They are happy with that.

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:50.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
We rejoice that our children
are giving their best

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:52.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
to their Creator and making him happy. 

00:34:52.390 --> 00:34:54.792 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah deserves that.

00:34:57.128 --> 00:34:59.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Of course, we miss our children, 

00:34:59.030 --> 00:35:01.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we would like to have them around,

00:35:01.232 --> 00:35:04.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we are very happy for them

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:08.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
for having the privilege
of serving Jehovah the way they are.

00:35:12.009 --> 00:35:15.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, the truths found in the Bible 

00:35:15.246 --> 00:35:19.484 line:90% position:50% align:center
can provide practical help 
in raising a family. 

00:35:19.484 --> 00:35:22.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
But although Jehovah 
has given the responsibility 

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
of raising children to the parents, 

00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:29.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
other members of the family 
can also play an important role 

00:35:29.327 --> 00:35:32.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
in encouraging spiritual progress. 

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:36.200 line:90% position:50% align:center
These three fleshly sisters 
looked after one another 

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.637 line:90% position:50% align:center
while learning about Jehovah.

00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:49.747 line:10% position:50% align:center
I was the first to start studying the Bible.

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:53.217 line:10% position:50% align:center
After that, I started studying too.

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:55.219 line:10% position:50% align:center
After watching them for a year, 

00:35:55.219 --> 00:35:57.221 line:10% position:50% align:center
I began studying too.

00:35:57.221 --> 00:36:00.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since our parents had stopped studying,

00:36:00.258 --> 00:36:03.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
only three of us went to the meetings.

00:36:04.695 --> 00:36:07.698 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saved our allowance 
to take the bus to meetings. 

00:36:07.698 --> 00:36:10.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
But sometimes
when we were short of money—

00:36:10.401 --> 00:36:13.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
My sisters let me ride the bus, 

00:36:13.204 --> 00:36:16.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
since I’m the youngest,
and they would walk.

00:36:16.908 --> 00:36:20.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
We used to walk
an hour and a half each way.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:26.350 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meetings were so important to us 
that we never felt it was a burden.

00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:29.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
May 2007.

00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.190 line:90% position:50% align:center
For me, it was October 2006.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was baptized in October 2005.

00:36:37.595 --> 00:36:40.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
Three years later,
I spent a week 

00:36:40.064 --> 00:36:43.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
with a special pioneer 
who was serving in the countryside. 

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:47.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
We prayed together every night 

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:50.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
and read life stories from <i>The Watchtower</i>. 

00:36:50.241 --> 00:36:54.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
I told Jehovah
that I wanted to be just like her.

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:59.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
Although my relatives 
were unhappy with my decision, 

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:03.321 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s help,
I decided to become a pioneer.

00:37:03.321 --> 00:37:06.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
I followed her example,
and I became a pioneer too.

00:37:07.792 --> 00:37:11.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was working six days a week 
to support my family, 

00:37:11.162 --> 00:37:15.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
so I prayed to Jehovah 
for the opportunity to become a pioneer. 

00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:18.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
After my boss reduced
my work to five days a week,

00:37:18.469 --> 00:37:20.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
I started pioneering.

00:37:22.673 --> 00:37:25.276 line:90% position:50% align:center
Pioneer service gives you the opportunity

00:37:25.276 --> 00:37:27.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
to serve Jehovah more fully.

00:37:27.511 --> 00:37:32.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Working closely with Jehovah,
I really feel part of his family.

00:37:33.184 --> 00:37:36.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
My relationship with Jehovah
has gotten stronger.

00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:40.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
When I pray now,
it feels like I’m talking to my close friend.

00:37:40.958 --> 00:37:43.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows you to expand your ministry.

00:37:43.828 --> 00:37:48.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
I became a special pioneer in June 2013.

00:37:48.132 --> 00:37:53.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve served at Bethel since September 2013.

00:37:53.004 --> 00:37:57.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
In April 2014,
I was appointed a special pioneer.

00:37:58.709 --> 00:38:01.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now I can serve Jehovah more fully.

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:05.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
My appreciation for Jehovah has deepened.

00:38:05.483 --> 00:38:10.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our mother, who had opposed us,
became a pioneer too.

00:38:10.187 --> 00:38:11.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
Full-time service is—

00:38:11.856 --> 00:38:15.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
—really awesome!

00:38:16.961 --> 00:38:19.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
Whether we are parents or siblings, 

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:22.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
applying Bible principles 

00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:25.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
helps us to create a strong family bond. 

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:28.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can also help us before we have children, 

00:38:28.873 --> 00:38:31.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
even before we are married. 

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.811 line:90% position:50% align:center
The world tries to tempt us 

00:38:33.811 --> 00:38:38.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
with deceptive lies 
about what is important in life. 

00:38:38.382 --> 00:38:41.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
But our own careful research of the Bible 

00:38:41.752 --> 00:38:46.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
can protect and guide us 
when we are planning a wedding.

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:54.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
Juliana and I have been friends 
for a few years, 

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:59.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we have been getting to know 
each other better for several months.

00:39:00.137 --> 00:39:03.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things were going really well between us. 

00:39:03.941 --> 00:39:07.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
I must say, when Nick asked me 
to join some friends 

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:09.146 line:90% position:50% align:center
for a little get-together at the park, 

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:11.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was getting suspicious 

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:13.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
when both our families were there. 

00:39:14.518 --> 00:39:16.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
I said, “Yes!”

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:22.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t believe she didn’t see it coming. 

00:39:23.728 --> 00:39:27.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
We were both so excited, 
and word spread fast!

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:32.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the meeting the next day, 
everyone was congratulating us

00:39:32.737 --> 00:39:35.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
—my friend Natalie especially. 

00:39:35.072 --> 00:39:37.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
She was full of ideas.

00:39:38.976 --> 00:39:41.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t wait to start making plans.

00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:45.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
I never realized 
how much goes into a wedding. 

00:39:46.751 --> 00:39:49.820 line:90% position:50% align:center
And everyone had 
their own ideas of what we needed

00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.822 line:90% position:50% align:center
—even Dad! 

00:39:51.822 --> 00:39:54.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had to think about who we would invite, 

00:39:54.325 --> 00:39:57.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
pick out flowers, decorations, 

00:39:57.061 --> 00:40:00.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
a suit for Nick and, of course, a dress! 

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:03.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was going to be 

00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:06.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
so much fun
—or so I thought.

00:40:08.072 --> 00:40:12.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
I soon found out there’s 
a whole wedding-related industry out there. 

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:17.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
They were trying to be helpful but, 
at the same time, 

00:40:17.381 --> 00:40:19.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is how they make money. 

00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:23.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
It seemed like nothing they had was modest. 

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:28.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the cost for something 
I would only wear for one day

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:30.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
—I couldn’t afford that! 

00:40:30.561 --> 00:40:33.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everyone was so happy for me, 

00:40:33.097 --> 00:40:36.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
but inside I was really starting 
to feel the pressure.

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:41.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we met back at Juliana’s home, 

00:40:41.238 --> 00:40:43.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was pretty confused. 

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:46.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
She had been so happy a few days ago, 

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:49.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
but now she was so stressed out. 

00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:52.149 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was like nobody 
was listening to what we wanted. 

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
But to be honest, 

00:40:54.752 --> 00:40:57.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not sure we knew
what we wanted either. 

00:40:58.656 --> 00:41:02.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
I thought it would be good 
if maybe we could just take some time 

00:41:02.059 --> 00:41:05.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
and think about what a Christian wedding 
should really be like.

00:41:07.965 --> 00:41:10.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
We had a meeting with Brother Grey 
and Brother Sharp the next day 

00:41:10.935 --> 00:41:13.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
to discuss using the Kingdom Hall 
for our wedding. 

00:41:13.504 --> 00:41:14.772 line:90% position:50% align:center
They gave us some helpful reminders, 

00:41:15.406 --> 00:41:17.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and I’m so glad they did. 

00:41:18.108 --> 00:41:21.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 10:31 says: 

00:41:21.011 --> 00:41:25.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Whether you are eating 
or drinking or doing anything else, 

00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:27.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
do all things for God’s glory.” 

00:41:28.686 --> 00:41:31.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Sharp helped us to see 
that a wedding is a spiritual occasion, 

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:34.959 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we need to keep 
Jehovah’s standards in mind 

00:41:34.959 --> 00:41:38.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we plan for what we will 
or won’t choose to include.

00:41:39.864 --> 00:41:44.468 line:90% position:50% align:center
Brother Grey showed us 1 John 2:15, 16: 

00:41:44.468 --> 00:41:48.672 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Do not love either the world
or the things in the world.

00:41:48.672 --> 00:41:51.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
“. . . Because everything in the world

00:41:51.442 --> 00:41:55.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—the desire of the flesh
and the desire of the eyes

00:41:55.179 --> 00:41:57.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and the showy display
of one’s means of life—

00:41:57.982 --> 00:42:00.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
. . . originates with the world.”

00:42:00.784 --> 00:42:04.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
He reminded us that what
the world views as normal

00:42:04.488 --> 00:42:07.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
is far different from Christian standards 

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:10.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that we can be a good example 

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:13.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
by making sure our choices please Jehovah.

00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:18.402 line:90% position:50% align:center
They even gave us a few articles 
about wedding arrangements to review. 

00:42:18.402 --> 00:42:21.572 line:90% position:50% align:center
They wanted to make sure we would have 
a happy occasion with nothing to regret. 

00:42:23.974 --> 00:42:27.478 line:90% position:50% align:center
I asked Brother Sharp 
if he would be our director of the feast 

00:42:27.478 --> 00:42:29.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help keep things coordinated, 

00:42:29.480 --> 00:42:32.816 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he suggested that we talk 
about it over dinner that night.

00:42:34.585 --> 00:42:37.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
On the way there, 
we passed by a photography studio. 

00:42:38.889 --> 00:42:42.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
I couldn’t believe how lavish 
and showy some weddings are. 

00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
It looked more like an excuse to party 

00:42:45.563 --> 00:42:49.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
instead of something 
that’s supposed to honor God.

00:42:49.266 --> 00:42:51.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
It reminded me of the book of Galatians: 

00:42:51.268 --> 00:42:53.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now the works of the flesh are . . .

00:42:53.737 --> 00:42:57.508 line:90% position:50% align:center
drunkenness, wild parties, 
and things like these.” 

00:42:57.508 --> 00:43:01.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
We didn’t want to do anything like that. 

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:03.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
We each took the time
to prayerfully consider

00:43:03.948 --> 00:43:06.383 line:90% position:50% align:center
the material the brothers gave us.

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:10.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
We saw that Scriptural principles 
can even help us plan a wedding 

00:43:10.554 --> 00:43:14.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
that’s affordable, 
enjoyable for everyone, 

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:16.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
and a day that honors Jehovah. 

00:43:18.729 --> 00:43:20.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
It looked like we needed 
to make some adjustments. 

00:43:21.599 --> 00:43:23.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
We couldn’t include 
everything we originally thought

00:43:24.935 --> 00:43:26.971 line:90% position:50% align:center
—some things were just too expensive.

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:30.641 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we wanted to make sure 
that none of our choices 

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:32.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
reflected the spirit of the world.

00:43:35.746 --> 00:43:38.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we decided to start over 

00:43:38.582 --> 00:43:41.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make sure we
were doing things Jehovah’s way.

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:45.990 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Timothy 2:9 says that a Christian 

00:43:45.990 --> 00:43:50.628 line:90% position:50% align:center
“should adorn themselves 
in appropriate [or “respectable”] dress, 

00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:53.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
with modesty and soundness of mind.” 

00:43:53.330 --> 00:43:55.332 line:90% position:50% align:center
It took some work, 

00:43:55.332 --> 00:43:59.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
but we were able 
to find something affordable, 

00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:01.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
appropriate, 

00:44:01.972 --> 00:44:04.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
and beautiful.

00:44:06.844 --> 00:44:09.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was able to find a nice suit

00:44:09.613 --> 00:44:12.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
—something I could even wear later. 

00:44:12.850 --> 00:44:15.252 line:90% position:50% align:center
And of course, the girls came by 

00:44:15.252 --> 00:44:17.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
to make sure that everything matched.

00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:21.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Time went by so fast. 

00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:24.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
I called Brother Sharp 
so he could help us follow through 

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:26.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
on the day of the wedding.

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:32.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before we knew it, 
we were sending out invitations 

00:44:32.269 --> 00:44:34.271 line:90% position:50% align:center
and finalizing all the details.

00:44:38.042 --> 00:44:41.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
When my dad walked me 
down the aisle that day, 

00:44:41.278 --> 00:44:43.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so excited.

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:46.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
Juliana was so beautiful! 

00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:52.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the ceremony was just perfect. 

00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:59.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
After all that planning we did, 
we were sure to make it legal.

00:45:02.232 --> 00:45:04.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
When looking back at our photos, 

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:07.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
it brings back so many good memories.

00:45:07.638 --> 00:45:10.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
I was so happy 
with how nice everything turned out. 

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:14.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we saw 
what a great job our friends had done 

00:45:14.745 --> 00:45:18.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
decorating the reception, 
I couldn’t believe my eyes.

00:45:18.749 --> 00:45:21.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
It was perfect
—simple, 

00:45:21.552 --> 00:45:23.554 line:90% position:50% align:center
dignified. 

00:45:24.221 --> 00:45:28.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our friends all told us that it was 
one of the nicest weddings they’ve been to. 

00:45:28.859 --> 00:45:31.995 line:90% position:50% align:center
Everything that day
was just what we wanted. 

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:34.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
It even stayed on budget.

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:39.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
And most importantly, 
we got our marriage off to a good start 

00:45:39.036 --> 00:45:41.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Jehovah’s help.

00:45:42.406 --> 00:45:44.775 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so happy we found each other.

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:47.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m so happy I found you too, Love. 

00:45:48.345 --> 00:45:51.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I know we’ll stay happy 
if we keep Jehovah first.

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:59.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
The couple’s ability to reason 
on Scriptural principles 

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.160 line:90% position:50% align:center
helped them to make 
the right decisions. 

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:07.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Good reasoning ability 
is an essential quality of a true Christian. 

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:12.736 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what does it really mean 
to reason on matters? 

00:46:12.736 --> 00:46:17.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
This morning worship program 
by Gary Breaux will show us.

00:46:18.142 --> 00:46:22.246 line:10% position:50% align:center
If you’d open your Bibles to Romans 12:1, 

00:46:22.246 --> 00:46:25.149 line:10% position:50% align:center
we’ll note that the apostle Paul, 

00:46:25.149 --> 00:46:27.384 line:10% position:50% align:center
as has been commented on, 

00:46:27.384 --> 00:46:31.755 line:10% position:50% align:center
talks about reasoning on matters. 

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:35.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s Romans 12:1, it says: 

00:46:35.559 --> 00:46:39.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Therefore, I appeal to you 
by the compassions of God, brothers, 

00:46:39.029 --> 00:46:42.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to present your bodies 
as a living sacrifice, 

00:46:42.232 --> 00:46:44.868 line:90% position:50% align:center
“holy and acceptable to God, 

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:49.540 line:90% position:50% align:center
a sacred service 
with your power of reason.” 

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:55.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
Ah, so Paul says reasoning has power to it. 

00:46:55.879 --> 00:47:00.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
A synonym for power is influence. 

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:03.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so if you reason something out, 

00:47:03.587 --> 00:47:07.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
you’ll be influenced to make 
the proper decision, basically.

00:47:07.925 --> 00:47:11.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he also introduced 
something else in our text today. 

00:47:11.595 --> 00:47:12.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go there. 

00:47:12.396 --> 00:47:15.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s 2 Thessalonians chapter 2,

00:47:15.299 --> 00:47:18.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll read verses 1 and 2:

00:47:21.705 --> 00:47:23.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
“However, brothers, 

00:47:23.707 --> 00:47:26.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
“concerning the presence
of our Lord Jesus Christ

00:47:26.443 --> 00:47:28.679 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and our being gathered together to him,

00:47:28.679 --> 00:47:33.684 line:90% position:50% align:center
“we ask you not to be
quickly shaken from your reason

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:38.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
“nor to be alarmed
either by an inspired statement

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:43.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or by a spoken message
or by a letter appearing to be from us,

00:47:43.727 --> 00:47:47.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the effect
that the day of Jehovah is here.”

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:52.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
So he introduces this aspect

00:47:52.169 --> 00:47:55.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
of being quickly shaken

00:47:55.839 --> 00:47:59.243 line:90% position:50% align:center
once you come to a conclusion on a matter 

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.612 line:90% position:50% align:center
after reasoning it out.

00:48:01.612 --> 00:48:04.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he says don’t be quickly shaken 

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:07.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
once you come to a conclusion of the matter 

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:10.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a result of reasoning the matter out. 

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:14.558 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that’s what he was telling 
the Thessalonica congregation here. 

00:48:14.558 --> 00:48:17.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the first letter, 
he had talked about and warned them 

00:48:17.928 --> 00:48:22.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Jehovah’s day was imminent 
and that it was coming, 

00:48:22.699 --> 00:48:25.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a result, 
some in the congregation went beyond that, 

00:48:25.903 --> 00:48:27.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
saying that it was here. 

00:48:27.938 --> 00:48:29.940 line:90% position:50% align:center
In fact, as verse 2 says, 

00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:34.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
there apparently was even a letter 
that appeared to be from Paul 

00:48:34.878 --> 00:48:38.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
and saying that it’s not that it’s coming

00:48:38.649 --> 00:48:41.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Jehovah’s day is here. 

00:48:41.451 --> 00:48:45.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
And so some got sidetracked 

00:48:45.255 --> 00:48:48.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a result of not thinking it through, 

00:48:48.859 --> 00:48:51.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
and their faith was shaken, apparently. 

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:53.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then as you continue, 

00:48:53.697 --> 00:48:57.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
Paul then helped them 
to reason further that no, 

00:48:57.501 --> 00:49:01.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are other things 
that have to happen before Jehovah’s day.

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:05.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
So we’d like to talk about this matter 

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:09.212 line:90% position:50% align:center
of quickly being shaken
—that is our faith. 

00:49:10.113 --> 00:49:15.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s important because we spend years

00:49:15.118 --> 00:49:17.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
developing a relationship with Jehovah God

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:20.057 line:90% position:50% align:center
and developing a solid faith, 

00:49:20.057 --> 00:49:22.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just this idea that Paul introduces 

00:49:22.592 --> 00:49:26.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
that one’s faith can be quickly shaken 

00:49:26.029 --> 00:49:28.699 line:90% position:50% align:center
is a rather disconcerting thought. 

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
It can happen to any of us, really. 

00:49:32.502 --> 00:49:34.972 line:90% position:50% align:center
I just think about Judas Iscariot, right? 

00:49:34.972 --> 00:49:39.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
John 6:64 says 
that from the beginning Jesus knew 

00:49:39.443 --> 00:49:42.446 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was the one who would betray him
—from the beginning. 

00:49:42.446 --> 00:49:44.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the beginning of what? 

00:49:44.448 --> 00:49:45.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Insight </i>book says: 

00:49:45.582 --> 00:49:48.885 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘From the beginning’ 
of when Judas started to go bad, 

00:49:48.885 --> 00:49:53.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
started to give in to imperfection 
and sinful inclinations.” 

00:49:53.056 --> 00:49:55.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how long did that process take? 

00:49:55.492 --> 00:49:59.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it was less than a year 
from the time he was appointed as an apostle. 

00:49:59.563 --> 00:50:04.234 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, we know his appointment 
was no mistake. 

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:07.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
So within that short period of time, 

00:50:07.437 --> 00:50:12.442 line:90% position:50% align:center
this man went from an apostle 
to an apostate. 

00:50:12.442 --> 00:50:16.646 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s why it’s such good counsel 
that Paul gave 

00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:20.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
for us not to be quickly shaken 

00:50:20.183 --> 00:50:25.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
from matters that we have established
as a result of good reasoning.

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:30.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there are times 
that we’re more susceptible 

00:50:30.293 --> 00:50:34.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
to our faith
being quickly shaken than others. 

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:37.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’d like to talk 
about that for just a moment. 

00:50:37.901 --> 00:50:40.904 line:90% position:50% align:center
What could some of those times be? 

00:50:40.904 --> 00:50:45.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it could be 
when we’re going through stress, 

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:49.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
depression, or anxiety. 

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:54.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
The March 1, 2010, <i>Watchtower, </i>
makes this comment: 

00:50:54.017 --> 00:50:56.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Judgment may be clouded 

00:50:56.486 --> 00:51:00.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
when one is under great emotional stress.” 

00:51:00.824 --> 00:51:03.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let me give you an example

00:51:03.493 --> 00:51:06.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
—hypothetical, but here’s an example—

00:51:06.530 --> 00:51:10.567 line:90% position:50% align:center
a brother has a deep relationship 
with his parents; 

00:51:10.567 --> 00:51:13.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
his mother suddenly dies. 

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:17.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is a great emotional blow to him; 

00:51:17.707 --> 00:51:22.579 line:90% position:50% align:center
he slips into a mild depression, 

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:26.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
and as a result, his personal study 

00:51:26.116 --> 00:51:30.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
and his spiritual activities slow down. 

00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:35.492 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then a short time later, 
a sibling is disfellowshipped. 

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:39.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
This crushes him; he can’t sleep. 

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:44.134 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wakes up; he gets to the computer; 

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:47.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
he turns it on, 

00:51:47.938 --> 00:51:51.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he slips into watching
something inappropriate.

00:51:52.709 --> 00:51:54.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what’s just happened? 

00:51:54.711 --> 00:51:58.181 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, his good reasoning ability was shaken. 

00:51:58.181 --> 00:52:02.853 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s of note 
that the November 15, 1992, <i>Watchtower, </i>

00:52:02.853 --> 00:52:04.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
puts it this way: 

00:52:04.855 --> 00:52:08.058 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Severe and prolonged mental depression 

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:10.293 line:90% position:50% align:center
“may have worn away 

00:52:10.293 --> 00:52:14.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
“some of the person’s normally 
strong emotional fiber 

00:52:14.631 --> 00:52:19.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
or may have made it extremely difficult 
to make wise decisions.” 

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:21.705 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what could the brother have done? 

00:52:21.705 --> 00:52:25.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, when he first recognized 
this mild depression 

00:52:25.976 --> 00:52:29.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
or slipping from the spiritual activities, 

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:34.284 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would have been good for him to get
someone to help him identify the cause.

00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:37.420 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what is another circumstance 

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:42.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could quickly shake our faith

00:52:42.225 --> 00:52:44.227 line:90% position:50% align:center
if we’re not on guard?

00:52:45.028 --> 00:52:47.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it has to do with the apostates. 

00:52:49.432 --> 00:52:54.437 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, there is something 
that the apostates are talking about 

00:52:54.437 --> 00:52:56.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
and trying to put forward. 

00:52:56.873 --> 00:53:01.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
The media has picked it up; 
others have also picked it up. 

00:53:01.645 --> 00:53:03.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that is our Scriptural position 

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:06.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
of having a two-witnesses requirement 

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:09.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
for judicial action 
if there is no confession. 

00:53:09.653 --> 00:53:12.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, if you open your Bibles 
to Deuteronomy 19:15, 

00:53:12.489 --> 00:53:15.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
our good reasoning is pretty solid on this. 

00:53:15.559 --> 00:53:18.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Deuteronomy 19:15,

00:53:18.562 --> 00:53:23.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
the scripture is very, very clear. 

00:53:23.233 --> 00:53:27.571 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says: 
“No single witness may convict another 

00:53:27.571 --> 00:53:30.874 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for any error or any sin that he may commit. 

00:53:30.874 --> 00:53:33.043 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On the testimony of two witnesses 

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
“or on the testimony of three witnesses 

00:53:35.111 --> 00:53:37.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
the matter should be established.” 

00:53:37.113 --> 00:53:38.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s very clear, isn’t it? 

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:43.687 line:90% position:50% align:center
You cannot establish 
a judicial committee based on one witness. 

00:53:43.687 --> 00:53:46.489 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, listen, 
here’s what they say: 

00:53:46.489 --> 00:53:48.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Well now, look, 
the Old Testament 

00:53:48.758 --> 00:53:52.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
“also says that adulteresses 
should be stoned.

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:56.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now, since you’re not doing that, 

00:53:56.499 --> 00:54:01.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
why do you stick 
to this two-witness rule?” 

00:54:02.305 --> 00:54:06.543 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, if you’re not careful, 
that can do some tricks on your mind 

00:54:06.543 --> 00:54:09.179 line:90% position:50% align:center
because you have to think it through. 

00:54:09.179 --> 00:54:11.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, how might we do that? 

00:54:11.248 --> 00:54:14.084 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we go to Matthew 18:16

00:54:14.084 --> 00:54:17.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
because obviously Christ Jesus

00:54:17.354 --> 00:54:19.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
established the Christian arrangement,

00:54:19.689 --> 00:54:21.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
and notice what he said.

00:54:21.691 --> 00:54:25.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
Matthew 18:16, he says: 

00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:29.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
“But if he does not listen,
take along with you one or two more,

00:54:29.099 --> 00:54:33.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
“so that on the testimony
of two or three witnesses

00:54:33.370 --> 00:54:36.539 line:90% position:50% align:center
every matter may be established.”

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:41.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Christ Jesus establishes the fact
that there has to be two witnesses.

00:54:41.578 --> 00:54:44.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it doesn’t mean 
that if there is only one witness 

00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:46.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there are no consequences. 

00:54:46.883 --> 00:54:49.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
There might be, 
depending upon the situation, 

00:54:49.185 --> 00:54:52.455 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the Scriptures are very clear. 

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:55.692 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before a judicial committee can be convened, 

00:54:55.692 --> 00:54:59.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
there has to be a confession 
or two witnesses, 

00:54:59.729 --> 00:55:02.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
so we will never change 

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:06.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
our Scriptural position on that subject.

00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:11.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah has given us the ability 
to reason things out, to think it through. 

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:13.076 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s do our part 

00:55:13.076 --> 00:55:16.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
and not allow our faith
to be quickly shaken.

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:20.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
Then we can have 
the confidence that Paul spoke of 

00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:23.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
at 2 Thessalonians 3:5 when he said: 

00:55:23.086 --> 00:55:26.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May the Lord continue to guide
your hearts successfully

00:55:26.756 --> 00:55:30.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the love of God
and to the endurance for the Christ.”

00:55:31.828 --> 00:55:34.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even when difficult circumstances arise, 

00:55:34.831 --> 00:55:36.900 line:90% position:50% align:center
such as judicial matters, 

00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:41.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
we cling to our accurate understanding 
of the Bible. 

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:45.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, Jehovah is the God of truth. 

00:55:45.742 --> 00:55:48.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
And our desire for accurate knowledge 

00:55:48.611 --> 00:55:52.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
motivates us to draw 
ever closer to Jehovah 

00:55:52.048 --> 00:55:55.819 line:90% position:50% align:center
and to learn more 
about his perfect qualities. 

00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:59.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
Just think of everything 
we can learn about him 

00:55:59.356 --> 00:56:03.693 line:90% position:50% align:center
when we take the time 
to study his works of creation. 

00:56:03.693 --> 00:56:07.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 104:24 reads: 

00:56:07.464 --> 00:56:11.067 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How many your works are, O Jehovah! 

00:56:11.067 --> 00:56:13.737 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You have made all of them in wisdom. 

00:56:13.737 --> 00:56:17.574 line:90% position:50% align:center
The earth is full of what you have made.” 

00:56:18.141 --> 00:56:21.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
In harmony with that, 
our music video for this month 

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:25.849 line:90% position:50% align:center
is entitled <i>Inspired by Your Wonders.</i>

00:56:26.783 --> 00:56:31.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
I hear the birds singing out
to the sunrise.

00:56:34.190 --> 00:56:41.164 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see the stars fading away
in the morning light.

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:51.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
Golden sun shines on down
through the treetops,

00:56:53.176 --> 00:57:01.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where there is a summer breeze
that whispers so soft.

00:57:02.619 --> 00:57:07.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,

00:57:07.023 --> 00:57:12.028 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.” 

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:20.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.

00:57:22.238 --> 00:57:28.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:39.322 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

00:57:40.890 --> 00:57:42.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sing to you.

00:57:48.264 --> 00:57:53.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
These wondrous, moving,
breathing creations—

00:57:55.371 --> 00:58:03.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
Oh, in the night, in the day—
can you hear what they say?

00:58:07.350 --> 00:58:13.223 line:90% position:50% align:center
From mountaintops
to the bottoms of oceans,

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:24.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let ev’ry living thing
sing out to your praise.

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:28.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,

00:58:28.471 --> 00:58:33.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.” 

00:58:33.376 --> 00:58:42.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:51.961 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

00:58:53.062 --> 00:59:02.138 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders, 
and I sing to you.

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.174 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sing to you.

00:59:06.809 --> 00:59:12.782 line:90% position:50% align:center
Looking past what we 
can see with our eyes,

00:59:15.351 --> 00:59:23.760 line:90% position:50% align:center
We will come to know more 
about the One who gave us life.

00:59:26.296 --> 00:59:31.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I sing,
“O Jah, Jehovah my God,

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:36.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
The work of your hands
fills us with awe.” 

00:59:36.039 --> 00:59:44.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
I stare at the stars,
Wondering how you care who we are.

00:59:46.115 --> 00:59:54.958 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

00:59:54.958 --> 01:00:03.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders,
and I sing to you.

01:00:04.534 --> 01:00:13.009 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.

01:00:15.044 --> 01:00:21.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.

01:00:24.387 --> 01:00:31.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
I see your wonders,
and I—I sing to you.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:37.000 line:90% position:50% align:center
I sing to you.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:42.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
When we take time to reflect 
on the beauties of creation, 

01:00:42.739 --> 01:00:46.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
it becomes clear 
that there is a higher intelligence 

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:49.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
who made all these things. 

01:00:49.145 --> 01:00:51.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, David, it’s hard to imagine 

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:55.118 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we’ve already come to the end 
of another monthly broadcast.

01:00:55.118 --> 01:00:58.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, Jim, I want to thank you very much 
for all your help with this program. 

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:01.524 line:90% position:50% align:center
I really, really appreciate it. 

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:03.559 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, before we conclude, 

01:01:03.559 --> 01:01:06.896 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’d like to visit the city of Cuzco in Peru, 

01:01:06.896 --> 01:01:11.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
where we have 
a Remote Translation Office, or RTO.

01:01:11.934 --> 01:01:15.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
The city of Cuzco is a stopover 
for travelers to Machu Picchu, 

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:20.977 line:90% position:50% align:center
a historic sanctuary 
of the former Inca Empire, 

01:01:20.977 --> 01:01:23.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
located high up in the mountains. 

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:27.316 line:90% position:50% align:center
Machu Picchu is an architectural marvel. 

01:01:27.316 --> 01:01:30.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
The design is earthquake resistant. 

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:33.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
Giant stones were cut so precisely 

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:36.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
that in many places a piece of paper 

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:39.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
cannot fit in between them. 

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:42.632 line:90% position:50% align:center
At such high altitudes, 
you can also see llamas, 

01:01:42.632 --> 01:01:45.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
which are raised 
in the Andes Mountains. 

01:01:45.935 --> 01:01:48.171 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Inca people spoke Quechua, 

01:01:48.171 --> 01:01:50.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
a language that is spoken 

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:53.109 line:90% position:50% align:center
by millions of Peruvians today.

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:56.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
There has been a translation office in Cuzco 

01:01:56.045 --> 01:01:58.347 line:90% position:50% align:center
since 2004, 

01:01:58.347 --> 01:02:00.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
but as the work grew, 

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:02.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
so did the need for more office space. 

01:02:02.852 --> 01:02:07.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in 2016, a new RTO was dedicated. 

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:11.928 line:90% position:50% align:center
The blessings of the translation work 
have been evident. 

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:16.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Since the <i>Bible Teach </i>book 
was released in Quechua in 2007, 

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:18.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
the number of publishers increased 

01:02:18.901 --> 01:02:21.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
from about 700 

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:25.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
to nearly 1,700 last year. 

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:27.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
In addition to <i>The Watchtower </i>

01:02:27.143 --> 01:02:29.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the <i>Life and Ministry Meeting Workbook, </i>

01:02:29.145 --> 01:02:32.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
videos are translated at this office, 

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:36.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
ranging from JW Broadcasting 
monthly programs 

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:40.890 line:90% position:50% align:center
to episodes of <i>Become Jehovah’s Friend.</i>

01:02:40.890 --> 01:02:44.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are several regions in Peru 
where Quechua is spoken, 

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:48.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
all with slightly different dialects 
and expressions. 

01:02:48.097 --> 01:02:51.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hence, 
each translation team 

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:54.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
has representatives from these areas 

01:02:54.971 --> 01:02:57.106 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to ensure that the translation 

01:02:57.106 --> 01:02:59.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
is universally understood 

01:02:59.475 --> 01:03:01.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
among Quechua speakers. 

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:06.249 line:90% position:50% align:center
Approximately 40 brothers 
and sisters work at the RTO, 

01:03:06.249 --> 01:03:09.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
of which 15 are full-time. 

01:03:09.619 --> 01:03:11.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the Cuzco area, 

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:15.691 line:90% position:50% align:center
there are 28 congregations and 38 groups, 

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:19.195 line:90% position:50% align:center
with about 2,000 publishers.

01:03:19.195 --> 01:03:23.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
We love our brothers and sisters 
in Cuzco very much indeed. 

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they want you to know 

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.669 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much they love you. 

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:28.838 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, until next time, 

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:31.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting 

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:35.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
from the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
