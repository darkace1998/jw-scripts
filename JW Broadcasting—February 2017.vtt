00:01.283 --> 00:04.053
Welcome to JW Broadcasting! 


00:04.053 --> 00:06.655
This month we’ll consider 
ways we can get 


00:06.655 --> 00:09.125
the most benefit 
from Bible principles. 


00:09.125 --> 00:11.227
Here are some highlights: 


00:11.227 --> 00:14.164
How can Bible study and meditation 


00:14.163 --> 00:17.300
prepare us for trials? 


00:17.300 --> 00:20.370
We’ll learn about the example 
of Sister Gertrud Pötzinger 


00:20.370 --> 00:22.372
through an archived interview. 


00:22.372 --> 00:26.342
What principles and Bible accounts 
enabled her and her husband, Martin, 


00:26.342 --> 00:30.012
to keep their integrity 
in Nazi Germany?


00:30.012 --> 00:33.000
Jehovah urges us 
to seek first the Kingdom. 


00:34.083 --> 00:36.886
What can happen when a person 
seeks things in the world 


00:36.887 --> 00:39.222
instead of the Kingdom? 


00:39.222 --> 00:43.059
We’ll listen to how this young sister 
learned to trust Jehovah 


00:43.058 --> 00:46.000
and lead a life that brings 
true happiness.


00:47.063 --> 00:49.765
Have you ever thought 
that a familiar piece of Bible counsel 


00:49.765 --> 00:52.235
didn’t apply to your situation? 


00:52.235 --> 00:56.605
Well, how can analyzing such counsel 
lead to related principles 


00:56.605 --> 00:59.842
that fit your specific challenge? 


00:59.842 --> 01:04.714
We’ll see 
in this encouraging dramatization. 


01:04.713 --> 01:09.000
You’re watching 
JW Broadcasting for February 2017.


01:29.138 --> 01:31.841
You and I make a lot of decisions every day. 


01:31.842 --> 01:34.644
Now, some have a little impact on our lives; 


01:34.643 --> 01:37.313
others have a very big impact. 


01:37.313 --> 01:39.548
And we can appreciate that we can make 


01:39.548 --> 01:42.385
choices and decisions for ourselves. 


01:42.385 --> 01:46.055
Think of how life would be 
if you made no decisions for yourself


01:46.055 --> 01:48.925
—someone tells you when to go to bed,


01:48.925 --> 01:50.927
they pick out your clothes, 


01:50.927 --> 01:52.929
and they tell you what to do for work. 


01:52.928 --> 01:54.830
Well, none of us would like that!


01:54.830 --> 01:58.400
Jehovah gave each of us free will, 


01:58.400 --> 02:00.503
and that’s the precious gift 


02:00.503 --> 02:03.005
of making choices for ourselves. 


02:03.005 --> 02:06.308
Now, have you ever thought 
about why Jehovah gave us this gift? 


02:06.308 --> 02:09.078
I mean, 
why trust us with free will 


02:09.078 --> 02:12.981
when he knew that we could make 
bad choices or decisions? 


02:12.982 --> 02:16.119
Well, one powerful reason is love. 


02:16.118 --> 02:19.321
The only way to give us the gift of love 


02:19.322 --> 02:22.259
is also to give us the gift of free will. 


02:22.258 --> 02:24.326
The two are tied together. 


02:24.327 --> 02:27.997
You really can’t have 
one without the other.


02:27.997 --> 02:30.967
For example, 
if I programmed my computer 


02:30.967 --> 02:33.435
to give me a message 
every day at 2:00 p.m.: 


02:33.435 --> 02:36.505
“John, I love you. 
I think you’re a wonderful guy,” 


02:36.505 --> 02:39.875
I think there’d be a little something 
wrong with me if I thought: 


02:39.875 --> 02:43.647
‘Aw, isn’t that nice? 
My computer, it loves me.’ 


02:43.647 --> 02:46.082
Yeah, love only exists 


02:46.082 --> 02:50.420
if it comes truly 
from a free-will expression.


02:50.420 --> 02:54.557
Now, did Jehovah place 
any boundaries on free will? 


02:54.557 --> 02:56.325
Yes. 


02:56.325 --> 02:59.062
They were stated in the Law 
to the nation of Israel. 


02:59.062 --> 03:01.730
And Jesus later repeated them 


03:01.730 --> 03:06.000
at Matthew 22:37-40: 


03:07.170 --> 03:09.738
“He said to him: 


03:09.738 --> 03:13.408
“‘“You must love Jehovah your God 
with your whole heart 


03:13.408 --> 03:16.946
“‘“and with your whole soul
and with your whole mind.”


03:16.947 --> 03:20.049
“‘This is the greatest
and first commandment.


03:20.048 --> 03:22.351
“‘The second, like it, is this: 


03:22.352 --> 03:25.355
“‘“You must love your
neighbor as yourself.”


03:25.355 --> 03:28.057
“‘On these two commandments 


03:28.057 --> 03:31.627
the whole Law hangs,
and the Prophets.’”


03:31.627 --> 03:34.530
So our use of free will 


03:34.530 --> 03:37.267
has love of God
and love of neighbor 


03:37.267 --> 03:39.269
as its boundaries.


03:39.268 --> 03:41.270
Notice, for example, 


03:41.270 --> 03:43.740
what people are doing 
in this picture, 


03:43.740 --> 03:48.745
both inside the circle boundary 
and outside. 


03:48.745 --> 03:50.813
See, free will allows us to do 


03:50.813 --> 03:52.915
any of the things 
we see in the picture. 


03:52.915 --> 03:55.952
But love of God 
and love of neighbor 


03:55.952 --> 03:58.622
move us to reject 
what’s outside the circle 


03:58.622 --> 04:00.657
and choose 
to do the kinds of things 


04:00.657 --> 04:03.125
that we see inside the circle.


04:03.125 --> 04:06.128
Now, to stay 
within those boundaries, 


04:06.128 --> 04:08.296
Jehovah gave us 
a marvelous brain 


04:08.297 --> 04:10.467
and a built-in conscience, 


04:10.467 --> 04:12.835
but he also knows 
we need more help. 


04:12.835 --> 04:16.072
And that’s why 
he also gave us Bible principles


04:16.072 --> 04:19.142
—basic truths from the Bible 


04:19.142 --> 04:21.810
that can help us 
to make good decisions. 


04:21.810 --> 04:25.448
And it can safely be said 
that any decision we face 


04:25.448 --> 04:28.785
can be guided 
by Bible principles. 


04:28.785 --> 04:31.000
Now, our Creator, Jehovah, 
knows what’s best for us. 


04:32.588 --> 04:35.925
And he also trusts us 
to make decisions 


04:35.925 --> 04:38.327
based on Bible principles 


04:38.327 --> 04:40.664
because he knows 
that when we do that, 


04:40.663 --> 04:44.033
then we’re really, 
truly going to be happy, content, 


04:44.033 --> 04:47.536
and at peace with him 
and with others.


04:47.537 --> 04:49.639
So in review so far: 


04:49.638 --> 04:52.041
Jehovah gave us free will


04:52.042 --> 04:55.512
—that’s the privilege 
to make choices for ourselves—


04:55.512 --> 04:58.949
and he also gave us 
Bible principles 


04:58.948 --> 05:02.885
as the boundaries 
to our choices. 


05:02.885 --> 05:07.423
But making difficult decisions 
requires that we train ourselves 


05:07.423 --> 05:11.760
to recognize Bible principles 
and apply them. 


05:11.760 --> 05:15.998
Now let’s read Romans 12:1, 


05:15.998 --> 05:18.066
and let’s see how this verse 


05:18.067 --> 05:22.539
describes the decision-making process. 


05:22.538 --> 05:25.541
“Therefore, I appeal to you 


05:25.542 --> 05:27.544
“by the compassions of God, brothers, 


05:27.543 --> 05:31.080
“to present your bodies 
as a living sacrifice, 


05:31.080 --> 05:33.817
“holy and acceptable to God, 


05:33.817 --> 05:38.822
a sacred service 
with your power of reason.”


05:38.822 --> 05:43.325
So are we using 
our “power of reason” 


05:43.325 --> 05:46.662
to understand Bible principles? 


05:46.662 --> 05:48.799
For example, young children 


05:48.798 --> 05:51.200
ask lots of questions. 


05:51.200 --> 05:53.335
But has a child ever asked you: 


05:53.335 --> 05:55.505
“What happens when I drop a ball? 


05:55.505 --> 05:57.973
a pencil? a book?” 


05:57.973 --> 05:59.975
No, they don’t ask that. 


05:59.975 --> 06:02.545
They know what happens 
to anything they drop. 


06:02.545 --> 06:04.547
It falls down! 


06:04.547 --> 06:07.550
See, the child doesn’t need 
rules for every object 


06:07.550 --> 06:10.553
but has quickly grasped the principle. 


06:10.553 --> 06:13.000
Anything he drops falls down. 


06:14.223 --> 06:17.060
Now, 
what if an 18-year-old asked you, 


06:17.060 --> 06:20.830
“What’s going to happen
when I drop this pen?”


06:20.830 --> 06:23.967
Well, it’s obvious 
he’s not been paying attention 


06:23.967 --> 06:26.869
to basic principles of life. 


06:26.868 --> 06:30.773
So by us paying attention 
to Bible principles, 


06:30.773 --> 06:33.910
we can very quickly see 
the pattern 


06:33.910 --> 06:37.247
of love of God 
and love of neighbor 


06:37.247 --> 06:39.482
and know 
the right thing to do 


06:39.482 --> 06:43.000
without a long list of rules 
for every situation.


06:44.953 --> 06:48.423
Well, how can we train
our “power of reason”?


06:48.423 --> 06:51.893
We train it by paying attention 


06:51.893 --> 06:54.796
as we read and study the Bible. 


06:54.797 --> 06:56.832
Now, we don’t need rules 


06:56.832 --> 07:00.369
for which movies to watch, 
which songs to listen to, 


07:00.368 --> 07:02.605
or what clothes we can wear. 


07:02.605 --> 07:06.808
If we’re paying attention 
when we’re reading the Bible, 


07:06.808 --> 07:10.311
we train our conscience 
with Bible principles 


07:10.312 --> 07:12.449
so we can make 
such decisions 


07:12.448 --> 07:15.751
without needing 
a long list of rules. 


07:15.752 --> 07:18.220
You know, 
we could compare our training 


07:18.220 --> 07:21.423
of our “power of reason” 
to a blind person 


07:21.423 --> 07:23.591
using a guide dog. 


07:23.592 --> 07:25.595
Now, an untrained dog 


07:25.595 --> 07:28.297
would be very helpful 
to a blind person. 


07:28.297 --> 07:31.800
It would bark when others 
were around, for example. 


07:31.800 --> 07:34.037
However, 
a dog trained 


07:34.037 --> 07:37.640
in specific skills 
is amazingly helpful. 


07:37.640 --> 07:40.042
The dog knows 
when to stop at curbs 


07:40.042 --> 07:42.044
and walk around obstacles 


07:42.043 --> 07:44.513
that the person 
might run their head into. 


07:44.513 --> 07:48.250
A guide dog 
is also taught a skill called 


07:48.250 --> 07:50.753
“intelligent disobedience.” 


07:50.753 --> 07:54.190
And even if the blind person 
encourages the dog forward, 


07:54.190 --> 07:56.192
it won’t obey, 


07:56.192 --> 07:59.062
but it’ll pull 
the person back from danger. 


07:59.062 --> 08:02.932
Now, it can take a year or more 
of training for the dog to learn 


08:02.932 --> 08:07.035
the amazing skills 
that are so helpful to a blind person.


08:07.035 --> 08:11.173
Likewise, our raw, 
untrained “power of reason” 


08:11.173 --> 08:13.208
can help us to a degree. 


08:13.208 --> 08:16.245
However, it can be amazing 


08:16.245 --> 08:19.248
if we take the time to train it. 


08:19.248 --> 08:22.251
Now, here are 
three skills that we can use 


08:22.252 --> 08:24.254
to train our “power of reason.” 


08:24.253 --> 08:26.588
They are illustrating, 


08:26.588 --> 08:28.590
analyzing, 


08:28.590 --> 08:31.260
and balancing. 


08:31.260 --> 08:35.163
Now, to consider our first skill, 
illustrating, 


08:35.163 --> 08:40.235
let’s use the general topic 
of forgiveness.


08:40.235 --> 08:45.000
What Bible principles 
could help with forgiveness? 


08:46.375 --> 08:50.580
Please think of as many principles 
and scriptures as you can. 


08:50.580 --> 08:53.950
Now, if it helps, 
you can pause the program now 


08:53.950 --> 08:56.000
and write down 
the principles that come to mind. 


08:58.453 --> 09:02.491
Now, your list 
may include principles like these: 


09:02.492 --> 09:04.960
Matthew 18:22 says 


09:04.960 --> 09:07.000
to forgive “up to 77 times”; 


09:08.530 --> 09:11.000
Proverbs 12:18 says: 


09:11.000 --> 09:14.003
“The tongue of the wise is a healing”; 


09:14.003 --> 09:17.506
and Colossians 3:13 tells us 


09:17.507 --> 09:20.877
to ‘forgive one another freely.’


09:20.877 --> 09:24.047
Now, the skill 
we want to learn is illustrating


09:24.047 --> 09:28.184
—creating a mental picture 
of an idea or principle 


09:28.183 --> 09:30.285
to see its real meaning 
and impact. 


09:30.285 --> 09:33.255
Now, even if we 
are not skilled artists, 


09:33.255 --> 09:37.260
all of us can and do create 
pictures in our minds. 


09:37.260 --> 09:41.930
When illustrating, 
pay attention to things that are similar 


09:41.930 --> 09:45.000
or like the thing 
you are trying to visualize. 


09:45.000 --> 09:49.005
For example, 
if sin is like debt, 


09:49.005 --> 09:53.675
then forgiveness 
is like someone canceling the debt. 


09:53.675 --> 09:57.980
If a hurtful remark 
is like a cut, 


09:57.980 --> 10:01.817
then forgiveness 
is like seeing it heal. 


10:01.817 --> 10:05.354
If sin is like a mark 
on a blackboard, 


10:05.353 --> 10:08.690
forgiveness is like erasing it. 


10:08.690 --> 10:11.960
Proverbs 12:18 


10:11.960 --> 10:15.000
is a great example 
of using the “like” technique. 


10:16.365 --> 10:21.437
“Thoughtless speech 
is like the stabs of a sword, 


10:21.437 --> 10:25.942
but the tongue of the wise 
is a healing.”


10:25.942 --> 10:27.944
Imagine what your skin 
would look like 


10:27.943 --> 10:31.146
if you still had 
every open cut, bruise, 


10:31.147 --> 10:33.649
or bleeding scratch 
since childhood. 


10:33.648 --> 10:36.518
See, Jehovah 
wonderfully designed our body 


10:36.518 --> 10:39.288
to heal such minor cuts 
and bruises. 


10:39.288 --> 10:43.358
And we can now visualize 
how the forgiveness of others 


10:43.358 --> 10:45.928
helps us to heal emotionally. 


10:45.928 --> 10:48.296
Now, learning to illustrate, 
or visualize, 


10:48.297 --> 10:50.299
takes time and practice. 


10:50.298 --> 10:53.701
However, it can be one 
of the most powerful skills we use 


10:53.702 --> 10:55.872
to train 
our “power of reason,” 


10:55.872 --> 10:58.107
and it can also be 
quite enjoyable. 


10:58.107 --> 11:00.209
You know, 
try at your family worship 


11:00.208 --> 11:02.678
to take 
the principles for a topic 


11:02.678 --> 11:04.980
and see 
how many similarities, 


11:04.980 --> 11:07.315
or “likes,” 
you can come up with. 


11:07.315 --> 11:10.085
Now, granted, 
they all won’t be amazing, 


11:10.085 --> 11:13.155
but you may be surprised 
by the insights 


11:13.155 --> 11:17.192
that come from seeing 
something from a new perspective.


11:17.192 --> 11:19.662
Well, let’s consider now 
our second skill: 


11:19.662 --> 11:21.764
analyzing.


11:21.763 --> 11:24.033
Now, analyzing something means 


11:24.033 --> 11:26.901
“examining it carefully in detail.” 


11:26.902 --> 11:31.407
And let’s use 
the topic of wrong desires. 


11:31.407 --> 11:34.277
Now, in this case, 
let’s say that we’ve already found 


11:34.277 --> 11:39.315
the principle 
at Colossians 3:5: 


11:39.315 --> 11:43.985
“Deaden, therefore, your body members 
that are on the earth 


11:43.985 --> 11:47.590
“as respects sexual immorality, 
uncleanness, 


11:47.590 --> 11:49.958
“uncontrolled sexual passion, 


11:49.958 --> 11:52.461
“hurtful desire, and greediness, 


11:52.462 --> 11:54.964
which is idolatry.”


11:54.963 --> 11:59.868
Now, what can we learn
from analyzing Colossians 3:5


11:59.868 --> 12:03.038
to help when we struggle 
with wrong desires? 


12:03.038 --> 12:05.841
Again, feel free 
to pause the program 


12:05.842 --> 12:08.000
if you want some time 
to think about it. 


12:09.612 --> 12:13.149
Look carefully 
at each step outlined. 


12:13.148 --> 12:16.151
Did you notice, for example, 
what appears to be 


12:16.152 --> 12:20.990
a reverse order 
of the steps leading to sin? 


12:20.990 --> 12:24.727
This verse works its way 
from sexual immorality 


12:24.727 --> 12:27.329
back to the very roots 
of the problem.


12:27.328 --> 12:31.600
Now, let’s take each phrase 
starting with the last, 


12:31.600 --> 12:35.437
“greediness, which is idolatry.” 


12:35.437 --> 12:38.640
So, sexual immorality 
starts with selfishness, 


12:38.640 --> 12:42.143
greedily putting our needs 
ahead of anything else. 


12:42.143 --> 12:45.313
Next is “hurtful desire.” 


12:45.313 --> 12:48.883
Greediness leads to “hurtful desire.” 


12:48.883 --> 12:52.053
It’s like a person 
hanging around a bakery, 


12:52.053 --> 12:56.558
smelling the bread and cakes 
when he can’t pay for it. 


12:56.558 --> 12:59.928
Likewise, 
hanging around immoral entertainment 


12:59.928 --> 13:01.930
or bad associates 


13:01.930 --> 13:06.435
can feed “hurtful desire” 
for what is not ours. 


13:06.435 --> 13:10.940
Next is listed 
“uncontrolled sexual passion.” 


13:10.940 --> 13:15.443
So “hurtful desire” 
has now turned from an idea 


13:15.443 --> 13:18.446
into a strong emotion 
of passion, 


13:18.447 --> 13:20.950
causing one 
to look for an opportunity 


13:20.950 --> 13:23.618
to fulfill the desire. 


13:23.618 --> 13:26.355
Next, “uncleanness.” 


13:26.355 --> 13:30.658
The previous steps have now led 
to inappropriate physical conduct 


13:30.658 --> 13:33.895
with another person. 


13:33.895 --> 13:37.633
Finally, “sexual immorality”
—serious sin. 


13:37.633 --> 13:40.535
Sexual immorality 
has occurred between persons 


13:40.535 --> 13:43.505
that are not married 
to one another. 


13:43.505 --> 13:47.577
So analyzing Colossians 3:5 


13:47.577 --> 13:52.480
can really help us to eliminate, 
not stimulate, wrong desires. 


13:52.480 --> 13:54.950
And we can see 
how important it is 


13:54.950 --> 13:57.485
to get rid 
of wrong desires immediately. 


13:57.485 --> 13:59.488
It’s easier 
to walk away from sin 


13:59.488 --> 14:03.025
when we’re still in the early stages, 
rather than later.


14:03.025 --> 14:05.193
So we need 
to practice the skill 


14:05.193 --> 14:08.496
of not simply 
just reading scriptures 


14:08.497 --> 14:10.499
but analyzing them 


14:10.498 --> 14:12.668
until we’ve learned 
all that we can. 


14:12.668 --> 14:15.003
And we can use 
the many research tools we have 


14:15.003 --> 14:18.906
to find valuable comments 
and application.


14:18.907 --> 14:20.877
Now, let’s consider our third 


14:20.877 --> 14:24.012
and final skill: balancing. 


14:24.012 --> 14:26.015
And to do that, 


14:26.015 --> 14:29.552
let’s use a question 
on the topic of alcohol.


14:29.552 --> 14:33.789
What Bible principles 
could help a couple to decide 


14:33.788 --> 14:37.391
whether to serve alcohol 
at their wedding? 


14:37.392 --> 14:41.164
What principles and scriptures 
do you think would help them 


14:41.163 --> 14:44.266
make a balanced decision? 


14:44.267 --> 14:46.569
Again, you’re welcome 
to pause the program 


14:46.568 --> 14:48.936
if you’d like to write down 
what comes to mind 


14:48.937 --> 14:51.740
or to research something. 


14:51.740 --> 14:55.610
Now, your list probably has 
some of these principles. 


14:55.610 --> 15:00.448
At John 2:9, 
Jesus made wine for a wedding. 


15:00.448 --> 15:04.253
However, 
1 Corinthians 6:10 says 


15:04.253 --> 15:07.623
that ‘drunkards 
will not inherit the Kingdom.’ 


15:07.623 --> 15:11.360
And 1 Corinthians 10:31, 32 says: 


15:11.360 --> 15:14.028
“Whether you are eating or drinking . . . , 


15:14.028 --> 15:16.531
do all things for God’s glory” 


15:16.532 --> 15:20.937
and to “keep from becoming 
causes for stumbling.” 


15:20.937 --> 15:22.939
Now, 
it doesn’t seem 


15:22.938 --> 15:26.575
that any one principle 
provides the answer. 


15:26.575 --> 15:28.577
The couple could simply say: 


15:28.577 --> 15:32.214
“Well, Jesus served wine at a wedding, 
so we can too.” 


15:32.213 --> 15:35.116
However, there’s really more 
to it than that, isn’t there? 


15:35.117 --> 15:37.787
It’s clear that a balance 


15:37.787 --> 15:40.655
of all these Bible principles 
is needed.


15:40.655 --> 15:43.358
Will relatives 
or others be there 


15:43.358 --> 15:45.961
who might be prone 
to overdrinking? 


15:45.962 --> 15:49.799
Would serving alcohol bother 
the conscience of many present 


15:49.798 --> 15:53.968
because of local customs 
and feelings about alcohol? 


15:53.968 --> 15:56.805
It’s often the case 
when making decisions 


15:56.805 --> 16:00.542
that we need to balance 
several Bible principles, 


16:00.542 --> 16:05.314
not taking any one principle solely 
on its own merit. 


16:05.313 --> 16:09.183
Jehovah expects us 
to use our “power of reason” 


16:09.183 --> 16:13.455
to balance Bible principles 
and make good decisions. 


16:13.455 --> 16:18.093
Ecclesiastes 7:16-18 


16:18.093 --> 16:21.063
gives us good advice 
about being balanced. 


16:21.063 --> 16:24.366
“Do not be overly righteous, 


16:24.367 --> 16:27.402
“nor show yourself excessively wise. 


16:27.402 --> 16:30.072
“Why should you bring ruin to yourself? 


16:30.072 --> 16:33.275
“Do not be excessively wicked, 
nor be foolish. 


16:33.275 --> 16:35.410
“Why should you die before your time? 


16:35.410 --> 16:38.447
“It is best to grasp one warning 


16:38.447 --> 16:40.449
“without letting go of the other; 


16:40.448 --> 16:44.353
for the one who fears God 
will heed them both.”


16:44.353 --> 16:46.455
How true. 


16:46.455 --> 16:49.892
Such balance between extremes 
is often necessary 


16:49.892 --> 16:51.960
when we apply 
Bible principles. 


16:51.960 --> 16:54.897
We need to heed them both, 
so to speak. 


16:54.897 --> 16:58.334
We need to balance 
all the Bible principles 


16:58.333 --> 17:00.335
so we can come 
to the decision 


17:00.335 --> 17:03.838
that would show love of God 
and love of neighbor. 


17:03.838 --> 17:08.176
We could illustrate the balance 
between different Bible principles 


17:08.177 --> 17:11.047
and applying them with this model bike. 


17:11.047 --> 17:13.415
It was a gift from a brother in Malawi. 


17:13.415 --> 17:17.585
Now, a bicycle has 
three basic principles of operation: 


17:17.585 --> 17:20.655
the brakes, the pedals, and the steering. 


17:20.655 --> 17:24.192
Now, the brakes are really like principles 


17:24.192 --> 17:26.195
that slow us down 


17:26.195 --> 17:28.330
or stop us from doing the wrong thing. 


17:28.330 --> 17:30.532
And the pedals are really like the principles 


17:30.532 --> 17:32.534
that move us forward 


17:32.533 --> 17:35.503
in showing love for Jehovah 
and our brothers and sisters. 


17:35.503 --> 17:38.640
And the steering is like our free will 


17:38.640 --> 17:41.277
to choose a direction in life 


17:41.277 --> 17:43.279
that pleases Jehovah. 


17:43.278 --> 17:46.348
So making decisions 
is like riding a bicycle. 


17:46.348 --> 17:51.386
We have to balance 
several Bible principles.


17:51.387 --> 17:53.555
So in review, 


17:53.555 --> 17:55.923
Jehovah gave us free will 


17:55.923 --> 17:59.461
to use within the boundaries 
of love of God and love of neighbor 


17:59.462 --> 18:02.364
and many other fine Bible principles. 


18:02.363 --> 18:06.268
Making difficult decisions requires 
that we train our “power of reason” 


18:06.268 --> 18:09.036
to recognize Bible principles 
and apply them. 


18:09.037 --> 18:11.072
And we discussed 
how to train 


18:11.072 --> 18:13.242
our power of reason 
with the three skills: 


18:13.242 --> 18:14.710
illustrating, 


18:14.710 --> 18:16.010
analyzing, 


18:16.010 --> 18:18.313
and balancing. 


18:18.313 --> 18:20.381
So no matter what decisions 
you are faced with, 


18:20.382 --> 18:22.384
we encourage you: 


18:22.383 --> 18:26.000
“Let Bible principles guide you.”


18:27.255 --> 18:29.357
Let’s use 
the following dramatization 


18:29.357 --> 18:32.260
to practice the skills 
we’ve just discussed. 


18:32.260 --> 18:34.262
In this video, 


18:34.262 --> 18:37.099
three Witnesses all hear 
the same familiar Bible counsel 


18:37.098 --> 18:39.100
at a Christian meeting. 


18:39.100 --> 18:41.403
And at first, 
it doesn’t seem to apply 


18:41.403 --> 18:43.771
to anything 
they’re currently experiencing, 


18:43.772 --> 18:45.774
but it does. 


18:45.773 --> 18:47.943
Maybe that’s happened to you. 


18:47.943 --> 18:50.178
As you listen to their reasoning, 


18:50.178 --> 18:54.616
what do you think they 
could do to let Bible principles 


18:54.617 --> 18:58.000
guide them 
to making a good decision?


19:00.955 --> 19:03.292
We must know Jehovah well. 


19:03.292 --> 19:05.894
That means knowing 
his thinking on matters. 


19:05.893 --> 19:09.665
We should welcome 
such an examination 


19:09.665 --> 19:12.500
and make any necessary changes. 


19:12.500 --> 19:14.537
For example, 


19:14.537 --> 19:18.000
let’s read 
1 Corinthians 15:33 together. 


19:20.408 --> 19:22.476
Here we read: 


19:22.477 --> 19:24.514
“Do not be misled. 


19:24.513 --> 19:28.150
Bad associations spoil useful habits.” 


19:28.150 --> 19:31.118
As familiar as that principle is, 


19:31.118 --> 19:33.921
can you think of an area in your life 


19:33.922 --> 19:36.000
where it’s difficult to apply?


19:38.660 --> 19:39.762
Hey, John.


19:39.762 --> 19:40.395
Hey.


19:40.395 --> 19:41.530
I know it’s not your usual, 


19:41.530 --> 19:43.065
but there’s no one to entertain 
those clients tonight. 


19:43.065 --> 19:44.065
So can you do it? 
Thanks.


19:44.065 --> 19:44.567
But I have. . .


19:44.567 --> 19:45.000
Great.


19:49.605 --> 19:53.000
Until then, 
it wasn’t my usual thing. 


20:03.285 --> 20:06.000
But I need to support my family. 


20:13.295 --> 20:17.967
And these aren’t really my friends. 


20:17.967 --> 20:19.669
I can handle it. 


20:19.668 --> 20:21.603
I think.


20:21.603 --> 20:23.705
. . .we’re faced with bad associations 


20:23.705 --> 20:25.740
in subtle ways. 


20:25.740 --> 20:28.477
This may require us 
to ask additional questions 


20:28.477 --> 20:30.479
of ourselves. 


20:30.478 --> 20:33.781
Are we letting in bad association 


20:33.782 --> 20:35.117
through social media? 


20:35.117 --> 20:38.487
Perhaps we can think 
of another way bad association. . .


20:38.487 --> 20:41.000
I don’t think so


20:43.625 --> 20:47.762
—except for some friends 
from my old congregation. 


20:47.762 --> 20:49.765
Wow! 


20:49.765 --> 20:52.300
They’re not doing so well spiritually. 


20:52.300 --> 20:56.338
But if I stay connected 
and see what they’re doing, 


20:56.338 --> 20:59.106
maybe I can help them.


20:59.107 --> 21:00.575
. . .can affect us. 


21:00.575 --> 21:03.912
Maybe it’s something very specific. 


21:03.912 --> 21:05.947
Or maybe 


21:05.947 --> 21:08.684
bad association 
is coming from a place 


21:08.683 --> 21:11.000
we never expected.


21:15.123 --> 21:18.000
I only join games 
with Witness friends I know. 


21:19.260 --> 21:21.330
But sometimes 


21:21.330 --> 21:26.335
they connect 
with people I don’t know 


21:26.335 --> 21:30.000
who pick games 
I’m not sure we should play. 


21:33.675 --> 21:37.000
But maybe my friends know them, 


21:38.813 --> 21:41.048
so they’re probably OK.


21:41.048 --> 21:44.820
It is vital that we avoid 
bad associations. 


21:44.820 --> 21:48.000
Now, 
as we resume in Psalm 26. . .


21:49.892 --> 21:52.827
The basic principle in this story
is one we all know: 


21:52.827 --> 21:55.997
“Bad associations spoil useful habits.” 


21:55.997 --> 21:59.735
But do our three friends 
find themselves in the same situation, 


21:59.735 --> 22:04.105
where they can simply apply 
1 Corinthians 15:33 


22:04.105 --> 22:06.140
in exactly the same way? 


22:06.140 --> 22:08.143
No. 


22:08.143 --> 22:11.078
The family head is concerned 
about supporting his family. 


22:11.078 --> 22:13.715
Our sister wants 
to stay in touch with her friends 


22:13.715 --> 22:16.317
in hopes of helping them spiritually. 


22:16.317 --> 22:19.154
And our young brother 
didn’t know exactly who 


22:19.153 --> 22:21.523
his associates were.


22:21.523 --> 22:24.760
Are you already thinking of 
additional principles 


22:24.760 --> 22:27.495
that would apply 
to each person’s problem? 


22:27.495 --> 22:31.933
How would you illustrate, analyze, 
or balance those principles 


22:31.933 --> 22:34.035
if you were in their position? 


22:34.035 --> 22:36.938
If you want to, 
pause the program here. 


22:36.938 --> 22:40.041
Take the time to write down 
what you’re thinking. 


22:40.042 --> 22:43.912
Then watch how they each 
search for Bible principles 


22:43.912 --> 22:46.000
and train their “power of reason.”


22:48.950 --> 22:51.853
I thought that talk 
didn’t apply to me. 


22:51.853 --> 22:55.523
But can I really handle 
bad association?


22:55.523 --> 22:59.000
If I take a stand, 
I may lose my job.


23:01.697 --> 23:04.000
But that’s being anxious 
about tomorrow. 


23:09.237 --> 23:10.872
Jesus said: 


23:10.872 --> 23:13.575
“So never be anxious and say, 


23:13.575 --> 23:14.743
“‘What are we to eat?’ or, 


23:14.743 --> 23:16.143
“‘What are we to drink?’ or, 


23:16.143 --> 23:18.846
‘What are we to wear?’”


23:18.847 --> 23:22.017
Jehovah knows I need a job. 


23:22.017 --> 23:25.987
And I need 
to set a good example 


23:25.987 --> 23:28.000
for when my children 
face bad association.


23:34.728 --> 23:38.100
1 Corinthians 15:33.


23:38.100 --> 23:41.202
My friends’ posts 
are getting worse


23:41.202 --> 23:44.705
—their pictures and comments. 


23:44.705 --> 23:49.000
Hmm, 2 Timothy 2:16.


23:50.545 --> 23:53.182
“But reject empty speeches 


23:53.182 --> 23:55.850
“that violate what is holy, 


23:55.850 --> 24:00.388
for they will lead 
to more and more ungodliness.”


24:00.388 --> 24:05.000
I’m letting them share 
“empty speeches” with me online. 


24:06.360 --> 24:09.197
I will try to help 
them while I still can, 


24:09.197 --> 24:13.000
but following their posts 
is not the way to do it.


24:15.703 --> 24:18.273
I told Mom what’s been happening 
when I game 


24:18.273 --> 24:20.941
with my friends. 


24:20.942 --> 24:23.077
She gave me good ideas 
on what to look for 


24:23.077 --> 24:26.280
in the Research Guide.


24:26.280 --> 24:28.750
“Christian Life.”


24:28.750 --> 24:31.000
“Association.”


24:32.587 --> 24:35.000
“Is Your Recreation Beneficial?”


24:37.092 --> 24:39.160
“Who Are My Companions?”


24:39.160 --> 24:40.895
It says, 


24:40.895 --> 24:44.000
“Who are the ones I want 
to share my leisure time with?”


24:45.633 --> 24:50.738
“Does he have the same Bible-based 
values and morals that I have?”


24:50.738 --> 24:52.806
Good question. 


24:52.807 --> 24:55.000
I don’t even know 
who they are sometimes.


24:56.110 --> 24:59.313
Psalm 119:63 says: 


24:59.313 --> 25:02.116
“I am a friend of all who fear you 


25:02.117 --> 25:06.822
and of those who keep your orders.”


25:06.822 --> 25:09.757
But if I only know them online, 


25:09.757 --> 25:11.000
I can’t know if they fear Jehovah.


25:15.630 --> 25:17.698
Let’s turn in our Bibles 
to the book 


25:17.698 --> 25:21.970
of 1 Timothy 1:5 


25:21.970 --> 25:24.000
and notice how it reads: 


25:25.707 --> 25:28.710
“Really, the objective of this instruction 


25:28.710 --> 25:30.945
“is love out of a clean heart 


25:30.945 --> 25:33.180
“and out of a good conscience 


25:33.180 --> 25:37.352
and out of faith without hypocrisy.” 


25:37.352 --> 25:40.389
We train our conscience 


25:40.388 --> 25:44.000
with Bible principles 
that reveal Jehovah’s thinking. 


25:45.293 --> 25:47.328
There may be several principles needed 


25:47.328 --> 25:49.898
for our unique problem. 


25:49.898 --> 25:51.933
But when we find 


25:51.933 --> 25:53.901
and apply them,  


25:53.902 --> 25:58.000
we’ll enjoy a clean heart 
and a good conscience.


26:03.978 --> 26:06.715
How did their Bible principles 
and meditation 


26:06.715 --> 26:08.983
compare to what 
you were thinking? 


26:08.983 --> 26:12.386
Now, you may not have come up 
with the same scriptures and thoughts, 


26:12.387 --> 26:14.389
but that’s OK. 


26:14.388 --> 26:18.493
The important thing is that by training 
our “power of reason,” 


26:18.493 --> 26:22.996
we’re aligning our thoughts 
with Jehovah’s thoughts.


26:22.997 --> 26:25.234
Did you see the three skills in use? 


26:25.233 --> 26:27.235
The young brother was able 


26:27.235 --> 26:29.570
to visualize his potential friends. 


26:29.570 --> 26:31.640
He couldn’t see them literally, 


26:31.640 --> 26:35.477
but knowing they didn’t fear Jehovah 
or keep His orders 


26:35.477 --> 26:39.982
painted a picture of the kind of associates 
they might prove to be.


26:39.982 --> 26:44.819
When our sister 
analyzed 2 Timothy 2:16, 


26:44.818 --> 26:47.555
she saw the social media comments 


26:47.555 --> 26:49.923
were similar to “empty speeches” 


26:49.923 --> 26:51.926
that could weaken her faith.


26:51.927 --> 26:54.964
And the family head balanced 


26:54.963 --> 26:57.498
his family responsibilities 


26:57.498 --> 27:01.401
by applying the principle 
at Matthew 6:31, 


27:01.402 --> 27:05.307
where Jesus said 
not to be anxious over material things. 


27:05.307 --> 27:09.344
And we can imagine him trying 
to work the matter out with his boss 


27:09.343 --> 27:12.746
while trusting Jehovah 
to care for him and his family, 


27:12.747 --> 27:15.784
no matter what 
might happen to his job.


27:15.783 --> 27:19.886
Think now about another principle 
in Matthew chapter 6. 


27:19.887 --> 27:24.825
Jesus tells us in verse 33 
to ‘seek first the Kingdom.’ 


27:24.825 --> 27:28.195
Young ones especially 
face temptations


27:28.195 --> 27:30.398
—both large and small—


27:30.398 --> 27:32.733
to seek things 
in the world instead. 


27:32.733 --> 27:37.505
And sadly, some have ignored 
Bible principles they have learned. 


27:37.505 --> 27:39.707
They’ve looked 
for happiness in what appears 


27:39.707 --> 27:43.177
to be the exciting possibilities 
of this system of things. 


27:43.177 --> 27:46.347
In this “Truth Transforms Lives” segment, 


27:46.347 --> 27:50.785
Sister Anneliese Zelina explains 
what led her to a similar choice 


27:50.785 --> 27:54.000
and what drew her back to Jehovah.


27:58.125 --> 28:00.562
Growing up in the truth, 


28:00.562 --> 28:02.764
I felt like I fit in 


28:02.763 --> 28:04.865
more with my friends at school 


28:04.865 --> 28:06.902
or people who weren’t Witnesses. 


28:06.902 --> 28:09.704
I was living a double life 
and I knew it. 


28:09.703 --> 28:12.040
I was not baptized.


28:12.040 --> 28:15.810
I had always tried to make 
the truth fit in with the world. 


28:15.810 --> 28:18.312
And this time I decided 
that I just want to give 


28:18.312 --> 28:20.349
the world a shot 
and see what that’s like.


28:20.348 --> 28:22.383
I came right to my parents, 
and I said, 


28:22.383 --> 28:25.253
“I want to move to LA 
and pursue modeling.” 


28:25.253 --> 28:28.490
I had my first job within the week. 


28:28.490 --> 28:32.000
It looked so glamorous.


28:40.602 --> 28:42.604
There were a lot of parties


28:42.603 --> 28:47.000
—going to the coolest houses, 
getting to hang out with celebrities. 


28:48.843 --> 28:50.878
There are no rules. 


28:50.878 --> 28:53.000
You have the money 
to do whatever you want.


28:55.083 --> 28:59.986
That lifestyle was so far 
from what I was raised knowing as right 


28:59.987 --> 29:03.859
that I basically had 
no relationship with Jehovah.


29:03.858 --> 29:06.126
Once all the smoke 
and mirrors are gone, 


29:06.127 --> 29:08.129
you see these things 
for what they are.


29:08.128 --> 29:10.131
I remember I called my mom, 


29:10.132 --> 29:12.134
and I told her: 
“It’s like Sodom and Gomorrah. 


29:12.133 --> 29:14.135
I’m literally in the middle of it all.” 


29:14.135 --> 29:16.137
And I thought, like, this is it; 


29:16.137 --> 29:18.607
this is what everyone says is the best, 
and I’m not happy. 


29:18.607 --> 29:21.609
And I just felt so dull
—empty. 


29:21.608 --> 29:23.611
And I actually thought to myself: 


29:23.612 --> 29:26.047
‘I wish—
I wish I was never raised a Witness. 


29:26.047 --> 29:29.150
I wish I never even knew Jehovah existed.’


29:29.150 --> 29:32.787
There were certain nights 
where I needed him. 


29:32.787 --> 29:35.055
I was thinking, 
‘Just pray; just go to him.’ 


29:35.055 --> 29:37.492
And I couldn’t.


29:37.492 --> 29:39.000
I thought I would never be able to
come back to Jehovah.


29:45.065 --> 29:47.068
One of the jobs 
I got hired to do 


29:47.068 --> 29:49.870
was to work 
for this young fashion company. 


29:49.870 --> 29:53.642
In between different outfits and shoots, 
you would, you know, 


29:53.642 --> 29:55.000
talk with the photographer.


29:57.378 --> 29:59.413
So, what are you guys 
going to be for Halloween?


29:59.413 --> 30:01.415
Matt doesn’t celebrate Halloween. 


30:01.415 --> 30:03.417
He’s one of Jehovah’s Witnesses.


30:03.417 --> 30:04.985
So am I.


30:04.985 --> 30:06.187
It’s not a joke.


30:06.187 --> 30:08.189
No, I’m not kidding. 


30:08.188 --> 30:10.325
I was raised as a Witness.


30:10.325 --> 30:11.558
Yeah, I was raised as one as well.


30:11.558 --> 30:13.595
Do you, um—
do you go to meetings?


30:13.595 --> 30:15.062
No, I haven’t been in forever. 


30:15.062 --> 30:16.497
What about you?


30:16.497 --> 30:18.000
No, no, I haven’t.


30:19.500 --> 30:21.502
I got a last-minute job to New York. 


30:21.502 --> 30:23.939
I decided to walk the Brooklyn Bridge. 


30:23.938 --> 30:27.708
I knew Bethel was there, 
and I’d never been to Bethel.


30:27.708 --> 30:32.180
This sister stopped me on my tour, 
and she invited me up to her office. 


30:32.180 --> 30:35.350
There were different paintings 
of the resurrection.


30:35.350 --> 30:38.553
She asked me, “Do you know why 
the people are waiting on the balcony?” 


30:38.553 --> 30:41.388
And I was like, 
“I—I don’t know. Why?” 


30:41.388 --> 30:46.000
And she said, “Because they’re waiting 
for their loved ones to be resurrected.”


30:48.797 --> 30:51.565
It was as if something 
just went straight to my heart. 


30:51.565 --> 30:54.202
I’ve never felt something like that.


30:54.202 --> 30:58.505
I had for the first time actually seen 
the resurrection and believed it. 


30:58.505 --> 31:01.175
It wasn’t just this thing that might happen
—it was for sure. 


31:01.175 --> 31:03.177
I knew exactly 
what it was going to look like. 


31:03.177 --> 31:05.680
I would be standing there 
on that balcony 


31:05.680 --> 31:07.000
looking for my loved ones 
to come back, 


31:10.652 --> 31:12.654
and I wanted to be there. 


31:12.653 --> 31:17.258
The resurrection was so real to me.


31:17.258 --> 31:19.693
And the second I got out of Bethel, 


31:19.693 --> 31:23.530
I—I called my mom, 
and I told her, and I said: 


31:23.530 --> 31:27.935
“Mom, Mom, I’m coming back. 


31:27.935 --> 31:30.672
“I know exactly what I need to do. 


31:30.672 --> 31:34.609
I’m coming back to Jehovah.”


31:34.608 --> 31:38.245
I had made up my mind, you know, 
I’m going to give Jehovah a chance. 


31:38.245 --> 31:40.582
But, you know, 
I’m coming back to the truth. 


31:40.582 --> 31:42.117
I’m going to do it right.


31:42.117 --> 31:45.487
There was an elder 
who was doing the Watchtower, 


31:45.487 --> 31:47.489
and he just came off so kind 


31:47.488 --> 31:50.258
that I thought, you know, 
when this meeting ends, 


31:50.258 --> 31:53.060
I want to talk with him, and I’m going 
to explain to him why I’m here. 


31:53.060 --> 31:55.497
I knew I had so many changes to make.


31:55.497 --> 31:58.800
Matthew 6:33 is so important to me, 


31:58.800 --> 32:01.402
‘Seek first the Kingdom.’ 


32:01.402 --> 32:05.407
My entire life I sought 
everything else before Jehovah. 


32:05.407 --> 32:09.377
I never put him first, 
and I for the first time was saying, 


32:09.377 --> 32:12.347
“OK, Jehovah, I’m going to put you first.”


32:12.347 --> 32:16.750
The job I have right now 
isn’t necessarily my dream job, 


32:16.750 --> 32:19.887
but it allows me to do exactly 
what I want to do for Jehovah


32:19.887 --> 32:21.957
—and that’s pioneer.


32:21.957 --> 32:24.459
I used to walk down Hollywood Boulevard 


32:24.458 --> 32:26.995
going from casting to casting 
with my portfolio in hand, 


32:26.995 --> 32:30.698
and now I walk down Hollywood Boulevard 
with the cart in my hand. 


32:30.698 --> 32:33.233
Out in the ministry, 
I see models that I used to work with, 


32:33.233 --> 32:35.903
and I love getting to show 
them that this is my new life, 


32:35.903 --> 32:37.905
and this has changed my life. 


32:37.905 --> 32:39.040
I am so happy.


32:39.040 --> 32:41.708
I know what it’s like 
to superficially feel good. 


32:41.708 --> 32:46.813
But to literally have the joy, 
the happiness


32:46.813 --> 32:49.000
—I want to share that with everybody.


32:52.387 --> 32:55.000
Jehovah completely changed my life.


33:09.970 --> 33:12.740
We’re so happy 
that Sister Zelina returned 


33:12.740 --> 33:14.975
and dedicated 
her life to Jehovah. 


33:14.975 --> 33:19.013
Even though she wanted to forget 
what she knew about God, 


33:19.013 --> 33:22.983
the things she had learned about him 
kept coming back to her mind. 


33:22.983 --> 33:25.453
Finally, when she saw 
the picture of the resurrection, 


33:25.453 --> 33:27.455
while touring Bethel, 


33:27.455 --> 33:30.625
it was a powerful reminder 
of Jehovah’s love. 


33:30.625 --> 33:34.228
Really, 
Sister Zelina’s Bible-trained conscience 


33:34.228 --> 33:36.430
was at work the entire time.


33:36.430 --> 33:41.068
Young ones, please know 
that Jehovah does not want 


33:41.068 --> 33:43.470
to hold you back 
from having fun, 


33:43.470 --> 33:45.940
and he doesn’t want 
you to feel guilty 


33:45.940 --> 33:49.877
for the desire to use 
your talents and to enjoy life. 


33:49.877 --> 33:54.082
But he does want to protect you 
from spiritual dangers, 


33:54.082 --> 33:58.887
and he asks you to seek first 
the Kingdom in these last days. 


33:58.887 --> 34:03.024
Proverbs 10:22 puts it well: 


34:03.023 --> 34:07.461
“It is the blessing of Jehovah 
that makes one rich, 


34:07.462 --> 34:11.465
and He adds no pain with it.”


34:11.465 --> 34:15.603
It is Satan’s system that adds 
any pain we may experience. 


34:15.603 --> 34:20.508
Sister Zelina and so many others 
have found that scripture to be true. 


34:20.508 --> 34:24.978
So often, young ones who choose 
to give Jehovah their best 


34:24.978 --> 34:28.148
are blessed with ways to use 
their talents and interests 


34:28.148 --> 34:30.283
in sacred service.


34:30.283 --> 34:32.286
Jehovah wants you to be part 


34:32.287 --> 34:35.924
of the exciting fulfillment 
of Micah 4:2, 


34:35.923 --> 34:37.925
where nations are saying: 


34:37.925 --> 34:41.595
“Come, let us go up 
to the mountain of Jehovah.” 


34:41.595 --> 34:44.365
Well, that verse was the daily text 


34:44.365 --> 34:46.800
and part of a morning worship discussion 


34:46.800 --> 34:49.103
by Brother Geoffrey Jackson. 


34:49.103 --> 34:52.273
Micah’s prophecy is being fulfilled now, 


34:52.273 --> 34:55.476
and it results 
in our worldwide brotherhood 


34:55.477 --> 35:00.147
and highlights the need 
for Christian unity and neutrality. 


35:00.147 --> 35:03.584
So Brother Jackson asked 
an interesting question, 


35:03.583 --> 35:07.688
“How important is our neutrality?”


35:07.688 --> 35:09.290
It’s true, isn’t it? 


35:09.290 --> 35:12.160
When we look at this prophecy 
in the book of Micah, 


35:12.160 --> 35:15.630
it’s very exciting 
because it portrays to us 


35:15.630 --> 35:19.733
what’s actually happening 
among God’s people today. 


35:19.733 --> 35:23.136
We know that although 
in the new world 


35:23.137 --> 35:26.674
there will be a tremendous unity 
displayed by God’s people, 


35:26.673 --> 35:28.876
chapter 4 of Micah 


35:28.877 --> 35:31.612
is actually portraying  what’s happening now, 


35:31.612 --> 35:33.647
and we’re involved with this. 


35:33.647 --> 35:35.717
We know that because 
in verse 5 it says 


35:35.717 --> 35:38.820
that at the same time 
that this unity would be evident: 


35:38.820 --> 35:42.623
“All the peoples will walk, 
each in the name of its god.” 


35:42.623 --> 35:45.291
Well, that’s not talking 
about the new world, is it? 


35:45.292 --> 35:48.495
It’s talking about the time 
we are living in now. 


35:48.495 --> 35:53.333
Well, what is it that helps all 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses worldwide 


35:53.333 --> 35:58.305
to be so united and not to be involved 
with the wars of this world?


35:58.305 --> 36:02.643
Well, one of the things that helps us 
is our Christian neutrality. 


36:02.643 --> 36:05.713
What do we mean by neutrality? 


36:05.713 --> 36:10.083
We mean not taking sides 
in political issues. 


36:10.083 --> 36:13.186
Of course, we take sides 
with Jehovah and the Kingdom, 


36:13.187 --> 36:18.059
but with regard to worldly political debates 
and issues that arise, 


36:18.058 --> 36:20.895
we don’t take sides. 


36:20.895 --> 36:23.130
Why is this so important? 


36:23.130 --> 36:28.402
Well, let’s turn our Bibles 
to Revelation chapter 13. 


36:28.402 --> 36:32.674
Revelation 13:16, 17, 


36:32.673 --> 36:35.576
and here it tells us: 


36:35.577 --> 36:39.147
“It puts under compulsion all people
—the small and the great, 


36:39.147 --> 36:42.417
“the rich and the poor, 
the free and the slaves


36:42.417 --> 36:46.854
“—that these should be marked 
on their right hand or on their forehead, 


36:46.853 --> 36:51.691
“and that nobody can buy or sell 
except a person having the mark, 


36:51.692 --> 36:57.030
the name of the wild beast 
or the number of its name.” 


36:57.030 --> 37:00.902
What’s the point of this verse? 


37:00.902 --> 37:03.704
Well, of course, 
we will look forward to seeing 


37:03.703 --> 37:06.173
how this may 
turn out in the future 


37:06.173 --> 37:09.710
and what pressure is put 
on God’s people at that time. 


37:09.710 --> 37:11.778
But even now, 
we see the principle here 


37:11.778 --> 37:16.683
that the political system is wanting 
to put its mark on us, 


37:16.683 --> 37:19.853
mentally as well as physically. 


37:19.853 --> 37:23.823
So we see the forehead 
as well as the hand being involved. 


37:23.823 --> 37:28.695
So we need to be absolutely certain 
that we remain neutral 


37:28.695 --> 37:31.698
with regard to political issues 
in the world, 


37:31.698 --> 37:36.070
not only by 
not being involved actively 


37:36.070 --> 37:38.072
in the political issues 


37:38.072 --> 37:42.310
but also mentally not allowing 
ourselves to take sides.


37:42.310 --> 37:46.780
What are some of the things 
that perhaps could erode our neutrality? 


37:46.780 --> 37:50.785
Well, maybe we could mention 
three things this morning. 


37:50.785 --> 37:55.757
One is the propaganda 
that the world puts forward. 


37:55.757 --> 37:59.827
Now, we have seen what the media says 
about Jehovah’s Witnesses, haven’t we? 


37:59.827 --> 38:03.330
How distorted some of their reports are 


38:03.330 --> 38:07.200
and how they can paint 
a negative picture with regard to us. 


38:07.200 --> 38:10.303
Well, should we expect 
that they are neutral


38:10.303 --> 38:13.640
with regard to other events 
that they report on, 


38:13.640 --> 38:17.077
particularly when there are conflicts 
between two nations? 


38:17.077 --> 38:20.882
The media 
in one particular nation may promote 


38:20.882 --> 38:23.550
certain ideas about the other nation. 


38:23.550 --> 38:25.653
We may be affected by that. 


38:25.653 --> 38:27.955
We may be surprised perhaps 


38:27.955 --> 38:32.092
to visit some other countries 
that have a different political ideology 


38:32.092 --> 38:35.764
and be surprised to see 
how things perhaps are a little different 


38:35.763 --> 38:40.166
in that country to how it’s portrayed 
by the media in our country. 


38:40.167 --> 38:42.637
So we need to be careful 
not to be influenced 


38:42.637 --> 38:45.105
by the propaganda of this world, 


38:45.105 --> 38:48.742
particularly media reports and so on.


38:48.742 --> 38:51.479
What’s another thing perhaps 
that could cause us 


38:51.478 --> 38:53.746
to lose a measure of neutrality? 


38:53.747 --> 38:55.750
Sporting events. 


38:55.750 --> 38:59.520
Sometimes sporting events 
are able to achieve 


38:59.520 --> 39:02.155
certain goals 
with regard to nationalism. 


39:02.155 --> 39:06.060
We see the national anthem 
being played at many of these events. 


39:06.060 --> 39:10.197
It reminds me many years ago 
when I was in a different country, 


39:10.197 --> 39:14.102
a friend of mine asked me 
to record a certain sporting event. 


39:14.102 --> 39:16.604
I wasn’t particularly 
interested in the event, 


39:16.603 --> 39:19.640
but because he made this request, 
I recorded it. 


39:19.640 --> 39:23.643
And, of course, I wanted to make sure 
that I got the last ten minutes of it. 


39:23.643 --> 39:25.713
I thought our friendship 
may be strained 


39:25.713 --> 39:29.316
if I didn’t get 
the actual last part of the game. 


39:29.317 --> 39:33.287
When I watched it, 
it was absolutely exciting


39:33.287 --> 39:35.289
—nail-biting finish. 


39:35.288 --> 39:38.791
Well, after the brother 
gave me back the videotape, 


39:38.792 --> 39:41.462
I thought maybe 
some of the other brothers 


39:41.462 --> 39:43.564
who would be interested 
in this sporting event 


39:43.563 --> 39:46.400
may want to have it 
rather than just wipe the tape. 


39:46.400 --> 39:50.103
So I offered it to several, 
and each one of them said to me: 


39:50.103 --> 39:51.971
“No thanks. 


39:51.972 --> 39:54.509
If we had won, 
perhaps it would be different.” 


39:54.508 --> 39:56.643
Now, what was the problem? 


39:56.643 --> 39:57.811
As I said to them, 


39:57.812 --> 40:01.182
“Were you watching the game 
or were you taking sides?” 


40:01.182 --> 40:03.184
An interesting concept, 


40:03.183 --> 40:06.220
because here 
two different nations were involved. 


40:06.220 --> 40:10.023
So we have to be careful 
that even sporting events 


40:10.023 --> 40:14.495
don’t stir up within us 
certain nationalistic feelings, 


40:14.495 --> 40:19.000
and perhaps we could take sides 
with regard to certain events.


40:20.100 --> 40:24.805
The third area that perhaps 
could erode our neutrality: 


40:24.805 --> 40:29.710
the political promises being made, 
particularly at election time. 


40:29.710 --> 40:34.615
Perhaps one of the candidates 
is from our ethnic background 


40:34.615 --> 40:39.018
or perhaps 
is the same gender as we are. 


40:39.018 --> 40:43.290
When we look at the political situation 
these days with many elections, 


40:43.290 --> 40:46.460
it seems to be more in the form 
of entertainment than anything else, 


40:46.460 --> 40:50.697
with music 
and very colorful characters. 


40:50.697 --> 40:53.967
But if we were 
to say in our heart, 


40:53.967 --> 40:57.437
‘I hope that idiot 
doesn’t get into power,’ 


40:57.437 --> 40:59.474
are we neutral? 


40:59.473 --> 41:01.508
Or worse still, if we say, 


41:01.508 --> 41:04.545
‘I hope the other person 
gets into power,’ 


41:04.545 --> 41:06.913
well, we need 
to be careful, don’t we? 


41:06.913 --> 41:10.416
I remember many years ago 
as a young pioneer in Australia, 


41:10.417 --> 41:13.720
I was facing 
the conscription issue


41:13.720 --> 41:16.223
—the national call-up 
for the military. 


41:16.223 --> 41:19.260
At that time, 
the Vietnam War was being fought. 


41:19.260 --> 41:22.028
And then there was 
an election in Australia. 


41:22.028 --> 41:25.833
And at that time, the party 
that was trying to get into power


41:25.833 --> 41:30.170
said that if they got into power, 
they would abolish conscription. 


41:30.170 --> 41:32.607
So now that affected me personally. 


41:32.607 --> 41:37.210
I remember how hard it was sitting there 
watching the election results, 


41:37.210 --> 41:40.513
not to say in my heart, 
‘I hope they get in.’ 


41:40.513 --> 41:45.000
And then, when they got in, 
not to say, ‘Yes!’ 


41:46.153 --> 41:50.490
You see, if we personally are affected 
by some of these political promises, 


41:50.490 --> 41:53.860
we may violate our neutrality. 


41:53.860 --> 41:57.665
So brothers and sisters, 
let’s work hard at remembering 


41:57.665 --> 41:59.667
that we’re no part of this world. 


41:59.667 --> 42:04.239
We support the best government 
that could ever rule this earth. 


42:04.238 --> 42:07.273
And by doing so, 
we will keep our neutrality, 


42:07.273 --> 42:10.843
and we will keep our unity.


42:10.843 --> 42:12.846
When neutrality is mentioned, 


42:12.847 --> 42:16.717
isn’t it true we often think of taking 
a stand during times of war? 


42:16.717 --> 42:19.854
But Brother Jackson 
reminded us that neutrality 


42:19.853 --> 42:24.325
is something we do every day 
in our thoughts and in our speech. 


42:24.325 --> 42:28.362
What a good example 
of analyzing a Bible principle 


42:28.362 --> 42:32.199
to understand its full meaning 
and application for us.


42:32.198 --> 42:35.001
Of course, 
there are times when governments 


42:35.002 --> 42:39.340
do pressure God’s people 
to renounce their faith or take up arms. 


42:39.340 --> 42:42.142
This happened 
to Sister Gertrud Pötzinger 


42:42.142 --> 42:44.144
and her husband, Martin, 


42:44.143 --> 42:46.413
in Nazi Germany 
during World War II. 


42:46.413 --> 42:50.116
Now, later in life, Brother Pötzinger 
was a member of the Governing Body, 


42:50.117 --> 42:53.654
and he finished 
his earthly course in 1988; 


42:53.653 --> 42:58.658
but Sister Pötzinger continued 
faithful until her death in 2003. 


42:58.658 --> 43:00.726
In an archived interview, 


43:00.727 --> 43:04.465
Sister Pötzinger described 
her wartime experiences. 


43:04.465 --> 43:06.633
How did Gertrud and Martin, 


43:06.633 --> 43:09.168
like thousands 
of our spiritual brothers and sisters, 


43:09.168 --> 43:14.000
keep their integrity 
through brutal persecution?


43:16.210 --> 43:20.747
I worked underground 
and traveled in Silesia, 


43:20.747 --> 43:23.084
and at that time, 


43:23.083 --> 43:27.420
I visited the families 
with copies of The Watchtower. 


43:27.420 --> 43:30.223
They caught me and arrested me 


43:30.223 --> 43:32.125
in Dresden.


43:32.125 --> 43:36.697
And there, there was
the same strong interrogation, 


43:36.697 --> 43:39.600
and Jehovah helped me 
in a wonderful way. 


43:39.600 --> 43:44.003
I was surprised by myself


43:44.003 --> 43:46.306
—what kind of thoughts 
came in my mind 


43:46.307 --> 43:48.409
when they asked me, 


43:48.408 --> 43:50.510
“Did you know 


43:50.510 --> 43:53.613
“that the organization 
of the Watchtower 


43:53.613 --> 43:56.450
is forbidden 
by the government?” 


43:56.450 --> 43:58.985
I was saying, 
“Sure, I know that.” 


43:58.985 --> 44:01.888
“Why were you 
working underground 


44:01.888 --> 44:05.691
against our command?”


44:05.692 --> 44:07.729
Then I was saying: 


44:07.728 --> 44:10.930
“The German judgment, 


44:10.930 --> 44:14.167
“they acknowledge the command: 


44:14.167 --> 44:17.739
“‘You have not to steal, 
not to lie, not to murder.’ 


44:17.738 --> 44:21.775
“And this came from the Mosaic Law; 
it’s from the Bible. 


44:21.775 --> 44:24.978
“If you acknowledge 
this command, 


44:24.978 --> 44:28.081
“then you have to acknowledge 
the other command too. 


44:28.082 --> 44:30.717
“The Bible is saying: 
‘You have to watch 


44:30.717 --> 44:33.520
“to come together 
 and to encourage one another.’ 


44:33.520 --> 44:38.000
“How can I do it 
if I would be ashamed to meet them? 


44:39.360 --> 44:41.695
“I want to do the will of God. 


44:41.695 --> 44:44.163
This is a commandment.” 


44:44.163 --> 44:46.200
The judge was saying nothing. 


44:46.200 --> 44:50.770
He spoke with the side judge, 
but he gave no answer.


44:50.770 --> 44:55.075
I was sentenced 
at first for five years. 


44:55.075 --> 44:57.210
And later on, 


44:57.210 --> 44:59.345
they made it go down 
to three and a half years 


44:59.345 --> 45:01.382
because I was so young; 


45:01.382 --> 45:04.419
I was 25 years of age. 


45:04.418 --> 45:09.390
So I started 
my solitary confinement. 


45:09.390 --> 45:12.325
But Jehovah’s spirit 


45:12.325 --> 45:16.263
made me real joyful. 


45:16.263 --> 45:19.265
Every day 
I was thinking: 


45:19.265 --> 45:22.970
‘Now I have 
to make every day 


45:22.970 --> 45:26.740
‘a special object 
to think about. 


45:26.740 --> 45:28.908
‘In fact, 
I want to think 


45:28.908 --> 45:31.145
about the qualities 
of Jehovah. 


45:31.145 --> 45:34.080
I’ll start with wisdom.’ 


45:34.080 --> 45:37.383
And so I put 
my fingers in my ears 


45:37.383 --> 45:40.686
and was running 
to and fro and to and fro. 


45:40.687 --> 45:43.390
I wanted 
to hear nothing outside. 


45:43.390 --> 45:47.000
So, wonderful thoughts 
and I was happy.


45:49.763 --> 45:51.831
Then when that was over, 


45:51.832 --> 45:54.869
then I thought: 
‘What is hope? 


45:54.868 --> 45:56.870
What is faith?’ 


45:56.870 --> 46:00.340
I started to think 
about the fruits of the spirit. 


46:00.340 --> 46:02.608
You have a lot. 


46:02.608 --> 46:06.546
Then I have 
so much to think, 


46:06.547 --> 46:08.915
and the time runs.


46:08.915 --> 46:12.285
After three and a half years, 


46:12.285 --> 46:14.655
the Gestapo 
called me again 


46:14.655 --> 46:16.857
and gave me 
a declaration. 


46:16.857 --> 46:18.859
I have to sign 


46:18.858 --> 46:20.926
that I never want 
to be in connection 


46:20.927 --> 46:22.997
with the Jehovah’s Witnesses 


46:22.997 --> 46:24.999
and that I refuse 


46:24.998 --> 46:27.633
to learn more 
from the Bible. 


46:27.633 --> 46:29.636
And I said: 
“No! Never!” 


46:29.637 --> 46:34.107
Then he said, 
“You can think for overnight.” 


46:34.107 --> 46:36.410
“No! 
I want not to think overnight.” 


46:36.410 --> 46:40.213
And immediately I said: 
“Never will I do it! 


46:40.213 --> 46:42.481
Never will I sign it!” 


46:42.482 --> 46:45.119
And then he was saying: 


46:45.118 --> 46:47.420
“Then you have 
to take the consequences. 


46:47.420 --> 46:50.890
“You will transfer 
to the concentration camp


46:50.890 --> 46:53.660
—to Ravensbruck.”


46:53.660 --> 46:55.695
And when I came, 


46:55.695 --> 46:58.698
they ordered that I have 
to put all my dress out 


46:58.698 --> 47:00.566
and to get them away. 


47:00.567 --> 47:04.805
And then I have to stay 
with other prisoners 


47:04.805 --> 47:09.643
several hours 
in a big bedroom. 


47:09.643 --> 47:14.000
And we have to wait 
till the doctor will see us. 


47:15.782 --> 47:19.754
And it was 
so humiliating. 


47:19.753 --> 47:21.955
They wanted to humiliate, 


47:21.955 --> 47:24.558
and they wanted 
to make us down. 


47:24.558 --> 47:28.328
And the old women 
between the young girls, 


47:28.328 --> 47:30.330
they were  so strongly ashamed. 


47:30.330 --> 47:33.000
You saw it
—how they suffered.


47:43.210 --> 47:45.212
I never will forget this. 


47:45.212 --> 47:47.447
And after, 


47:47.447 --> 47:51.985
we got the new dress 
from the camp 


47:51.985 --> 47:56.155
and we were assigned to go 
to the punishment barrack. 


47:56.155 --> 47:59.960
And then 
that was a terrible night. 


47:59.960 --> 48:01.995
So many prisoners, 


48:01.995 --> 48:04.163
they were crying the night 


48:04.163 --> 48:08.501
and others were vomiting


48:08.502 --> 48:11.405
—had to vomit. 


48:11.405 --> 48:14.742
It was a terrible night. 


48:14.742 --> 48:18.245
The next day, 
we had to go for working. 


48:18.245 --> 48:20.547
We had so strong to work 


48:20.547 --> 48:22.549
from morning
—in summertime, 


48:22.548 --> 48:25.085
from 5 o’clock 
we were on the roll call place 


48:25.085 --> 48:28.000
till evening, 7 o’clock. 


48:29.823 --> 48:31.858
Then the quarantine came. 


48:31.858 --> 48:33.626
We have to not go out. 


48:33.627 --> 48:34.995
They closed the door. 


48:34.995 --> 48:39.465
They gave us our meals 
through the window, 


48:39.465 --> 48:43.203
and we had 
a fine time to have rest. 


48:43.203 --> 48:47.240
We encouraged one another 
with spiritual interests. 


48:47.240 --> 48:50.510
And the doctor came 
and knocked on the window. 


48:50.510 --> 48:52.512
“Who died in your barrack?” 


48:52.512 --> 48:54.514
“Nobody.” 


48:54.513 --> 48:56.248
No one. 


48:56.248 --> 48:59.820
Our old, weak sisters 
they overcame all. 


48:59.820 --> 49:03.390
Never some became sick. 


49:03.390 --> 49:06.427
So it was really a good witness 


49:06.427 --> 49:10.000
for the others in the camp.


49:11.230 --> 49:13.933
My husband was 
in the concentration camp, 


49:13.933 --> 49:17.670
at first in Dachau 
and later on in Mauthausen.


49:17.670 --> 49:20.173
They worked 
in the stone quarry. 


49:20.173 --> 49:22.308
And in that group, 


49:22.308 --> 49:25.245
a brother 
had the bad shoes; 


49:25.245 --> 49:29.282
they were too tight for him, 
and he took them off. 


49:29.282 --> 49:31.885
And he had forgotten 


49:31.885 --> 49:35.955
to take them from the stone quarry 
to the camp. 


49:35.955 --> 49:38.792
And my husband 
wanted to help him, 


49:38.792 --> 49:41.662
and he was running 
to pick up the shoes. 


49:41.662 --> 49:45.232
And the watchman 
observed that he 


49:45.232 --> 49:48.335
ran away from the lawn, 
from the group. 


49:48.335 --> 49:53.000
His punishment was to hang 
for one hour on the pole. 


49:54.173 --> 49:57.143
When I asked my husband, 


49:57.143 --> 50:00.813
“How did you overcome 
such a torture?” 


50:00.813 --> 50:04.150
Then he said: 
“I was thinking: 


50:04.150 --> 50:07.120
“‘How was the situation 


50:07.120 --> 50:10.757
“‘when Abraham 
had to kill his son? 


50:10.757 --> 50:12.759
“And this was a long way.’ 


50:12.758 --> 50:14.761
“I was always thinking: 


50:14.762 --> 50:16.764
“‘What were his thoughts? 


50:16.763 --> 50:20.133
“‘How had he 
overcome his feeling 


50:20.133 --> 50:23.203
and what Jehovah 
wants for him?’” 


50:23.203 --> 50:27.000
And in this way, 
he didn’t feel anymore. 


50:28.808 --> 50:31.811
After one hour, 
when he came down, 


50:31.812 --> 50:33.980
the other brothers 
were saying, 


50:33.980 --> 50:38.952
“You don’t look as you have been 
on the torture stake.”


50:38.952 --> 50:42.489
So Jehovah can help us 


50:42.488 --> 50:44.623
in all such situations. 


50:44.623 --> 50:47.460
Every situation we had some 


50:47.460 --> 50:50.297
of what was not so easy. 


50:50.297 --> 50:53.032
But in every situation, 


50:53.032 --> 50:57.437
we have a touch of wonderful help
—Jehovah’s spirit. 


50:57.437 --> 50:59.505
And we could pray. 


50:59.505 --> 51:04.210
Jehovah’s name 
is the most important part in our life. 


51:04.210 --> 51:09.000
Nothing is so important 
like Jehovah’s name.


51:11.618 --> 51:15.455
Did you see the ways Jehovah blessed 
Sister Pötzinger’s determination 


51:15.455 --> 51:18.057
to stay loyal under pressure? 


51:18.057 --> 51:22.229
At Matthew 10:19, 
Jesus told his apostles: 


51:22.228 --> 51:25.298
“When they hand you over, 
do not become anxious 


51:25.298 --> 51:28.201
“about how or what 
you are to speak, 


51:28.202 --> 51:32.539
for what you are to speak 
will be given you in that hour.” 


51:32.538 --> 51:34.540
She may have felt that same assurance 


51:34.540 --> 51:36.710
when arrested and interrogated. 


51:36.710 --> 51:38.712
Then, when tested in the camps, 


51:38.712 --> 51:41.449
she and Martin meditated 
on Christian qualities 


51:41.448 --> 51:43.816
and the faith of Bible characters. 


51:43.817 --> 51:45.819
And finally they, 


51:45.818 --> 51:47.820
like so many Witnesses, 


51:47.820 --> 51:50.723
were helped to survive 
because of the love and care 


51:50.723 --> 51:53.160
of their spiritual brothers and sisters.


51:53.160 --> 51:55.495
Sister Pötzinger used her experience 


51:55.495 --> 51:57.830
to encourage others 
in her later assignments. 


51:57.830 --> 51:59.833
For example, in the interview 


51:59.833 --> 52:01.835
with William and Sandra Malenfant, 


52:01.835 --> 52:04.470
Sister Malenfant remembered working 
with Sister Pötzinger 


52:04.470 --> 52:06.473
in the Bethel Sewing Department, 


52:06.473 --> 52:10.810
and Sister Pötzinger had given her 
a memorable sewing illustration. 


52:10.810 --> 52:15.215
She likened each prayer 
to adding another thread 


52:15.215 --> 52:18.785
to a strong cord 
that unites us with Jehovah. 


52:18.785 --> 52:21.622
You might enjoy 
watching that interview again 


52:21.622 --> 52:24.424
in the “Interviews and Experiences” section,


52:24.423 --> 52:27.993
under “Blessings of Sacred Service.”


52:27.993 --> 52:30.763
Later this month, 
you’ll also want to watch 


52:30.763 --> 52:34.633
a new original song 
under the “Music” section. 


52:34.633 --> 52:37.103
In the April 2016 program, 


52:37.103 --> 52:38.971
a group of young ones explained 


52:38.972 --> 52:41.642
why they visited Bethel 
and what they enjoyed seeing. 


52:41.642 --> 52:45.512
While there, they also sang 
a song about their experience, 


52:45.512 --> 52:49.000
with the help of Bethelites, 
at the branches they visited.


52:51.818 --> 52:55.688
And we have a music video 
to enjoy in this month’s program. 


52:55.688 --> 52:59.691
It’s called 
Stop, Think, and Pray. 


52:59.692 --> 53:02.029
No matter what the problem is, 


53:02.028 --> 53:05.965
we should always take time 
to think about Bible principles 


53:05.965 --> 53:09.000
and pray for Jehovah’s holy spirit.


53:19.880 --> 53:29.923
Life’s not easy when trouble’s around
And the whole situation is getting you down.


53:29.923 --> 53:41.433
So-called friends, they just want a reaction.
Turn to Jehovah and pray—


53:41.433 --> 53:46.000
Silently pray.


53:47.107 --> 53:57.450
Don’t give up; don’t give in.
Put your trust in Jehovah.


53:57.450 --> 54:07.260
Keep it calm; we can win
If we stop, think, and pray.


54:07.260 --> 54:17.437
When there seems no way out,
He’ll be there, always by our side.


54:17.437 --> 54:27.514
He will be our guide, never doubt;
No, just stop, think, and pray.


54:27.513 --> 54:35.000
Make Jehovah smile.
Let him show the way.


54:46.298 --> 54:51.503
Ev’ry day will have troubles to share.


54:51.503 --> 54:56.743
There are bills to be paid 
with no money to spare.


54:56.743 --> 55:07.986
Even so, we’ll be happy in giving
If we can make someone smile—


55:07.987 --> 55:12.000
Make someone smile.


55:14.060 --> 55:23.770
Never doubt; never fear.
Put your trust in Jehovah.


55:23.770 --> 55:34.680
And our road will be clear
If we stop, think, and pray.


55:34.680 --> 55:44.190
When we’re weak, we are strong.
And we’ll see he was by our side.


55:44.190 --> 55:54.200
He has been our guide all along.
Always stop, think, and pray.


55:54.200 --> 56:02.000
Make Jehovah smile.
Let him show the way.


56:05.312 --> 56:15.155
Put your trust in Jehovah.
And our road will be clear


56:15.155 --> 56:25.632
If we stop, think, and pray.
When we’re weak, we are strong.


56:25.632 --> 56:35.675
And we’ll see he was by our side.
He has been our guide all along.


56:35.675 --> 56:43.000
Always stop, think, and pray.
Make Jehovah smile.


56:45.652 --> 56:49.000
Thank him ev’ry day.


56:52.192 --> 56:54.360
Jehovah will always bless us 


56:54.360 --> 56:56.695
when we go to him 
in prayer with our concerns. 


56:56.695 --> 56:58.698
Whatever the situation, 


56:58.698 --> 57:01.901
he can give us 
“the power beyond what is normal.” 


57:01.902 --> 57:04.537
And as we learned 
and practiced in this program, 


57:04.537 --> 57:08.240
we do our part by training 
our “power of reason” 


57:08.240 --> 57:11.010
with the principles 
from his written Word.


57:11.010 --> 57:13.145
Finally, 
we have greetings 


57:13.145 --> 57:16.382
from the Vesterålen islands, 
in Norway.


57:16.382 --> 57:19.485
These islands are home to 30,000 people 


57:19.485 --> 57:22.155
who enjoy the beautiful fjords, mountains, 


57:22.155 --> 57:24.890
and calm beaches.


57:24.890 --> 57:28.728
The 53 publishers 
in the Sortland Norwegian Congregation 


57:28.728 --> 57:33.533
preach in a territory that covers 
1,800 square kilometers, 


57:33.533 --> 57:37.000
or 695 square miles. 


57:38.237 --> 57:42.709
Their thorough witnessing takes them 
into the beautiful countryside, 


57:42.708 --> 57:44.710
as well as to the city of Sortland 


57:44.710 --> 57:47.647
for metropolitan public witnessing. 


57:47.647 --> 57:50.184
Each year, they organize trips 
to unassigned territory, 


57:50.183 --> 57:52.085
where they often meet people 


57:52.085 --> 57:55.000
who show deep respect for the Bible.


57:56.188 --> 57:57.923
One Saturday each month, 
after the ministry, 


57:57.923 --> 58:01.126
they gather to watch 
the JW Broadcasting program 


58:01.127 --> 58:03.295
and enjoy spending time together. 


58:03.295 --> 58:06.265
Progressive Bible studies 
and a Russian group 


58:06.265 --> 58:08.935
join them each week 
at their meetings. 


58:08.935 --> 58:11.070
We send our love 
and greetings 


58:11.070 --> 58:13.873
and thank them 
for their Christian love 


58:13.873 --> 58:16.000
and example of faith.


58:17.943 --> 58:19.945
Thank you for watching. 


58:19.945 --> 58:22.515
From the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


58:22.515 --> 58:31.775
this is JW Broadcasting!
