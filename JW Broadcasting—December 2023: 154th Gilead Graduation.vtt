Welcome to JW Broadcasting®

00:00:03.816 --> 00:00:05.818 line:90% position:50% align:center
for December 2023!

00:00:24.753 --> 00:00:27.089 line:90% position:50% align:center
On September 9, 2023,

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.135 line:90% position:50% align:center
the 48 students of the 154th class of Gilead

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
graduated in the presence of their family,

00:00:33.596 --> 00:00:37.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
friends, and the United States Bethel family.

00:00:37.349 --> 00:00:39.727 line:10% position:50% align:center
Mature brothers serving at Bethel

00:00:39.727 --> 00:00:41.979 line:10% position:50% align:center
along with their Gilead instructors

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:44.315 line:10% position:50% align:center
gave the students loving encouragement

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:45.858 line:10% position:50% align:center
and reminders

00:00:45.858 --> 00:00:47.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help them fulfill their commission

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.238 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen and stabilize God’s people

00:00:51.238 --> 00:00:53.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
wherever they are assigned.

00:00:53.741 --> 00:00:56.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
We are sharing
these motivating talks with you

00:00:56.493 --> 00:00:59.580 line:90% position:50% align:center
in Part 1 of this Gilead graduation program.

00:01:00.164 --> 00:01:03.626 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we are here to celebrate

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:08.631 line:90% position:50% align:center
with the graduating class number 154

00:01:08.631 --> 00:01:11.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the Watchtower Bible School of Gilead.

00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:13.552 line:90% position:50% align:center
Are you excited?

00:01:26.607 --> 00:01:30.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we’re excited for you.

00:01:30.611 --> 00:01:34.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this is the culmination of five months

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:36.533 line:90% position:50% align:center
of hard work on your part.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we want to say
that we are proud

00:01:39.787 --> 00:01:42.665 line:90% position:50% align:center
of each and every one of you,
and we love you.

00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:46.085 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know that you’re going to do
a tremendous amount of good

00:01:46.085 --> 00:01:48.128 line:90% position:50% align:center
in your assignments.

00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:51.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, unlike the chairman
of the midweek meeting,

00:01:51.715 --> 00:01:55.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m not going to be able to give you
an overview of the information

00:01:55.511 --> 00:01:57.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’re going to hear this morning.

00:01:57.513 --> 00:01:59.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
But I can tell you one thing:

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:02.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’ve looked over the themes
that the instructors

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.396 line:90% position:50% align:center
and other responsible brothers
have turned in,

00:02:05.396 --> 00:02:07.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they’re mighty interesting.

00:02:07.398 --> 00:02:09.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
So let’s get started.

00:02:09.191 --> 00:02:10.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s hear the first talk.

00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:14.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the first talk is going to be given
by Brother Jody Jedele,

00:02:14.863 --> 00:02:17.366 line:90% position:50% align:center
who was recently chosen

00:02:17.366 --> 00:02:20.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
as a helper to the Service Committee.

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:25.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Jedele’s theme is
“Remember the Builder.”

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:27.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s listen.

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:37.970 line:90% position:50% align:center
A master builder is responsible

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
for every aspect
in the creation of a building

00:02:40.597 --> 00:02:42.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
—beginning to end—

00:02:42.224 --> 00:02:46.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
including oversight
of those performing the work.

00:02:46.603 --> 00:02:50.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is mankind’s Master Builder.

00:02:50.274 --> 00:02:52.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Gilead students, soon-to-be graduates,

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:56.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
you have the precious privilege
of further supporting the Master Builder

00:02:56.947 --> 00:02:59.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
by strengthening and stabilizing,

00:02:59.408 --> 00:03:02.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, building up Jehovah’s people.

00:03:02.327 --> 00:03:05.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you do that successfully?

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:07.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, turn with me, please,
to the book of Psalms,

00:03:07.541 --> 00:03:11.670 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 127—the 127th Psalm.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll look in verse 1,
the words of wise King Solomon.

00:03:16.675 --> 00:03:20.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 127:1 says:

00:03:20.137 --> 00:03:24.141 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house.”

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:27.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Hebrew,
“house” can also refer to “family.”

00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:30.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house,

00:03:30.355 --> 00:03:34.068 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is in vain
that its builders work hard on it.”

00:03:34.068 --> 00:03:37.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Unless Jehovah builds the house”
—that’s powerful.

00:03:37.988 --> 00:03:40.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Any endeavor, even well-intentioned,

00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
that doesn’t have Jehovah’s blessing

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
will ultimately be in vain.

00:03:46.497 --> 00:03:49.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
So to build up Jehovah’s family,

00:03:49.208 --> 00:03:54.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have to align our efforts
with Jehovah’s building methods.

00:03:54.004 --> 00:03:57.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
So how can we
or how can you successfully do that

00:03:57.925 --> 00:04:00.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
—build up the branch family
where you’re assigned?

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.097 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, I’d like to invite you
to the book of Nehemiah.

00:04:03.097 --> 00:04:06.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll turn to Nehemiah chapter 1,

00:04:06.391 --> 00:04:09.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
and we’ll see how he applied
King Solomon’s wise counsel

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remember the Builder
and then what lessons we can learn from him.

00:04:13.857 --> 00:04:16.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll begin in chapter 1 and verse 3,

00:04:16.443 --> 00:04:21.198 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Hanani, Nehemiah’s brother,
is explaining Jerusalem’s sad situation.

00:04:21.198 --> 00:04:23.784 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s pick up their conversation in verse 3:

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:27.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
“They [or Hanani
and those who traveled with him] replied:

00:04:27.371 --> 00:04:31.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘Those remaining there in the province
who have survived the captivity

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:34.753 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘are in a terrible situation
and in disgrace.

00:04:34.753 --> 00:04:38.132 line:90% position:50% align:center
“‘The walls of Jerusalem are broken down,

00:04:38.132 --> 00:04:41.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
and its gates have been burned with fire.’”

00:04:41.844 --> 00:04:44.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, how did Nehemiah react
when he heard that information?

00:04:44.346 --> 00:04:45.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s look in verse 4.

00:04:45.848 --> 00:04:48.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah says:
“As soon as I heard these words,

00:04:48.934 --> 00:04:53.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
“I sat down and began to weep
and mourn for days,

00:04:53.355 --> 00:04:54.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I kept fasting

00:04:54.773 --> 00:04:58.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
[and notice]
and praying before the God of the heavens.”

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:01.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
This news had a profound impact on him.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
He wept; he mourned; he fasted.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why? Because he loved Jehovah,
Jerusalem was a center of pure worship,

00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:09.997 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he loved his brothers and sisters.

00:05:09.997 --> 00:05:12.291 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the question is,
What should he do about it?

00:05:12.291 --> 00:05:15.210 line:90% position:50% align:center
He probably wanted to jump in
and fix things right away.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you notice
how he remembered the Builder?

00:05:18.881 --> 00:05:20.883 line:90% position:50% align:center
His feelings were appropriate.

00:05:20.883 --> 00:05:24.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something was needed,
but he didn’t get ahead of things.

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:26.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
He took time to deal with his feelings,

00:05:26.597 --> 00:05:30.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it says he prayed repeatedly.

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
He focused on the Builder.

00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:34.605 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it’s interesting
that Jehovah waited

00:05:34.605 --> 00:05:37.191 line:90% position:50% align:center
some four months or so
to answer those prayers

00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:39.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Kislev to Nisan—

00:05:39.193 --> 00:05:42.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
whereas the rebuilding itself
only took about 52 days.

00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:47.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, four months may not be
a long period of time,

00:05:47.075 --> 00:05:49.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it’s also not the next day.

00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:52.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
In either case,
Nehemiah waited for Jehovah’s direction.

00:05:52.956 --> 00:05:54.583 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when the direction came,

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:57.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
when the king granted
all of the things he had prayed for,

00:05:57.294 --> 00:05:59.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah could be confident

00:05:59.588 --> 00:06:02.257 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it was Jehovah doing the building.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:05.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, you know how Nehemiah felt.

00:06:05.344 --> 00:06:08.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
You’ve seen Jehovah answer prayers
in your life.

00:06:08.597 --> 00:06:11.183 line:90% position:50% align:center
Continue to rely on prayer,

00:06:11.183 --> 00:06:13.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
even more so now
as you take on new assignments

00:06:13.852 --> 00:06:15.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
and encounter new situations.

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:20.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, yes, when you have strong feelings
on a matter,

00:06:20.025 --> 00:06:22.486 line:90% position:50% align:center
remember the Builder.

00:06:22.486 --> 00:06:24.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
Get his direction.

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:28.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another thing to remember
about getting Jehovah’s direction

00:06:28.158 --> 00:06:30.202 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that it’s not a passive process.

00:06:30.202 --> 00:06:31.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
It’s an active process.

00:06:31.787 --> 00:06:34.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
While Nehemiah waited,
he didn’t just sit around killing time.

00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:37.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was active
in his spiritual routine and assignment,

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
and he kept meditating on the situation,

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:43.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking for solutions
that Jehovah could bless

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then including those in his prayers.

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:49.930 line:90% position:50% align:center
His spiritual routine helped him
through the discouraging moments,

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:54.935 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it also helped him remain ready
for when the answer did come.

00:06:54.935 --> 00:06:58.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we know this
because at Nehemiah 2:4-8,

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
when King Artaxerxes granted his request,
he asked Nehemiah:

00:07:02.317 --> 00:07:06.113 line:90% position:50% align:center
“How long will your journey be,
and when will you return?”

00:07:06.113 --> 00:07:09.116 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah already had a timetable in mind.

00:07:09.116 --> 00:07:12.953 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah also asked
for authorization letters for the governors

00:07:12.953 --> 00:07:16.331 line:90% position:50% align:center
and for building materials
from “the keeper of the Royal Park.”

00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:21.336 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah had been waiting actively
—praying, meditating.

00:07:21.336 --> 00:07:25.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, situations today
will not always be resolved in a day.

00:07:25.757 --> 00:07:27.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
But like Nehemiah,
your spiritual routine

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:29.761 line:90% position:50% align:center
will provide you with stability,

00:07:29.761 --> 00:07:33.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and it’ll help you to be ready
when the direction comes.

00:07:33.015 --> 00:07:35.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another beautiful effect
is that your example

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the ministry and at the meetings
and in your assignments

00:07:38.353 --> 00:07:40.689 line:90% position:50% align:center
will also strengthen the friends.

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:42.774 line:90% position:50% align:center
As they too face challenges,

00:07:42.774 --> 00:07:45.610 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’ll be helped to remember the Builder.

00:07:46.862 --> 00:07:48.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another way to remember the Builder

00:07:48.613 --> 00:07:52.117 line:90% position:50% align:center
is to remember Jehovah’s love for people.

00:07:52.117 --> 00:07:56.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah, even under difficult circumstances,
noticed people.

00:07:56.496 --> 00:07:59.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn to Nehemiah chapter 3.

00:07:59.207 --> 00:08:01.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll look at some of the highlights
here in chapter 3.

00:08:01.918 --> 00:08:05.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah is going
around the city wall counterclockwise,

00:08:05.172 --> 00:08:07.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
but notice what he describes
there in chapter 3.

00:08:07.507 --> 00:08:09.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll look first in verse 1.

00:08:09.718 --> 00:08:11.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
It says
that “the high priest and his brothers”

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
were building “the Sheep Gate.”

00:08:13.305 --> 00:08:17.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look in verse 2:
“The men of Jericho were building.”

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.102 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s go down to verse 5.

00:08:19.102 --> 00:08:22.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
There we see
the humble Tekoites working hard,

00:08:22.898 --> 00:08:25.525 line:90% position:50% align:center
but the prominent ones not so much.

00:08:25.525 --> 00:08:28.695 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s a lesson in that.
Don’t be a prominent Tekoite.

00:08:28.695 --> 00:08:31.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all want to work on the walls.

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:32.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
Go down to verse 12.

00:08:32.866 --> 00:08:34.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we notice Shallum, who’s a prince.

00:08:34.618 --> 00:08:36.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
But who’s working with him?

00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:38.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
His hardworking daughters.

00:08:38.121 --> 00:08:40.415 line:90% position:50% align:center
It helps remind us
of our sisters that do so much

00:08:40.415 --> 00:08:43.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
in today’s efforts
to advance Kingdom interests.

00:08:43.126 --> 00:08:45.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
Turn to verse 20 here in the chapter.

00:08:45.879 --> 00:08:50.425 line:90% position:50% align:center
And it says: 
“Baruch . . . worked with fervor.”

00:08:50.425 --> 00:08:53.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nehemiah noticed people,

00:08:53.136 --> 00:08:56.390 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah inspired him to write about them.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.391 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why?

00:08:57.391 --> 00:09:01.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
One reason is that Jehovah wants us
to remember why we’re building.

00:09:01.228 --> 00:09:03.313 line:90% position:50% align:center
He loves people.

00:09:03.313 --> 00:09:06.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rebuilding the walls wasn’t the end goal.

00:09:06.566 --> 00:09:10.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
Rather, rebuilding the walls
supported the end goal

00:09:10.237 --> 00:09:13.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that of glorifying Jehovah,
fulfilling prophecy

00:09:13.156 --> 00:09:15.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, yes, protecting Jehovah’s people.

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
Those actual walls
were destroyed again later.

00:09:17.702 --> 00:09:19.871 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the account of Nehemiah lives on today.

00:09:19.871 --> 00:09:22.124 line:90% position:50% align:center
And those who worked on the wall,

00:09:22.124 --> 00:09:24.251 line:90% position:50% align:center
they too hoped to live forever.

00:09:24.251 --> 00:09:26.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
So get to know the people
you’re building with.

00:09:26.294 --> 00:09:27.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’re wonderful people.

00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:29.673 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah chooses amazing friends.

00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:33.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
And like Nehemiah,
appreciate their qualities.

00:09:34.428 --> 00:09:38.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Think of your congregation
and your department as a spiritual building.

00:09:38.098 --> 00:09:41.852 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the individual brothers and sisters
—we’re all the stones.

00:09:41.852 --> 00:09:44.312 line:90% position:50% align:center
The mortar that binds us together

00:09:44.312 --> 00:09:48.650 line:90% position:50% align:center
is the love and consideration
we show each other.

00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:51.862 line:90% position:50% align:center
For those of you brothers
who may contribute to decision-making

00:09:51.862 --> 00:09:54.156 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you return to your assignments,

00:09:54.156 --> 00:09:56.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
humbly consider the ideas of others,

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:00.370 line:90% position:50% align:center
including brothers and sisters
under your oversight.

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:05.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Additionally,
consider how a decision will affect others.

00:10:05.208 --> 00:10:09.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
To strengthen others,
we need to know and love them,

00:10:09.004 --> 00:10:11.590 line:90% position:50% align:center
just like the Builder does.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:14.384 line:90% position:50% align:center
One final thought
regarding our Master Builder:

00:10:14.384 --> 00:10:16.428 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is a happy God.

00:10:16.428 --> 00:10:18.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imperfection in Satan’s system
causes suffering.

00:10:18.472 --> 00:10:19.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s true.

00:10:19.598 --> 00:10:23.018 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember
that serving Jehovah brings joy

00:10:23.018 --> 00:10:25.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
despite those challenges.

00:10:25.353 --> 00:10:27.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there is strength in that joy.

00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:32.527 line:90% position:50% align:center
After completing the wall, at Nehemiah 8:10,
Nehemiah reminded the people

00:10:32.527 --> 00:10:36.031 line:90% position:50% align:center
that “the joy of Jehovah
[was their] stronghold.”

00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:39.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Knowing that they had done Jehovah’s will
and had Jehovah’s approval

00:10:39.743 --> 00:10:43.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
gave them strength,
and that had an impact on them.

00:10:43.288 --> 00:10:46.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice that in Nehemiah chapter 12.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Nehemiah 12:43,

00:10:50.504 --> 00:10:52.923 line:90% position:50% align:center
this verse talks
about the day of inauguration

00:10:52.923 --> 00:10:55.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
after all of the challenges
had been overcome.

00:10:55.592 --> 00:11:00.388 line:90% position:50% align:center
And notice how the people felt
at Nehemiah 12:43:

00:11:00.388 --> 00:11:05.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
“On that day
they offered great sacrifices and rejoiced,

00:11:05.185 --> 00:11:08.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
“for the true God
made them rejoice with great joy.

00:11:08.855 --> 00:11:11.566 line:90% position:50% align:center
“The women and the children also rejoiced,

00:11:11.566 --> 00:11:16.488 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that the rejoicing of Jerusalem
could be heard far away.”

00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:20.408 line:90% position:50% align:center
Even with brand-new high walls,
they could be heard at a distance.

00:11:20.408 --> 00:11:23.119 line:90% position:50% align:center
That sounds like the joyful noise
before our meetings and assemblies

00:11:23.119 --> 00:11:26.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
or even here this morning
before your graduation program.

00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:31.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
But did you notice that it was Jehovah
who “made them rejoice”?

00:11:31.503 --> 00:11:34.798 line:90% position:50% align:center
Despite the challenges now
and those to come,

00:11:34.798 --> 00:11:39.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthen others
by remembering to enjoy Jehovah’s service.

00:11:39.469 --> 00:11:41.471 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s a happy God.

00:11:42.472 --> 00:11:46.476 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist said:
“Unless Jehovah builds the house.”

00:11:46.476 --> 00:11:49.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Jehovah is building the house.

00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:52.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you, dear graduates,
along with all of us,

00:11:52.649 --> 00:11:56.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
have the wonderful privilege of working
alongside him in this building work.

00:11:56.361 --> 00:11:59.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you strengthen and stabilize
Jehovah’s people,

00:11:59.531 --> 00:12:01.157 line:90% position:50% align:center
humbly remember the Builder.

00:12:01.157 --> 00:12:02.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
Seek his direction in prayer,

00:12:02.993 --> 00:12:05.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
stay busy in your spiritual routine,

00:12:05.287 --> 00:12:07.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
love the brothers and sisters,

00:12:07.372 --> 00:12:09.499 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy serving Jehovah.

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:12.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like Nehemiah, you’re guaranteed success,

00:12:12.752 --> 00:12:16.214 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Jehovah will remember you favorably

00:12:16.214 --> 00:12:18.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
when you remember the Builder.

00:12:31.646 --> 00:12:33.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
I don’t know about you,

00:12:33.273 --> 00:12:36.985 line:90% position:50% align:center
but it makes me want to read
the book of Nehemiah all over again.

00:12:38.403 --> 00:12:41.573 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, now we’re going to hear
from another recently appointed helper

00:12:41.573 --> 00:12:44.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the Service Committee,
Brother Betty Georges.

00:12:44.576 --> 00:12:49.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he is going to talk to us
on the subject “The Steps of Love.”

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what do you think?

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:56.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
What are the steps of love?

00:12:57.088 --> 00:12:59.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
There are three

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:02.385 line:90% position:50% align:center
—step one: love of God;

00:13:02.385 --> 00:13:06.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
step two: love of neighbor;

00:13:06.723 --> 00:13:10.185 line:90% position:50% align:center
and step three: love of self.

00:13:10.185 --> 00:13:13.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, of course, we’re not talking
about the selfish, self-centered attitude

00:13:13.438 --> 00:13:14.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
that people have today.

00:13:14.856 --> 00:13:18.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
We all need a measure
of self-worth, self-respect.

00:13:18.652 --> 00:13:20.487 line:90% position:50% align:center
If we were to take a picture of these steps,

00:13:20.487 --> 00:13:22.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
it would look something like this.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
It makes sense that the highest step

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.079 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the first is love of God.

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:31.081 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the lowest

00:13:31.081 --> 00:13:33.500 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the third step is love of self.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.377 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because according to “the law of the Christ,”

00:13:35.377 --> 00:13:37.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
we ought to love our neighbor more than self

00:13:37.545 --> 00:13:39.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
because we ought to be willing to die

00:13:39.547 --> 00:13:40.882 line:90% position:50% align:center
for our neighbor.

00:13:41.424 --> 00:13:44.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
For the sake of this talk,
we’ll focus on step three.

00:13:44.594 --> 00:13:48.431 line:90% position:50% align:center
The reason being is that though the lowest,

00:13:48.431 --> 00:13:52.268 line:90% position:50% align:center
for some it may be the hardest to climb

00:13:52.268 --> 00:13:55.021 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of lack of self-esteem.

00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:57.232 line:90% position:50% align:center
The question to you is this,

00:13:57.232 --> 00:13:59.359 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can we help others

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:02.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
build or boost their self-esteem?

00:14:02.153 --> 00:14:03.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
What do you think?

00:14:03.988 --> 00:14:05.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
By imitating Christ.

00:14:05.407 --> 00:14:06.700 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he do?

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
He gave love to others in three ways:

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.416 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being encouraging, by caring,

00:14:14.416 --> 00:14:16.459 line:90% position:50% align:center
and by trusting.

00:14:16.459 --> 00:14:20.505 line:90% position:50% align:center
One example of Jesus being encouraging
is found in Luke chapter 10,

00:14:20.505 --> 00:14:23.091 line:90% position:50% align:center
so please follow with me in Luke chapter 10.

00:14:23.091 --> 00:14:27.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there, as we glance down to verse 27,

00:14:27.345 --> 00:14:30.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have a man versed in the Law.

00:14:30.098 --> 00:14:32.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there he clearly identified
the three steps

00:14:32.809 --> 00:14:36.354 line:90% position:50% align:center
according to the Law of Moses,

00:14:36.354 --> 00:14:38.398 line:90% position:50% align:center
the Mosaic Law.

00:14:38.398 --> 00:14:41.568 line:90% position:50% align:center
But note the encouragement Jesus gave him

00:14:41.568 --> 00:14:44.404 line:90% position:50% align:center
in verse 28
—verse 28.

00:14:44.404 --> 00:14:48.074 line:90% position:50% align:center
At Luke 10:28, Jesus said to him:

00:14:48.074 --> 00:14:50.702 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You answered correctly;

00:14:50.702 --> 00:14:54.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
“keep doing this
[or keep giving love; keep showing love]

00:14:54.497 --> 00:14:56.916 line:90% position:50% align:center
and you will get life.”

00:14:56.916 --> 00:14:59.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the lesson for us?

00:14:59.461 --> 00:15:02.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
We want to be quick to give,

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:06.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
yes, commendation but also motivation.

00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:08.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
One <i>Watchtower </i> said this.

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:12.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
It said (<i>The Watchtower</i>  said):
‘At this point in the race for life,

00:15:12.015 --> 00:15:13.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘our brothers don’t need critics.

00:15:13.850 --> 00:15:15.810 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘There are enough critics in the world,

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:20.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
but they need friends
to help them reach the finish line.’

00:15:22.108 --> 00:15:24.152 line:90% position:50% align:center
In Luke chapter 18,

00:15:24.152 --> 00:15:27.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
we have an example of Jesus being caring

00:15:27.781 --> 00:15:30.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
—showing tender, loving care.

00:15:30.033 --> 00:15:31.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
So in Luke chapter 18—

00:15:31.701 --> 00:15:33.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
the context of Luke chapter 18

00:15:33.745 --> 00:15:37.999 line:90% position:50% align:center
is it’s close to the spring of 33 C.E.

00:15:37.999 --> 00:15:39.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus is on his way.

00:15:39.542 --> 00:15:43.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s on a mission, going to Jerusalem
to observe his last Passover.

00:15:43.004 --> 00:15:45.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there in verse 35 of Luke chapter 18—

00:15:45.757 --> 00:15:48.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
I’m sure you remember
that the context 

00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:50.762 line:90% position:50% align:center
of Luke chapter 18 is near Jericho.

00:15:50.762 --> 00:15:53.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jericho to Jerusalem is a day’s journey.

00:15:54.682 --> 00:15:58.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
And there, Luke 18:35, near Jericho,

00:15:58.353 --> 00:16:03.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
there’s a blind man
sitting beside the road begging.

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:06.319 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did Jesus do for this man?

00:16:06.319 --> 00:16:09.364 line:90% position:50% align:center
Please scroll down to verse 40,

00:16:09.364 --> 00:16:12.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
verse 40, Luke 18:40.

00:16:12.075 --> 00:16:13.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus cared enough to stop.

00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:17.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s on a mission, but he stopped.

00:16:18.248 --> 00:16:20.667 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 41,

00:16:20.667 --> 00:16:24.045 line:90% position:50% align:center
he cared enough
to show personal interest.

00:16:24.045 --> 00:16:26.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did you notice the question
Jesus just asked the man?

00:16:26.589 --> 00:16:28.967 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:16:28.967 --> 00:16:33.137 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we can try to picture,
imagine, the tone of voice of Jesus:

00:16:33.137 --> 00:16:35.014 line:90% position:50% align:center
“What do you want me to do for you?”

00:16:35.014 --> 00:16:37.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, let’s think about this a little bit.

00:16:37.225 --> 00:16:40.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is it possible that Jesus
could see the man was blind?

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:42.355 line:90% position:50% align:center
Probably.
So why the question?

00:16:44.065 --> 00:16:46.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
Probably to take into consideration
his feelings.

00:16:46.943 --> 00:16:48.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What do you need?
What do you want?’

00:16:48.778 --> 00:16:52.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interestingly, in verse 39 (in verse 39),

00:16:52.615 --> 00:16:55.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
the crowd was trying to keep this man quiet.

00:16:56.744 --> 00:17:01.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
But now, in verse 41,
Jesus says: ‘Speak to me.

00:17:01.791 --> 00:17:03.376 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘What do you want?
What do you need?

00:17:03.376 --> 00:17:05.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can I help you?’

00:17:05.169 --> 00:17:07.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Personal interest.

00:17:07.797 --> 00:17:10.216 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to drive home the lesson of this account,

00:17:10.216 --> 00:17:13.052 line:90% position:50% align:center
here’s a verified experience.

00:17:14.095 --> 00:17:19.142 line:90% position:50% align:center
A brother took his nephew,
13 years old, to visit Bethel.

00:17:19.142 --> 00:17:22.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at the time, the nephew
was going through family turmoil

00:17:22.270 --> 00:17:25.857 line:90% position:50% align:center
to the point
that it caused him to lack motivation.

00:17:25.857 --> 00:17:29.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
So as they’re touring Bethel,
a Bethelite stopped

00:17:32.822 --> 00:17:36.534 line:90% position:50% align:center
and took a few minutes
to show personal interest.

00:17:36.534 --> 00:17:38.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
The result?

00:17:38.745 --> 00:17:42.248 line:90% position:50% align:center
At the very next assembly,
the 13-year-old got baptized.

00:17:43.499 --> 00:17:47.086 line:90% position:50% align:center
Two years later, at 15,
he started regular pioneering.

00:17:47.086 --> 00:17:50.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
At 17, he was appointed
a ministerial servant.

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:53.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now he is 19;
he put in his application for Bethel.

00:17:54.719 --> 00:17:58.848 line:90% position:50% align:center
All of this because someone stopped

00:17:58.848 --> 00:18:01.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
and showed personal interest.

00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:09.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you think of an example
of Jesus showing trust to others?

00:18:09.233 --> 00:18:11.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go to Luke

00:18:11.235 --> 00:18:14.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
—this time in Luke chapter 22,

00:18:14.739 --> 00:18:16.741 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke chapter 22.

00:18:16.741 --> 00:18:20.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
And as we look at verse 34,

00:18:20.745 --> 00:18:23.498 line:90% position:50% align:center
Luke 22:34,

00:18:23.498 --> 00:18:27.126 line:90% position:50% align:center
it’s when Jesus reminded or forewarned,

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:31.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
not reminded but forewarned Peter
that he would deny him three times.

00:18:31.547 --> 00:18:33.633 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now let’s pause there.

00:18:33.633 --> 00:18:38.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
At that moment
when Peter denied his Master three times,

00:18:38.638 --> 00:18:42.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
what do you think
was his level of self-worth?

00:18:42.642 --> 00:18:45.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yeah, at an all-time low.

00:18:45.269 --> 00:18:48.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
It would have been so easy for Peter
to just give up and never get back up.

00:18:49.983 --> 00:18:53.611 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what helped him
to climb back onto step three?

00:18:54.612 --> 00:18:58.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
Probably what Jesus told him in verse 32.

00:18:58.950 --> 00:19:02.161 line:90% position:50% align:center
Look at the latter part of verse 32.

00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:07.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
We’ll focus on four words:
You notice, “once you have returned”

00:19:07.208 --> 00:19:09.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“once you have returned.”

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:13.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
And probably these words
may have kept ringing in Peter’s ears

00:19:13.464 --> 00:19:17.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he was down and out
and slowly getting back up

00:19:17.343 --> 00:19:18.803 line:90% position:50% align:center
—“once you have returned.”

00:19:18.803 --> 00:19:21.055 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jesus is expressing what here?

00:19:21.055 --> 00:19:23.975 line:90% position:50% align:center
Expressing confidence.

00:19:23.975 --> 00:19:27.520 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Yes, you will fall,
but you will get back to step three.’

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.688 line:90% position:50% align:center
But not only that.

00:19:28.688 --> 00:19:32.859 line:90% position:50% align:center
Hey, don’t forget step two, because
you notice the latter part of verse 32:

00:19:32.859 --> 00:19:37.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Once you have returned,
[what’s the mission?] strengthen.”

00:19:37.613 --> 00:19:42.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Greek word
literally means “make firm” your brothers.

00:19:46.539 --> 00:19:49.584 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is eager

00:19:49.584 --> 00:19:52.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
to believe the best in others.

00:19:52.211 --> 00:19:54.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
Love is trusting.

00:19:56.591 --> 00:19:58.634 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what could be the result

00:19:58.634 --> 00:20:02.096 line:90% position:50% align:center
as we help others to boost their self-esteem?

00:20:02.096 --> 00:20:03.639 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, let’s go back to our image.

00:20:03.639 --> 00:20:05.224 line:90% position:50% align:center
What could be the result?

00:20:05.224 --> 00:20:07.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, as you climb up to step three,

00:20:07.685 --> 00:20:10.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
you agree it makes it a little bit easier
to go on to step two

00:20:10.063 --> 00:20:13.399 line:90% position:50% align:center
—love of others, or love of neighbor—

00:20:13.399 --> 00:20:15.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is a prerequisite

00:20:15.777 --> 00:20:18.154 line:90% position:50% align:center
for love of God, step one.

00:20:18.154 --> 00:20:20.865 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did the apostle John say?

00:20:20.865 --> 00:20:22.158 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did he say?

00:20:22.158 --> 00:20:27.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, we cannot say
we love God if we don’t love our neighbor.

00:20:29.248 --> 00:20:33.711 line:90% position:50% align:center
Having attended Gilead,
you heard the fine talk of Brother Jedele.

00:20:33.711 --> 00:20:35.713 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is expected of you?

00:20:37.298 --> 00:20:41.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
To strengthen and stabilize the organization.

00:20:43.012 --> 00:20:47.642 line:90% position:50% align:center
It has been said that this can be done
one publisher at a time.

00:20:47.642 --> 00:20:51.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that reminds me of about ten years ago
—actually, ten years ago—

00:20:51.187 --> 00:20:53.898 line:90% position:50% align:center
my wife and I were transferred
from Canada to Congo.

00:20:53.898 --> 00:20:55.942 line:90% position:50% align:center
And I’ll never forget what a friend told me.

00:20:55.942 --> 00:20:57.777 line:90% position:50% align:center
He said: “You know what?
The friends in Congo

00:20:57.777 --> 00:20:59.946 line:90% position:50% align:center
“—they don’t need another Messiah.

00:20:59.946 --> 00:21:01.989 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Trust me, they don’t.

00:21:04.784 --> 00:21:08.204 line:90% position:50% align:center
All they need is love.”

00:21:09.664 --> 00:21:13.918 line:90% position:50% align:center
So keep on loving

00:21:13.918 --> 00:21:16.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
as Jesus taught us

00:21:16.170 --> 00:21:18.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
by being encouraging,

00:21:18.881 --> 00:21:23.261 line:90% position:50% align:center
by caring, by trusting.

00:21:23.261 --> 00:21:27.682 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the friends
will give you love back in return.

00:21:27.682 --> 00:21:30.101 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah help you to do just that.

00:21:30.101 --> 00:21:32.145 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, we love you.

00:21:46.951 --> 00:21:49.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was worthwhile, wasn’t it?

00:21:49.662 --> 00:21:51.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
Beautiful presentation.

00:21:51.831 --> 00:21:56.169 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, Brother David Iannelli,
who is a member of the Writing staff,

00:21:56.169 --> 00:21:58.754 line:90% position:50% align:center
is going to speak to us on the theme

00:21:58.754 --> 00:22:02.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Never Forget What Jehovah Remembers.”

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
There’s something Jehovah remembers

00:22:07.597 --> 00:22:11.601 line:90% position:50% align:center
that we do well never to forget.

00:22:11.601 --> 00:22:14.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
It involves the way he views us

00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:17.064 line:90% position:50% align:center
and treats us right now.

00:22:17.064 --> 00:22:21.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
And all of us, including you
who are graduating from Gilead today,

00:22:21.485 --> 00:22:24.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
do well never to forget it.

00:22:24.614 --> 00:22:26.407 line:90% position:50% align:center
What is it?

00:22:26.407 --> 00:22:30.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, open your Bible, please, to Psalm 103.

00:22:30.244 --> 00:22:34.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the answer is
in the familiar words recorded in verse 14,

00:22:34.832 --> 00:22:37.960 line:90% position:50% align:center
and just please keep your Bible open here.

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
The psalmist David,
speaking of Jehovah, says:

00:22:42.715 --> 00:22:46.010 line:90% position:50% align:center
“For he well knows how we are formed,

00:22:46.010 --> 00:22:50.306 line:90% position:50% align:center
remembering that we are dust.”

00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:54.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah remembers that we are dust.

00:22:54.685 --> 00:22:59.523 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does it mean,
and why should we never forget it?

00:22:59.523 --> 00:23:02.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, first, what does this expression mean?

00:23:02.485 --> 00:23:04.779 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Jehovah remembers that we’re dust.’

00:23:04.779 --> 00:23:07.281 line:90% position:50% align:center
Simply put, this:

00:23:07.281 --> 00:23:11.744 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is mindful of our sinful nature

00:23:11.744 --> 00:23:16.207 line:90% position:50% align:center
and inclined to forgive repentant sinners.

00:23:16.207 --> 00:23:18.709 line:90% position:50% align:center
Notice how the context indicates this.

00:23:18.709 --> 00:23:21.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you look in verses 1 and 2,

00:23:21.379 --> 00:23:25.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
David begins the psalm by exhorting himself

00:23:25.299 --> 00:23:29.512 line:90% position:50% align:center
never to forget what Jehovah has done.

00:23:29.512 --> 00:23:31.931 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what has Jehovah done?

00:23:31.931 --> 00:23:34.225 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 3, first,

00:23:34.225 --> 00:23:37.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
David mentions that Jehovah forgives.

00:23:37.895 --> 00:23:39.897 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the verses that follow,

00:23:39.897 --> 00:23:43.651 line:90% position:50% align:center
David four times refers to mercy,

00:23:43.651 --> 00:23:47.405 line:90% position:50% align:center
the tender quality
that moves Jehovah to forgive.

00:23:47.405 --> 00:23:50.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he four times refers to loyal love,

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.952 line:90% position:50% align:center
the love that moves Jehovah

00:23:52.952 --> 00:23:56.789 line:90% position:50% align:center
to treat us as his special property.

00:23:56.789 --> 00:24:00.042 line:90% position:50% align:center
Forgiveness, mercy, loyal love

00:24:00.042 --> 00:24:02.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
—they’re connected.

00:24:02.044 --> 00:24:03.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
How so?

00:24:04.338 --> 00:24:08.509 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, mercy prompts forgiveness.

00:24:08.509 --> 00:24:10.886 line:90% position:50% align:center
As one scholar put it:

00:24:10.886 --> 00:24:13.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
“God’s mercy is the cause,

00:24:13.556 --> 00:24:16.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
the removal of sin, the result.”

00:24:16.934 --> 00:24:18.936 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in this context,

00:24:18.936 --> 00:24:20.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
mercy and forgiveness

00:24:20.938 --> 00:24:25.026 line:90% position:50% align:center
are part of Jehovah’s loyal love.

00:24:25.026 --> 00:24:28.821 line:90% position:50% align:center
You might think of Jehovah’s loyal love
as a large house.

00:24:28.821 --> 00:24:33.451 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, mercy and forgiveness
are spacious rooms in that house.

00:24:34.285 --> 00:24:37.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we come to verses 11-13.

00:24:37.496 --> 00:24:42.460 line:90% position:50% align:center
David uses a series of three similes
—powerful word pictures—

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:46.464 line:90% position:50% align:center
to describe first the height,
then the breadth,

00:24:46.464 --> 00:24:49.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
then the paternal tenderness

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
of what one Bible reference work calls

00:24:52.219 --> 00:24:56.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehovah’s forgiving love.”

00:24:56.098 --> 00:24:58.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
And then we come to verse 14.

00:24:58.851 --> 00:25:01.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
David now explains why Jehovah

00:25:01.979 --> 00:25:06.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
is inclined to show us his forgiving love.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:10.654 line:90% position:50% align:center
He says: “He well knows how we are formed.”

00:25:10.654 --> 00:25:14.283 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah is well-aware that he formed Adam
“out of dust from the ground”

00:25:14.283 --> 00:25:19.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
and that even perfect humans
have natural limitations

00:25:19.163 --> 00:25:22.333 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the need to eat, to sleep, to breathe.

00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:24.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Adam and Eve sinned,

00:25:24.794 --> 00:25:28.547 line:90% position:50% align:center
being dust took on new meaning.

00:25:28.547 --> 00:25:33.094 line:90% position:50% align:center
Regarding verse 14,
<i>The Watchtower</i>  once explained:

00:25:33.094 --> 00:25:36.305 line:90% position:50% align:center
“David was speaking . . .
about human frailties

00:25:36.305 --> 00:25:40.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
caused by inherited imperfection.”

00:25:40.434 --> 00:25:43.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Jehovah is well-aware of the frailties

00:25:43.270 --> 00:25:46.607 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the limitations of our sinful nature.

00:25:46.607 --> 00:25:49.860 line:90% position:50% align:center
He understands; he knows how easy it is,

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:52.071 line:90% position:50% align:center
how prone we are to sin,

00:25:52.071 --> 00:25:55.658 line:90% position:50% align:center
and how strong the temptation to sin can be.

00:25:55.658 --> 00:25:59.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah is not just aware of this.

00:25:59.495 --> 00:26:03.457 line:90% position:50% align:center
David goes on to say that He remembers it.

00:26:03.457 --> 00:26:07.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
And the Hebrew word here
can mean “active remembering.”

00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.757 line:90% position:50% align:center
It implies a response
from the one remembering.

00:26:11.757 --> 00:26:16.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
In other words,
because Jehovah remembers that we’re dust,

00:26:16.262 --> 00:26:19.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
he is moved to do something.

00:26:19.432 --> 00:26:21.100 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do what?

00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, according to the context, to show mercy

00:26:24.603 --> 00:26:27.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
by forgiving repentant sinners.

00:26:27.815 --> 00:26:29.150 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what’s the lesson?

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:32.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s the meaning
of ‘Jehovah remembers that we are dust?’

00:26:32.153 --> 00:26:35.114 line:90% position:50% align:center
Again, put simply: He is mindful

00:26:35.114 --> 00:26:38.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our sinful nature and inclined

00:26:38.576 --> 00:26:41.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
to show us his forgiving love.

00:26:41.328 --> 00:26:44.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
We might sum up the lesson with three words:

00:26:44.582 --> 00:26:48.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
“limitations,” “expectations,”

00:26:48.502 --> 00:26:51.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “dealings” (or actions).

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:54.467 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because Jehovah understands the limitations

00:26:54.467 --> 00:26:56.469 line:90% position:50% align:center
of our sinful nature,

00:26:56.469 --> 00:27:00.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
he expects that we will fall short at times.

00:27:00.598 --> 00:27:03.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when we do, he is inclined

00:27:03.267 --> 00:27:06.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
to deal mercifully with us,

00:27:06.353 --> 00:27:08.814 line:90% position:50% align:center
to forgive our repentant heart.

00:27:09.857 --> 00:27:12.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the second question, though?

00:27:12.401 --> 00:27:15.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Why should we,
including you graduating today,

00:27:15.988 --> 00:27:20.326 line:90% position:50% align:center
never forget what Jehovah remembers?

00:27:20.326 --> 00:27:23.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, for you members of the 154th class,

00:27:23.037 --> 00:27:25.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
not forgetting what Jehovah remembers

00:27:25.706 --> 00:27:30.503 line:90% position:50% align:center
can actually help you fulfill the purpose
of your Gilead training,

00:27:30.503 --> 00:27:33.380 line:90% position:50% align:center
which (as we heard) is to stabilize

00:27:33.380 --> 00:27:35.716 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strengthen the work.

00:27:35.716 --> 00:27:39.386 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, consider two ways that this psalm
can help you

00:27:39.386 --> 00:27:43.891 line:90% position:50% align:center
—and by extension all of us listening in—
to do just that.

00:27:44.642 --> 00:27:48.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
First: To strengthen the work,

00:27:48.187 --> 00:27:51.899 line:90% position:50% align:center
be a force for peace and unity

00:27:51.899 --> 00:27:55.444 line:90% position:50% align:center
by imitating Jehovah’s forgiveness.

00:27:55.444 --> 00:27:57.279 line:90% position:50% align:center
How?

00:27:57.279 --> 00:27:59.949 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, recall three key words,

00:27:59.949 --> 00:28:04.745 line:90% position:50% align:center
“limitations influence expectations,”

00:28:04.745 --> 00:28:08.374 line:90% position:50% align:center
which affect how we deal with others.

00:28:08.374 --> 00:28:11.335 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s interesting;
we often do this automatically.

00:28:11.335 --> 00:28:13.712 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine a group of brothers playing soccer.

00:28:13.712 --> 00:28:16.423 line:90% position:50% align:center
One twists his ankle badly.

00:28:16.423 --> 00:28:18.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
The other brothers do not now expect him

00:28:18.968 --> 00:28:21.595 line:90% position:50% align:center
to run, kick, do body feints.

00:28:21.595 --> 00:28:24.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
They see the limitation,

00:28:24.098 --> 00:28:27.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
they adjust their expectations,

00:28:27.017 --> 00:28:29.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then they deal kindly,

00:28:29.353 --> 00:28:32.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps gently helping him off the field.

00:28:32.481 --> 00:28:37.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
And yet, in our everyday interactions
with others,

00:28:37.361 --> 00:28:40.781 line:90% position:50% align:center
it is so easy to forget

00:28:40.781 --> 00:28:42.908 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah remembers

00:28:42.908 --> 00:28:46.245 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the limitations of our sinful nature.

00:28:46.245 --> 00:28:50.791 line:90% position:50% align:center
So try this: When you feel resentment
welling up in you

00:28:50.791 --> 00:28:54.253 line:90% position:50% align:center
because of what a fellow worker
has said or done,

00:28:54.253 --> 00:28:56.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
stop and ask yourself:

00:28:56.964 --> 00:29:01.427 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Am I forgetting what Jehovah remembers

00:29:01.427 --> 00:29:06.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the limitations of my brother’s sinful,
imperfect nature?”

00:29:06.974 --> 00:29:10.311 line:90% position:50% align:center
You see, by reflecting on the limitation,

00:29:10.311 --> 00:29:13.230 line:90% position:50% align:center
you can adjust your expectations,

00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:17.443 line:90% position:50% align:center
which makes it easier to deal mercifully

00:29:17.443 --> 00:29:19.778 line:90% position:50% align:center
by letting go of that resentment

00:29:19.778 --> 00:29:23.490 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thus being a force for peace and unity.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:26.577 line:90% position:50% align:center
What about the second way?

00:29:26.577 --> 00:29:29.288 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here’s a second way the psalm can help:

00:29:29.288 --> 00:29:31.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
To strengthen the work,

00:29:31.790 --> 00:29:34.710 line:90% position:50% align:center
strengthen the workers,

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:37.921 line:90% position:50% align:center
for example, by helping others

00:29:37.921 --> 00:29:41.050 line:90% position:50% align:center
accept Jehovah’s forgiveness.

00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:43.302 line:90% position:50% align:center
At times, you may learn that a fellow worker

00:29:43.302 --> 00:29:45.846 line:90% position:50% align:center
is struggling with stubborn guilt

00:29:45.846 --> 00:29:48.766 line:90% position:50% align:center
over past mistakes.

00:29:48.766 --> 00:29:52.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
He’s forgetting what Jehovah remembers

00:29:52.603 --> 00:29:55.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
—that Jehovah is mindful of our limitations

00:29:55.481 --> 00:29:58.233 line:90% position:50% align:center
and inclined to forgive.

00:29:58.233 --> 00:30:01.987 line:90% position:50% align:center
But perhaps the brother is also remembering

00:30:01.987 --> 00:30:04.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
what Jehovah forgets

00:30:04.448 --> 00:30:06.992 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the sins that he’s already forgiven

00:30:06.992 --> 00:30:10.120 line:90% position:50% align:center
and would never hold against that brother.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.122 line:90% position:50% align:center
How can you help him?

00:30:12.122 --> 00:30:15.250 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, try this: Use Psalm 103:14

00:30:15.250 --> 00:30:17.586 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remind him of why Jehovah

00:30:17.586 --> 00:30:20.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
is inclined to forgive

00:30:20.339 --> 00:30:22.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then perhaps use verse 12

00:30:22.675 --> 00:30:26.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
to remind him of how far-reaching
that forgiveness is.

00:30:26.845 --> 00:30:28.847 line:90% position:50% align:center
Verse 12 reads:

00:30:28.847 --> 00:30:31.892 line:90% position:50% align:center
“As far off as the sunrise [or east]

00:30:31.892 --> 00:30:34.770 line:90% position:50% align:center
“is from the sunset [or west],

00:30:34.770 --> 00:30:39.066 line:90% position:50% align:center
so far off . . .
he has put our transgressions.”

00:30:40.109 --> 00:30:43.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
How far is east from west?

00:30:43.237 --> 00:30:46.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
The <i>Close to Jehovah </i> book
explains it this way:

00:30:46.657 --> 00:30:49.201 line:90% position:50% align:center
“In a sense, east is always

00:30:49.201 --> 00:30:51.537 line:90% position:50% align:center
“at the utmost distance

00:30:51.537 --> 00:30:54.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
“imaginable from west;

00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:57.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
the two points can never meet.”

00:30:57.668 --> 00:31:01.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, what does that mean for our sins?

00:31:01.422 --> 00:31:04.717 line:90% position:50% align:center
One reference work explained it this way:

00:31:04.717 --> 00:31:08.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
“If sin be removed so far,

00:31:08.303 --> 00:31:12.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
“then we may be sure
that the scent, the trace,

00:31:12.725 --> 00:31:14.727 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the very memory of it

00:31:14.727 --> 00:31:18.188 line:90% position:50% align:center
must be entirely gone.”

00:31:18.188 --> 00:31:21.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
A scent can trigger a memory.

00:31:21.483 --> 00:31:24.903 line:90% position:50% align:center
But when Jehovah forgives,
he puts our sins so far off

00:31:24.903 --> 00:31:28.365 line:90% position:50% align:center
that there remains
not even the trace of a scent

00:31:28.365 --> 00:31:31.410 line:90% position:50% align:center
that could possibly trigger him
to remember it

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:34.246 line:90% position:50% align:center
and hold it against us.

00:31:34.246 --> 00:31:36.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
Use Psalm 103

00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:38.876 line:90% position:50% align:center
to help others accept

00:31:38.876 --> 00:31:42.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jehovah’s far-reaching forgiveness.

00:31:42.379 --> 00:31:44.506 line:90% position:50% align:center
If you strengthen the worker,

00:31:44.506 --> 00:31:46.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
you strengthen the work.

00:31:46.925 --> 00:31:51.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
So for you members of the 154th class,
as you leave here today,

00:31:51.597 --> 00:31:55.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
may you be determined
to use your Gilead training

00:31:55.184 --> 00:31:58.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
to strengthen the work and the workers.

00:31:58.604 --> 00:32:02.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
And to that end,
let the beautiful words of Psalm 103

00:32:02.983 --> 00:32:06.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
help you to (1) be a force

00:32:06.653 --> 00:32:10.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
for peace and unity
by imitating Jehovah’s forgiveness

00:32:10.824 --> 00:32:14.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
and (2) help downhearted ones

00:32:14.411 --> 00:32:18.832 line:90% position:50% align:center
to accept that far-reaching forgiveness.

00:32:18.832 --> 00:32:23.337 line:90% position:50% align:center
The lesson for you
is really a lesson for us all:

00:32:23.337 --> 00:32:26.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
May we never forget what Jehovah remembers.

00:32:26.924 --> 00:32:30.093 line:90% position:50% align:center
And (while we’re at it)
may we also do our best

00:32:30.093 --> 00:32:33.722 line:90% position:50% align:center
not to remember what Jehovah forgets.

00:32:47.444 --> 00:32:51.448 line:90% position:50% align:center
We appreciate that warm reassurance.

00:32:52.199 --> 00:32:54.701 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, the next two speakers

00:32:54.701 --> 00:32:57.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
are members of the teaching staff.

00:32:57.496 --> 00:33:01.917 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Brother Clarke here
is the latest addition to the teaching staff.

00:33:01.917 --> 00:33:05.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was serving in Czechia,
the Czech Republic,

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:07.256 line:90% position:50% align:center
before he came here.

00:33:07.256 --> 00:33:08.966 line:90% position:50% align:center
I guess it was this year
—wasn’t it, Jeremy?—

00:33:08.966 --> 00:33:10.592 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you came here.

00:33:10.592 --> 00:33:15.472 line:90% position:50% align:center
Anyway, he’s going to speak to us
on the theme “May Jehovah Know.”

00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:22.729 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was buried with the kings,
but he was not a king.

00:33:22.729 --> 00:33:25.315 line:90% position:50% align:center
He lived 130 years,

00:33:25.315 --> 00:33:27.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
but perhaps
for the first 90 years of his life,

00:33:27.943 --> 00:33:31.280 line:90% position:50% align:center
there is nothing recorded that he achieved.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.907 line:90% position:50% align:center
And one major event that was recorded,

00:33:33.907 --> 00:33:38.912 line:90% position:50% align:center
he had to keep secret,
without others knowing, for about six years.

00:33:38.912 --> 00:33:41.039 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is this man?

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:43.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
High Priest Jehoiada.

00:33:43.542 --> 00:33:46.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
What does Jehovah
want you to know about him?

00:33:46.587 --> 00:33:50.507 line:90% position:50% align:center
It is this: Jehoiada was loyal to Jehovah,

00:33:50.507 --> 00:33:53.802 line:90% position:50% align:center
even without recognition from others.

00:33:53.802 --> 00:33:56.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
So the question to you is,

00:33:56.263 --> 00:33:59.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
If only Jehovah knows

00:33:59.266 --> 00:34:01.685 line:90% position:50% align:center
what you do and your loyalty

00:34:01.685 --> 00:34:04.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
without recognition from others,

00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:07.983 line:90% position:50% align:center
is that enough
to sustain you in your loyalty?

00:34:07.983 --> 00:34:11.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
For how long? a year? two?

00:34:11.653 --> 00:34:13.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
six? longer?

00:34:15.991 --> 00:34:18.619 line:90% position:50% align:center
Before you came to Gilead School,

00:34:18.619 --> 00:34:22.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
maybe it mattered more to you
what others saw in you,

00:34:22.497 --> 00:34:26.001 line:90% position:50% align:center
what they thought of you, your achievements.

00:34:26.001 --> 00:34:28.879 line:90% position:50% align:center
But in class, a deep study of the Scriptures

00:34:28.879 --> 00:34:31.173 line:90% position:50% align:center
opened up your heart;

00:34:31.173 --> 00:34:34.176 line:90% position:50% align:center
you looked at the attitudes
and feelings and thoughts,

00:34:34.176 --> 00:34:37.346 line:90% position:50% align:center
perhaps hidden there for a long time.

00:34:37.346 --> 00:34:42.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
You looked long and hard
at “the secret person of the heart . . . ,

00:34:42.351 --> 00:34:46.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
which is of great value in the eyes of God”
—the inner you.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.275 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this drew you closer to Jehovah.

00:34:50.275 --> 00:34:52.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
You felt his reassuring love.

00:34:52.361 --> 00:34:54.780 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now more than ever, you realize

00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:58.325 line:90% position:50% align:center
how much Jehovah sees you and knows you.

00:34:59.826 --> 00:35:03.956 line:90% position:50% align:center
Do you not have the same thoughts
as we find in Psalm 139?

00:35:05.582 --> 00:35:07.668 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read the first four verses.

00:35:11.546 --> 00:35:13.548 line:90% position:50% align:center
Psalm 139:

00:35:15.258 --> 00:35:19.513 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, you have searched through me,

00:35:19.513 --> 00:35:21.640 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and you know me.

00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:25.686 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You know when I sit down and when I rise up.

00:35:27.229 --> 00:35:29.564 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You discern my thoughts from afar.

00:35:29.564 --> 00:35:33.902 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You observe me when I travel

00:35:33.902 --> 00:35:38.073 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and when I lie down;
you are familiar with all my ways.

00:35:38.073 --> 00:35:40.075 line:90% position:50% align:center
“There is not a word on my tongue,

00:35:40.075 --> 00:35:43.787 line:90% position:50% align:center
but look! O Jehovah, you . . . know it well.”

00:35:47.165 --> 00:35:50.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
You have joy that Jehovah knows you.

00:35:50.544 --> 00:35:53.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
He always knew you,
but now you know that he knows you.

00:35:55.007 --> 00:35:57.426 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you feel more secure
in your relationship with him

00:35:57.426 --> 00:36:01.221 line:90% position:50% align:center
and less concerned
about recognition from others.

00:36:02.806 --> 00:36:05.434 line:90% position:50% align:center
This was High Priest Jehoiada.

00:36:07.728 --> 00:36:09.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, he was born some years

00:36:09.855 --> 00:36:14.401 line:90% position:50% align:center
after King Solomon’s temple
was completed in 1027 B.C.E.

00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:17.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means that in his lifetime,

00:36:17.529 --> 00:36:19.531 line:90% position:50% align:center
the nation of Israel split in two,

00:36:19.531 --> 00:36:22.951 line:90% position:50% align:center
leaving only the two-tribe kingdom
using the temple.

00:36:24.202 --> 00:36:29.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
He saw kings of Judah
introduce idolatry and sex worship.

00:36:29.082 --> 00:36:32.461 line:90% position:50% align:center
There were two good kings,
Asa and Jehoshaphat.

00:36:32.461 --> 00:36:35.255 line:90% position:50% align:center
But remember, Jehoshaphat had his son

00:36:35.255 --> 00:36:38.884 line:90% position:50% align:center
marry Jezebel’s daughter, Athaliah,
from the north,

00:36:38.884 --> 00:36:42.262 line:90% position:50% align:center
and brought her wicked influence
right into Jerusalem.

00:36:42.262 --> 00:36:45.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things were going from bad to worse.

00:36:46.558 --> 00:36:50.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in just 100 years,
the temple was so neglected

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:52.606 line:90% position:50% align:center
that it needed major repair

00:36:52.606 --> 00:36:55.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
just to be structurally sound again.

00:36:55.317 --> 00:36:58.153 line:90% position:50% align:center
Meanwhile,
they built a temple for Baal worship.

00:36:59.321 --> 00:37:00.947 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Jehoiada sees all this.

00:37:00.947 --> 00:37:03.825 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here he is an old man, the high priest.

00:37:03.825 --> 00:37:07.662 line:90% position:50% align:center
How did he keep his loyalty
through those distressing years?

00:37:08.747 --> 00:37:10.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
The Bible doesn’t say.

00:37:10.749 --> 00:37:12.751 line:90% position:50% align:center
But Jehovah knows it all.

00:37:14.586 --> 00:37:17.422 line:90% position:50% align:center
Through meditation and prayer,

00:37:17.422 --> 00:37:22.344 line:90% position:50% align:center
wouldn’t he have to look at his own heart
(his inner person)

00:37:22.344 --> 00:37:27.015 line:90% position:50% align:center
and look at his attitude
and his feelings toward pure worship

00:37:27.015 --> 00:37:31.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
(not becoming lax
in standing for what is right,

00:37:31.061 --> 00:37:34.773 line:90% position:50% align:center
unlike High Priest Eli when he got old)?

00:37:34.773 --> 00:37:37.400 line:90% position:50% align:center
And here Jehoiada is a man of authority.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:41.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yet, he doesn’t step outside
of the bounds of his assignment,

00:37:41.696 --> 00:37:44.449 line:90% position:50% align:center
but he patiently waits on Jehovah.

00:37:46.284 --> 00:37:49.663 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, these years of loyal love
helped him face

00:37:49.663 --> 00:37:52.082 line:90% position:50% align:center
the greatest challenge when he was old.

00:37:52.082 --> 00:37:56.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And this he had to do without others knowing.

00:37:56.211 --> 00:37:57.504 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was that?

00:37:58.588 --> 00:38:01.675 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, it’s around 905 B.C.E.,

00:38:01.675 --> 00:38:04.845 line:90% position:50% align:center
and let’s pick up the account
in 2 Chronicles chapter 22.

00:38:08.932 --> 00:38:12.602 line:90% position:50% align:center
Here we find King Ahaziah of Judah has died,

00:38:12.602 --> 00:38:16.982 line:90% position:50% align:center
and then the unimaginable happens.

00:38:16.982 --> 00:38:20.485 line:90% position:50% align:center
In 2 Chronicles chapter 22,
we’ll start at verse 10:

00:38:22.696 --> 00:38:25.740 line:90% position:50% align:center
“When Athaliah, Ahaziah’s mother,

00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.034 line:90% position:50% align:center
“saw that her son had died,

00:38:28.034 --> 00:38:32.706 line:90% position:50% align:center
“she rose up and destroyed
the entire royal line

00:38:32.706 --> 00:38:34.708 line:90% position:50% align:center
of the house of Judah.”

00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:38.587 line:90% position:50% align:center
Athaliah kills her own grandsons

00:38:38.587 --> 00:38:41.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
and makes herself queen illegally.

00:38:41.047 --> 00:38:43.925 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now the Davidic line
to the promised offspring

00:38:43.925 --> 00:38:46.553 line:90% position:50% align:center
is at risk of being cut off.

00:38:46.553 --> 00:38:49.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verse 11: “However,

00:38:49.514 --> 00:38:52.184 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Jehoshabeath the daughter of the king

00:38:52.184 --> 00:38:55.270 line:90% position:50% align:center
“took Jehoash the son of Ahaziah

00:38:55.270 --> 00:39:00.025 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and stole him away from among the sons
of the king who were to be put to death,

00:39:00.025 --> 00:39:03.653 line:90% position:50% align:center
and she put him
and his nurse in an inner bedroom.”

00:39:03.653 --> 00:39:05.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
Who is Jehoshabeath?

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
Read on.

00:39:06.656 --> 00:39:08.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s “the daughter of King Jehoram

00:39:08.617 --> 00:39:11.578 line:90% position:50% align:center
“(she was the wife of Jehoiada the priest

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:15.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the sister of Ahaziah).”

00:39:16.666 --> 00:39:19.920 line:90% position:50% align:center
And she “managed to keep him [the baby]

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:24.341 line:90% position:50% align:center
“concealed from Athaliah,
so that she did not put him to death.

00:39:24.341 --> 00:39:26.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
“He remained with him for six years,

00:39:26.343 --> 00:39:30.430 line:90% position:50% align:center
hidden at the house of the true God,
while Athaliah was ruling over the land.”

00:39:31.806 --> 00:39:35.894 line:90% position:50% align:center
For six long years, Jehoiada,
Jehoshabeath, and a nurse

00:39:35.894 --> 00:39:40.023 line:90% position:50% align:center
had a big secret—a small baby—
the last living heir.

00:39:41.024 --> 00:39:44.861 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, it’s possible that this inner bedroom

00:39:46.238 --> 00:39:49.866 line:90% position:50% align:center
could have been a storage room at the palace.

00:39:49.866 --> 00:39:52.452 line:90% position:50% align:center
And when it was safe, they smuggled the baby

00:39:52.452 --> 00:39:54.913 line:90% position:50% align:center
into a chamber in the temple.

00:39:54.913 --> 00:39:57.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that happened, imagine the risk.

00:39:57.749 --> 00:40:02.254 line:90% position:50% align:center
The timing would have had to be perfect
so they wouldn’t get caught.

00:40:02.254 --> 00:40:06.424 line:90% position:50% align:center
And in the temple for six years,
do you think there were some close calls?

00:40:07.926 --> 00:40:10.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, at one point, Athaliah’s own sons

00:40:10.303 --> 00:40:13.556 line:90% position:50% align:center
broke into the temple
and stole items for Baal worship.

00:40:13.556 --> 00:40:15.725 line:90% position:50% align:center
If that happened during this period,

00:40:15.725 --> 00:40:19.020 line:90% position:50% align:center
imagine if they had seen the child—game over!

00:40:20.647 --> 00:40:25.277 line:90% position:50% align:center
This means that not once could Jehoiada
or Jehoshabeath let out their secret.

00:40:25.277 --> 00:40:27.529 line:90% position:50% align:center
They couldn’t complain to others.

00:40:27.529 --> 00:40:29.239 line:90% position:50% align:center
They couldn’t give up.

00:40:29.239 --> 00:40:31.616 line:90% position:50% align:center
They couldn’t give out.

00:40:31.616 --> 00:40:35.078 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means they had no recognition,

00:40:35.078 --> 00:40:38.581 line:90% position:50% align:center
no acknowledgment,
no appreciation for their effort.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.836 line:90% position:50% align:center
That means they’d rely on prayer,

00:40:42.836 --> 00:40:45.338 line:90% position:50% align:center
looking to only Jehovah

00:40:45.338 --> 00:40:48.300 line:90% position:50% align:center
for support and reassurance.

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:51.136 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would look to the Scriptures,
like Psalm 139.

00:40:51.136 --> 00:40:53.263 line:90% position:50% align:center
“O Jehovah, . . . you know me.”

00:40:53.263 --> 00:40:55.598 line:90% position:50% align:center
You can hear them
adapt it to their situation:

00:40:55.598 --> 00:40:58.393 line:90% position:50% align:center
“You know that we’re
protecting the rightful king.”

00:40:59.853 --> 00:41:01.855 line:90% position:50% align:center
And they’re
not just babysitting for six years;

00:41:01.855 --> 00:41:04.107 line:90% position:50% align:center
they’re teaching the child to love Jehovah,

00:41:04.107 --> 00:41:06.735 line:90% position:50% align:center
to love His Law, to be a good king for Judah.

00:41:08.695 --> 00:41:11.656 line:90% position:50% align:center
They would have to work unitedly as a couple.

00:41:13.533 --> 00:41:15.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that brings us to her.

00:41:15.327 --> 00:41:18.121 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s talk about her for a moment
—Jehoshabeath.

00:41:18.121 --> 00:41:20.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
Clearly, Jehovah gives her the credit

00:41:20.582 --> 00:41:23.585 line:90% position:50% align:center
for saving her nephew, Jehoash.

00:41:23.585 --> 00:41:26.421 line:90% position:50% align:center
But at this point, how old is she?

00:41:26.421 --> 00:41:28.715 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, her father, King Jehoram,

00:41:28.715 --> 00:41:32.635 line:90% position:50% align:center
who died the year before,
was only 40 years old.

00:41:34.095 --> 00:41:36.473 line:90% position:50% align:center
So she is still quite young

00:41:36.473 --> 00:41:41.144 line:90% position:50% align:center
and, yet, married to a man
some decades older than she was.

00:41:41.144 --> 00:41:44.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here we have a young woman who is royalty

00:41:44.856 --> 00:41:48.943 line:90% position:50% align:center
married to a much older man
who has a position of high rank.

00:41:48.943 --> 00:41:50.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
What’s her angle?

00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.614 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is she abusing her authority?

00:41:52.614 --> 00:41:57.035 line:90% position:50% align:center
Is she trying to manipulate things
like her stepmother, Athaliah?

00:41:57.035 --> 00:41:57.869 line:90% position:50% align:center
No.

00:41:57.869 --> 00:42:02.123 line:90% position:50% align:center
She’s risking her life
to protect the rightful king

00:42:02.123 --> 00:42:05.168 line:90% position:50% align:center
(in line with Jehovah’s will),
supporting her husband

00:42:05.168 --> 00:42:08.588 line:90% position:50% align:center
and apparently
without recognition from others.

00:42:10.924 --> 00:42:13.551 line:90% position:50% align:center
She reminds us of you, dear sisters.

00:42:14.803 --> 00:42:17.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
Much of what you achieve

00:42:17.013 --> 00:42:20.934 line:90% position:50% align:center
may not be as noticeable
as your husband’s achievements.

00:42:20.934 --> 00:42:23.645 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that could just be
the nature of the assignment,

00:42:24.646 --> 00:42:26.731 line:90% position:50% align:center
which means you may get less attention.

00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:30.235 line:90% position:50% align:center
But you take pleasure

00:42:30.235 --> 00:42:33.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
in that Jehovah knows
all that you do for him.

00:42:33.530 --> 00:42:35.532 line:90% position:50% align:center
And we love you for that.

00:42:37.158 --> 00:42:39.285 line:90% position:50% align:center
So, you brothers,

00:42:39.285 --> 00:42:41.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
many things you do will be noticed.

00:42:42.914 --> 00:42:47.794 line:90% position:50% align:center
There may be some things where you won’t
get recognition, perhaps for a long time.

00:42:48.962 --> 00:42:53.007 line:90% position:50% align:center
And by the way,
it’s not wrong to get recognition.

00:42:53.633 --> 00:42:56.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
As humans, we thrive on it.

00:42:56.511 --> 00:42:59.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if you’re ever in a position
where you can recognize

00:42:59.514 --> 00:43:03.017 line:90% position:50% align:center
the good work or loyalty of someone else,
don’t pass it up.

00:43:03.017 --> 00:43:04.519 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let them know.

00:43:04.519 --> 00:43:06.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
They’d appreciate it.

00:43:06.521 --> 00:43:08.815 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, your loyalty

00:43:08.815 --> 00:43:12.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
is based
not on what others will see and know

00:43:12.193 --> 00:43:16.072 line:90% position:50% align:center
but on the unseen, loyalty from the heart.

00:43:17.407 --> 00:43:19.742 line:90% position:50% align:center
Remember Jehoiada.

00:43:19.742 --> 00:43:23.872 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes, eventually everybody found out
what he did, and he got honor.

00:43:23.872 --> 00:43:27.167 line:90% position:50% align:center
But what was the secret to his success?

00:43:27.167 --> 00:43:29.294 line:90% position:50% align:center
Was it not in the years before

00:43:29.294 --> 00:43:31.296 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the small things, the hidden things,

00:43:31.296 --> 00:43:34.466 line:90% position:50% align:center
the unseen things only Jehovah knows?

00:43:36.092 --> 00:43:38.219 line:90% position:50% align:center
The name Jehoiada means

00:43:38.219 --> 00:43:41.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
“May Jehovah Know”
—how fitting!

00:43:41.723 --> 00:43:45.351 line:90% position:50% align:center
May Jehovah know all your loyal acts

00:43:45.351 --> 00:43:47.353 line:90% position:50% align:center
—seen and unseen—

00:43:47.353 --> 00:43:51.024 line:90% position:50% align:center
and “your Father who looks on in secret
will repay you.”

00:44:04.537 --> 00:44:08.041 line:90% position:50% align:center
That certainly brought
Jehoiada to life, didn’t it?

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:13.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, Mark Noumair usually
has something very interesting to say.

00:44:14.589 --> 00:44:17.759 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today—
No pressure.

00:44:19.052 --> 00:44:23.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
Today he’s going to talk to us
on the subject “Side by Side.”

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:32.273 line:90% position:50% align:center
We don’t know her name,
but we know her husband.

00:44:32.273 --> 00:44:36.194 line:90% position:50% align:center
He was a hardworking fisherman,
outspoken apostle,

00:44:36.194 --> 00:44:38.029 line:90% position:50% align:center
writer of two Bible books,

00:44:38.029 --> 00:44:41.491 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the only person besides Jesus
to walk on water.

00:44:41.491 --> 00:44:43.993 line:90% position:50% align:center
We know Peter,

00:44:43.993 --> 00:44:46.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
but sometimes we forget his wife.

00:44:47.247 --> 00:44:49.582 line:90% position:50% align:center
What was Peter’s wife like?

00:44:49.582 --> 00:44:52.544 line:90% position:50% align:center
What were they like as a married couple?

00:44:52.544 --> 00:44:56.589 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what can they teach
you 24 married couples?

00:44:56.589 --> 00:44:58.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
This is the first time in close to a decade

00:44:58.758 --> 00:45:03.054 line:90% position:50% align:center
we’ve had an entire class
of only married couples.

00:45:03.054 --> 00:45:06.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Thus, we’ve chosen Peter and his wife

00:45:06.266 --> 00:45:10.812 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that you can learn specific lessons

00:45:10.812 --> 00:45:15.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
that you can bring
to your places of assignment

00:45:15.358 --> 00:45:17.694 line:90% position:50% align:center
but especially to strengthen your marriages

00:45:17.694 --> 00:45:22.615 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you apply this
and you serve together side by side.

00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:28.496 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s begin by reading Mark chapter 1

00:45:28.496 --> 00:45:32.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
—Mark 1:16:

00:45:34.168 --> 00:45:36.379 line:90% position:50% align:center
“While walking alongside the Sea of Galilee,

00:45:36.379 --> 00:45:38.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
“he saw Simon [that’s Jesus saw Simon]

00:45:38.756 --> 00:45:43.011 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and Simon’s brother Andrew casting
their nets into the sea,

00:45:43.011 --> 00:45:45.013 line:90% position:50% align:center
for they were fishermen.”

00:45:46.139 --> 00:45:48.266 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter is a fisherman.

00:45:48.266 --> 00:45:50.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
He brings home the fish.

00:45:50.435 --> 00:45:52.604 line:90% position:50% align:center
His wife cooks the fish.

00:45:52.604 --> 00:45:55.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
And if she doesn’t cook the fish,
she sells the fish

00:45:55.356 --> 00:45:59.569 line:90% position:50% align:center
(like “a capable [Proverbs 31] wife”)
and brings home the money.

00:45:59.569 --> 00:46:01.696 line:90% position:50% align:center
That helps support the house.

00:46:01.696 --> 00:46:05.450 line:90% position:50% align:center
It allows Peter
to handle his responsibilities.

00:46:05.450 --> 00:46:08.328 line:90% position:50% align:center
All is well, a great couple

00:46:08.328 --> 00:46:10.955 line:90% position:50% align:center
working side by side together.

00:46:10.955 --> 00:46:14.542 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, life changes suddenly

00:46:16.002 --> 00:46:18.004 line:90% position:50% align:center
—verses 17 and 18:

00:46:19.005 --> 00:46:21.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
“So Jesus said to them:
‘Come after me,

00:46:21.674 --> 00:46:23.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
“and I will make you fishers of men.’

00:46:23.968 --> 00:46:27.889 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at once
they abandoned their nets and followed him.”

00:46:29.265 --> 00:46:33.561 line:90% position:50% align:center
In faith, Peter abandons his fishing business

00:46:33.561 --> 00:46:35.563 line:90% position:50% align:center
and follows Jesus.

00:46:35.563 --> 00:46:37.649 line:90% position:50% align:center
What did she think about that?

00:46:37.649 --> 00:46:39.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did she expect that?

00:46:39.776 --> 00:46:43.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
Did she become insecure
and uncertain now about the future?

00:46:45.031 --> 00:46:48.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would she feel that her life now
has been upended

00:46:48.743 --> 00:46:51.788 line:90% position:50% align:center
by the decisions
of her impulsive, big-hearted husband?

00:46:51.788 --> 00:46:53.790 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Peter!
What are you doing?”

00:46:55.375 --> 00:46:58.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
We have very good reason to conclude

00:46:58.795 --> 00:47:02.674 line:90% position:50% align:center
that Peter’s wife supported the decision,

00:47:02.674 --> 00:47:07.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
willing to and ready
to stand right at Peter’s side

00:47:07.095 --> 00:47:11.432 line:90% position:50% align:center
as he took on added responsibilities.

00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:17.438 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s gain more insight
into the life of Peter and his wife

00:47:17.438 --> 00:47:19.440 line:90% position:50% align:center
with verse 29:

00:47:20.983 --> 00:47:23.069 line:90% position:50% align:center
“At that they left the synagogue and went

00:47:23.069 --> 00:47:26.948 line:90% position:50% align:center
“to the home of Simon and Andrew

00:47:26.948 --> 00:47:28.950 line:90% position:50% align:center
with James and John.”

00:47:29.784 --> 00:47:34.330 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, this verse explains that they went
to the home of Simon and Andrew.

00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:35.873 line:90% position:50% align:center
They lived together.

00:47:36.874 --> 00:47:41.170 line:90% position:50% align:center
So Peter’s wife was agreeable
to sharing her living space

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:45.299 line:90% position:50% align:center
with Andrew, Peter’s brother.

00:47:45.299 --> 00:47:49.303 line:90% position:50% align:center
And likely the close friends of Peter,

00:47:49.303 --> 00:47:53.099 line:90% position:50% align:center
James and John, were frequent guests.

00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:57.061 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you can hear Peter saying,
“Come over anytime.”

00:47:57.061 --> 00:48:00.022 line:90% position:50% align:center
And his wife does the cooking.

00:48:00.022 --> 00:48:02.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the way it would work.

00:48:02.483 --> 00:48:05.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
She could most likely hear
the “Sons of Thunder” coming.

00:48:05.570 --> 00:48:06.988 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Here they come.”

00:48:08.489 --> 00:48:11.617 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Peter says: “That’s them.

00:48:11.617 --> 00:48:14.203 line:90% position:50% align:center
Cook more fish!”

00:48:14.203 --> 00:48:17.749 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s the way it probably would be.

00:48:17.749 --> 00:48:22.003 line:90% position:50% align:center
But here’s the question,
Why could Peter feel free

00:48:22.003 --> 00:48:24.172 line:90% position:50% align:center
to bring his friends home

00:48:24.172 --> 00:48:28.301 line:90% position:50% align:center
(and sometimes most likely
they came in an unexpected manner)?

00:48:30.344 --> 00:48:34.348 line:90% position:50% align:center
Because he knew his wife.

00:48:34.348 --> 00:48:37.143 line:90% position:50% align:center
And interestingly,
when he wrote his first letter,

00:48:37.143 --> 00:48:41.189 line:90% position:50% align:center
he advised husbands to dwell with their wives

00:48:41.189 --> 00:48:44.358 line:90% position:50% align:center
“according to knowledge.”

00:48:44.358 --> 00:48:47.570 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter knew his wife.

00:48:47.570 --> 00:48:51.282 line:90% position:50% align:center
And he knew that she would be willing
to accommodate the guests

00:48:51.282 --> 00:48:55.495 line:90% position:50% align:center
because she knew her husband.

00:48:55.495 --> 00:48:58.206 line:90% position:50% align:center
“That’s Peter: ‘Come on over.’”

00:48:59.749 --> 00:49:02.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
She and Peter were a team.

00:49:02.502 --> 00:49:07.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
She knew that having them in the home
involved some inconvenience.

00:49:07.048 --> 00:49:09.258 line:90% position:50% align:center
We get that.

00:49:09.258 --> 00:49:11.719 line:90% position:50% align:center
But think of the conversations

00:49:11.719 --> 00:49:13.721 line:90% position:50% align:center
that she would be privy to.

00:49:13.721 --> 00:49:15.723 line:90% position:50% align:center
As Peter, Andrew, James, and John

00:49:15.723 --> 00:49:18.059 line:90% position:50% align:center
would discuss Jesus’ ministry,
she would sit there: 

00:49:18.059 --> 00:49:20.895 line:90% position:50% align:center
‘Oh, my! I’m so glad they came’

00:49:20.895 --> 00:49:25.441 line:90% position:50% align:center
—the blessing that she would get
as they talked about Jesus’ ministry!

00:49:25.441 --> 00:49:28.236 line:90% position:50% align:center
So here’s your first big lesson:

00:49:28.236 --> 00:49:31.447 line:90% position:50% align:center
Something very similar
can happen to you as a couple.

00:49:32.615 --> 00:49:35.535 line:90% position:50% align:center
Your husband’s good shepherding

00:49:35.535 --> 00:49:39.163 line:90% position:50% align:center
will result in warm conversations,

00:49:39.163 --> 00:49:43.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
and strong friendships are forged.

00:49:43.417 --> 00:49:48.381 line:90% position:50% align:center
And that could lead
to spontaneous invitations,

00:49:48.381 --> 00:49:52.677 line:90% position:50% align:center
like, “Say, come on over for a snack.”

00:49:52.677 --> 00:49:55.555 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you get a text,
“Guess who’s coming to dinner?”

00:49:56.639 --> 00:49:59.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
But is it inconvenient at times?

00:49:59.976 --> 00:50:01.269 line:90% position:50% align:center
Yes.

00:50:01.269 --> 00:50:03.521 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is a Bible principle,

00:50:03.521 --> 00:50:08.317 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Bible principle here
overrides all cultures, past and present:

00:50:08.317 --> 00:50:11.445 line:90% position:50% align:center
Be self-sacrificing and hospitable.

00:50:13.072 --> 00:50:15.199 line:90% position:50% align:center
So be like Peter and his wife,

00:50:16.117 --> 00:50:19.954 line:90% position:50% align:center
and think of the spiritual blessings
you would receive

00:50:19.954 --> 00:50:23.040 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you get to know
your brothers and sisters better.

00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:27.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
That overrides even the inconvenience.

00:50:28.796 --> 00:50:31.048 line:90% position:50% align:center
But the self-sacrificing spirit

00:50:31.048 --> 00:50:34.343 line:90% position:50% align:center
of this dynamic couple doesn’t stop there.

00:50:34.343 --> 00:50:36.345 line:90% position:50% align:center
Let’s read verse 30:

00:50:37.972 --> 00:50:41.392 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Now Simon’s mother-in-law
was lying down sick with a fever,

00:50:41.392 --> 00:50:45.938 line:90% position:50% align:center
and they at once told him [Jesus] about her.”

00:50:47.231 --> 00:50:51.193 line:90% position:50% align:center
So now we learn that Peter and his wife
are caring for a parent.

00:50:51.861 --> 00:50:54.655 line:90% position:50% align:center
And at this moment, she is sick.

00:50:54.655 --> 00:50:57.575 line:90% position:50% align:center
Now, what demands that places
on a married couple

00:50:57.575 --> 00:51:01.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
—you know that—
caring for a sick parent!

00:51:01.454 --> 00:51:06.334 line:90% position:50% align:center
And for a married couple to live
with one in-law naturally has its challenges.

00:51:06.334 --> 00:51:10.129 line:90% position:50% align:center
But living with a brother-in-law
and a mother-in-law,

00:51:10.129 --> 00:51:13.382 line:90% position:50% align:center
now, that brings it to an entirely new level.

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:18.804 line:90% position:50% align:center
Can you hear Peter’s wife
whispering to Peter,

00:51:18.804 --> 00:51:21.515 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Your brother Andrew is driving me crazy”

00:51:22.892 --> 00:51:26.562 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Peter being tempted to blurt out,
“But what about your mother”?

00:51:26.562 --> 00:51:30.274 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, but we’re not saying that ever happened.

00:51:32.401 --> 00:51:34.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
Nevertheless

00:51:34.904 --> 00:51:37.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
—nevertheless—
we know that living with in-laws

00:51:37.657 --> 00:51:39.659 line:90% position:50% align:center
and caring for aging parents

00:51:39.659 --> 00:51:43.287 line:90% position:50% align:center
poses unique challenges for a couple.

00:51:43.287 --> 00:51:45.998 line:90% position:50% align:center
That would require great sacrifices.

00:51:45.998 --> 00:51:48.417 line:90% position:50% align:center
That’s what we’re talking about.

00:51:48.417 --> 00:51:53.047 line:90% position:50% align:center
However, with sacrifices come blessings,

00:51:53.047 --> 00:51:55.758 line:90% position:50% align:center
just as we’ve discussed
over and over in class:

00:51:55.758 --> 00:51:58.678 line:90% position:50% align:center
With a sacrifice comes a blessing.

00:51:58.678 --> 00:52:00.888 line:90% position:50% align:center
In verse 31,

00:52:00.888 --> 00:52:04.016 line:90% position:50% align:center
Jesus performs a miracle right in the home.

00:52:04.016 --> 00:52:05.518 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom is cured.

00:52:05.518 --> 00:52:06.978 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine that!

00:52:06.978 --> 00:52:08.187 line:90% position:50% align:center
Mom is cured.

00:52:08.187 --> 00:52:12.608 line:90% position:50% align:center
What a tender, intimate moment
this must have been for Peter and his wife!

00:52:12.608 --> 00:52:13.609 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Thank Jehovah.”

00:52:13.609 --> 00:52:17.697 line:90% position:50% align:center
They probably said
a heartfelt prayer thanking Jehovah

00:52:17.697 --> 00:52:21.033 line:90% position:50% align:center
—intimate, quiet, prayerful.

00:52:22.410 --> 00:52:26.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
But look at what happens next
in verses 32 and 33:

00:52:27.957 --> 00:52:30.501 line:90% position:50% align:center
“After evening had fallen,
when the sun had set,

00:52:30.501 --> 00:52:34.463 line:90% position:50% align:center
“the people began bringing to him
all who were ill and demon possessed;

00:52:34.463 --> 00:52:38.968 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the whole city
was gathered right at the door.”

00:52:38.968 --> 00:52:41.095 line:90% position:50% align:center
Where is the intimacy now?

00:52:41.095 --> 00:52:43.514 line:90% position:50% align:center
It went from quiet to chaos.

00:52:43.514 --> 00:52:46.809 line:90% position:50% align:center
Imagine the scene: Sick people from all over

00:52:46.809 --> 00:52:49.228 line:90% position:50% align:center
come to Peter’s house to get healed.

00:52:49.228 --> 00:52:51.480 line:90% position:50% align:center
How would you feel if a whole city

00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.734 line:90% position:50% align:center
of sick and demon-possessed people
showed up at your door?

00:52:56.736 --> 00:52:58.863 line:90% position:50% align:center
Talk about uninvited guests!

00:52:58.863 --> 00:53:01.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Peter’s wife didn’t have time to prepare

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:03.409 line:90% position:50% align:center
and plan and make the house perfect.

00:53:03.409 --> 00:53:05.411 line:90% position:50% align:center
“No, not yet.
The table is not right.

00:53:05.411 --> 00:53:06.454 line:90% position:50% align:center
The chairs aren’t right.”

00:53:06.454 --> 00:53:08.080 line:90% position:50% align:center
No, that wasn’t it.

00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.166 line:90% position:50% align:center
Things weren’t perfect.

00:53:10.166 --> 00:53:14.211 line:90% position:50% align:center
And what if a crowd that size
damaged the home,

00:53:14.211 --> 00:53:17.339 line:90% position:50% align:center
like the desperate Jews
who on a later occasion

00:53:17.339 --> 00:53:20.718 line:90% position:50% align:center
made a hole in someone’s roof
to drop down someone

00:53:20.718 --> 00:53:22.720 line:90% position:50% align:center
so that they could be healed?

00:53:25.264 --> 00:53:29.226 line:90% position:50% align:center
At this point, Peter’s wife
certainly could have complained,

00:53:29.226 --> 00:53:31.479 line:90% position:50% align:center
“Get these people out of here!”

00:53:31.479 --> 00:53:34.356 line:90% position:50% align:center
But there is no record of a complaint.

00:53:36.108 --> 00:53:39.361 line:90% position:50% align:center
Consider this: Years later,

00:53:39.361 --> 00:53:43.657 line:90% position:50% align:center
when Peter counseled wives
to cultivate “the quiet and mild spirit,”

00:53:45.201 --> 00:53:47.244 line:90% position:50% align:center
did his wife’s example

00:53:47.244 --> 00:53:50.831 line:90% position:50% align:center
give him the freedom of speech
to offer that advice?

00:53:52.083 --> 00:53:55.878 line:90% position:50% align:center
And Peter must have thanked his wife
—thanked her—

00:53:55.878 --> 00:53:58.881 line:90% position:50% align:center
for her loyally being by his side

00:53:58.881 --> 00:54:03.511 line:90% position:50% align:center
as they supported Jesus’ ministry.

00:54:04.386 --> 00:54:06.806 line:90% position:50% align:center
Another big lesson for you:

00:54:06.806 --> 00:54:10.267 line:90% position:50% align:center
As you deal with aging parents
and health issues,

00:54:10.267 --> 00:54:12.603 line:90% position:50% align:center
look for Jehovah’s blessing

00:54:12.603 --> 00:54:15.981 line:90% position:50% align:center
and enjoy your periods of calm.

00:54:15.981 --> 00:54:18.901 line:90% position:50% align:center
However,
remember that we are living at a time

00:54:18.901 --> 00:54:22.613 line:90% position:50% align:center
when ‘the scene of the world is changing,’
and it can change quickly.

00:54:22.613 --> 00:54:25.241 line:90% position:50% align:center
A natural disaster or civil unrest

00:54:25.241 --> 00:54:27.910 line:90% position:50% align:center
can break out unexpectedly.

00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:31.038 line:90% position:50% align:center
And you might have
to accommodate those seeking aid.

00:54:31.038 --> 00:54:33.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
And though you might not be ready for that

00:54:33.541 --> 00:54:37.795 line:90% position:50% align:center
(things aren’t perfect),
don’t worry about that.

00:54:37.795 --> 00:54:40.131 line:90% position:50% align:center
But allow your self-sacrificing spirit

00:54:40.131 --> 00:54:43.175 line:90% position:50% align:center
to just move forward,

00:54:43.175 --> 00:54:45.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
going the extra mile.

00:54:45.636 --> 00:54:50.307 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, husbands,
don’t forget to thank your wife

00:54:50.307 --> 00:54:53.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
for being by your side

00:54:53.477 --> 00:54:57.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you respond
to the needs of the organization.

00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.278 line:90% position:50% align:center
First Corinthians 9:5

00:55:02.278 --> 00:55:04.530 line:90% position:50% align:center
indicates that Peter’s wife traveled with him

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:07.324 line:90% position:50% align:center
for at least some of the time.

00:55:07.324 --> 00:55:11.162 line:90% position:50% align:center
Traveling with Peter
would have included hard trips

00:55:11.162 --> 00:55:13.664 line:90% position:50% align:center
and dangerous conditions.

00:55:13.664 --> 00:55:15.666 line:90% position:50% align:center
Peter was arrested in Jerusalem

00:55:15.666 --> 00:55:18.752 line:90% position:50% align:center
one time, two times, three times,
arrested again, flogged.

00:55:18.752 --> 00:55:21.130 line:90% position:50% align:center
This time, James was arrested with him.

00:55:21.130 --> 00:55:22.756 line:90% position:50% align:center
James is beheaded.

00:55:22.756 --> 00:55:26.260 line:90% position:50% align:center
Would Peter’s wife say,
“Will I see my husband again”?

00:55:27.261 --> 00:55:29.597 line:90% position:50% align:center
It could not have been easy

00:55:29.597 --> 00:55:33.475 line:90% position:50% align:center
to be married to a man
so involved in sacred service.

00:55:35.769 --> 00:55:39.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
Between the years 62 and 64 C.E.,

00:55:39.481 --> 00:55:43.652 line:90% position:50% align:center
we find Peter,
who is now perhaps in his 60’s,

00:55:43.652 --> 00:55:46.739 line:90% position:50% align:center
serving where the need is greater in Babylon,

00:55:46.739 --> 00:55:51.493 line:90% position:50% align:center
where Jehovah
inspired him to write two letters.

00:55:51.493 --> 00:55:54.371 line:90% position:50% align:center
As he is finishing his second letter

00:55:54.371 --> 00:55:57.458 line:90% position:50% align:center
in what now would become
the twilight of his life,

00:55:59.084 --> 00:56:03.839 line:90% position:50% align:center
how thankful he must have been

00:56:03.839 --> 00:56:06.008 line:90% position:50% align:center
to have had such a faithful,

00:56:06.008 --> 00:56:10.596 line:90% position:50% align:center
loving, loyal wife
by his side over the years!

00:56:12.598 --> 00:56:16.477 line:90% position:50% align:center
All things considered, here’s the gold:

00:56:16.477 --> 00:56:19.063 line:90% position:50% align:center
Work unselfishly as a team;

00:56:19.063 --> 00:56:23.776 line:90% position:50% align:center
be positive when confronted
with unexpected challenges.

00:56:23.776 --> 00:56:28.030 line:90% position:50% align:center
Husbands, highly value
the loyal support of your wife

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:30.032 line:90% position:50% align:center
and thank her.

00:56:30.032 --> 00:56:34.036 line:90% position:50% align:center
Wives, realize
that after Jehovah and Jesus,

00:56:34.036 --> 00:56:37.289 line:90% position:50% align:center
you—you—are probably the closest person

00:56:37.289 --> 00:56:39.541 line:90% position:50% align:center
who can work intimately with your husband

00:56:39.541 --> 00:56:43.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
for his success and, of course, your own.

00:56:43.545 --> 00:56:46.465 line:90% position:50% align:center
And, for you 24 dear couples,

00:56:46.465 --> 00:56:50.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
be determined to maintain your stride

00:56:50.636 --> 00:56:54.056 line:90% position:50% align:center
as you serve together side by side.

00:57:12.157 --> 00:57:14.743 line:90% position:50% align:center
Well, that was very enjoyable, wasn’t it?

00:57:15.577 --> 00:57:18.372 line:90% position:50% align:center
We hope you enjoyed Part 1!

00:57:18.372 --> 00:57:20.624 line:90% position:50% align:center
Parts 2 and 3 will be available

00:57:20.624 --> 00:57:23.502 line:90% position:50% align:center
on jw.org later this month.

00:57:24.712 --> 00:57:28.090 line:90% position:50% align:center
Our postcard for this month is from Uruguay.

00:57:28.716 --> 00:57:31.844 line:90% position:50% align:center
Located between Argentina and Brazil,

00:57:31.844 --> 00:57:34.638 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uruguay has beautiful coastlines

00:57:34.638 --> 00:57:36.098 line:90% position:50% align:center
along the Atlantic Ocean

00:57:36.098 --> 00:57:38.976 line:90% position:50% align:center
and rolling hills in its interior.

00:57:38.976 --> 00:57:42.062 line:90% position:50% align:center
The pristine beaches of Punta del Este

00:57:42.062 --> 00:57:44.481 line:90% position:50% align:center
are a popular tourist destination.

00:57:45.899 --> 00:57:48.944 line:90% position:50% align:center
Several rivers in the country,
such as the Rio Negro

00:57:48.944 --> 00:57:53.240 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the Río de la Plata,
create stunning landscapes

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.576 line:90% position:50% align:center
and make the soil fertile.

00:57:55.576 --> 00:57:57.828 line:90% position:50% align:center
These breathtaking views

00:57:57.828 --> 00:58:01.707 line:90% position:50% align:center
provide a picturesque backdrop
for preaching the good news.

00:58:02.458 --> 00:58:06.545 line:90% position:50% align:center
Uruguay currently has 149 congregations

00:58:06.545 --> 00:58:08.964 line:90% position:50% align:center
preaching in five different languages,

00:58:08.964 --> 00:58:11.800 line:90% position:50% align:center
including Uruguayan Sign Language

00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:14.636 line:90% position:50% align:center
and Portuñol, a pidgin language

00:58:14.636 --> 00:58:18.349 line:90% position:50% align:center
composed of Spanish and Portuguese.

00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:21.435 line:90% position:50% align:center
Like the fertile,
productive fields where they preach,

00:58:21.435 --> 00:58:23.979 line:90% position:50% align:center
the harvest in the ministry is great,

00:58:23.979 --> 00:58:25.856 line:90% position:50% align:center
as the 12,000 publishers

00:58:25.856 --> 00:58:30.110 line:90% position:50% align:center
average 11,000 Bible studies per month!

00:58:30.110 --> 00:58:32.237 line:90% position:50% align:center
In the 1960’s,

00:58:32.237 --> 00:58:35.824 line:90% position:50% align:center
missionaries used rafts
to traverse the Cebollatí River

00:58:35.824 --> 00:58:38.327 line:90% position:50% align:center
in order to reach remote territories,

00:58:38.327 --> 00:58:41.497 line:90% position:50% align:center
and the tradition continues to this day.

00:58:41.497 --> 00:58:44.208 line:90% position:50% align:center
Trucks loaded with carts

00:58:44.208 --> 00:58:47.044 line:90% position:50% align:center
are ferried across the river
so that publishers can witness

00:58:47.044 --> 00:58:49.797 line:90% position:50% align:center
in the local town squares.

00:58:49.797 --> 00:58:51.924 line:90% position:50% align:center
After a long day of preaching,

00:58:51.924 --> 00:58:55.594 line:90% position:50% align:center
brothers and sisters
enjoy relaxing around campfires,

00:58:55.594 --> 00:58:58.389 line:90% position:50% align:center
singing, and enjoying maté

00:58:58.389 --> 00:59:01.850 line:90% position:50% align:center
—a traditional herbal drink
made with yerba

00:59:01.850 --> 00:59:04.937 line:90% position:50% align:center
that pairs well
with tortas fritas, or fried cakes.

00:59:05.687 --> 00:59:09.483 line:90% position:50% align:center
The 30 publishers
of the Cebollatí Congregation

00:59:09.483 --> 00:59:12.111 line:90% position:50% align:center
and all the brothers and sisters in Uruguay

00:59:12.111 --> 00:59:15.906 line:90% position:50% align:center
send their love and greetings
to the worldwide brotherhood.

00:59:16.949 --> 00:59:19.618 line:90% position:50% align:center
From the World Headquarters
of Jehovah’s Witnesses,

00:59:19.618 --> 00:59:22.037 line:90% position:50% align:center
this is JW Broadcasting.
