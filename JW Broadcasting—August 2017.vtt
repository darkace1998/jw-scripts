00:01.383 --> 00:04.486
Welcome to JW Broadcasting. 


00:04.487 --> 00:09.225
We have some encouraging things 
to look forward to in this month’s program. 


00:09.225 --> 00:13.697
We’ll hear the experiences 
of Sister Agapita Reyes. 


00:13.697 --> 00:15.699
As a Christian wife and mother, 


00:15.698 --> 00:17.700
she successfully met the challenges 


00:17.700 --> 00:20.837
of raising a family 
by applying Bible principles. 


00:20.837 --> 00:24.874
What helped her 
to remain steadfast throughout her life?


00:24.873 --> 00:28.010
How can you maintain focus 


00:28.010 --> 00:30.147
even after you achieve a spiritual goal? 


00:30.147 --> 00:35.085
Could subtle temptations 
and distractions take you off course? 


00:35.085 --> 00:40.657
We’ll discuss an important quality 
that can help you.


00:40.657 --> 00:44.327
Parents are proud of young ones 
who give their best to Jehovah. 


00:44.327 --> 00:48.297
Their feelings are 
a reflection of how Jehovah feels 


00:48.297 --> 00:53.302
and are the inspiration 
for this month’s music video. 


00:53.302 --> 00:58.000
This is JW Broadcasting for August 2017.


01:16.525 --> 01:18.562
The complexity found in nature 


01:18.562 --> 01:23.099
has inspired 
amazing achievements in technology.


01:23.098 --> 01:25.935
But it has also moved people to ask, 


01:25.935 --> 01:28.337
“Was It Designed?” 


01:28.337 --> 01:33.175
That’s the title of an Awake! series 
that first appeared in 2008. 


01:33.175 --> 01:37.913
It’s been a powerful tool 
to turn people’s attention to Jehovah, 


01:37.913 --> 01:40.916
the Creator of all things. 


01:40.917 --> 01:43.119
We’re pleased to introduce the first 


01:43.118 --> 01:47.000
in an exciting new video series 
based on those articles.


02:12.048 --> 02:15.083
The trunk of the African elephant 


02:15.083 --> 02:18.153
is an impressive multitool. 


02:18.153 --> 02:20.390
It is both flexible 


02:20.390 --> 02:23.693
and strong. 


02:23.693 --> 02:27.496
It can pick up a blade of grass 


02:27.497 --> 02:30.000
or uproot a tree.


02:33.435 --> 02:37.273
Some elephants can use 
their trunks to feed themselves 


02:37.273 --> 02:41.176
around 270 kilograms (600 lbs) 
of vegetation 


02:41.177 --> 02:44.000
every day.


02:51.187 --> 02:53.189
With their trunks, 


02:53.188 --> 02:56.000
they can suck water like a straw, 


03:01.297 --> 03:03.634
spray like a fountain, 


03:03.633 --> 03:07.000
and swim with a snorkel.


03:10.873 --> 03:14.000
The trunk can give a gentle touch, 


03:16.378 --> 03:20.216
give a strong push, 


03:20.217 --> 03:24.087
or sound a warning trumpet.


03:24.087 --> 03:28.390
Engineers admire 
the elephant trunk’s remarkable flexibility. 


03:28.390 --> 03:30.893
This comes from having no bone. 


03:30.893 --> 03:33.061
Instead, it contains 


03:33.062 --> 03:37.067
about 150,000 muscle units


03:37.067 --> 03:42.305
—an incredible marriage 
of strength and structure.


03:42.305 --> 03:45.675
Inspired by the elephant’s trunk,
researchers are designing robots


03:45.675 --> 03:48.745
for the future with greater flexibility.


03:48.745 --> 03:54.017
Industrial design
often can be made better by copying 


03:54.017 --> 03:57.254
the perfectly beautiful solutions 
in the natural world.


03:57.253 --> 04:00.188
What do you think? 


04:00.188 --> 04:04.000
Did the elephant’s trunk evolve? 


04:06.395 --> 04:09.000
Or . . .


04:13.168 --> 04:15.236
This new video series can help you 


04:15.237 --> 04:18.742
to see the proof that there is a Creator. 


04:18.742 --> 04:21.910
It can especially help 
you young ones to recognize 


04:21.910 --> 04:25.000
and reject 
the false teaching of evolution. 


04:26.482 --> 04:29.152
Use these new videos 
in your personal study 


04:29.152 --> 04:32.422
and share them 
with classmates and teachers. 


04:32.422 --> 04:35.024
They’ll help you 
give an effective witness 


04:35.023 --> 04:37.626
and bring honor to Jehovah. 


04:37.627 --> 04:40.162
You’ll find them 
in the Video on Demand section 


04:40.162 --> 04:42.832
of JW Broadcasting.


04:42.832 --> 04:45.402
Young ones need strong faith 


04:45.402 --> 04:48.137
in this difficult system of things, 


04:48.137 --> 04:50.139
but they are not alone. 


04:50.138 --> 04:53.175
They have Jehovah’s holy spirit, 


04:53.175 --> 04:56.278
a congregation of brothers and sisters, 


04:56.278 --> 05:00.281
and very often, 
loving Christian parents. 


05:00.282 --> 05:02.552
In Monterrey, Mexico, 


05:02.552 --> 05:05.989
Sister Agapita Reyes 
set a beautiful example 


05:05.988 --> 05:08.825
in building up 
the faith of her children. 


05:08.825 --> 05:13.000
What circumstances 
made that effort a special challenge?


05:19.002 --> 05:23.774
It’s not easy raising kids in the truth,


05:23.773 --> 05:27.000
and I had ten. 


05:29.678 --> 05:34.050
I learned the truth when I was 19. 


05:34.050 --> 05:37.120
Some Witnesses came to preach in our town, 


05:37.120 --> 05:39.422
and my father offered them a place to stay. 


05:39.422 --> 05:41.957
He spoke with them all through the night 


05:41.957 --> 05:45.929
and then announced excitedly 
that he had found the truth. 


05:45.928 --> 05:49.031
Eventually, I was baptized in the 1950’s.


05:49.032 --> 05:52.302
My husband was favorable toward the truth 


05:52.302 --> 05:55.605
but got involved 
in political affairs in the community, 


05:55.605 --> 05:58.000
and from there 
he began his political career. 


06:00.743 --> 06:02.478
When I read 1 Peter 3:1, 2, 


06:02.478 --> 06:06.148
I understood that I needed 
to be in subjection to my husband, 


06:06.148 --> 06:08.150
with the hope that he could be won over 


06:08.150 --> 06:10.820
“without a word” by means of my conduct.


06:10.820 --> 06:12.822
When my children were young, 


06:12.822 --> 06:15.659
I made a weekly Bible study program 
for each of them, 


06:15.658 --> 06:17.660
and as they grew up, 


06:17.660 --> 06:21.830
the older kids helped me 
with their younger siblings.


06:21.830 --> 06:25.300
I remember Mom always made 
an effort to teach me how to preach.


06:25.300 --> 06:29.505
I would write presentations 
for the ministry on pieces of paper, 


06:29.505 --> 06:33.810
and the kids would practice while they 
did their chores around the house. 


06:33.810 --> 06:37.813
We set aside time 
one day a week for our family study.


06:37.813 --> 06:39.415
It could be anything


06:39.415 --> 06:42.985
—a sack of potatoes, 
a sack of flour, or a house plant. 


06:42.985 --> 06:44.387
She would tell me: 


06:44.387 --> 06:47.257
“Imagine that this is a person 
you meet in field service. 


06:47.257 --> 06:49.225
What would you say to them?” 


06:49.225 --> 06:51.260
When I finished, she would say to me, 


06:51.260 --> 06:53.262
“The way you did it just now, 


06:53.262 --> 06:56.000
do it like that when you 
go out in the ministry.”


06:57.200 --> 07:00.703
My mom was very creative. 


07:00.703 --> 07:05.000
She would assign us to play 
the part of different Bible characters.


07:07.143 --> 07:10.813
My mom taught us to appreciate the truth 


07:10.813 --> 07:13.215
through her example.


07:13.215 --> 07:16.685
I served as a regular pioneer for many years, 


07:16.685 --> 07:20.188
and I encouraged my kids 
to reach out for spiritual goals. 


07:20.188 --> 07:22.591
My daughter left home at the age of 18 


07:22.592 --> 07:26.495
to serve as a special pioneer.


07:26.495 --> 07:28.497
Later, my oldest son did the same. 


07:28.497 --> 07:33.904
These two proved to be excellent examples 
for their younger brothers.


07:33.903 --> 07:37.105
Raising my son Noé was a challenge. 


07:37.105 --> 07:38.808
He was the youngest, 


07:38.808 --> 07:41.000
and at a very young age, 
he was diagnosed with epilepsy. 


07:42.712 --> 07:45.147
Despite his limitations, 


07:45.147 --> 07:48.717
he was able to serve 
as a ministerial servant 


07:48.717 --> 07:50.219
and regular pioneer. 


07:50.218 --> 07:53.221
He fought his illness for more than 40 years, 


07:53.222 --> 07:56.000
before passing away recently.


07:57.360 --> 08:01.000
Losing my husband in death 
dealt me another blow. 


08:02.063 --> 08:04.866
Now my health and my memory are fading. 


08:04.867 --> 08:06.869
I can’t do as much 


08:06.868 --> 08:09.005
in the ministry as before. 


08:09.005 --> 08:13.442
But even so, thanks to the help 
of the brothers in the congregation, 


08:13.442 --> 08:17.747
I’m not giving up. 


08:17.747 --> 08:20.617
Even though my husband 
was not a Witness, 


08:20.617 --> 08:23.619
I respected him 
as the head of the family.


08:23.618 --> 08:26.088
I will never forget the moment 


08:26.088 --> 08:29.000
when my husband asked me 
to study the Bible with him. 


08:30.158 --> 08:32.961
I remember 
that my eldest son gave the talk, 


08:32.962 --> 08:37.032
and his father was 
among the candidates for baptism. 


08:37.032 --> 08:40.770
Forty-two years 
after I received the Kingdom message, 


08:40.770 --> 08:43.605
my husband was baptized. 


08:43.605 --> 08:45.842
Another great blessing 
was seeing my children 


08:45.842 --> 08:50.000
grow in the truth 
and use their youth to serve Jehovah. 


08:51.447 --> 08:53.917
Some have served as special pioneers, 


08:53.917 --> 08:56.000
circuit overseers, or in Bethel.


08:57.287 --> 08:59.289
If it wasn’t for her help 


08:59.288 --> 09:01.323
and the support of my siblings, 


09:01.323 --> 09:05.326
perhaps we wouldn’t be part 
of the organization today. 


09:05.327 --> 09:10.000
But thanks to her, 
we started out on the best course in life. 


09:12.568 --> 09:17.205
Words cannot express 
how grateful I am to her.


09:17.205 --> 09:19.242
I now find great joy 


09:19.242 --> 09:22.545
in seeing my grandchildren 
and great-grandchildren 


09:22.545 --> 09:24.913
follow their parents’ example. 


09:24.913 --> 09:26.981
Thinking about all I have experienced 


09:26.982 --> 09:29.852
in over 60 years of service to Jehovah


09:29.852 --> 09:32.755
—raising my ten children in the truth, 


09:32.755 --> 09:36.292
my husband becoming a servant of Jehovah, 


09:36.292 --> 09:39.595
and seeing 30 members 
of my family in full-time service—


09:39.595 --> 09:41.863
I can do nothing 
but thank Jehovah 


09:41.863 --> 09:44.000
for his blessings. 


09:44.000 --> 09:49.000
It’s been worth all the effort.


09:55.645 --> 09:57.980
Sister Reyes continues 
to serve Jehovah faithfully 


09:57.980 --> 10:01.000
at 86 years of age. 


10:02.452 --> 10:07.290
Have you personally experienced 
some of her more difficult struggles? 


10:07.290 --> 10:12.295
She’s felt the heartbreak 
of losing her husband and a child in death. 


10:12.295 --> 10:15.732
In recent years, 
she’s battled failing health. 


10:15.732 --> 10:17.967
But through all of that, 


10:17.967 --> 10:22.000
Sister Reyes remains 
a motivating example for Christian women. 


10:23.472 --> 10:27.000
Her story is an excellent start 
to our discussion.


10:28.310 --> 10:30.312
The theme for our program is 


10:30.312 --> 10:33.649
“The Women Proclaiming the Good News.” 


10:33.648 --> 10:36.785
Sadly, throughout human history 


10:36.785 --> 10:41.790
women have been subjected 
to injustice, violence, and abuse. 


10:41.790 --> 10:43.825
Why is that? 


10:43.825 --> 10:46.895
The Bible explains. 


10:46.895 --> 10:51.900
In the latter part of Genesis 3:16, 


10:51.900 --> 10:55.170
notice what God says: 


10:55.170 --> 10:57.373
“Your longing will be for your husband, 


10:57.373 --> 11:01.000
and he will dominate you.” 


11:02.077 --> 11:06.482
When God said 
that Adam would “dominate” his wife, 


11:06.482 --> 11:11.487
God was not indicating His approval 
of the subjugation of woman by man. 


11:11.487 --> 11:14.490
He was simply foretelling 
the sad consequences 


11:14.490 --> 11:17.325
of sin on the first couple. 


11:17.325 --> 11:21.997
So abuse of women 
is a direct outcome 


11:21.997 --> 11:26.302
of the sinful nature of humans, 
not of God’s will. 


11:26.302 --> 11:28.504
Right down to our day, 


11:28.503 --> 11:30.671
rarely have women been accorded 


11:30.672 --> 11:34.177
the dignity that God 
wants them to receive. 


11:34.177 --> 11:39.049
However, Jehovah makes clear 
in his Word, the Bible, 


11:39.048 --> 11:43.018
that women and men 
have equal standing before him. 


11:43.018 --> 11:47.255
In fact, he indicated 
that women would play a vital role 


11:47.255 --> 11:50.760
in the outworking of his purpose.


11:50.760 --> 11:56.765
Our theme is based on Psalm 68:11. 


11:56.765 --> 11:58.833
Let’s read it: 


11:58.833 --> 12:01.570
“Jehovah gives the command; 


12:01.570 --> 12:05.000
the women proclaiming 
the good news are a large army.” 


12:06.075 --> 12:08.410
Those words were inspired by God. 


12:08.410 --> 12:12.000
But what did the psalmist 
have in mind when he penned them?


12:13.348 --> 12:16.018
The context of Psalm 68 


12:16.018 --> 12:21.756
shows that David was praising 
Jehovah as a God of saving acts. 


12:21.757 --> 12:24.627
From the time of their Exodus from Egypt, 


12:24.627 --> 12:28.664
the men of Israel often had to fight 
against enemy nations. 


12:28.663 --> 12:32.400
With Jehovah’s help, 
they defeated them. 


12:32.400 --> 12:34.903
And the entire nation would then rejoice 


12:34.903 --> 12:37.906
over the victory Jehovah had given them.


12:37.907 --> 12:42.110
The first of the victory celebrations 
recorded in the Bible 


12:42.110 --> 12:44.747
was at the time 
that Jehovah gave his people 


12:44.747 --> 12:48.000
the victory over Pharaoh 
and the Egyptians who were pursuing them. 


12:49.718 --> 12:54.723
Exodus 15:20, 21 


12:54.723 --> 12:59.795
tells what happened 
after this miraculous victory: 


12:59.795 --> 13:03.732
“Then Miriam the prophetess, 
Aaron’s sister, 


13:03.732 --> 13:05.969
“took a tambourine in her hand, 


13:05.968 --> 13:10.371
“and all the women followed her 
with tambourines and with dances. 


13:10.372 --> 13:13.842
“Miriam sang in response to the men: 


13:13.842 --> 13:15.945
“‘Sing to Jehovah, 


13:15.945 --> 13:19.282
“‘for he has become highly exalted. 


13:19.282 --> 13:23.885
The horse and its rider 
he has hurled into the sea.’” 


13:23.885 --> 13:26.455
Picture that scene. 


13:26.455 --> 13:29.057
There were 
an estimated three million people 


13:29.057 --> 13:31.060
in the nation of Israel. 


13:31.060 --> 13:34.663
Imagine
—out of that large number, 


13:34.663 --> 13:38.666
“all the women” were dancing 
and singing praises to Jehovah. 


13:38.667 --> 13:43.005
That was undoubtedly a large army! 


13:43.005 --> 13:48.310
What a great shout of praise 
to Jehovah that was!


13:48.310 --> 13:51.680
Another example was 
when King Saul and his general David 


13:51.680 --> 13:54.617
returned from victory over the Philistines. 


13:54.617 --> 13:56.652
Let’s read the account 


13:56.652 --> 14:02.000
at 1 Samuel 18:6. 


14:03.192 --> 14:05.327
“When David and the others would return 


14:05.327 --> 14:07.295
“from striking down the Philistines, 


14:07.295 --> 14:09.298
“the women would come out 


14:09.298 --> 14:11.000
“from all the cities of Israel 


14:11.000 --> 14:13.935
“with song and dances to meet King Saul 


14:13.935 --> 14:15.938
“with tambourines, 


14:15.938 --> 14:18.740
with rejoicing, and with lutes.” 


14:18.740 --> 14:21.043
Notice that the account says 


14:21.043 --> 14:24.446
that the women came out of “all the cities” 


14:24.447 --> 14:28.284
to greet them with music, song, and dance. 


14:28.283 --> 14:30.385
Occasions such as these 


14:30.385 --> 14:34.155
were not simply expressions of rejoicing 


14:34.155 --> 14:37.325
that originated with human emotion. 


14:37.325 --> 14:40.162
Recall that under inspiration, David said: 


14:40.162 --> 14:43.165
“Jehovah gives the command; 


14:43.165 --> 14:46.135
the women proclaiming 
the good news are a large army.” 


14:46.135 --> 14:49.672
Yes, and Jehovah valued 
their expressions of praise, 


14:49.672 --> 14:54.000
just as he valued the contributions 
of the men who had engaged in battle.


14:55.010 --> 14:57.545
What about today? 


14:57.545 --> 15:02.083
The report for the 2017 service year 


15:02.083 --> 15:05.988
shows that there were 
over 8.3 million publishers 


15:05.988 --> 15:09.691
proclaiming the good news 
throughout the earth. 


15:09.692 --> 15:12.695
Keep in mind that in most lands, 


15:12.695 --> 15:14.830
it is not unusual for our dear sisters 


15:14.830 --> 15:18.233
to make up over half 
of our special pioneers 


15:18.233 --> 15:23.838
and nearly three quarters of those 
who serve in the regular pioneer work. 


15:23.838 --> 15:26.241
In addition, many other sisters 


15:26.242 --> 15:29.244
are wholeheartedly spreading 
the good news of the Kingdom 


15:29.243 --> 15:33.615
to the best of their ability 
within their circumstances. 


15:33.615 --> 15:37.385
There are many single-parent families 
where our sisters 


15:37.385 --> 15:41.000
are providing materially 
and spiritually for their children. 


15:42.257 --> 15:44.394
Many of our faithful single sisters 


15:44.393 --> 15:47.061
are expending themselves 
in Jehovah’s service 


15:47.062 --> 15:50.565
in theocratic construction 
and maintenance work, 


15:50.565 --> 15:54.503
Bethel service, 
and serving where the need is greater


15:54.503 --> 15:58.873
—which includes 
serving in foreign-language fields. 


15:58.873 --> 16:02.711
Faithful wives 
loyally support their husbands 


16:02.712 --> 16:06.515
as well as fulfill their own roles 
as preachers and teachers. 


16:06.515 --> 16:09.785
Yes, how Jehovah must be pleased 


16:09.785 --> 16:13.222
to see all of you 
who serve in various ways! 


16:13.222 --> 16:15.224
And we’re grateful 


16:15.223 --> 16:18.393
for the warm spirit and positive influence 


16:18.393 --> 16:21.000
our dear sisters have on our congregations.


16:22.163 --> 16:24.165
Clearly, 


16:24.165 --> 16:29.972
Jehovah values 
this “large army” of sisters. 


16:29.972 --> 16:32.909
But does he take note 
of the individual circumstances 


16:32.908 --> 16:36.078
and sacrifices of each sister? 


16:36.078 --> 16:38.580
We do not have to wonder. 


16:38.580 --> 16:40.815
By means of his Word, 


16:40.815 --> 16:43.385
Jehovah makes it evident that he sees 


16:43.385 --> 16:46.922
and appreciates each of his servants.


16:46.922 --> 16:48.957
For example, 


16:48.957 --> 16:53.429
did you notice when we read 
the scripture in Exodus chapter 15 


16:53.428 --> 16:57.000
that Miriam was described 
as a “prophetess”? 


16:58.067 --> 17:00.269
Evidently, 
she was privileged to be used 


17:00.268 --> 17:03.071
as an instrument 
of divine communication. 


17:03.072 --> 17:05.774
In some instances, 


17:05.773 --> 17:10.445
this no doubt included singing songs 
that were inspired by Jehovah. 


17:10.445 --> 17:15.283
Miriam was not the only one 
in the Scriptures with this designation. 


17:15.283 --> 17:17.551
Other women in the Bible record, 


17:17.552 --> 17:20.889
such as Anna and Isaiah’s wife, 


17:20.888 --> 17:24.693
were also spoken of as prophetesses.


17:24.693 --> 17:27.061
In the book of Judges, 


17:27.062 --> 17:32.100
another faithful servant, 
Deborah, is identified. 


17:32.100 --> 17:38.000
Let’s read Judges 4:4, 5: 


17:39.708 --> 17:41.876
“Now Deborah, a prophetess, 


17:41.877 --> 17:43.879
“the wife of Lappidoth, 


17:43.878 --> 17:46.248
“was judging Israel at that time. 


17:46.248 --> 17:48.950
“She used to sit under Deborah’s palm tree 


17:48.950 --> 17:50.952
“between Ramah and Bethel 


17:50.952 --> 17:53.089
“in the mountainous region of Ephraim; 


17:53.088 --> 17:55.790
the Israelites 
would go up to her for judgment.” 


17:55.790 --> 17:58.093
Evidently, 


17:58.093 --> 18:01.796
Deborah was assigned to settle 
disputes that arose among Israelites 


18:01.797 --> 18:05.000
by giving Jehovah’s answer 
to problems that came up.


18:06.468 --> 18:09.403
Much later in Israel’s history, 


18:09.403 --> 18:12.173
during the reign of faithful King Josiah, 


18:12.173 --> 18:15.843
Huldah served as a prophetess. 


18:15.843 --> 18:20.848
At 2 Kings 22:8, 


18:20.848 --> 18:24.351
we read that while the temple 
was being repaired, 


18:24.352 --> 18:27.622
the original book of the Law was found. 


18:27.622 --> 18:29.625
When it was read to Josiah, 


18:29.625 --> 18:32.895
he was distraught at seeing how far off 


18:32.895 --> 18:36.063
the nation had strayed from Jehovah’s Law. 


18:36.063 --> 18:38.333
In verse 13, 


18:38.333 --> 18:41.603
he directed the priest, the secretary, 


18:41.603 --> 18:44.840
and other influential men: 


18:44.840 --> 18:49.310
“Go, inquire of Jehovah in my behalf, 


18:49.310 --> 18:51.880
“in behalf of the people, 


18:51.880 --> 18:55.617
“and in behalf of all Judah 
concerning the words of this book 


18:55.617 --> 18:58.420
that has been found.” 


18:58.420 --> 19:00.822
How did they accomplish this? 


19:00.822 --> 19:03.725
Verse 14 continues: 


19:03.725 --> 19:05.927
“So Hilkiah the priest, 


19:05.927 --> 19:10.565
“Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah 


19:10.565 --> 19:13.000
went to Huldah the prophetess.” 


19:14.235 --> 19:17.238
It’s interesting that Jehovah 
used this faithful woman 


19:17.238 --> 19:19.240
to convey his direction 


19:19.240 --> 19:21.610
and that prominent men and priests 


19:21.610 --> 19:24.000
sought her divinely inspired advice.


19:25.980 --> 19:28.583
The Christian Greek Scriptures, however, 


19:28.583 --> 19:31.320
do not permit sisters 
to serve in such a capacity 


19:31.320 --> 19:33.988
as did Deborah 
and other prophetesses 


19:33.988 --> 19:35.990
in the nation of Israel. 


19:35.990 --> 19:37.993
However, 


19:37.993 --> 19:42.563
Titus 2:3, 4 


19:42.563 --> 19:47.568
encourages “older women” 
to display spiritual qualities, 


19:47.568 --> 19:49.938
“so that they may advise 
the younger women” 


19:49.938 --> 19:51.940
in spiritual matters. 


19:51.940 --> 19:55.077
Let’s read those verses: 


19:55.077 --> 19:59.480
“Likewise, let the older women 
be reverent in behavior, 


19:59.480 --> 20:03.618
“not slanderous, 
not enslaved to a lot of wine, 


20:03.618 --> 20:05.920
“teachers of what is good, 


20:05.920 --> 20:08.390
“so that they may advise 
the younger women 


20:08.390 --> 20:12.093
to love their husbands,
to love their children.”


20:12.093 --> 20:16.565
How we appreciate 
the spiritually mature sisters among us 


20:16.565 --> 20:20.235
who provide 
such fine assistance to younger sisters 


20:20.235 --> 20:23.872
or those who are newer in the truth!


20:23.872 --> 20:28.810
However, today Jehovah 
has delegated authority to men. 


20:28.810 --> 20:33.148
They Scripturally qualify 
to serve as elders and ministerial servants 


20:33.148 --> 20:38.020
in order to serve, guide, 
and protect his people. 


20:38.020 --> 20:41.757
It is obvious that this is not due 
to a lack of respect 


20:41.757 --> 20:44.292
for the gifts of our sisters 
in the congregation. 


20:44.292 --> 20:47.930
In fact, 
many responsible brothers will acknowledge 


20:47.930 --> 20:50.532
that they have benefited 
from the experience 


20:50.532 --> 20:55.000
and practical wisdom 
of our humble, spiritually mature sisters.


20:56.237 --> 20:58.240
Finally, 


20:58.240 --> 21:00.475
think of the outstanding faith 


21:00.475 --> 21:04.000
of another woman 
mentioned in the Bible, Mary. 


21:05.247 --> 21:10.119
What an awesome responsibility 
Jehovah entrusted her with


21:10.118 --> 21:15.123
—bearing and raising 
his own Son as a human! 


21:15.123 --> 21:19.360
We can only imagine the thoughts 
that were going through her mind 


21:19.360 --> 21:22.397
when she was told of this assignment. 


21:22.397 --> 21:27.402
But the account in Luke chapter 1 


21:27.402 --> 21:31.507
tells us much about her spirituality. 


21:31.507 --> 21:34.944
In verse 38, 


21:34.943 --> 21:39.715
after the angel Gabriel 
finished speaking with her, 


21:39.715 --> 21:43.418
Mary’s response was simply: 


21:43.418 --> 21:46.921
“Look! Jehovah’s slave girl! 


21:46.922 --> 21:50.759
May it happen to me 
according to your declaration.” 


21:50.758 --> 21:55.063
She must have wondered 
how Jehovah would accomplish these things, 


21:55.063 --> 21:58.333
but she was humble and obedient. 


21:58.333 --> 22:02.036
Faithful men such as Moses 
and Jeremiah hesitated 


22:02.037 --> 22:04.205
when given 
a challenging assignment from God. 


22:04.205 --> 22:06.207
Not Mary! 


22:06.207 --> 22:08.944
What a beautiful example 
she set for all of us


22:08.943 --> 22:11.846
—men and women!


22:11.847 --> 22:16.852
Clearly, 
Jehovah has always highly valued women. 


22:16.852 --> 22:19.120
And we are privileged to serve today 


22:19.120 --> 22:22.557
with millions of hardworking sisters. 


22:22.557 --> 22:25.560
How pleased Jehovah must be 


22:25.560 --> 22:30.332
to see dear sisters 
serving him humbly and faithfully! 


22:30.332 --> 22:32.334
We urge you sisters, 


22:32.333 --> 22:35.170
please keep up your good work 


22:35.170 --> 22:39.708
and continue to be 
a positive influence in the congregation. 


22:39.708 --> 22:42.876
God has indeed granted 
you faithful women 


22:42.877 --> 22:47.015
the privilege of participating 
in the fulfillment of the psalmist’s words: 


22:47.015 --> 22:49.517
“Jehovah gives the command; 


22:49.517 --> 22:54.000
the women proclaiming 
the good news are a large army.”


22:55.223 --> 22:57.425
Thousands of our sisters have been active 


22:57.425 --> 23:00.795
for many years 
in that “large army” of women. 


23:00.795 --> 23:02.797
Bertille Kupelian, 


23:02.797 --> 23:06.702
a special pioneer in West Virginia, 
in the United States, 


23:06.702 --> 23:10.505
entered the full-time service in 1958. 


23:10.505 --> 23:15.910
In that time, she’s helped 
more than 60 people to baptism. 


23:15.910 --> 23:18.313
How has her outlook toward the ministry 


23:18.313 --> 23:22.000
kept her going for almost 60 years?


23:27.655 --> 23:32.260
My father was opposed  


23:32.260 --> 23:34.428
to the truth as I was growing up, 


23:34.428 --> 23:38.000
but my mother was very, very zealous.


23:39.100 --> 23:43.003
I knew the things my mother 
was teaching me was the truth. 


23:43.003 --> 23:46.541
I knew that this was 
what I was going to do. 


23:46.542 --> 23:51.000
And it was not easy, but we did it.


23:52.247 --> 23:54.884
I was Daddy’s girl, 


23:54.883 --> 23:58.220
but my mom made sure 


23:58.220 --> 24:01.222
that I and my siblings knew the truth. 


24:01.222 --> 24:04.525
And she studied with us 
when no other children 


24:04.525 --> 24:09.530
in the congregation 
had Bible studies at home. 


24:09.530 --> 24:13.535
Of course, we kind of kicked 
and didn’t like it, 


24:13.535 --> 24:16.738
but I was glad she did it.


24:16.738 --> 24:20.408
My mother was a very, very positive person, 


24:20.408 --> 24:23.545
and although she had the opposition, 


24:23.545 --> 24:26.380
I saw how she dealt with it 


24:26.380 --> 24:29.117
and how firm and determined she was. 


24:29.117 --> 24:32.820
And that was something she taught us.


24:32.820 --> 24:35.357
It’s a mind-set. 


24:35.357 --> 24:38.794
You know, 
your mind is a wonderful thing. 


24:38.793 --> 24:43.000
It can really influence you 
toward good or maybe not so good. 


24:44.198 --> 24:47.601
And so then, 
I was determined in my mind 


24:47.602 --> 24:52.907
that I was going to serve Jehovah then.


24:52.907 --> 24:57.245
In our congregation, there were brothers 
and sisters of the anointed. 


24:57.245 --> 24:59.848
They were always very kind to me, 


24:59.848 --> 25:03.351
and they encouraged me. 


25:03.352 --> 25:05.620
I worked in service with them. 


25:05.620 --> 25:09.000
And I thought, 
‘That’s the way I want to be.’


25:10.725 --> 25:13.595
Children like attention. 


25:13.595 --> 25:16.030
And so then, if you give them attention


25:16.030 --> 25:18.032
—you talk with them 


25:18.032 --> 25:21.469
and ask if you could work 
with them in the ministry 


25:21.468 --> 25:23.638
and help them prepare a presentation


25:23.638 --> 25:25.806
and go over it and over it 


25:25.807 --> 25:28.677
so that they’re ready for the ministry


25:28.677 --> 25:31.000
—then they’ll enjoy it more.


25:32.580 --> 25:35.417
That was one of the things 
that the anointed


25:35.417 --> 25:37.419
did in the congregation where I was. 


25:37.418 --> 25:41.000
They paid attention to me, and I loved it.


25:43.792 --> 25:47.162
How I learned to teach 
was I think about the person, 


25:47.162 --> 25:49.999
and I think about their situation, 


25:49.998 --> 25:54.501
and I try to think in my mind 
what they are thinking, 


25:54.502 --> 25:57.905
and I work on that 


25:57.905 --> 26:01.810
and think of what kind of scriptures 
I can find to help them. 


26:01.810 --> 26:03.177
And so then, 


26:03.177 --> 26:08.182
I try to pattern our studies 


26:08.182 --> 26:12.000
to incorporate some of those things.


26:14.155 --> 26:16.858
There are always challenges. 


26:16.858 --> 26:21.000
Some of the winters right on the lake 
where I lived were very harsh. 


26:22.730 --> 26:26.768
And my trailer was parked 
in such a way that every time 


26:26.768 --> 26:30.005
the wind blew 
and the snow came and the ice came, 


26:30.005 --> 26:32.007
it sealed the door. 


26:32.007 --> 26:34.742
And so then, I carried a big knife in my car, 


26:34.742 --> 26:37.179
and I would have to cut around the door 


26:37.178 --> 26:41.683
to get the door to open
—break the ice seal. 


26:41.683 --> 26:44.000
It was interesting.


26:45.053 --> 26:47.788
I had some opposition in the territories, 


26:47.788 --> 26:50.291
and one was this lady who was very irate. 


26:50.292 --> 26:53.795
And she went to kick me, 
and she kicked me right in the stomach, 


26:53.795 --> 26:57.000
and so then, anyway, 
I dismissed myself. 


26:58.232 --> 27:01.704
Then, a while later, 
it was time to work the territory again. 


27:01.703 --> 27:04.838
Nobody wanted to go there, 
and we didn’t have do-not-calls, 


27:04.838 --> 27:08.576
I don’t think, at that time, 
at least there wasn’t any in the territory. 


27:08.577 --> 27:12.514
So then anyway, I called by 
and I mentioned to her:


27:12.513 --> 27:14.515
“Why, hello there. 


27:14.515 --> 27:17.152
I know I’ve had the opportunity 
to talk with you before.” 


27:17.152 --> 27:19.154
Yes, she remembered. 


27:19.153 --> 27:22.000
And I said, “Well, perhaps 
you were having a bad day that day.”


27:24.592 --> 27:28.162
I hit a lull when I had few Bible studies, 


27:28.162 --> 27:31.599
and so I prayed diligently to Jehovah: 


27:31.598 --> 27:34.035
“Jehovah, help me. 
I need Bible studies.” 


27:34.035 --> 27:37.205
And then you have to be 
out there looking for them.


27:37.205 --> 27:40.475
Well, I’ve lost my father, my mother, 


27:40.475 --> 27:43.978
my sister, my brother. 


27:43.978 --> 27:48.783
Well, naturally you feel at a loss, 


27:48.783 --> 27:53.286
but Jehovah strengthened me, 
and the friends strengthened me, 


27:53.287 --> 27:56.524
and I kept busy in the ministry. 


27:56.523 --> 27:58.560
But again, it goes back to that mind-set. 


27:58.560 --> 28:00.962
Are you going to let the challenge beat you, 


28:00.962 --> 28:04.299
or are you going to beat the challenge?


28:04.298 --> 28:07.000
You and Jehovah can beat the challenge.


28:08.703 --> 28:12.906
You know, discouragement 
is one of Satan’s biggest tools. 


28:12.907 --> 28:16.210
And I always tell myself, 


28:16.210 --> 28:19.380
‘I’m not going to let Satan beat me down.’


28:19.380 --> 28:23.552
As far as health is concerned, 
my everyday health is very good. 


28:23.552 --> 28:27.000
But I have a leg that drives me crazy.


28:28.423 --> 28:31.826
I think back to Jacob. 


28:31.827 --> 28:34.229
He served Jehovah with a limp. 


28:34.228 --> 28:38.000
And then I think of Paul. 


28:39.400 --> 28:43.000
And so then, those things keep you humble.


28:44.772 --> 28:46.775
I’ve prayed and prayed and prayed about it, 


28:46.775 --> 28:49.243
but just like with the apostle Paul, 


28:49.243 --> 28:51.645
it didn’t disappear. 


28:51.645 --> 28:55.283
And so then, I just say: 
“Patch me up till Armageddon. 


28:55.283 --> 28:58.285
It’ll disappear then.”


28:58.285 --> 29:01.488
If your mind is made up 
that this is what you’re going to do, 


29:01.488 --> 29:05.493
this is your life, 
this is what Jehovah wants you to do, 


29:05.493 --> 29:09.863
and so then you do it.


29:09.863 --> 29:14.000
I’ve seen how he’s kept me going. 


29:15.803 --> 29:19.640
You know that I’ve needed work; 
I’ve needed money; 


29:19.640 --> 29:21.877
I’ve needed strength. 


29:21.877 --> 29:23.879
I’ve needed companionship 


29:23.878 --> 29:26.613
because a lot of times 
I’m in the ministry by myself. 


29:26.613 --> 29:28.616
I talk to Jehovah. 


29:28.617 --> 29:31.000
And so then, he’s always there for me.


29:32.153 --> 29:35.590
I definitely want to keep pioneering 


29:35.590 --> 29:38.392
or serving Jehovah the best I can, 


29:38.392 --> 29:41.662
regardless of what comes up.


29:41.662 --> 29:45.099
There is nothing more joyful 


29:45.098 --> 29:50.000
than to see that you have helped 
somebody to live forever. 


29:51.172 --> 29:55.000
Well, how much better could it be?


29:59.613 --> 30:04.418
Sister Kupelian had a profound effect
on those she witnessed to. 


30:04.418 --> 30:08.623
I know this because she found me 
in the door-to-door ministry 


30:08.623 --> 30:11.058
when I was 14 years old. 


30:11.058 --> 30:15.263
At that age, I had the goal to be a doctor. 


30:15.263 --> 30:18.065
One night after the meeting, 
Bertille said to me, 


30:18.065 --> 30:20.568
“Well, you know, 
in the new world, 


30:20.568 --> 30:24.438
we won’t need doctors 
because Jesus will do all the healing.” 


30:24.438 --> 30:27.775
Honestly, that hit me hard 


30:27.775 --> 30:31.812
because I wanted to help people 
as well as provide for my mother. 


30:31.812 --> 30:33.815
But she added, 


30:33.815 --> 30:36.717
“What we will need are teachers.” 


30:36.717 --> 30:39.254
I thought that was a good idea. 


30:39.253 --> 30:43.691
Still focused on a career, 
I had one type of teacher in mind, 


30:43.692 --> 30:45.727
but she had another. 


30:45.727 --> 30:47.762
Through her patience and reasoning, 


30:47.762 --> 30:52.134
she helped me to become 
the most important kind of teacher


30:52.133 --> 30:55.470
—a teacher of God’s Word. 


30:55.470 --> 31:00.107
Is there someone like Sister Kupelian 
in your congregation? 


31:00.107 --> 31:03.812
We are grateful 
for these sisters’ zealous spirit 


31:03.812 --> 31:06.780
and for the personal interest 
they show toward us. 


31:06.780 --> 31:10.000
And we’re sure Jehovah 
values them like we do.


31:11.585 --> 31:15.890
One of Sister Kupelian’s strengths 
is her perseverance. 


31:15.890 --> 31:20.093
Perseverance means to continue resolutely 


31:20.093 --> 31:22.096
in the face of adversity, 


31:22.097 --> 31:26.100
being tenacious, not giving up. 


31:26.100 --> 31:30.137
If not careful, 
we could reach a spiritual goal, 


31:30.137 --> 31:34.309
only to let something 
distract us away from it. 


31:34.308 --> 31:36.310
In this dramatization, 


31:36.310 --> 31:39.680
a young sister is pioneering 
and working toward new goals. 


31:39.680 --> 31:44.000
How, though, 
is she in danger of losing her focus?


31:54.295 --> 31:56.463
When I started learning sign language, 


31:56.463 --> 31:59.000
it just seemed to come natural for me.


32:07.042 --> 32:08.944
After I transferred to the congregation, 


32:08.943 --> 32:11.000
I remember feeling so happy.


32:22.057 --> 32:25.192
I was pioneering and really enjoying 


32:25.192 --> 32:28.000
this new way of communicating.


32:30.598 --> 32:34.635
It’s funny how 
the thing you love can also be 


32:34.635 --> 32:38.000
the thing that tests you.


32:39.407 --> 32:42.000
Soon, I took the test 
for a sign-language interpreter. 


32:43.210 --> 32:48.548
I couldn’t believe I passed!


32:48.548 --> 32:51.000
I loved my new job.


32:54.122 --> 32:57.292
My hope was 
that it would support my pioneering 


32:57.292 --> 32:59.294
and maybe 


32:59.293 --> 33:01.428
allow me to travel one day to a country 


33:01.428 --> 33:05.800
and preach where there was 
a need for sign language.


33:05.800 --> 33:09.037
My boss was very happy with my work, 


33:09.037 --> 33:13.000
so much so that he began to give me more.


33:16.643 --> 33:21.048
Everyone seemed appreciative, 


33:21.048 --> 33:25.000
and the extra money didn’t hurt.


33:38.432 --> 33:42.304
I was handling it all fine. 


33:42.303 --> 33:48.000
Ahh, OK, for a while.


34:28.783 --> 34:30.785
My boss asked me to work full-time 


34:30.785 --> 34:33.000
for a few months 
to get some extra training. 


34:35.890 --> 34:37.958
The raise could help me 


34:37.958 --> 34:41.000
with planning my trip abroad.


34:45.733 --> 34:47.735
I knew my parents would be concerned. 


34:47.735 --> 34:52.307
I knew because I felt it too. 


34:52.307 --> 34:55.000
I was already dragging physically. 


34:56.143 --> 34:59.580
But then again, 
it would only be for a few months. 


34:59.580 --> 35:02.483
I was really torn.


35:02.483 --> 35:04.485
Dad kindly commended me 


35:04.485 --> 35:08.155
for having good goals 
and trying my best to work toward them. 


35:08.155 --> 35:12.327
Then he showed me 
a scripture that really helped me, 


35:12.327 --> 35:16.130
1 Timothy 4:16: 


35:16.130 --> 35:19.733
“Pay constant attention 
to yourself and to your teaching. 


35:19.733 --> 35:22.236
“Persevere in these things, 


35:22.237 --> 35:25.205
“for by doing this 
you will save both yourself 


35:25.205 --> 35:27.708
and those who listen to you.”


35:27.708 --> 35:29.710
He helped me 


35:29.710 --> 35:32.000
to see that Timothy set spiritual goals 
for himself while growing up. 


35:35.182 --> 35:37.685
But Paul was now telling him, 


35:37.685 --> 35:40.000
“Don’t stop!”


35:41.522 --> 35:44.459
Even though Timothy 
was a grown spiritual man, 


35:44.458 --> 35:48.896
Paul encouraged him 
to continue setting new spiritual goals, 


35:48.897 --> 35:52.000
in fact, to ‘persevere in them.’ 


35:53.767 --> 35:56.000
What was I persevering in?


36:08.082 --> 36:10.919
I kindly turned down the offer 


36:10.918 --> 36:13.753
and explained to my boss 
that I’d like to keep my hours 


36:13.753 --> 36:16.000
to a minimum 


36:21.862 --> 36:24.000
so I could support 
my number one job.


36:27.202 --> 36:30.905
It might take me longer to save my money, 


36:30.905 --> 36:33.740
but I’ll make that trip one day 


36:33.740 --> 36:36.643
with Jehovah’s help 


36:36.643 --> 36:40.000
and a little perseverance.


36:42.048 --> 36:44.218
It’s interesting 
that the skill she used 


36:44.218 --> 36:48.055
to expand her ministry 
and support her pioneering 


36:48.055 --> 36:50.390
became her distraction. 


36:50.390 --> 36:53.560
That wasn’t easy for her to see at first. 


36:53.560 --> 36:57.332
Who helped her to see the problem clearly? 


36:57.332 --> 37:02.002
It was her parents, 
especially her spiritually-minded father. 


37:02.002 --> 37:05.239
The interest you family heads 
show in your daughters 


37:05.238 --> 37:07.608
is well worth the effort. 


37:07.608 --> 37:11.778
It can point them in the right direction 
when they need guidance. 


37:11.778 --> 37:14.648
Everything you do for them 


37:14.648 --> 37:19.420
shows how precious they are 
to you and to Jehovah, 


37:19.420 --> 37:22.857
and that’s the feeling 
expressed in the music video 


37:22.857 --> 37:25.000
Precious Daughter.


37:34.768 --> 37:45.411
Through all her tender years,
He watched her grow.


37:45.412 --> 37:54.222
Many the joys and tears,
She would come to know.


37:54.222 --> 37:59.294
But when she gave her best
And came through each test,


37:59.293 --> 38:05.231
She made His heart feel so good.


38:05.232 --> 38:15.000
Precious daughter, 
He’s so proud of you.


38:17.945 --> 38:25.000
Time won’t alter His love for you.


38:43.703 --> 38:52.000
Hard work and sacrifice—
That’s just her way.


38:53.913 --> 39:01.721
Thinking of His advice
Helps her through the day,


39:01.722 --> 39:06.627
And she’s so glad to know
That He loves her so.


39:06.627 --> 39:11.000
It means so much to hear him say:


39:12.700 --> 39:22.000
“Precious daughter, 
I’m so proud of you.


39:25.045 --> 39:33.000
Time won’t alter my love for you.”


39:46.933 --> 39:52.171
Yes, Jehovah sees
And Jehovah knows


39:52.172 --> 39:57.010
All the work you’ve done
And the love you’ve shown.


39:57.010 --> 40:02.015
No, He won’t forget
How you’ve loved His name


40:02.015 --> 40:06.000
For all this time.


40:07.988 --> 40:17.000
Precious daughter, 
He’s so proud of you.


40:20.133 --> 40:30.000
Precious daughter, 
He’ll be there for you.


40:32.345 --> 40:43.000
Precious daughter, 
He will care for you.


40:44.992 --> 40:54.000
Precious daughter,
He loves you.


41:13.220 --> 41:17.658
The apostle John wrote 
that he had no greater joy 


41:17.658 --> 41:22.663
than to hear that his spiritual children 
continued “walking in the truth.” 


41:22.663 --> 41:25.631
You fathers feel that same joy 


41:25.632 --> 41:29.437
when you see your daughters 
mature as Christian women. 


41:29.437 --> 41:32.272
Raising your children to love Jehovah 


41:32.272 --> 41:36.010
is just one of the many things 
you do for your family. 


41:36.010 --> 41:38.212
At a Bethel morning worship, 


41:38.212 --> 41:41.315
Brother Lett focused 
on the special relationship 


41:41.315 --> 41:43.650
between a husband and wife. 


41:43.650 --> 41:45.652
What can a husband do to show 


41:45.652 --> 41:48.000
that he shares Jehovah’s view of his wife?


41:49.423 --> 41:52.793
My theme for this little discussion is


41:52.793 --> 41:57.000
“Husbands, Love Your Wife as Yourself.”


41:58.498 --> 42:00.500
What did Jesus say 


42:00.500 --> 42:02.637
was the second greatest commandment? 


42:02.637 --> 42:04.805
Well,
you’re familiar with it. 


42:04.805 --> 42:08.142
At Matthew 22:39, 
he said: 


42:08.142 --> 42:12.412
“You must love 
your neighbor as yourself.” 


42:12.412 --> 42:14.982
Now,
what an excellent illustration 


42:14.982 --> 42:17.719
is contained
in this second greatest commandment!


42:17.718 --> 42:20.520
If you think about it, 
we just naturally, 


42:20.520 --> 42:22.990
inherently, love ourselves, 
don’t we? 


42:22.990 --> 42:25.458
And we show 
love in many ways. 


42:25.458 --> 42:26.960
So Jesus is saying, 


42:26.960 --> 42:30.497
“Work hard to show
the same love for others


42:30.497 --> 42:32.532
you show for yourself.”


42:32.532 --> 42:34.602
But, now, thinking of husbands


42:34.602 --> 42:36.670
as addressed in our theme, 


42:36.670 --> 42:39.540
who is a husband’s closest neighbor? 


42:39.540 --> 42:41.542
Well, his wife.


42:41.542 --> 42:44.612
So especially must a husband work hard


42:44.612 --> 42:47.882
to show the love that he shows 
for himself just naturally and then 


42:47.882 --> 42:50.084
to show that love for his wife. 


42:50.083 --> 42:52.786
Now, what are some specific ways 


42:52.787 --> 42:55.957
that husbands 
just naturally love themselves? 


42:55.957 --> 42:57.825
Well, 
let’s talk about five. 


42:57.825 --> 43:00.227
And undoubtedly
you can think of many others 


43:00.227 --> 43:03.097
that could be discussed
during this discussion.


43:03.097 --> 43:05.132
But number one: 


43:05.132 --> 43:08.335
A husband feeds himself. 


43:08.335 --> 43:12.673
Ephesians 5:29 says in part: 


43:12.673 --> 43:16.043
“For no man ever hated his own body, 


43:16.043 --> 43:18.845
but he feeds . . . it.” 


43:18.845 --> 43:23.283
Well, what does loving our wife, 
now, as ourself require? 


43:23.283 --> 43:26.486
Well, for one thing, 
we certainly would make sure 


43:26.487 --> 43:30.390
we provide for the food 
and for other material needs 


43:30.390 --> 43:32.558
that our wife has. 


43:32.558 --> 43:34.895
And regarding this, 
I think of our brothers 


43:34.895 --> 43:38.732
in concentration camps 
in Nazi Germany. 


43:38.732 --> 43:40.800
Food was very scarce. 


43:40.800 --> 43:44.705
But our brothers, even then, 
from their meager food ration 


43:44.705 --> 43:47.842
would share food 
with other brothers, 


43:47.842 --> 43:50.477
even, in some cases, 
with worldly people. 


43:50.477 --> 43:54.180
Well, similarly, 
a husband would do without himself, 


43:54.180 --> 43:59.152
if necessary, in order to provide 
what his wife really needs. 


43:59.152 --> 44:03.224
But even more importantly, 
an extended application, 


44:03.223 --> 44:06.860
he would make sure 
that she is well-fed spiritually. 


44:06.860 --> 44:09.930
He must make sure 
that she has opportunity 


44:09.930 --> 44:12.933
to benefit from periods 
of personal study, 


44:12.933 --> 44:16.603
congregation meetings, 
assemblies, conventions, 


44:16.603 --> 44:18.771
and family worship.


44:18.772 --> 44:21.109
But now let’s talk 
about a second way 


44:21.108 --> 44:24.043
that a husband 
just naturally loves himself: 


44:24.043 --> 44:27.313
We cherish ourselves. 


44:27.313 --> 44:31.385
Ephesians 5:29 says in part: 


44:31.385 --> 44:34.955
“For no man ever hated his own body, 


44:34.955 --> 44:37.390
but he . . . cherishes it.” 


44:37.390 --> 44:40.593
Now, 
what does cherish mean? 


44:40.593 --> 44:42.595
Well, 
according to the dictionary, 


44:42.595 --> 44:46.033
it means to treat 
with affection and tenderness, 


44:46.033 --> 44:50.536
treasure, value, 
attach importance to. 


44:50.537 --> 44:53.940
See, because of this feeling 
we have toward ourselves, 


44:53.940 --> 44:58.645
we try to get rest 
when we’re sick or tired; 


44:58.645 --> 45:01.615
we try to be 
with friends and loved ones; 


45:01.615 --> 45:05.285
we play games; we exercise; 
we do things we enjoy. 


45:05.285 --> 45:08.588
Periodically, 
we treat ourselves, don’t we,


45:08.588 --> 45:11.391
because we cherish ourselves? 


45:11.392 --> 45:15.262
So, what does loving 
our wife as ourself require? 


45:15.262 --> 45:17.130
Well, it certainly means more


45:17.130 --> 45:19.332
than just being able 
to put up with our mate.


45:19.332 --> 45:21.802
It means cherishing her, 


45:21.802 --> 45:26.707
cultivating affection, 
or fondness, for her.


45:26.707 --> 45:30.577
Think of this: 
At Proverbs 8:31, 


45:30.577 --> 45:34.314
it says that Jesus 
in his prehuman existence 


45:34.313 --> 45:37.216
was fond of humans.


45:37.217 --> 45:40.154
Now, don’t you think 
that fondness he had for us 


45:40.153 --> 45:42.155
made it easier for him
to come to the earth,


45:42.155 --> 45:44.190
take the difficult assignment he took, 


45:44.190 --> 45:46.960
and even die for us 
because he was fond of us? 


45:46.960 --> 45:48.962
Well, similarly,


45:48.962 --> 45:53.100
if wives are cherished 
by their husbands


45:53.100 --> 45:55.302
—if husbands 
are fond of their wives—


45:55.302 --> 45:58.505
it’ll make it so much easier 
to forgive them,


45:58.505 --> 46:02.508
to even die for them, 
if necessary, in the future. 


46:02.508 --> 46:06.580
But if we’re going to have 
this proper feeling, like Jehovah, 


46:06.580 --> 46:11.418
we have to focus 
on the good qualities of our wife, see,


46:11.418 --> 46:14.286
not the flaws, the imperfections. 


46:14.287 --> 46:16.957
And as one 
of the brothers commented on 


46:16.957 --> 46:19.727
(I love the thoughts 
in The Watchtower comments): 


46:19.727 --> 46:23.797
“Love is best sensed 
when it is expressed. 


46:23.797 --> 46:25.832
“How vital that marriage mates 


46:25.832 --> 46:29.269
“not allow the activities of daily life 


46:29.268 --> 46:34.073
to rob them of exchanging 
expressions of affection!”


46:34.073 --> 46:36.075
But now let’s get a third way 


46:36.075 --> 46:39.245
that husbands 
just naturally love themselves: 


46:39.245 --> 46:42.182
We adorn ourselves. 


46:42.182 --> 46:44.217
First Timothy 2:9 speaks 


46:44.217 --> 46:48.689
of women “adorn[ing] themselves 
in appropriate dress.” 


46:48.688 --> 46:50.690
Well, husbands 
try to do the same thing. 


46:50.690 --> 46:55.462
And in adorning ourselves,
we try to cover over


46:55.462 --> 46:58.432
and minimize our flaws 


46:58.432 --> 47:02.269
and cover our bulges, 
our blemishes. 


47:02.268 --> 47:05.305
We try to make ourselves 
look as good as possible, don’t we? 


47:05.305 --> 47:09.375
Well, what does loving 
our wife as ourself require? 


47:09.375 --> 47:13.147
For one thing, we certainly 
wouldn’t shine a spotlight on her flaws. 


47:13.147 --> 47:16.149
We wouldn’t do this 
in the presence of others. 


47:16.148 --> 47:19.620
We would try hard 
not to even do it in our own mind. 


47:19.620 --> 47:24.257
Rather, we seek to cover over 
minor sins and transgressions, 


47:24.257 --> 47:27.962
as encouraged at Proverbs 19:11, 
where it says: 


47:27.962 --> 47:32.265
“It is beauty . . . to overlook an offense.” 


47:32.265 --> 47:35.035
So we work hard
to adorn our wives


47:35.035 --> 47:37.437
—make her look 
as good as possible—


47:37.437 --> 47:41.007
in the eyes of others, 
even in our own mind.


47:41.007 --> 47:43.010
Well, let’s get a fourth way 


47:43.010 --> 47:46.347
that husbands 
just naturally love themselves: 


47:46.347 --> 47:49.082
We take steps to heal ourselves 


47:49.082 --> 47:51.419
when we’re sick or injured. 


47:51.418 --> 47:53.453
Mark 5:26 


47:53.453 --> 47:56.456
talks about a woman 
who was very sick. 


47:56.457 --> 47:58.692
‘She suffered at the hands 
of many physicians; 


47:58.692 --> 48:00.394
‘she spent all her resources; 


48:00.393 --> 48:02.395
she didn’t get any better; 
she got worse.’ 


48:02.395 --> 48:04.397
But the point is, 


48:04.397 --> 48:06.500
she was really trying hard 
to heal herself. 


48:06.500 --> 48:08.968
Well, husbands 
try to do the same thing. 


48:08.968 --> 48:12.271
So if we’re sick or injured, 
we try to get extra rest, 


48:12.272 --> 48:16.277
we’ll buy medicine,
we’ll take vitamins,


48:16.277 --> 48:18.645
we’ll make an appointment 
with the doctor, 


48:18.645 --> 48:20.980
we’ll pursue therapy.


48:20.980 --> 48:23.783
See, we try to get well. 


48:23.783 --> 48:27.053
What does loving our wife 
as ourself require then? 


48:27.053 --> 48:29.288
Well, we would certainly 
do all within our power 


48:29.288 --> 48:31.291
if she’s sick or injured 


48:31.292 --> 48:33.294
to try to help her get well. 


48:33.293 --> 48:35.295
But even more importantly, 


48:35.295 --> 48:37.863
if she happens 
to be ailing somewhat spiritually, 


48:37.863 --> 48:40.833
we would do everything 
we can possibly do 


48:40.833 --> 48:43.303
to help her get well spiritually. 


48:43.303 --> 48:46.306
What would be something, 
perhaps, we could do? 


48:46.307 --> 48:48.642
Well, Proverbs 12:18 says: 


48:48.642 --> 48:52.012
“The tongue of the wise is a healing”


48:52.012 --> 48:55.515
—so the using of wise expressions. 


48:55.515 --> 48:57.683
Also, Proverbs 16:24: 


48:57.683 --> 49:00.120
“Pleasant sayings are a honeycomb, 


49:00.120 --> 49:02.122
“sweet to the soul 


49:02.122 --> 49:05.192
and a healing to the bones.” 


49:05.192 --> 49:08.229
So, “pleasant sayings,” 
we would use these 


49:08.228 --> 49:11.631
to try to help her 
get well spiritually.


49:11.632 --> 49:14.167
But now here’s one more, 
a fifth way 


49:14.167 --> 49:17.070
that husbands 
just naturally love themselves: 


49:17.070 --> 49:19.205
We make allowances,


49:19.205 --> 49:22.042
excuses, 
if we make mistakes. 


49:22.042 --> 49:24.679
Husbands who make mistakes 


49:24.678 --> 49:27.313
are often heard blaming it 


49:27.313 --> 49:29.448
on their heredity 


49:29.448 --> 49:31.918
or maybe the environment, 


49:31.918 --> 49:35.155
their blood-sugar level, 


49:35.155 --> 49:39.625
how much sleep they got 
or didn’t get the night before, 


49:39.625 --> 49:43.063
the weather, and so forth. 


49:43.063 --> 49:47.166
We tend to well understand 
our own limitations, don’t we? 


49:47.167 --> 49:49.169
And we allow for that. 


49:49.168 --> 49:51.438
Well, what about 
loving our wife as ourself? 


49:51.438 --> 49:53.640
We’d make the same allowances for her


49:53.640 --> 49:57.910
—being positive, 
imputing good motives to her. 


49:57.910 --> 50:02.082
If she speaks a little roughly 
or acts a little thoughtlessly, 


50:02.082 --> 50:04.584
we’ll try to discern the feelings 


50:04.583 --> 50:08.121
behind the words or actions. 


50:08.122 --> 50:11.759
We’ll make allowance, 
especially if we can discern 


50:11.758 --> 50:14.795
that she’s under some kind 
of emotional pressure. 


50:14.795 --> 50:18.598
We’ll make that allowance for her 
like we would for ourselves.


50:18.598 --> 50:20.600
Well, there we have five ways 


50:20.600 --> 50:23.203
that we as husbands 
show love for ourselves. 


50:23.203 --> 50:27.840
We feed, cherish, adorn, 


50:27.840 --> 50:29.910
try to heal ourselves; 


50:29.910 --> 50:32.745
and we make allowances, excuses, 


50:32.745 --> 50:34.480
when we make mistakes. 


50:34.480 --> 50:38.518
Let’s work hard 
to show the same love 


50:38.518 --> 50:43.323
in those five areas 
for our dear, beloved wives.


50:43.323 --> 50:46.291
And I’m sure, as we said, 
you can think of other ways 


50:46.292 --> 50:48.962
that husbands just naturally 
love themselves. 


50:48.962 --> 50:51.499
But what a rich illustration Jesus gave! 


50:51.498 --> 50:55.001
And interestingly, 
he took it even a step further. 


50:55.002 --> 50:57.837
He further expanded the illustration 


50:57.837 --> 51:00.674
at John 13:34. 


51:00.673 --> 51:03.376
You’re familiar with this, 13:34. 


51:03.377 --> 51:06.547
He said: 
“I am giving you a new commandment, 


51:06.547 --> 51:09.215
“that you love one another; 


51:09.215 --> 51:12.252
“just as I have loved you, 


51:12.252 --> 51:15.622
you also love one another.” 


51:15.622 --> 51:18.559
So he’s saying that we should have 


51:18.558 --> 51:20.593
even deeper love for our brothers


51:20.593 --> 51:23.663
—which would definitely 
include our Christian wives—


51:23.663 --> 51:26.165
a deeper love 
than we have for ourselves. 


51:26.165 --> 51:29.268
And that deeper love 
would move us to treat 


51:29.268 --> 51:32.638
our dear wives even better


51:32.638 --> 51:35.000
than we treat ourselves.


51:36.242 --> 51:38.712
Husbands, we know your wife 


51:38.712 --> 51:42.815
will never grow tired 
of your efforts to apply that counsel. 


51:42.815 --> 51:47.387
Really, the whole family 
benefits when each member 


51:47.387 --> 51:51.492
loves their closest neighbor 
as themselves. 


51:51.492 --> 51:54.862
And when a family 
is happy and spiritually strong, 


51:54.862 --> 51:57.797
they can do so much for Jehovah.


51:57.797 --> 52:00.167
At the Scandinavia branch, 


52:00.167 --> 52:04.905
families from 19 congregations 
in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden 


52:04.905 --> 52:09.308
participated in children’s choruses 
to record theocratic music. 


52:09.308 --> 52:13.380
The children worked hard 
to prepare for each session, 


52:13.380 --> 52:16.717
but that meant hard work 
for the parents too. 


52:16.717 --> 52:21.000
The results, however, 
are a chorus of praise to Jehovah.


52:29.462 --> 52:32.000
You get so happy 
when you sing with others!


52:37.803 --> 52:40.206
Jehovah created us like that. 


52:40.207 --> 52:41.775
The birds also sing.


52:41.775 --> 52:44.000
I feel that Jehovah is proud of me.


52:48.815 --> 52:51.685
The Scandinavia branch office 
supervises nine languages 


52:51.685 --> 52:53.987
in audio and video production. 


52:53.987 --> 52:57.757
In the three largest languages
—Swedish, Norwegian, and Danish—


52:57.757 --> 53:00.160
there are also three children choruses 


53:00.160 --> 53:02.762
that help us 
with the recordings of the songs 


53:02.762 --> 53:06.365
for the Become Jehovah’s Friend series.


53:06.365 --> 53:09.335
First, I listen very carefully 


53:09.335 --> 53:13.273
to the American adult chorus. 


53:13.273 --> 53:16.710
I try to spot where they breathe, 
where they pause, 


53:16.710 --> 53:19.000
and the overall mood
in their way of singing.


53:20.180 --> 53:24.000
Then, I listen 
to the music we have received.


53:26.853 --> 53:30.456
I have a piano at home 
to practice the voices and figure out 


53:30.457 --> 53:32.892
where the high notes and low notes are, 


53:32.892 --> 53:36.000
where the challenging parts are, 
and how I can pass this on to the children. 


53:37.463 --> 53:40.233
I also think about what the goal
with the recording is


53:40.233 --> 53:42.568
—how other children who listen to the song 


53:42.568 --> 53:44.703
can feel the same joy as we feel


53:44.703 --> 53:47.000
when we are singing and recording it.


53:49.375 --> 53:51.945
Before the children arrive,


53:51.945 --> 53:56.650
we make sure that all the equipment 
is prepared and tested 


53:56.650 --> 53:59.000
so that everything 
is ready when they come here.


54:01.120 --> 54:03.757
When we receive 
the assignment to participate 


54:03.757 --> 54:05.792
in the recordings of a new song, 


54:05.792 --> 54:09.562
I feel that our girls have been 
full of initiative to practice. 


54:09.562 --> 54:14.000
And we have made it our custom
to sing the songs at our family worship. 


54:15.602 --> 54:17.770
When we are driving, 
like to the RTO 


54:17.770 --> 54:20.240
for the recordings and on other occasions, 


54:20.240 --> 54:22.000
we usually sing in the car.


54:23.610 --> 54:26.747
I like to sing the songs
because they are good


54:26.747 --> 54:28.949
and have nice melodies.


54:28.948 --> 54:33.118
I especially like the new songs


54:33.118 --> 54:35.188
because they are so different.


54:35.188 --> 54:38.958
One has African drums in it,
and the next is a bit Irish


54:38.958 --> 54:41.000
and like you are walking
in a valley and on a mountain.


54:43.863 --> 54:48.301
Alma plays the cello
and has asked to get the sheet music


54:48.302 --> 54:52.000
for the new Kingdom songs,
which are her favorites right now.


54:53.840 --> 54:56.743
It’s been a challenge for André and me


54:56.743 --> 54:59.000
because we are not that musical.


55:00.913 --> 55:04.950
There is also a serious part,


55:04.950 --> 55:07.287
so we start with a prayer to Jehovah.


55:07.287 --> 55:10.624
Then, we watch the video and talk


55:10.623 --> 55:12.858
about the point of the video


55:12.858 --> 55:15.161
and how other children and families


55:15.162 --> 55:18.297
can benefit when listening to them.


55:18.297 --> 55:22.869
Then, we need to loosen up a bit,
so we warm up with some exercises,


55:22.868 --> 55:25.000
and then we’re ready to sing.


55:51.865 --> 55:54.533
It is clear to us that they appreciate 


55:54.533 --> 55:56.535
their privilege more and more. 


55:56.535 --> 56:00.807
They actually see it as praise to Jehovah.


56:00.807 --> 56:04.377
The joy they have of singing for Jehovah 


56:04.377 --> 56:07.000
rubs off on us who work with them.


56:08.047 --> 56:10.617
When the children sing with joy


56:10.617 --> 56:13.620
and express themselves freely,


56:13.620 --> 56:15.622
it has an effect on us as parents


56:15.622 --> 56:18.625
and the ones in the congregation.


56:18.625 --> 56:21.093
Jehovah becomes happy when he sees it,


56:21.093 --> 56:23.028
and also many brothers and sisters


56:23.028 --> 56:25.030
and children become happy.


56:25.030 --> 56:27.033
It is fun to make the recordings.


56:27.033 --> 56:28.835
You get so happy,
and then it’s more fun


56:28.835 --> 56:31.000
to sing at the meetings.


56:34.007 --> 56:37.644
I see more clearly why we sing


56:37.643 --> 56:40.000
and why it is a part of our worship.


56:41.347 --> 56:43.349
We don’t go there just
to spend time with our friends;


56:43.348 --> 56:45.351
we go there to sing.


56:45.352 --> 56:47.787
It is a part of praising Jehovah


56:47.787 --> 56:50.000
Singing is like a prayer to him.


56:52.192 --> 56:54.394
I have been humming the songs,


56:54.393 --> 56:57.730
and people around me wonder
what it is I am always humming.


56:57.730 --> 57:01.000
So it has helped me,
and it is an easy way to give a witness.


57:02.802 --> 57:05.000
My faith in Jehovah is stronger now.


57:06.005 --> 57:09.575
I think that I am happier
knowing Jehovah


57:09.575 --> 57:11.778
after I began singing.


57:11.778 --> 57:15.046
You understand that singing
is a huge part of our worship,


57:15.047 --> 57:20.000
and Jehovah wants us to use it.


57:21.753 --> 57:25.090
When children sing out joyfully to Jehovah, 


57:25.090 --> 57:28.160
they draw closer to him. 


57:28.160 --> 57:32.198
The choruses in Scandinavia 
are a good example of that fact. 


57:32.198 --> 57:34.700
Their excitement for singing 


57:34.700 --> 57:38.972
even gave them opportunities 
to witness to their classmates. 


57:38.972 --> 57:42.642
You probably already include singing 
as part of your family worship 


57:42.642 --> 57:46.079
and agree that we feel 
a special warmth 


57:46.078 --> 57:49.000
when the family sings 
to Jehovah together.


57:50.317 --> 57:53.587
As you look ahead 
at the August midweek meetings, 


57:53.587 --> 57:58.592
you’ll notice a part 
for the week of August 28 that asks: 


57:58.592 --> 58:03.095
“When Can I Next Serve 
as an Auxiliary Pioneer?” 


58:03.095 --> 58:05.998
You’ll want to prepare 
by watching the video 


58:05.998 --> 58:10.001
With Jehovah, I Can Do Almost Anything. 


58:10.002 --> 58:13.172
It’s the life story 
of Sister Sabina Hernández, 


58:13.172 --> 58:16.609
which appeared 
in the December 2015 program. 


58:16.608 --> 58:19.811
You’ll find it 
in the Video on Demand section 


58:19.812 --> 58:22.315
under “Interviews and Experiences.” 


58:22.315 --> 58:25.685
At the midweek meeting, 
you’ll be ready to share 


58:25.685 --> 58:28.000
how Sabina’s example encouraged you.


58:29.388 --> 58:31.390
Our program has shown us 


58:31.390 --> 58:34.927
how much Jehovah values 
what women do in the family, 


58:34.927 --> 58:39.099
in the congregation, and in the ministry. 


58:39.098 --> 58:41.600
To all of our sisters, 


58:41.600 --> 58:46.205
please be assured that we love you, 


58:46.205 --> 58:50.000
and it’s our prayer 
that Jehovah continues to bless your work.


58:51.043 --> 58:53.045
We want to conclude with greetings 


58:53.045 --> 58:56.215
from our brothers and sisters 
on the island of Saipan. 


58:56.215 --> 59:00.953
Part of Micronesia, 
in the western Pacific Ocean, 


59:00.953 --> 59:05.090
Saipan is a popular destination 
for thousands of tourists. 


59:05.090 --> 59:08.093
But make no mistake, 


59:08.093 --> 59:11.396
this is a preacher’s paradise.


59:11.397 --> 59:14.267
After early opposition 
to the preaching work, 


59:14.267 --> 59:16.802
the truth is now flourishing 


59:16.802 --> 59:19.372
with an average 
of 200 Kingdom publishers 


59:19.372 --> 59:22.042
in three congregations 
throughout the island, 


59:22.042 --> 59:26.112
including 33 regular pioneers. 


59:26.112 --> 59:29.815
The relaxing atmosphere 
and tropical climate 


59:29.815 --> 59:32.518
make public witnessing carts 
an effective way 


59:32.518 --> 59:35.288
to reach the hearts of receptive ones. 


59:35.288 --> 59:39.000
The large number of tourists
—many from Asian lands—


59:40.192 --> 59:44.030
are finding our literature 
in Japanese, Korean, 


59:44.030 --> 59:47.900
Tagalog, Chinese, 
and other languages.


59:47.900 --> 59:51.370
Among the first baptized publishers 
in Saipan 


59:51.370 --> 59:54.840
are faithful sisters who are now 
in their 80’s. 


59:54.840 --> 59:59.012
Sister Taeko Castro 
was baptized in 1970, 


59:59.012 --> 1:00:03.182
and Tomasa Mafnas 
was baptized in 1973. 


1:00:03.182 --> 1:00:06.885
They continue to be 
zealous Kingdom proclaimers 


1:00:06.885 --> 1:00:10.000
and are fine examples 
of “the women proclaiming the good news.” 


1:00:11.557 --> 1:00:15.529
We send our love and greetings 
to these congregations in Saipan 


1:00:15.528 --> 1:00:19.631
and warmly commend them 
for their positive spirit 


1:00:19.632 --> 1:00:22.269
and hard work 
to make Jehovah’s name known. 


1:00:22.268 --> 1:00:24.603
Thank you for watching. 


1:00:24.603 --> 1:00:27.606
From the world headquarters 
of Jehovah’s Witnesses, 


1:00:27.607 --> 1:00:37.634
this is JW Broadcasting.
